The study analyzes each energy scenario’s outputs and outlooks by 2040 such as gross domestic product growth, technology developments, primary energy demand by sector, energy supply by fuel, energy intensity and carbon emissions. Based on the foresight semiquantitative method, global energy driving forces which play significant roles in reshaping the world energy future by 2040 have been identified. The study applies mathematical principles to quantify the rational judgments of an expert panel in social, technological, economic, environmental and political framework through cross-impact analysis. Among the 10 global energy driving forces by 2040, population growth rate and climate change are identified as social and environmental driving forces, respectively. Investment in infrastructures, financial shocks, consumer behavior and energy efficiency are marked as economic driving forces, while global governance and geopolitical relationships are identified as the global energy market’s political driving force. And finally, technological development in renewable energies as well as in oil and gas upstream sector is recognized as a technological driving force.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy markets</kwd><kwd>Foresight</kwd><kwd>Global trends</kwd><kwd>Scenario analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13762_2020_Article_2738.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Science and Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Waste Water Technology / Water Pollution Control / Water Management / Aquatic Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Soil Science &amp; Conservation</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Ecotoxicology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">For decades, long-term changes in the production and consumption of energy resources have been the focus of attention of energy economists (Cherp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>). Since the 1970s, the uncertainties existing in energy markets, especially in oil markets, have been of prime practical significance (Yergin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">This paper aims to advance this debate by reviewing world energy scenarios and analyzing the driving forces in the global energy market. The future of energy supply and demand are subject to large uncertainties, and it is difficult to predict the trends of influencing factors such as energy prices, world economic growth rates, demographic changes, technological advances, government policies, and consumer behavior (Jefferson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2000</xref>; Pearson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Over the past four decades, the world’s rapid growth in energy demand has mainly been satisfied by fossil fuels. Oil, coal, natural gas, hydroelectric, nuclear energy, and renewables accounted for 33.6, 27.2, 23.9, 6.8, 4.4 and 4% of the world’s primary energy consumption in 2018, respectively. On the other hand, fossil fuels accounted for 84.7% of world primary energy consumption in 2018 (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The global social, economic, political, environmental and technological changes create a fundamentally different outlook for the international energy markets. It is expected that a different future would be characterized by shale oil and shale gas revolution (Zahid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2007</xref>; Alhajji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>) and growth of other unconventional resources, rapid technological development, lower population growth, the rise of renewables share in the world primary energy basket, widespread decarbonization plans, urbanization growth, changing economic and political power blocs, climate change and its associated environmental concerns (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Population growth, population ageing, migration and urbanization are the demographic megatrends in 2040 and social key factors of global energy system (UN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2019</xref>). The impressive growth in the Middle East and Africa is predicted to become the world’s most populated regions in the world by 2030. The demographic trends also show that the population growth will be 0.7% by 2040 which unprecedentedly decreased compared to the last few decades (EIA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Economic growth is one of the main key drivers behind energy demand. Higher economic growth is generally associated with higher energy demand, hence the need for more supply (Bhattacharyya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>). Moreover, energy plays an important role in the long-run economic growth. By comparison with capital and labor, energy signifies more importance as a factor of production, albeit having a small cost-share (Ayres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). However, long-term economic growth is driven mainly by technological development, demographic trends, environmental and governmental policies and energy market development (Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Global GDP between 2015 and 2030 is expected to increase at an average rate of 3.55% per annum or about 75% total increase as compared to 2015 (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). This growth is predicted to be mainly driven by labor productivity and efficiency.</p><p id="Par9">In this period, energy systems and markets are expected to be highly influenced by government policies, international cooperation on environmental, technological and economic issues.</p><p id="Par10">The energy industry is highly dependent on technology development. Hence, technological change will be of critical importance for the future energy systems (Nakicenovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1998</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Technology development in the field of renewables has led to a significant increase in its share of the entire primary energy portfolio of the world. Renewable energies are conducive in reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. The share of renewable energies in the total primary energy consumption of the world is increasing from 9.5% in 2015 to 63% in 2050 (Gielen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">In this study, we aim to analyze the major global energy scenarios in terms of their main characteristics, scenario building frameworks, time frames and results.</p><p id="Par13">The global energy scenarios reviewed in this study are selected based on crucial considerations such as international validity, variety of scenario building frameworks and diversity of authorship, including international petroleum corporations, global policy agencies, international NGOs and global policy networks. All of these scenarios are global studies with no specific regional focus, and in the term of time horizon, investigate 2030 and later. These scenarios have been published in 2011 and after and aimed to represent the whole energy system.</p><p id="Par14">The selected scenarios contain a wide range of input assumptions, e.g. optimistic or pessimistic approach to the future share of renewable energies and the key factors with respect to social, technological, economic, environmental and political (STEEP) framework.</p><p id="Par15">In the literature review, many studies that mentioned the areas of uncertainty in the global energy system have been reviewed. This section reviews on global energy drivers in social, environmental, economic, political and technological approaches.</p><p id="Par16">The Materials and methods section deals with selected global energy scenarios in a novel approach. The characteristics, frameworks, time horizon and the models used in each scenario are briefly discussed. This section presents a comparative analysis of selected global energy scenarios and outlines the International Energy Agency  (IEA), British Petroleum (BP), World Energy Council (WEC), Greenpeace (GP), ExxonMobil, and Shell projections for the future of global energy market. This section also analyzes the future trend of energy demand by sector, global energy supply of different fuels, energy intensity and carbon emissions.</p><p id="Par17">The Methodology section examines 40 key factors of global energy scenarios by Delphi method based on the academic literature review of global energy systems and reviewed world energy scenarios. According to foresight semiquantitative method, the driving forces of international energy markets in 2040 are identified by the cross-impact analysis (CIA), which is one of the most commonly used techniques for future studies and scenario planning.</p><p id="Par18">Results and discussion reviews the major findings of this paper, followed by the Conclusion of this study in the final section. The present research work has been carried out at the Department of Energy, Agriculture and Environmental Economics, Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran in 2018–2019.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par19">The dominant view in the academic literature is that the global energy market has changed rapidly in recent years (Benedict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Gilbert and Sovacool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Grübler et al.

Several studies reviewed Shell’s experience in scenario analysis and presented different narrative to what was found in the existing literature.</p><p id="Par29">These studies highlighted the importance of exploring the emerging trends and key factors of global energy markets in Shell’s scenarios and concluded that the Shell scenarios go beyond the conventional energy outlooks and consider long-term trends in economics, energy supply and demand, geopolitical shifts and social changes (Zalik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2010</xref>; Jefferson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>; Bentham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Several studies reviewed the methodology behind IEA’s World Energy Outlook (Mohn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>; Junne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019</xref>).

Cross-impact analysis is a scenario design methodological approach in which mutual connection of a set of variables (descriptors) has been assessed by expert judgment (Culka and Society <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>). Cross-impact analysis is used to capture the inter-relationship between key influencing factors. The Delphi method is used to fill cross-impact matrix (CIM).

Based on cross impact analysis method, the driving forces in terms of importance and extent of impact are investment in infrastructure, financial shocks, geo-political relationships and tensions, climate change, global governance, technology developments in renewable, technology developments in petroleum upstream, energy efficiency, consumer behavior and population growth.</p><p id="Par153">In terms of the STEEP framework, the identified driving forces of this research include three economic, two technological, two political, two social and one environmental factors.</p><p id="Par154">Among the four environmental key factors extracted, only climate change was identified as the driving force because of its high impact on the other key factors.</p><p id="Par155">Among political drivers, geo-political relationships and tensions and global governance were distinguished as the driving forces.</p><p id="Par156">Consumer behavior and population growth are the two social driving force. In the technology group, technology developments in renewable and petroleum upstream were identified as global drivers due to significant influence on other key factors of the world energy system. Finally, among 17 economic key factors, investment in infrastructure, financial shocks and energy efficiency were identified as global driving force.</p><p id="Par157">According to the results of the study, economic drivers play the most important role in shaping the future state of the global energy because of the number of drivers and their significant total impact. It is noteworthy that the identified driving forces are somehow considered as key factors in all the selected energy scenarios studied.</p><p id="Par158">In addition to driving forces, there are other key factors called “relay factors” that play a significant supporting and complementary role in shaping the global energy transition out to 2040 and the key uncertainties surrounding. This study reveals that national energy policies, changing power blocs, crude oil and natural gas prices, and GDP growth in emerging economies are the five key factors that act as relay variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par159">In this paper, selected energy reports are reviewed to show international mindsets about energy futures and share of energy resources in the global market.</p><p id="Par160">Scenarios are stories about plausible long-term futures. Besides the knowledge they bring, scenarios make it possible to share understandings about futures. Scenarios show how different driving forces initiate events, shape trends, and create structures for possible futures.</p><p id="Par161">In all of the scenarios reviewed in this paper, except GP-ER, the fossil fuels remain the first provider of the energy, but the share of renewable energy of world energy supply increases sharply.</p><p id="Par162">Long-term overview of the world current situation shows that the world’s current trend drives to economic and energy status similar to undesirable Shell’s Scramble and WEC’s Hard-Rock scenarios with the local view interests. World’s most probable path to the future of economic growth and environmental developments‏ depends on how the nations collaborate in these issues.</p><p id="Par163">Although different reports suggested different paths to future, in many cases they have proposed similar trends. As the most important, almost all energy outlooks estimated an adjusted coal share, as it has a great contribution to greenhouse gasses emissions. In addition, RE resources will increase their share, especially in the term of electricity supply.</p><p id="Par164">To address growing energy demands, oil and natural gas still will provide about two-third of total energy demand, however, due to upstream technology developments and being environment friendly natural gas grows with a steeper slope. As noted, environmental concerns are impressing energy policies, but nuclear power is still challenging. European countries are going to retire nuclear power plants referring to possible disastrous accidents, while India and China are planned to launch new plants.</p><p id="Par165">In all scenarios, electricity demand growth is an inevitable future due to transport electrification, growing urban lifestyles and rising incomes.</p><p id="Par166">All reviewed scenarios see a significant role of population growth and consumer behavior in future.</p><p id="Par167">Based on the comparative analysis of global energy scenarios, pursuing collaborative approach, renewable technologies developments and accelerating digitalization are the essential elements in the transition towards a global low-or-zero carbon emissions energy future.</p><p id="Par168">All global energy scenarios direct attention to the need for coordinated action and policies on global climate change as the most important environmental driving force.</p><p id="Par169">According to the findings of this study, the realization of a desirable future with global economic growth and low emissions is achieved by good global governance, a high level of investment in energy infrastructures and significant energy efficiency growth.</p><p id="Par170">Reviewed scenarios describes that developments in the global financial system and geo-political relationships and tensions can constrain or accelerate successful global energy transition.</p><p id="Par171">Though existence of a global shared vision is very valuable, national energy polices and outlooks should not be ignored. The international macro image, and corresponding policies, may contradict the national image, referring to countries challenges, capacities and potentials, especially in the case of energy supplier countries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors appreciate the generous feedbacks from the 40 member of expert panel of this research.
