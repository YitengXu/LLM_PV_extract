These bacteria can convert atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to chemicals which could help to mitigate climate change by replacing fossil fuel-based chemicals. A known method to enhance the product yield is to disrupt competing metabolic pathways in the host organism. One such pathway in many ‘Knallgas’ bacteria is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis. In this study, the PHB biosynthesis genes of a non-model ‘Knallgas’ bacterium <italic>Xanthobacter </italic>sp. SoF1 were identified. Consequently, the <italic>phaA</italic>, <italic>phaB</italic> and <italic>phaC</italic> genes were individually deleted and the resulting knockouts were evaluated for their ability to produce PHB in autotrophic shake flask and small-scale bioreactor cultivations. The results demonstrate that PHB production was inactivated in the <italic>phaC1</italic> knockout strain, which advances the development of <italic>Xanthobacter </italic>sp.

platforms use mainly plant-derived feedstocks, such as sugars and starches, which compete with food production. As an alternative to traditional heterotrophic production hosts, aerobic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB), also known as <italic>Knallgas</italic> bacteria, do not require plant-derived feedstocks. They are chemolithoautotrophic organisms using CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as sole carbon and energy sources, respectively. H<sub>2</sub> can be generated from water with electrolysis, which can be powered by any renewable energy source. Notably, with solar energy, energy-to-biomass efficiency of <italic>Knallgas</italic> bacteria exceeds that of plants (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). At present, various companies, including Air Protein (US), Deep Branch Technology (UK), NovoNutrients (US) and Solar Foods (Finland), develop industrial-scale bioprocesses to cultivate HOB for a high protein content biomass for feed and food purposes (Nyyssölä et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2022</xref>). When technology for their cultivation and engineering improves, HOB could also become economically feasible production hosts for other biotechnological applications. In fact, prior literature has demonstrated production of organic compounds, such as isobutanol and terpenes, from CO<sub>2</sub> in engineered HOB, mainly in <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> (previously known as <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic>) (Brigham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>). Nevertheless, these studies record low product concentrations that must be increased to reach economically feasible production.</p><p id="Par15">One method to enhance the product yield is to disrupt competing metabolic pathways, such as carbon storage pathways, in the host organism (Funston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>; Grousseau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>; van der Woude et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). In many cases, HOB store carbon and energy in the form of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which accumulates especially under nutrient limitation. For instance, <italic>C. necator</italic>, the model organism for PHB production, can accumulate PHB up to 80% of its cell dry weight (CDW) under autotrophic nitrogen-deficient conditions (Lambauer and Kratzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>). In industrial-scale cultivations, nutrient limitation may be avoided by providing cultures with excess nutrients, but this approach lowers the economic feasibility.</p><p id="Par16">PHB biosynthesis requires expression of three genes; <italic>phaA</italic>, <italic>phaB,</italic> and <italic>phaC</italic>, encoding for β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and PHA synthase, respectively. β-ketothiolase joins two acetyl-CoA molecules into acetoacetyl-CoA, which is reduced by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase into 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA with NAD(P)H as the cofactor. PHA synthase catalyzes the polymerization of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA monomers into PHB with the release of CoA. Hence, PHB synthesis consumes one acetyl-CoA and one NAD(P)H for every monomer of PHB, significantly affecting the central metabolism. Redirecting carbon flux from PHB to products in <italic>C. necator</italic> has resulted in the highest product concentrations (isopropanol, 1,3-butanediol and mannitol) recorded for <italic>C. necator</italic> (Garrigues et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>; Gascoyne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>; Hanko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>). In these studies, either all three genes related to PHB synthesis or part of them were deleted, depending on the constructed pathway.</p><p id="Par17">Because the vast majority of studies of HOB engineering have been conducted on <italic>C. necator</italic>, the potential of other strains remains mostly unexplored. One potential alternative for <italic>C. necator</italic> is <italic>Xanthobacter </italic>sp. SoF1, which is a non-model, gram-negative, diazotrophic, hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium studied for single cell protein production (Holmström and Pitkänen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). Different enzymes (Hirano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Sluis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2002</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>) and transcription regulation (van den Bergh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993</xref>; van Keulen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2003</xref>) of other <italic>Xanthobacter </italic> spp. have been under investigation. In addition, some genetic engineering tools have been developed for <italic>Xanthobacter </italic> spp. (Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>; Swaving et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>), which could be adapted for SoF1. However, no prior research has targeted <italic>Xanthobacter </italic>sp. as a host for production of chemicals.</p><p id="Par18">The objective of this study was to inactivate the PHB biosynthesis in SoF1. In the future, this could enable redirection of acetyl-CoA from the PHB synthesis to other products. In addition, genetic engineering methods for targeted integration were established for this novel host. To investigate the effect of PHB pathway genes individually on PHB production, separate <italic>phaA</italic>, <italic>phaB</italic> and <italic>phaC</italic> knockout strains of SoF1 were constructed. The effect of gene knockouts on biomass accumulation, growth rate as well as PHB and protein contents were evaluated in shake flasks and in a continuous gas fermentation under autotrophic nitrogen-limited conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial strains, culture media and heterotrophic cultivations</title><p id="Par19">The host organism <italic>Xanthobacter </italic> sp.

Inoculum cultivations of SoF1 strains for bioreactors were started from glycerol stocks into 10 mL of the modified DSMZ81 media in 250 mL shake flasks with 0.2 μm ePTFE membrane caps.

The same was observed in <italic>C. necator phaA</italic> and <italic>phaB</italic> knockouts, which retain their ability to produce PHB because of the presence of other isoenzymes (Budde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Lindenkamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). <italic>C. necator</italic> has at least 20 other β-ketothiolases that can assist in PHB production when <italic>phaA</italic> is deleted (Arikawa and Sato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>). A BLAST search conducted on the SoF1 genome with the <italic>C. necator phaA</italic> gene as the query identified multiple closely related genes in addition to the highly related <italic>phaA</italic>, which was knocked out in this study. Regarding <italic>phaB</italic> homologs in <italic>C. necator</italic>, Budde et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>) identified three, which they targeted for deletion. Out of these genes, one (<italic>phaB2</italic>) was not expressed as an active acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, but the deletion of the other two inactivated PHB synthesis. Although the BLAST query coverages in SoF1 for other than the deleted <italic>phaB</italic> gene were low (&lt; 33%), it is likely that SoF1 also possesses other enzymes with acetoacetyl-CoA reductase activity.</p><p id="Par37">Based on previous literature, it was expected that a <italic>phaC</italic> knockout of SoF1 would not produce PHB. Although some organisms have more than one functional <italic>phaC</italic> gene (Rehm and Steinbüchel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>), deletion of only one gene, <italic>phaC1</italic>, from <italic>C. necator</italic> has been shown to prevent PHB synthesis (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>). <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> possesses a second PHA synthase PhaC2 which is unexpressed, at least under the tested conditions (Peplinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). The present study shows that also SoF1 possesses one PHA synthase, which deletion is enough to disrupt the PHB biosynthesis. However, the role of <italic>phaC2</italic> gene is unclear because its deletion lowered PHB production but did not contribute to PHB production in SoF1Δ<italic>phaC</italic> strain. PHB biosynthesis in other HOB than <italic>C. necator</italic> has remained quite unexplored. However, similar results have also been obtained from <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic>, a phototrophic non-sulfur purple bacteria that can grow chemolithoautotrophically under aerobic conditions (Paoli and Tabita <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1998</xref>). Deletion of <italic>phaAB</italic> genes from <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> did not reduce PHB production, while deletion of <italic>phaC</italic> led to complete disruption of it (Kranz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1997</xref>). As in SoF1, <italic>phaC</italic> gene of <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> is separate from the <italic>phaAB</italic> operon.</p><p id="Par38">Initially, the knockout strains were investigated in shake flasks, which provided evidence of PHB deficiency. Continuous cultivation was then applied to further analyze the strains at a constant growth rate. Biomass was first accumulated after which PHB accumulation was induced, which is a common strategy in biotechnology. Garcia-Gonzalez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>) investigated PHB production in <italic>C. necator</italic> with a two-phase cultivation system in which they first accumulated biomass under heterotrophic conditions, after which nitrogen- and oxygen-limiting conditions were applied in the autotrophic phase to induce PHB production. In the PHB accumulation phase, CDW doubled in some reactors solely due to PHB. In this study, indications on the opposite trend were observed when OD<sub>600</sub> values decreased under low nitrogen concentration in the continuous cultivation. However, ammonium was completely consumed by the cells also in the high nitrogen concentration medium and it might be that the used low nitrogen condition was excessive for the cells. It has been shown that stress response, for example caused by too high salt concentration, in <italic>C. necator</italic> can lead to PHB degradation (Obruca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>). If this is the case and PHB was produced already in the cultivation phase with high nitrogen concentration, higher PHB concentrations would have been recorded, if cultivations had been stopped earlier. Unfortunately, determination of PHB contents during the cultivation was not possible because of limited sample volumes.</p><p id="Par39">The results from bioreactor cultivations suggest oxygen-sensitivity of the SoF1 strains. In the beginning of the cultivation, all strains except SoF1Δ<italic>phaC</italic> had increasing DO. When oxygen was lowered from 10% of total gas flow to 6%, the growth was retrieved. Oxygen might have affected the activity of hydrogenase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), which are both crucial for autotrophic growth. In particular, hydrogenases provide cells energy to perform CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by rubisco. Although HOB are recognized by the oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases, they can be inhibited by high oxygen concentration. Wilde and Schlegel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1982</xref>) evaluated the growth of <italic>C. necator</italic> and <italic>Xanthobacter autotrophicus</italic> in autotrophic conditions under different oxygen concentrations (10–100%). The growth rates and hydrogenase activities declined by increasing oxygen concentration but retrieved after returning to a lower oxygen concentration. On the other hand, high O<sub>2</sub> concentration can induce the oxygenation side reaction of rubisco (Tcherkez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2016</xref>). This is less likely to affect the growth of SoF1 because the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was high, which favors carboxylation over oxygenation, especially when considering the lower solubility of O<sub>2</sub> to media compared to CO<sub>2</sub>. In the future, cultivations could be initiated with a lower oxygen concentration and increased when more biomass is accumulated.</p><p id="Par40">Growth rate and biomass accumulation are frequently affected by genetic modifications. The hypothesis was that knocking-out <italic>phaA</italic> and <italic>phaB</italic> genes earlier from the PHB pathway would prevent accumulation of intermediate compounds, acetoacetyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, possibly impairing growth. Although the growth rate of the knockout strains was not notably impaired in shake flasks in this study, lower biomass accumulation was detected for all knockout strains in the continuous cultivation, especially for SoF1Δ<italic>phaC</italic> strain. Similarly, <italic>Burkholderia thailandesis phaC</italic> knockout strain accumulated 70% less biomass than the WT after 264 h fermentation (Funston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>), which is comparable to the 80% reduction in biomass of SoF1Δ<italic>phaC</italic> observed in this study. At least two factors might contribute to this outcome. Firstly, it might be that <italic>phaC</italic> knockouts accumulate PHB synthesis intermediate compound 3-HB-CoA inside the cells whereas, for example, acetoacetyl-CoA possibly accumulating when <italic>phaB</italic> is deleted can be more easily redirected to other pathways. This could be avoided by deleting all PHB genes simultaneously in SoF1. Deletion of <italic>phaC</italic> in <italic>C. necator</italic> decreases growth rate, even in shake flasks (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>), but <italic>phaCAB</italic> knockout strain has been shown to accumulate biomass similarly to the WT (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). Secondly, the lack of PHB granules results in losing their beneficial functions in protecting against various stress factors (Obruca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>) and helping with redox imbalance (Batista et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). This could be possibly avoided by better process control in bioreactors.</p><p id="Par41">A PHB deficient strain of <italic>C. necator</italic> is typically chosen as a production host because it accumulates pyruvate (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>; Steinbüchel and Schlegel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1989</xref>), which can be redirected to other compounds when PHB biosynthesis is blocked. In addition to <italic>phaC</italic> deletion, deletion or overexpression of <italic>phaA</italic> and <italic>phaB</italic> may be needed if precursors are derived from acetoacetyl-CoA or 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA intermediates of the PHB pathway (Gascoyne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). However, studies in which the product was not directly derived from PHB pathway intermediates, show contradicting results on the benefits of this approach. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>) demonstrated that production of laureate (medium-chain fatty acid) in <italic>C. necator</italic> was not enhanced by <italic>phaCAB</italic> deletion compared to the WT. Similar outcome was found when producing methyl ketones (Muller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). On the contrary, production of mannitol was increased by 25% in <italic>C. necator phaCAB</italic> knockout compared to the PHB producing strain (Hanko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>). Therefore, it seems to differ from case to case if a constructed pathway benefits from PHB-deficiency. In the current study, pyruvate could not be detected from the cultivation supernatants of the PHB-deficient strain. However, the results suggest that the available carbon was possibly directed towards the production of protein rather than pyruvate, and therefore PHB-deficiency is a viable approach to advance SoF1 as a production host for single cell protein. To conclude, the current study took an essential step towards redirecting the carbon flux of SoF1 from PHB biosynthesis to desired products. By enabling further engineering of SoF1, this study unlocks new possibilities for sustainable bioproduction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Anna-Liisa Ruskeepää, Matti Hölttä, Heli Nygren for analyses and Antti Nyyssölä and Susanna Mäkinen for critically reading the manuscript.
