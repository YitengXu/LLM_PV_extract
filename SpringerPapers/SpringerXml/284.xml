The CNT films were fabricated by coating CNT paste or spraying CNT suspension solution on Ti wires. A fluorine tin oxide-coated CNT underlayer was used to improve the adherence of the CNT layer on Ti substrate for sprayed samples. The charge transfer catalytic behavior of fibrous CNT/Ti counter electrodes to the iodide/triiodide redox pair was carefully studied by electrochemical impedance and current-voltage measurement. The catalytic activity can be enhanced by increasing the amount of CNT loading on substrate.

Particularly, fibrous dye-sensitized solar cells (F-DSCs) based on various fibrous substrates (i.e., metal wires, optical fiber, carbon fiber, etc.) have attracted increasing attentions due to their unique structures for omnidirectional light absorption and weavable characteristic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The metal-based F-DSCs have the advantages of low bulk resistance, low cost and easy fabrication. Recently, considerable efforts have been focused on the cost effective fibrous photoanode. It can be constructed by covering the metal wire substrate with titanium dioxide particle films, nanotube arrays, or nanowires films <italic>via</italic> simple dip-coating, spray techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], or electrochemical-eroding Ti wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, less attention has been paid to the fibrous counter electrode (CE). Commonly, the F-DSCs were assembled by twisting Pt wire CE and photoande together, and the conversion efficiency (<italic>Eff</italic>) of 5.8% and 1.86% could be achieved using liquid electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and solid electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], respectively . However, the Pt wire was an extremely expensive CE for the practical applications of F-DSCs, which gave rise to the strong request for new cheaper materials to substitute Pt.</p><p>Carbon materials are considered to be excellent substitutes of Pt for their good reduction ability to tri-iodine ions in electrolyte. Various kinds of carbon, such as activated carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], carbon nanotubes (CNT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], graphite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], hard carbon spherules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and carbon black [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have been studied. Due to their advantages of high electrical conductivity, chemical stability and high surface area, these carbon materials have been proven to be competitive with Pt as CE used in flat DSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study, multiwalled CNT is firstly chosen as the catalytical material of CE for F-DSCs. Fibrous CEs are fabricated by two different methods, brushing CNT paste or spraying CNT suspensions on Ti wire substrate. Because the CE should be convolved on photoanode, the adherence of the active layer on wire substrate is of great importance. Fluorine tin oxide (FTO) was sprayed on CNT layer to improve the contact between CNTs and enhance the adherence of CNT layer which cycles to the surface of Ti wire. The impact of CNT loading amount and fabrication methods on the electrochemical catalytic activity of the CEs have been studied by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and current-voltage measurement. The F-DSCs were assembled using dye-sensitized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube (TNT)-coated Ti wire as photoanode and CNT-coated Ti wire as CE. The best energy conversion efficiency of 4.18% has been achieved under AM 1.5-G illumination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of photoanode</title><p>The TiO<sub>2</sub>-nanotube photoanode was fabricated by anodic oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Ti wires (<italic>Φ</italic> = 0.3 mm, purity 99.7%) with length of 4 cm were first ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and then electrochemically polished. The polished Ti wires were electrochemically eroded in ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0.2 wt% NH<sub>4</sub>F and a small amount of deionized water, with an applied voltage of 50 V. The length of TNT can be adjusted by controlling the reaction time. The TNT-coated Ti wires were ultrasonically treated after anodic oxidation for several minutes and annealed at 450°C for 3 h for crystallization, then treated in 0.1 M TiCl<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution at 70°C for 1 h, followed by re-annealing at 450°C for 30 min. After cooling down to 80°C, the TNT photoanodes were immediately immersed into 0.3 mM cis-bis (isothiocyanato) bis (2,2 = −bipyridyl-4,4 = −dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bistetrabutyl ammonium (N719, Dyesol, New South Wales, Australia) in ethanol for 24 h at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Fabrication of CNT CE</title><p>To prepare a viscous CNT paste, 0.5 g CNT powder (donated by Prof. Fei Wei from Tsinghua University, P.R. China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) was ultrasonically dispersed in 300 mL ethanol, then 10 ml of terpineol, 0.3 ml of ethyl cellulose alcoholic solution and 0.2 ml of titanium isopropoxide used as binder were added into the solution. To improve the dispersion of CNTs, the mixed paste was ball-milled for 24 h. The as-prepared CNT paste was brush coated on Ti wires (<italic>Φ</italic> = 0.1 mm). After drying at 80°C in the air for 30 min, CNT CEs fabricated by brush coating method (BCNT) were obtained by annealing at 385°C for 20 min with a heating rate of 2°C/min.</p><p>To prepare CNT CEs by spraying method (SCNT), 0.5 g CNT powder was firstly treated with mixture solution of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (<italic>v/v</italic> = 1/3) under 100°C for 1 h to obtain separated CNTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. After washing with deionized water, the CNT suspension was filtrated, and the CNT powder was collected and dried. Then, purified CNT powder (10 mg) was ultrasonically dispersed into 100 mL deionized water for 2 h. For a good adherence to substrate, a FTO-coated CNT underlayer was introduced between CNT film and Ti substrate. The temperature of Ti wires substrate was kept at 400°C in the beginning of spraying to ensure the good crystallization of FTO on the surface of CNTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The as-prepared suspension was then sprayed on Ti wires (<italic>Φ</italic> = 0.1 mm) with a portable spray gun. After spraying CNT solution for 40 s, the ethanol precursor solution of FTO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was ultrasonically sprayed on the samples for 3 min, as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

All the thread pitch distances of screwed CE were kept at 1 mm, according to our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To fix the fibrous solar cell and to avoid electrolyte drying out, two pieces of PET were used to clamp the samples. A small amount of electrolyte was dropped into the gap between the two pieces of PET, and the electrolyte would flow along with Ti wire due to the capillary force. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M methylhexylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M of iodine, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M of lithium iodide in 3-methoxypropionitrile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measurements</title><p>The morphology of CE was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI XL30 SFEG). Dummy cells were composed of two identical fibrous CEs laid parallel to each other with the distance of 0.5 mm and clamped by two pieces of glass. Electrolyte was injected into the space between the two CEs. EIS and current-voltage characteristic of dummy cells were applied to test the catalytic properties of CEs. For photovoltaic measurement, the F-DSCs were exposed to the illumination of standard simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> (AM 1.5 G, Oriel 91160A, Newport Corporation, Beijing, China). A 20 mm × 1 mm mask was used to screen stray light and ensure the light to vertically illuminate onto solar cells. The photocurrent-voltage curves of F-DSCs were recorded by IM6e electrochemical work station (Zahner Co., Germany). The frequency of the superimposed signal is from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The effective illuminated area of one fibrous solar cell was calculated as the product of the Ti wire diameter and the cell length (2 cm), which was 0.06 cm<sup>2</sup> for Ti wire with diameter of 0.3 mm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results and discussions</title><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the photo of two F-DSCs using Pt wire and CNTs/Ti wire as CEs, respectively, and SEM images of CNT CEs. As seen from Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, both Pt and CNTs/Ti CEs were convolved around the sensitized TNT anode with uniform screw pitch which ensures the good reproducibility of the experiments. For clarity, a schematic image of F-DSCs is given in the inset of Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b shows that one thin layer of CNTs with a thickness of 4 μm is coated on Ti wire by brush coating method. However, the SCNTs are much thinner than the BCNT, and the thickness of SCNT is very difficult to be detected from SEM measurement. FTO crystals are obviously covering the CNTs after spraying the FTO precursor (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The FTO-coated CNT layers act as adhesive to improve the contact between CNTs and substrate. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d shows the CNT network which provides a large surface area with CNT diameters ranging from 10 nm to 20nm.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Photo of F-DSCs and SEM images of CNT CEs.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) The photo of two F-DSCs using CNTs and Pt as CEs, respectively.

Increasing the loading amount of carbon materials on the substrate will directly raise the surface area, providing more sites for I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> reduction and, subsequently, improve the performance of the CEs. Normally, the thicknesses of the carbon layer on CEs are varied from several microns to more than 100 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, too thick CNT layers would be easily crashed due to the distortion and extension during the convolving step in the assembly process of F-DSCs. Thus, the carbon layer thickness should be carefully controlled.</p><p>To investigate the influence of the CNT loading amount on the catalytic activity of SCNTs, EIS measurements of dummy cells assembled by two identical electrodes have been carried out. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a,b shows the Nyquist plots of EIS results, and Bode-phase plots are illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c. For a Pt-Pt symmetrical cell, one semicircle and a beeline appeared as the results of the Pt/electrolyte interfacial charge transfer at around 1–100 kHz and the semi-infinite diffusion of electrolyte at low frequency domain (&lt;1 Hz), respectively. All the Nyquist plots of CNT-CNT dummy cells show inherent semicircles near the frequency region of 1–100 Hz, representing the charge transfer at the CNTs/electrolyte interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the electrolyte diffusion impedances (<italic>Z</italic><sub>N</sub>) cannot be easily distinguished in this case because of the overlap with the middle-frequency peaks. The characteristic peak frequency in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c is related to the charge transfer rate. The peak frequency of the charge transfer at CNT/electrolyte interface is smaller than that at the Pt/electrolyte interface, suggesting that the charge-transfer process at the CNT/electrolyte interfaces is slower than that at the Pt/electrolyte interface. A unique impedance of BCNT/BCNT dummy cell with a very fast time constant around 50 kHz was observed in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, which is most possibly the result of charge transfer within solid CNTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Furthermore, the SCNT CEs with FTO-coated CNT underlayer have better connection between CNT film and substrate than that of BCNT CEs. They can be reused because the CNTs would not easily crush from the substrate by distortion, while the SCNT samples with thicker activated layers show contrary result.

The catalytic activity of CNT films is enhanced with CNT loading amount as the results of the increasing inner surface area of CNT films. However, too thick CNT film which is prepared by brush coating method would lead to CNT particles pilling from substrate during cell assembly process, indicating that the CNT CEs fabricated by spray method are more practical. Both the efficiencies of F-DSCs with CNT CEs prepared by brush coating and spraying methods (spraying time is 1,000 s) exceeded 4% and reached 80% of that of F-DSCs with Pt CE, indicating the application potential of CNT fibrous CE as the substitute of Pt wire.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors appreciate the financial supports of National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 20725311, 51072221 and 21173260), National Key Basic Research Program (973 project, grant no. 2012CB932903) and the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.
