id="Abs1"><title>Abstract</title><p>Recently, algae have received significant interest as a potential feedstock for renewable diesel (such as biodiesel), and many researchers have attempted to quantify this potential. Some of these attempts are less useful because they have not incorporated specific values of algal lipid content, have not included processing inefficiencies, or omitted processing steps required for renewable diesel production. Furthermore, the associated energy, materials, and costs requirements are sometimes omitted. The accuracy and applicability of these estimates can be improved by using data that are more specific, including all relevant information for renewable diesel production, and by presenting information with more relevant metrics. To determine whether algae are a viable source for renewable diesel, three questions that must be answered are (1) how much renewable diesel can be produced from algae, (2) what is the financial cost of production, and (3) what is the energy ratio of production? To help accurately answer these questions, we propose an analytical framework and associated nomenclature system for characterizing renewable diesel production from algae. The three production pathways discussed in this study are <italic>the transesterification of extracted algal lipids</italic>, <italic>thermochemical conversion of algal biomass</italic>, and <italic>conversion of secreted algal oils</italic>. The nomenclature system is initially presented from a top-level perspective that is applicable to all production pathways for renewable diesel from algae. Then, the nomenclature is expanded to characterize the production of renewable diesel (specifically, biodiesel) from extracted algal lipids in detail (cf. Appendix <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). The analytical framework uses the presented nomenclature system and includes three main principles: using appropriate reporting metrics, using symbolic notation to represent unknown values, and presenting results that are specific to algal species, growth conditions, and product composition.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Renewable diesel</kwd><kwd>Biodiesel</kwd><kwd>Algae</kwd><kwd>Reporting framework</kwd><kwd>Systems analysis</kwd><kwd>Lipid</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2011</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2011</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12155_2010_Article_9099.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Genetics and Genomics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Breeding/Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Ecology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Wood Science &amp;

Dozens of biological feedstock sources have been suggested to meet this effort, and the success of their implementation has varied. In this paper, we discuss algal oil, which has been touted as a potential feedstock for renewable diesel production. Specifically, we present a framework for reporting renewable diesel production from algae. Algae are an extremely diverse group of organisms, and it is not surprising that different species of algae produce different compounds that could be used as alternative fuel feedstock. Five commonly studied algal components or products useful for alternative fuels are: lipids for petroleum fuel substitutes, carbohydrates for ethanol, hydrogen, methane via biomass gasification, and biomass for direct combustion, anaerobic digestion, or thermochemical conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The conversion pathways that are available (i.e., biochemical conversion, thermochemical conversion, and transesterification) for producing algae-based fuel (e.g., biodiesel, methane, hydrogen, electricity, etc.) have been outlined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The framework presented here is focused on characterizing the production of renewable diesel from algae. The term, “renewable diesel” is defined as a substitute for conventional diesel fuel that is derived from renewable resources (e.g., biodiesel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Renewable diesel fuels are produced by upgrading a renewable oil material, which is referred to as biocrude, and can be produced from a variety of feedstock and production pathways. It is possible that non-diesel fuels could be produced from algal biocrude by alternative refining techniques. Although this study presents a framework for reporting the production of renewable diesel fuel from algae, it is expected that similar methods can be used to report other algal fuels.</p><p>The use of algae for alternative fuels has been studied globally by researchers for several decades. The United States’ National Renewable Energy Laboratory conducted an 18-year research effort, the <italic>Aquatic Species Program</italic>, which investigated the use of algae for biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dozens of other research and industry groups have conducted algae-to-biofuel studies during the time of the <italic>Aquatic Species Program</italic> and since its conclusion in 1996.</p><p>There are multiple production pathways that are being researched for renewable diesel production from algae. Categorically, these include (1) <italic>transesterification of extracted algal lipids</italic>, (2) <italic>thermochemical conversion of algal biomass</italic>, and (3) <italic>conversion of secreted algal oils</italic> (i.e., “milking”). Each of these pathways is discussed in greater detail in the following sections. The reporting framework presented here provides a way to compare results, not only from within the same production pathway, but also among different production pathways.</p><p>In general, the potential of algae-derived renewable diesel to be a suitable alternative fuel is dependent on the answers to three questions: (1) how much renewable diesel can be produced, (2) what is the financial cost of production, and (3) what is the energy ratio of producing renewable diesel? In this study, the amount of renewable diesel that can be produced is evaluated with respect to the cultivation volume and growth duration and is therefore expressed in units of grams per liter per day. Different metrics could be used for evaluating the amount of renewable diesel that can be produced on a national or global scale, such as the total land, water, and nutrients required to produce enough renewable diesel to satisfy the US liquid fuel demand. In addition, evaluating the amount of renewable diesel that can be produced at the national or global level requires the consideration of other factors, such as environmental impacts, resource availability, and infrastructure renovations, which are not specifically addressed in this study. However, the three questions listed above are critical for evaluating the potential of an alternative fuel to make a significant contribution to energy supply. Many variables influence the evaluation of each of these questions, and it is important to establish a systematic approach to determine the answers.</p><p>Although great progress has been made regarding the use of algae for renewable diesel, the field is relatively young. Consequently, some ambiguity remains about the best way to report research results. In turn, it is easy to misinterpret published results because the nomenclature varies. Furthermore, because an explicit reporting method has not been established, researchers are at risk of inaccurately estimating the potential for algae as a renewable diesel feedstock by accidentally omitting important processing inefficiencies. Finally, due to the lack of standardization, it is difficult for researchers to integrate results from multiple sources. The following section illuminates the inconsistencies discussed here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reporting Variability and Inconsistency</title><p>The advantages of a particular species, growth environment, or conversion technology depend on the impact it has on the entire production pathway. Said differently, the fundamental interest is in the total energy, materials, and cost balances for renewable diesel production. To enable systems-level analyses, when reporting results associated with individual processing steps (e.g., growth, harvesting, refining, etc.), it would be ideal to use metrics that are compatible with the other steps. Using compatible metrics is also important, but more complicated, if renewable diesel production from algae is integrated into a multi-product facility, in which waste streams of one product are used for another. Multi-product industrial facilities like this are not specifically considered in this study.</p><p>To illustrate the variability in reporting methods, Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> list results from several algae-based renewable diesel studies pertaining to how much renewable diesel can be produced and the financial cost of production. The data presented are specific to the production of biodiesel via transesterification of extracted lipids (as opposed to the other production pathways, all of which are discussed below).

Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These tables illustrate the variety of reporting methods used in the field, but do not encompass or represent all algae-based renewable diesel research that has been published. For most categories shown, there is a wide range of results. For instance, the estimated cost of producing algal “oil” (or lipids) varies from $39 to $209 per barrel across the studies. Additionally, there are different metrics used to report results within the same category. For example, biomass productivity is commonly reported in terms of kilograms per square meter per day or kilograms per liter per day (where square meter is for the growth media surface area and liter is for the growth media volume), which can lead to ambiguities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Both metrics can provide valuable data, and both should be reported when possible. In addition, some studies use metrics to report results that do not include enough information to adequately characterize the potential of algae as a renewable diesel feedstock. For example, the lipid fraction is often used to evaluate the potential of different algal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. As discussed below, the lipid fraction lacks the specificity needed to evaluate the impact of that species, growth condition, and type of lipids produced on the entire production pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Finally, in most of the studies shown, several steps in the production pathway are omitted entirely.

Additional standardization is needed within the field so that communication among researchers is less ambiguous. To address this problem, we outline three production pathways for algae-derived renewable diesel, present a nomenclature system for reporting results, and propose a framework for characterizing the potential of algae as a source for renewable diesel production. The nomenclature system is presented as a top-level analysis that is applicable to all three of the production pathways. The utility of this nomenclature system is illustrated in Appendix <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">2</xref> by expanding it to include the detailed production steps for one of the production pathways (namely, <italic>transesterification of extracted algal lipids</italic>).

After algae are grown in an open pond, photobioreactor, or fermentor (i.e., heterotrophic growth), the algae are harvested from the growth medium. After harvesting, the lipids are extracted from the algal cells. This extraction generally consists of a lysing process to rupture the cells followed by a separation of the lipids from the other biomass. Alternatively, direct solvent extraction can be conducted to extract lipids, although it may be infeasible on the industrial scale. Additional separations may be required to obtain only the lipids that are specifically useful for biodiesel production. These lipids are referred to as useful lipids and are discussed in more detail below. Once the useful lipids have been separated, they are converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) via transesterification. Biodiesel is a term that we use to refer to a composition consisting mainly of fatty acid methyl esters that complies with standard fuel specifications. There is also potential for producing valuable co-products, such as glycerol, protein, or biomass. The biomass co-product could be converted to fuels (via anaerobic digestion or gasification) or used to produce electricity (via direct combustion). A more detailed discussion of the intermediate products in this production pathway is provided in Appendix <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Thermochemical Biomass Conversion</title><p><italic>Thermochemical conversion of algal biomass</italic> is another processing method that can be used to produce renewable diesel, and the associated production pathway is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. After the algae are grown, they are harvested and, in some cases, dried (depending on the thermochemical conversion process applied). Biomass is the substrate for thermochemical processes, and therefore, the entire algal cell undergoes conversion. The most common thermochemical processes are liquefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification with subsequent Fischer–Tropsch conversion.</p><p>Each of these processes converts algal biomass to products that can potentially be upgraded to renewable diesel. Liquefaction converts high molecular weight organic compounds to low molecular weight oils at temperatures around 250–350°C, high pressure (0.5–20 MPa), and often with the aid of a catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Pyrolysis is defined as the conversion of high molecular weight organic compounds to oil under high temperature (~480–700°C), in the absence of oxygen, and under operating pressures of ~0.1–0.5 MPa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].

The co-products of each thermochemical conversion process vary and can include gases, aqueous liquids, and solid char.</p><p>Following thermochemical conversion, the oils (i.e., biocrude) are separated (usually by solvent extraction with chloroform or dichloromethane) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and may be refined into renewable diesel. There is also potential for the production of valuable co-products with thermochemical algal biomass conversion. For instance, the gaseous product contains methane, and the solid char residue could be used as a combustion fuel or soil additive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conversion of Secreted Algal Oils</title><p>Another method that has been explored for renewable diesel production is the collection and conversion of secreted algal oils (sometimes called milking). The aim of this method is to use genetically modified organisms that secrete oils into the growth medium. The production of renewable diesel from secreted algal oils is the least mature of the three production pathways presented here. Much of the work in this area to date is proprietary. As a result, the feasibility of this production pathway is unclear. The increased cost of engineering a suitable organism and maintaining a monoculture may be offset by a reduction in processing cost required to produce renewable diesel, as compared to the lipid extraction and thermochemical conversion production pathways shown above. The most general steps required for producing renewable diesel from secreted algal lipids are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.</p><p>The first processing step required in this production pathway is the separation of secreted oil from the growth medium. The term “oils” is used here rather than “lipids” because the exact composition of the secreted products is not yet known. As a result, secondary separations may be required to recover oils that are specifically useful for refining into renewable diesel</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Framework Principles</title><p>In this section, a proposed framework is presented that uses the nomenclature developed in this work (specifically, for <italic>transesterification of algal lipids</italic> as detailed in Appendix <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). The framework is based on three principles: using strong reporting metrics, using symbolic notation to include unknown values, and ensuring that results are presented consistently. Each of these principles is discussed in detail below.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Strong Metrics</title><p>First, results should be reported with the strongest metric possible. The strength of a metric refers to the amount of information relevant to renewable diesel production that it contains. For instance, the metric “triacylglycerol per dry weight” is stronger than “lipid per dry weight” because it includes additional information about the composition of the lipids. Similarly, the renewable diesel productivity, <italic>P</italic><sub>RD</sub>, is a stronger metric than triacylglycerol productivity, <italic>P</italic><sub>TAG</sub>, and this concept is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.
<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Metric strength increases as the amount of information that the metric contains increases. It is important that results are consistent in algal species and growth conditions and include all relevant inputs and processing steps. It is assumed for this figure that renewable diesel (specifically, biodiesel) can only be made from triacylglycerol, rather than all lipids</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12155_2010_9099_Fig5_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>The scope of a particular study determines the amount of information that is obtained and the associated reporting metric. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> illustrates how metric strength increases as the breadth of information conferred by the metric increases. It does not include all relevant metrics for renewable diesel production from algae. For example, a primary study may focus on determining the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> required for large-scale algal cultivation, a subset of the “Materials Consumed for Growth” metric.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> lists the productivity, cost, and energy requirements associated with each intermediate product in the production pathway (specifically, <italic>transesterification of algal lipids</italic>) in order of metric strength.
<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The productivity, cost, and energy requirements associated with producing each intermediate product can be written as an inverted pyramid, with the strongest metrics representing the entire production pathway. The subscripts on the left-hand side of the equations are renewable diesel (RD), fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), separated useful lipids (SUL), lysed mass (LM), harvested mass (HM), and grown mass (GM). The overall units for these equations are grams per liter of growth volume per day, dollars per liter of renewable diesel, and joules per liter of renewable diesel for the productivity, cost, and energy equations, respectively (recall that the tilde denotes a processing step cost or energy requirement and that this nomenclature is specific to transesterification of algal lipids)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12155_2010_9099_Fig6_HTML.gif" id="MO6"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Use of Symbolic Notation</title><p>The second principle for the proposed characterization framework is that results from studies with limited scope can be reported with strong metrics by including unknown information in symbolic notation. There are two main advantages of presenting information in this manner: (1) it ensures that results are not taken out of context, thus helping to avoid incomplete estimates for the potential of renewable diesel from algae, and (2) it explicitly identifies the areas where additional data are needed to complete the production pathway analysis. In addition, using symbolic notation enables results to be incorporated into systems-level analyses more directly. The nomenclature used in this section is described in detail in Appendix <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">2</xref>.</p><p>To demonstrate reporting results with unknowns in symbolic notation in an example, the triacylglycerol productivity, <italic>P</italic><sub>TAG</sub>, of a culture can be expressed as

This lack of specificity in the results of many studies limits their utility.</p><p>It is also important to be specific when citing results that are dependent upon growth conditions. Combining results for the maximum lipid fraction (g lipid/g of algal mass) of a particular alga (often obtained under nutrient deficient conditions) with the maximum growth rate of that alga (generally obtained under nutrient replete conditions) introduces an inconsistency in the resulting lipid productivity. This practice is misleading because growth rate and lipid production are generally inversely related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>There are several different metrics that are often used to evaluate algal biofuel potential including lipid content, neutral lipid content, triacylglycerol content, etc. If these terms are improperly used as synonyms, comparisons among various results are not direct comparisons. For instance, the terms “oil” or “algae oil” are frequently used for reporting results without defining the chemical composition of these substances. These terms have been used to refer to algal lipids, biodiesel, and even ethanol. The lack of specificity regarding these metrics needlessly limits the value of the published results.</p><p>Finally, neglecting to distinguish among types of biofuels can also introduce ambiguity in analyses. For example, ethanol contains about 70% of the energy content per volume of biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Inclusive Results</title><p>Many studies specifically addressing the production of renewable diesel from algae could be more widely useful if they included information encompassing more of the production pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. While the scope of a study determines the breadth of information available, it is useful to rigorously place the work in the context of the entire production pathway. As suggested by Griffiths and Harrison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], this benefit is particularly true for studies that include information regarding the products of interest in algal cultures for biodiesel production (i.e., lipids or triacylglycerol). For example, if a researcher evaluates the impact of different nutrients on lipid production, the results for that study are most useful if they provide more information than simply the lipid fraction, LF, of the cultures.</p><p>It is also important to include information about all relevant parts of the production pathway due to the variability of algal cultures. Downstream processing studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of processing algae or “algae oil,” without including relevant information about the algal species, lipid content, or oil composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Since growth rate, lipid content, and lipid composition can vary widely depending on species or growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>], the processing efficiencies determined for one alga or one composition of “algae oil” may differ from those associated with different algae or oil compositions. The resources required for production may also vary depending on species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Including the algal species and/or the composition of the tested algal oil would reduce these inconsistencies.</p><p>Also, there is a significant discrepancy among costs on a lab scale, pilot scale, and commercial scale and among results obtained for short-term versus long-term experiments. Correlating data among these scales and time frames is challenging, and the scalability of algal production for biofuels is an ongoing area of research. To advance this research area, which is critical for producing accurate estimates of the potential of algae for renewable diesel, it is valuable to be as specific about the growth volume and time period as possible because the cultivation scale can impact growth characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Finally, several systems-level analyses have calculated estimates for the total land area (for open ponds) or growth volume (for bioreactors) required to cultivate enough microalgae needed to produce a specified amount of diesel fuel substitute (such as to satisfy the US diesel consumption) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Other studies present estimates for the total financial cost of producing “algae oil” in terms such as dollars per barrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. However, some of these analyses, including some analyses listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, omit important pieces of the production pathway, leading to inconsistent results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Energy, Materials, and Cost Balances</title><p>The third way to improve reporting consistency is by considering the energy, materials, and cost requirements for each production process. These requirements are relevant for specific studies conducted by primary researchers (e.g., energy required to grow a culture) and especially for systems-level researchers who characterize the potential for algae-based biofuel. In fact, the two are directly linked. Without energy, materials, and cost information associated with primary studies of individual processes, it is impossible to compile the energy balance of the entire production pathway.</p><p>There are numerous primary studies on algal growth, lipid composition, and processing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. The impact of many primary studies could potentially be increased with the inclusion of energy, cost, and material requirements. For instance, if a study on the lipid fraction of different algal species includes the amount of energy, materials, and cost required to produce the lipid, its results could be more broadly interpreted. Information that is not relevant or not known can be presented in symbolic notation, as suggested above, to enable the use of strong reporting metrics.</p><p>It is also important that top-level analyses of renewable diesel produced from algae address the energy, materials, and cost requirements for renewable diesel production consistently. Significant inconsistencies can arise when the requirements for entire production steps are omitted or oversimplified. Several systems-level analyses have been published for renewable diesel from algae (primarily biodiesel), each with a different amount of information regarding energy, cost, and material requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. These systems-level cost analyses provide good outlines for conducting cost estimates, but sometimes lack specificity to algal species or growth conditions, and may omit some required processing steps. Processing efficiencies and resource requirements may depend on the algal species and composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the field of algae-derived renewable diesel to progress, the community of researchers needs to provide accurate answers to the three questions: (1) how much renewable diesel can be produced, (2) how much will this renewable diesel cost, and (3) what are the energy requirements for production? We have proposed a framework and associated nomenclature system for characterizing the potential of algae for renewable diesel that outlines a method for presenting consistent, widely interpretable results. This framework consists of three principles: using strong metrics, using symbolic representation for unknown information, and presenting results that are consistent and include all relevant information. Widespread use of common nomenclature and a consistent reporting framework by primary researchers would allow systems-level analysts to integrate the results of primary research into estimates for the potential of algae for renewable diesel. In turn, widespread use of a framework by systems-level analysts would lead to improved estimates, which are valuable for researchers and policy makers. Accurate and informative estimates of the potential of renewable diesel will help researchers focus their efforts on the most pressing problems and help policy makers make appropriate decisions about funding and resource allocation related to algal biofuel development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><sec><p>We would like to thank the Center for Electromechanics at the University of Texas at Austin and OpenAlgae LLC for their collaboration and partial funding of this research.

Biodiesel is a type of renewable diesel, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents the general pathway for producing algal biodiesel via transesterification of extracted lipids. This pathway can also be envisioned as the progression of intermediate products, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. The composition of the intermediate products shown might be dynamic, as with any biological system.
<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>There are several intermediate products in the algal biodiesel production pathway. *The total separations efficiency includes the lipids separations efficiency and the useful lipids separation efficiency</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12155_2010_9099_Fig7_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p>The product(s) of each step in the production pathway, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, are often complex mixtures of compounds. As a result, the content of each intermediate product may be reported according to the quantity of lipid (all types), neutral lipid, triacylglycerol, hydrocarbon, or FAME present. Thus, it is important to define these terms. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> outlines a basic classification of lipids, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> provides the chemical structure for a triacylglycerol, a phospholipid, and a FAME. Lipids are broadly defined as naturally produced molecules that are insoluble in water and often characterized as cellular compounds that can be extracted by an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As described by Hu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] lipids include polar lipids, neutral lipids, and several additional compounds. Polar lipids, including glycolipids and phospholipids, are a major component in biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. These compounds contain a polar head and non-polar tails that are fat-soluble fatty acids. Neutral lipids, or simple lipids, include non-polar glycerolipids, hydrocarbons, and waxes. A common neutral lipid in microalgae is triacylglycerol (also called triglyceride, TAG, or TG), which is formed as an energy storage product. Triacylglycerol is comprised of a glycerol backbone and three saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. The length and saturation of the fatty acids varies for different algal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Triacylglycerol produced by microalgae is of particular interest because it is very well suited for biodiesel production due to long fatty acid chains that are often between 16 and 18 carbon atoms in length (i.e., C:16–C:18, similar to those comprising petroleum diesel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Also, triacylglycerol does not contain phosphorus or other elements that could complicate biodiesel refining. Some neutral lipids are hydrocarbons, which are defined as molecules consisting exclusively of hydrogen and carbon and are found in several algal species, specifically <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. FAME, the main components of biodiesel, are produced from lipids via transesterification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The term “useful lipid” is used to refer to the lipids that are compatible with downstream production processes. Generally, triacylglycerol is considered the most useful lipid for biodiesel production. Conversely, phospholipids might complicate refining due to the phosphorus and nitrogen content of the polar head groups, which could prevent them from being used to produce biodiesel. It is not clear which lipids will be useful for industrial scale algal biodiesel production, so triacylglycerol is singled out in some following examples to emphasize the need to be specific about the type of algal lipids that are produced.
