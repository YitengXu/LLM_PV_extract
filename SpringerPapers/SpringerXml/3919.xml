To achieve even higher power conversion efficiencies, it is important to understand the role of remnant lead iodide in these perovskites. To that end, we explored the mechanism facilitating this effect by identifying the impact of excess lead iodide within the perovskite film on charge diffusion length, using electron-beam-induced current measurements, and on film formation properties, from grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Based on our results, we propose that excess lead iodide in the perovskite precursors can reduce the halide vacancy concentration and lead to formation of azimuthal angle-oriented cubic α-perovskite crystals in-between 0° and 90°. We further identify a higher perovskite carrier concentration inside the nanostructured titanium dioxide layer than in the capping layer. These effects are consistent with enhanced lead iodide-rich perovskite solar cell performance and illustrate the role of lead iodide.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Excess lead iodide in the mixed halide perovskites solar cells leads to high device performance but its origin remains elusive.

The PCEs of PSCs have been mainly improved by developing methods to deposit highly uniform and dense layers on substrates and to control the ABX<sub>3</sub> composition of the halide perovskites (HaP), where X is halide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Compositional control of HaP materials includes varying the ratio of lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>) and the salt of the “A” cation, methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formaminidium iodide (FAI), used to form the perovskite layers. Bi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> have independently reported that addition of excess PbI<sub>2</sub> to a solution used to prepare an HaP of 15% methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>) mixed with 85% formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>), plays an important role in improving the PCEs of PSCs, based on this HaP ((FAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.85</sub>(MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.15</sub>). However, it is not clear how excess PbI<sub>2</sub> in the precursor solution, produced by adding PbI<sub>2</sub> in excess to the required (MAX or FAX) to PbI<sub>2</sub> ratio, and residual PbI<sub>2</sub> in the HaP layer contributes to efficiency improvement in these PSCs. At this time, the residual PbI<sub>2</sub> location in the HaP and its function remain unclear.</p><p id="Par4">While the effect of excess PbI<sub>2</sub> in HaPs has been discussed in several previous investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the details of this phenomenon could not be elucidated, and the hypotheses suggested for the origin of these effects are not comprehensive. For example, it has been suggested that PbI<sub>2</sub> can be located at the grain boundaries, the surface of the HaP films as well as at the interfaces between nanostructured titanium dioxide (ns-TiO<sub>2</sub>) and HaPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Oesinghaus et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> used grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) to investigate how different crystal orientations of HaPs (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) are formed with various HaPs deposition methods, such as the popular one/two-step coating. Brenner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> investigated the conversion of single crystal PbI<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> with emphasis on structural relations and transformation dynamics and found that while initially the reaction proceeds topotactically, ultimately a destruction/reconstruction process occurs and memory of the original PbI<sub>2</sub> morphology is lost. Although this is useful information for understanding the process of film formation and effects of different crystalline orientations, it is not yet possible to correlate crystal orientations with charge transfer mechanisms in terms of solar cell function.</p><p id="Par5">Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) have been commonly used to understand charge collection efficiencies and identify charge transfer mechanisms. However, for HaP materials it has been difficult to determine exact values of electron/hole pair diffusion lengths in the actual PSCs, because of the need to develop a model for the charge quenching processes in various HaP layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, the applicability of these approaches to HaP layers with mixed compositions should be verified.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we examine key features of the electrical and crystal properties of HaP layers with and without excess PbI<sub>2</sub>, using electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) measurements, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Our EBIC results suggest that excess PbI<sub>2</sub> results in reduced electronic defects in the bulk film, and GIWAXS shows that the PbI<sub>2</sub>-rich HaP film is textured and has more-ordered grains than the normal film. Additionally, HR-TEM observations indicate that excess PbI<sub>2</sub> surrounds the perovskite grains rather than occuring just at grain boundaries. These features may improve charge transfer and lead to very low <italic>J-V</italic> hysteresis in a PV cell made with this material, compared with what is the case for films and cells made from a stoichiometric solution precursor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>EBIC measurements</title><p id="Par7">EBIC measurements can probe carrier diffusion lengths, <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub>, which is a critical material/device property for solar cells. We should use a special form of EBIC, plan-view, on full devices to obtain <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub>, because the thickness of the active absorber in the high efficiency devices is less than the diffusion lengths. As this is not the usual way in which EBIC is used to extract diffusion lengths, we then describe how, in these samples, we can use plan-view EBIC and give the working assumptions for use of plan-view EBIC due to the inability to measure diffusion lengths in cross-sectional EBIC images. A model for charge separation mechanism as well as estimates of carrier diffusion lengths can be deduced from EBIC collection efficiency mapping of a PV device, in this case, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dense-TiO<sub>2</sub>/ns-TiO<sub>2</sub>/Perovskite/PTAA(polytriarylamine)/Au.Thus, EBIC measurements were carried out for two representative types of HaP samples, namely, [FAPbI<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0.85</sub>[MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0.15</sub> (denoted as control-HaP) and [FAPbI<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0.85</sub>[MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0.15</sub>, which was prepared with 7.5 mol% of excess PbI<sub>2</sub> (denoted as w/-PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP). Excited carrier diffusion lengths can be determined from EBIC measurements only if the carrier motion is not subject to any electric field, but such lengths can also be derived from the drift lengths. Carrier diffusion and drift are correlated by the Einstein relation, <italic>D</italic> = <italic>μkTq</italic><sup>−1</sup>, where <italic>D</italic> is the diffusion length, <italic>μ</italic> is the carrier mobility, and <italic>k</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>q</italic> are the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and carrier charge, respectively. In a <italic>p-i-n</italic> device, where an electric field is present throughout the absorber film, an upper limit of the diffusion length can be estimated from plan-view EBIC images. There, EBIC mapping is done at the edge of the Au contacts for holes, and at the FTO edge for electrons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). To make it possible for carriers to be collected, carrier motion must be perpendicular to the built-in field and we can assume, to a first approximation, that the carrier motion is not affected by the field that exists across the layer (i.e., 90° from the direction of measurement in plan view). The resulting estimate of the diffusion length is considered as an upper limit, because of the fast extraction of the complementary carrier type to the selective contact. In this case an uneven concentration of excited holes and electrons in an already low-doped semiconductor results in a low recombination rate. In order to estimate excited carrier diffusion lengths from plan-view EBIC, we assume significant lateral transport in the PTAA is unlikely due to its high resistance compared to that of the HaP film. This is due to a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher hole mobility in the HaP than in the PTAA and also the difference in the layer thickness (over 500-nm-thick HaP layer and less than 50 nm for the PTAA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Lateral transport of electrons in the d-TiO<sub>2</sub> and the incorporated HaP in the nanoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> (HaP@ns-TiO<sub>2</sub>) may be more efficient than that of holes in the PTAA and contribute to the EBIC signal as the e<sup>−</sup>-beam scans away from the FTO (over parts from which the FTO was etched). Reduced concentration of one type of carrier due to fast extraction of one of the carrier types along with point excitation would increase the effective apparent diffusion length of the other carrier by lowering the probability of second order recombination. A cleaner estimate of the exact diffusion lengths in the HaP would require deposition of the HaP layer, on glass, with two selective contacts, which do not sandwich the HaP film. Deposition over glass requires adjusting the HaP deposition process and may result in a different electronic quality material. The estimated upper limit represents the potential of the material under optimal conditions and in a real device.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Plan-view images of a device, using secondary electron (SE) contrast (left) and EBIC measurements (right).

A peak is formed if the beam-induced damage also creates damage to the material, which at some point becomes significant and results in measurable signal reduction; second, beam-induced change in the effective doping concentration, which is initially optimized with respect to the first scan, but later forms an excess, which results in an increased recombination rate and, as a result, a lower EBIC signal.</p><p id="Par13">The latter explanation is independent of whether or not a new surface was created as part of sample preparation for EBIC analysis (i.e., sample cleaving). This means that a peak in EBIC signal with repetitive scans should have appeared both in plan-view, as well as in cross-section imaging. The appearance of such a peak in the cross-sectioned samples is only relevant for the first explanation, where the HaP has exposed free surface. A lower surface state concentration in w/-PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP is indicated by a high initial signal, unaffected by previous beam exposure, and fewer exposures required to reach the maximum signal value. The initial EBIC signal strength at the w/-PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP was 70% ± 8% of the highest value (Fig. 2a shows an extreme case of signal strength of ~90% of the maximum), whereas for the control-HaP, 40% ± 16% of the highest signal was observed. 1–3 beam exposures were required to reach the highest signal for w/-PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP, and 4–6 for the control-HaP. An example for the evolution of the EBIC signal owing to beam-damage-related signal decay is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>.</p><p id="Par14">In light of our understanding of the mechanism for beam-induced changes of the EBIC signal, we conclude that the w/-PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP is less susceptible to defect formation during cleaving and lab air exposure than the control sample.</p><p id="Par15">A striking observation from the EBIC line profile is the relatively low signal from the HaP@ns-TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, only some 8–17% of the signal from the capping HaP film (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). As an HaP content larger than 25% but considerably less than the content in the HaP overlayer, can clearly be seen in the ns-TiO<sub>2</sub> layer using high-resolution Z contrast SEM imaging (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), the low EBIC signal is attributed to a high recombination rate. This means that the current collection efficiency from that layer is low, and may represent a loss in a real device, due to absorption of light in a poorly photoactive layer. Possible reasons for high recombination rate in the HaP@ns-TiO<sub>2</sub> are defects at the HaP/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface, high (dark) carrier concentration due to charge transfer from the TiO<sub>2</sub> to the HaP across the interface, or defects in the HaP as a result of less optimal crystallization than that of the HaP capping-layer. The relatively low external quantum efficiency at short wavelength, previously reported by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, is consistent with such an explanation. Strong optical absorption in the short wavelength range implies essentially complete absorption (in this range) by the HaP in the ns-TiO<sub>2</sub> and loss of current. An advantage of having the HaP@ns-TiO<sub>2</sub> layer could be to promote charge separation, even before carrier injection into the TiO<sub>2</sub> by formation of high electron concentration at the HaP/HaP@ns-TiO<sub>2</sub> interface. Such a junction should be selective for electrons and repel holes from the electron extraction interface, which may reduce overall recombination. Further investigation is required to understand the origin of, and thus avoid, the low collection efficiency in the HaP@TiO<sub>2</sub> layer.</p><p id="Par16">The differences between the EBIC signals in the presence and absence of excess PbI<sub>2</sub> in the deposition solution can be caused by several factors. For example, excess PbI<sub>2</sub> in solution may act to shift the crystallization reaction equilibrium towards a material with fewer iodide (I<sup>−</sup>) vacancies, by maintaining high I<sup>−</sup> activity during crystallization and, thus, limiting the vacancy density (assuming that formation energies for interstitials or anti-site defects are too high to make these defects occur in significant concentrations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Alternatively, a thin PbI<sub>2</sub> coating at the HaP grain boundaries may somehow passivate defect surface states and prevent recombination (at the surfaces)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We note that the above discussion is limited to bulk grains and the interface between the HaP layer with the selective contacts, and does not include HaP grain boundaries. We also selected only areas of the sample that had a flat morphology.

We note that δ-HaP was not observed in conventional XRD measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), which suggests that it may be on the surface of the α-HaP crystal or in a very small boundary layer between PbI<sub>2</sub> and α-HaP crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This hypothesis is consistent with the stronger intensities for δ-HaP [100]<sub>h</sub> of w/-PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) than in control-HaP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In addition, different crystal orientations for α-HaP, [100]c and [200]c, can be observed as preferential GIWAXS peaks for both HaPs. For control-HaP, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>, α-HaP[100]<sub>c</sub> is mainly observed out-of-plane, and very few crystallites are oriented at 5° (175°) and 40° (140°) of azimuthal angles, where the angle in parentheses represents the symmetry value of the GIWAXS 2D pattern.

As already reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, the formation of a crystalline HaP thin film involves a process in which precursors, dissolved in a solution, are first solidified in the form of a compound bound to a solvent, and as the solvent is removed crystallization occurs with the help of external thermal energy. HaP crystal transformations from the as-prepared film were monitored from 6 s to 480 s on a hot plate during heating from 30 °C to 150 °C by in-situ GIWAXS, to reveal when a PbI<sub>2</sub> remnant was produced, and when the crystalline HaP was oriented. The as-prepared film was obtained by dripping diethyl ether as an antisolvent onto the substrate during spin-coating of the perovskite precursor solution. At the initial stage after 6 s, it was found in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> that α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> [200] and δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> [100] were formed at an early stage. We see that the phase of the δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> [100] is significantly reduced and converted to α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and PbI<sub>2</sub> [001] phase at 60 s. No significant changes occur between 60 and 480 s. This implies that an excess PbI<sub>2</sub> in precursor solution forms a thin intermediate layer of the FAI deficient-FAI-PbI<sub>2</sub>-DMSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> complex rather than PbI<sub>2</sub>-DMSO, after spin-coating, followed by the conversion of α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> [100] and PbI<sub>2</sub> [001] phase from δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> [100] with annealing at high temperature. This result also explains why PbI<sub>2</sub> is present inside the α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> grains, as will be seen later in the TEM. We now take a closer look at the changes taking place. After annealing for 6 s, a non-perovskite phase derived from yellow δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> was observed at <italic>q</italic> = 0.84 Å<sup>−1</sup>. Interestingly, this phase showed two distinct orientations at azimuth angles of 30° (150°), and 90°. After further heating for 60 s, peaks at <italic>q</italic> = 0.84 Å<sup>−1</sup> began to disappear, whereas another diffraction peak at <italic>q</italic> = 1.0 Å<sup>−1</sup> originating from black α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> appeared with two specific orientations at azimuth angles of 25° (155°) and 55° (125°). The in-situ GIWAXS shows that the phase transition during crystallization and growth does not significantly affect the orientation of the perovskite crystallites. This preferred orientation of the perovskite crystallite is presumed to be determined from the intermediate complex due to differences in the precursor solution, but further study is required. The importance for this study is that no peak of PbI<sub>2</sub> [001]<sub>t</sub> is seen in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>.

To fabricate efficient perovskite cells based on the (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.85</sub>(MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.15</sub>:PbI<sub>2</sub>, 1.05 M solutions with the ratio of 0.85(NH<sub>2</sub>CH = NH<sub>2</sub>(=FA)PbI<sub>3</sub>), 0.15(CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>(=MA)PbBr<sub>3</sub>) and MACl (in case of excess PbI<sub>2</sub> 7.5 mol% PbI<sub>2</sub> powder was added to this precursor solution) in N-N-dimethylformamide(DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide(DMSO) = (6:1 v/v) were then coated onto the nanostructured(ns)-TiO<sub>2</sub>/bl-TiO<sub>2</sub>/FTO substrate, heated to 50 °C, by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 5 and 10 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, 1 mL ethyl ether was poured onto the substrate after 5 s. A polytriarylamine (PTAA) (EM index Co. LTD., Mn is 17500 g mol<sup>−1</sup>)/toluene (10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) solution with 7.5 µL Li-bis(trifl uoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (170 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and 4 µL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) added, was spin-coated on the perovskite layer/ns-TiO<sub>2</sub>/bl-TiO<sub>2</sub>/FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of Au was deposited as electrical contact by thermal evaporation. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>EBIC measurement</title><p id="Par25">Control—and w/-PbI<sub>2</sub> -HaP—samples were prepared according to a previously reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. EBIC imaging was conducted with a LEO Supra scanning electron microscope and a Stanford Research Instruments pre-amplifier (SR570) to amplify the current and convert it to voltage feed for the instrument computer. Plan-view imaging was performed at 5 and 10 kV beam energies. Cross-sectional imaging was performed at 3 kV beam energy, after the sample was mechanically cleaved and transferred to the vacuum chamber within less than 2 minutes. In order to cleave the sample, a small, straight cut is made on the glass (uncovered) side of the substrate across the substrate using a glass-cutting pen. Then, compressive pressure is applied at one of the contacts (FTO or the etched glass/gold) to fracture the device.</p><p id="Par26">In all images, the aperture diameter was 7.5 μm, the beam current was 3–4 pA, and the working distance was 5 to 7 mm. Images were collected in pixel average mode. Under these conditions, the interaction volume limits the resolution to around 20 nm.</p><p id="Par27">Statistics for all EBIC data were obtained from two sets of w/PbI<sub>2</sub>-HaP and control samples, prepared independently. Each set was composed of two samples from each type. For diffusion length estimation each sample was measured five times, at different locations. At each location the average of 25 EBIC lines was used to arrive at a single calculated value. The five values from each sample were compared between all samples of the same type, i.e. 20 values per sample type, to form an average value and standard deviation.</p><p id="Par28">For the total intensity decay analysis, an averaged EBIC signal was taken from a 2D square map. The map area was 5 consecutive pixel lines across the HaP layer. The intensity decay analysis was performed by repetitive scans of the same area. Quick scans (up to 3 seconds) are done to center a region of interest without leaving significant damage. Then, every image scan takes 2.8–3.0 minutes while re-taking the images is done in less than 3 seconds, in which the current image is recorded and immediately followed by a re-scan of the area. We did not observe beam damage dependence on time between scans. Next, the intensity at each location was normalized according to the maximum achieved intensity for that area. An averaged initial intensity value was obtained by a similar averaging process as described above. The fitting of the data results in an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.99 and 0.94 for <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub>.</p><p id="Par29">Care was taken to account for beam-induced changes in the signal, which can affect the measured properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For each diffusion length measurement (planar view, which does not involve sample cleaving), repetitive scans were performed to study the signal decay and compare it to cross-sectional decay as described in the text. Since our setup does not provide absolute EBIC current, we consider relative intensity only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>GIWAXS investigation</title><p id="Par30">GIWAXS measurements were conducted on the PLS-II 6D UNIST- PAL beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in the Republic of Korea.

Incidence angles of 0.15°, 0.2°, and 0.3° were used in this study. The vacuum GIWAXS sample chamber is equipped with a 5-axis motorized stage for fine sample alignment. The incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to 0.15°, which is close to the critical angle for HaP. Two-dimensional GIWAXS 2 dimension (2D) patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix MX 225-HS, USA). Diffraction angles were calibrated by a pre-calibrated sucrose (Monoclinic, P2<sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic> = 10.8631 Å, <italic>b</italic> = 8.7044 Å, <italic>c</italic> = 7.7624 Å, b = 102.938°)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and the sample-to-detector distance was 246.4 mm.
