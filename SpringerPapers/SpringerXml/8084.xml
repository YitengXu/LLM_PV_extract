In these devices, formation of neutral states through charge recombination has a crucial role in determining device efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; however, it is difficult to control this process directly. In OLEDs, simple models based on spin statistics predict that recombination of injected electrons and holes forms singlet and triplet excitons with a ratio of 1:3. Owing to weak spinâorbit coupling in most organic semiconductors, only singlet excitons contribute to light emission. By injecting spin-polarized carriers from magnetic electrodes, it is in principle possible to control the exciton spin statistics and light emission in OLEDs; however, only weak effects have been observed in this type of device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The reason remains unclear, but is likely because of the difficulty of obtaining selective spin-polarized injection at metal/organic semiconductor interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">When electrons are injected into an organic semiconductor device from the electrodes, they form a dilute non-degenerate system and thermal statistics should apply once the spin population has had time to equilibrate (in the absence of spin-selective recombination processes). Therefore, spin polarization can be an important effect in organic semiconductors devices at very low temperatures and high magnetic fields. In this case, the spins of electrons and holes will be aligned with the external magnetic field. For perfect spin alignment, only the ââ triplet state can be formed when an electron and hole recombine, hence in high magnetic fields singlet state formation should be suppressed and triplet excitons preferentially formed; however, this effect has not previously been reported.</p><p id="Par5">Here we show a new approach that allows large changes in exciton spin statistics to be achieved by spin-polarizing carriers after injection using high magnetic fields and low temperatures, where the Zeeman energy is comparable with the thermal energy. By using this method, we demonstrate that the singlet formation can be suppressed by up to 53% in OLEDs, and the dark conductance of OPV devices can be increased by up to 45% due to enhanced formation of triplet charge-transfer (CT) states, leading to less recombination to the ground state. In addition to providing a sensitive test of the effects of spin-dependent recombination in OLEDs and OPVs, our high-field measurements confirm the importance of spin-dependent recombination in driving the smaller room-temperature magnetic field effects previously seen in these devices at low fields. Although the microscopic physics of spin polarization is simple, it is surprising that spin polarization translates into such large changes in macroscopic observables such as current and light output. These effects have not been observed in inorganic semiconductor spintronic devices, and rely on the unique physics of organic semiconductors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Light-emitting diodes</title><p id="Par6">To investigate the effects of spin polarization on recombination (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we first performed experiments on typical OLED devices.

As the device current changed only slightly (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), changes in carrier mobility are insufficient to explain the large observed MEL. Direct enhancement of recombination rates via singlet and triplet pathways has been proposed to explain the positive MEL effects seen by Reufer <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, but cannot explain the large negative MEL seen here. Spin mixing in organic semiconductors can be caused by the hyperfine coupling (HFC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and <italic>Îg</italic> mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Before forming intramolecular excitons, intermolecular CT states are formed through electron-hole recombination. ISC can occur much more easily in CT states than in tightly bound intramolecular excitons, because the CT states have much smaller exchange energy. By applying an external magnetic field which is comparable to the hyperfine field, HFC can be suppressed and ISC is reduced, thus reducing the overall recombination rate from CT states. These effects have been extensively investigated in OLEDs (see for example Hu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, Dediu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and Kersten <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>). In our measurement, we also observe a small reduction in EL (~1%) at magnetic fields up to 0.1âT. However, changes in ISC caused by HFC will saturate at relatively small magnetic fields, and therefore cannot explain our large-field results. Also, ISC caused by the Î<italic>g</italic> mechanism is expected to increase ISC at high field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and then it will produce a positive MEL, in contrast to the negative MEL that we observe. Therefore, magnetic field dependence of ISC is not the reason for the observed large negative MEL at high magnetic fields. It has been shown that additional singlet excitons can be produced through TTA, and TTA can be suppressed by high magnetic fields, which results in a negative MEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In fact, the TTA process becomes important only when the excitation density is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In our measurement, we observe that the MEL is more significant at lower carrier density when the temperature is below 10âK. Therefore, we believe that TTA does not play a significant role in the lowest current density case. At 50âK, the MEL slightly increases at higher current densities (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), which indicates that TTA might play a role under these conditions. In addition, the maximum MEL expected due to modulation of TTA is 37.5% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>), smaller than the effect that we observe.</p><p id="Par9">On the basis of the above analysis, we believe that the observed large MEL at low bias is caused directly by the magnetic field dependence of the formation probabilities of singlet and triplet states. At high magnetic field and low temperature, the Zeeman energy is comparable to the thermal energy (for example, the Zeeman energy is about 60âÎ¼eV at 1âT, and the thermal energy is about 250âÎ¼eV at 3âK), and then the spin polarization effect becomes important if the charge carriers have had time to relax before recombination. In this case, fewer singlet states and more triplet states will be formed, which directly results in EL quenching. To set up a simple model for this process, we assume that the equilibrium spin populations are determined by Boltzmann statistics corresponding to the Zeeman energy, and that the populations relax exponentially to this equilibrium state with a characteristic time <italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub>. We assume that the carriers are unpolarized on injection, and that they recombine in a well-defined carrier recombination time <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub> that is the same for electrons and holes. Pairs of parallel spins are assumed to recombine to triplet states, and antiparallel spins recombine to singlet or triplet states with equal probability. The detailed calculation is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1359">Supplementary Methods</xref>. Applying the model to the 3âK data in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> gives a good fit with a ratio <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> of 1.43. In the absence of independent measurements of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub>, we fit the temperature-dependent data in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> with the same value of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub>; a reasonable fit to the magnitude and shape of the MEL effect as a function of temperature is obtained. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> displays fits of the MEL at various bias voltages at 3âK, here allowing <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> to vary. Values of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> of 1.43, 0.95, 0.72 and 0.50 are obtained at voltages of 25, 27, 29 and 32âV, respectively. The clear decrease in <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> as the bias voltage increases is consistent with a reduced chargeâcarrier lifetime due to the larger electric field and higher mobility (due to its dependence on field and carrier density), possibly assisted by a higher bimolecular recombination rate at higher bias (or high current density). The <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> value can also be tuned by changing device thickness, and we indeed observe that thinner devices have smaller MEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1359">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The observed deviations of the MEL data from the model at high biases are likely due to the TTA process playing a role when the current density is high.</p><p id="Par10">To obtain independent validation of our model, we can estimate <italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> by measuring the transient EL after turning on the device (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1359">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). The initial EL is insensitive to magnetic field, and the MEL effect builds up on a characteristic timescale of ~150âÎ¼s, independent of temperature. The additional carriers that are injected are initially almost unpolarized, and the time taken for the magnetic field effect to build up is thus a direct measure of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub>. The value of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub> is more difficult to measure independently, due to the dispersive nature of transport and recombination, and the presence of two carrier types in the device. We note that the EL overshoot after turn-on stabilizes on a timescale of about 75âÎ¼s, and this provides one measure of a characteristic timescale for transport and recombination that agrees with the <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> ratio determined by fitting the MEL data above. Smaller or larger values of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub> can, however, be estimated respectively from the fast EL turn-on or from mobilities extracted assuming spaceâcharge-limited currents. Broadly, our independent measurements of <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub> and <italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> conclude that they are of the same order, consistent with the <italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>Ï</italic><sub>s</sub> ratios that we extract from fitting the MEL data.</p><p id="Par11">We note that in F8BT:TFB devices the singlet CT states initially formed by electron-hole recombination relax to form bound emissive CT states (sometimes termed exciplexes) at the F8BT/TFB interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. At low temperatures, the EL comes predominantly from these singlet exciplex states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This contrasts with LEDs based on a single polymer, where intermolecular singlet CT states relax to form intrachain singlet excitons. In both cases triplet CT states relax rapidly to the lower-energy intrachain triplet exciton, which is non-emissive. In the absence of significant dissociation or spin mixing of the emissive state the MEL effect should be independent of whether the emission is from an intrachain or inter-chain singlet state. This is confirmed by the fact that we also observe MEL effects (of similar magnitude to those described above) in single-polymer LEDs based on poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (F8) and poly(2-methoxy-5-(2â²-ethyl-hexyloxy)-<italic>p</italic>-phenylene vinylene) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1359">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photovoltaic devices</title><p id="Par12">We have shown that the spin statistics can be controlled in OLED devices at high magnetic fields, with very obvious effects on optical emission. In general, changing the spin statistics can change the net rate of recombination, and this can change the current flowing in the device, leading to magnetoconductance (MC) effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, in the devices studied above these effects are small, probably because the tightly bound exciplex or exciton states formed by recombination are unlikely to be redissociated to form free charges. Instead, they will rapidly relax to the lower-energy intrachain triplet exciton state, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. Hence, although the population of charge pairs will increase as the recombination rate is reduced, this will not have a direct effect on the population of free charges responsible for the current. In other systems, however, particularly those that operate efficiently as photovoltaics, dissociation of charge pairs is an important process in competition with recombination, and significant effects on the electrical properties might be expected by changing the net recombination rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We therefore now examine MC effects in the dark current of OPV devices. One good example is a typical poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) OPV system. In this system, the intrachain triplet exciton is a higher-energy state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> than the CT state, therefore the long-lived triplet CT states can be dissociated to become free changes and contribute to device current, and a significant MC effect is expected when charge carriers are spin polarized, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic of recombination pathways and timescales.</title><p>Spin polarization due to the magnetic field changes the ratio of singlet and triplet charge-transfer states (<sup>1</sup>CT and <sup>3</sup>CT, respectively) formed by charge recombination, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. For the LED device (<bold>a</bold>), triplet CT states recombine rapidly to form lower-energy triplet excitons. For the photovoltaic device (<bold>b</bold>), the triplet exciton state is higher in energy than the triplet CT state.

This small-field effect is similar to that seen in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, which is due to changes in HFC-induced ISC. However, when the magnetic field increases further, a new and significant MC effect appears at low temperatures. At 2âK, we observe a positive MC as high as 45% at 8.7âT. This positive high-field MC effect decreases rapidly with increasing temperature, becoming negative at 25âK. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> shows the temperature dependence of the device current under constant bias voltage at various magnetic fields. Detailed data at different temperatures are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1359">Supplementary Figs S9 and S10</xref>. At zero magnetic field, the device current decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature. At 3âT, the current begins to increase as the temperature falls below 4âK. The point of minimum conductivity moves to higher temperatures as the magnetic field increases, reaching a temperature of approximately 6.5âK at 9âT. These results are surprising, as the temperature dependence appears to switch from that expected for hopping conduction to that expected for metallic conduction as the magnetic field is increased. The fact that the MC behaviour is so similar to the MEL in OLED devices leads us to consider that the MC may also be caused by the spin-polarization effect.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>MC in an P3HT:PCBM device.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) MC (on a logarithmic scale) under constant bias at various temperatures.

These include: classical MC caused by the Lorentz force; hopping MC due to wavefunction shrinkage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>; weak localization due to quantum interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; and bipolaron formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The first two mechanisms can be ruled out in our devices because they result only in negative MC effects. MC caused by the weak localization effect and bipolaron formation might be positive. However, all these mechanisms are single-carrier effects that should be present in electron-only or hole-only devices. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1359">Supplementary Fig. S11</xref>, the MC effects in these single-carrier devices are very much suppressed, and become almost unobservable. Therefore, we can also rule out weak localization and bipolaron formation effects in our system. Hence, we return to changes in the recombination process due to spin polarization as the dominant mechanism to explain the observed large MC effect.</p><p id="Par15">In OPVs, CT states can be formed through bimolecular recombination following injection of electrons and holes from electrodes. Singlet CT states will recombine quickly to the ground state, whereas triplet CT states will recombine more slowly. Relaxation of triplet CT states to form intramolecular triplet excitons can in some cases provide an additional pathway for removal of triplet CT states, but in this system the CT state is sufficiently low in energy that this process is forbidden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, triplet CT states are more likely than singlets to be redissociated into free charges, and enhanced formation of triplet CT states will therefore reduce the net recombination rate for free charges. In our measurements, it is the enhanced formation of triplet states due to spin polarization that we believe is responsible for the large observed MC. As discussed by Bergeson <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> in the low-field regime where changes in recombination rate are also observed, the effect of these changes on the measured current is complex, and the sign and intensity of the MC are sensitive to the exact driving conditions. In our devices, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, at 2âK we observe a positive MC at biases above 3.5âV where the injected current is significant. In this regime, recombination must be in competition with electrons and holes passing through the device without recombination, such that reducing the recombination rate increases the measured current. At higher bias, the MC tends to saturate and starts to decrease at biases above 5âV (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). This may be due to changes in the competition between carrier recombination and extraction at high biases, or due to the reduced time available for spin polarization to occur before recombination at higher bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par16">The role of spin-dependent recombination in organic devices is still controversial, and our technique allows models for device operation to be tested by achieving direct control of spin populations in a manner that is controlled primarily by energetics rather than kinetics. Our results are consistent with spin-dependent recombination being the dominant effect explaining low-field magnetic field effects in organic devices, although the amount by which recombination influences the current can vary greatly from system to system depending on the relative energies of CT states, singlet excitons and triplet excitons. In the high-field regime where spin polarization occurs, we see strong changes in the EL with magnetic field, even when the changes in the current are small. The strong spin polarization effects that we observe are unique to organic semiconductors, as they are free from the Pauli paramagnetism effects, high doping densities and strong spinâorbit coupling typically present in inorganic semiconductor devices. By spin-polarizing carriers in polymer-based devices, we have shown that the EL can be suppressed by as much as 53% in OLEDs, and the dark current can be increased by 45% in OPVs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Device preparation</title><p id="Par17">After being cleaned and oxygen plasma-treated, ITO-coated glass substrates were spin-coated with a layer of 40ânm-thick PEDOT:PSS, and then were annealed at 150âÂ°C for 10âmin under nitrogen gas flow before being transferred to a nitrogen glove box for further fabrication processes.</p><p id="Par18">For LED devices, the TFB:F8BT layer was spin-coated from a 1:1 weight ratio solution in xylene (28âmgâml<sup>â1</sup>, mixed isomers), and the active layer formed is â250ânm thick.
