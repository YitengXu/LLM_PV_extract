These include the leveling off of the total consumption of primary energy and electricity, a shift away from coal-fired electricity generation, advances in the efficiency energy conversions and end-uses, as well as the onshoring and offshoring of some energy applications. Transitions are considered with a long-term, sociotechnological perspective using data from the past 60 years, recognizing the impacts technological developments, economics, public policy, cultural preferences, and concerns about environmental impacts such as climate change. Different transitions are in different phases of development with different scales of impact, with some likely to only become significant over the next few decades.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13705_2018_Article_178.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Energy systems are dynamic and always in transition; functioning within the laws of nature and the cultural norms of the societies within which they exist. They are composed of diverse resources, technologies, and end uses, connected by infrastructure, and driven by economics, resource access, public policies, and social behaviors. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, energy systems are changing in response to (a) the shifting costs and availability of specific energy resources, (b) technological innovation, (c) public concerns about the environmental consequences of specific energy practices, and (d) many billions of people in developing nations gaining of access to modern forms of energy. The causes and speed of energy transitions are unsurprisingly complex.</p><p id="Par3">Historically, systemic changes in energy systems are not the result of “Eureka” moments of invention or discovery, but of sustained periods of technological, economic, and social advancement carried out by many actors in diverse locations, beginning long before the “breakthroughs” noted in history books and continued long after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Energy transitions occur at different speeds in different places. Large-scale infrastructure requirements slow the rate of change everywhere.</p><p id="Par4">Energy transitions are socio-technical transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] which involve innovations in technology and public policy to fulfill specific societal function met by energy services. However, technology and policies are mediated by infrastructure and economics and adopted in the context of the social values and culture (or more commonly “consumer preference”).</p><p id="Par5">In this paper, major energy transitions underway in the United States in 2018, are viewed in the context of the past six decades with recognition of sociotechnical factors and a multi-level perspective that recognizes three phases or “levels” of transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par6">Micro-level (or niche-level) transition describes technological and policy innovation which occurs in “niches” insulated from external forces that would normally stifle them. The distribution of political power between national, state, county, and city governments has provided for many policy niches in the United States. In the private sector, opportunities for significant financial gain also create investment niches. While scholars often view the micro-level as describing “technological niches,” here, I take the broad view of technological and policy niches which address practices and behaviors as well as technologies.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7">Meso-level (or sociotechnical regime-level) transition describes the phase where innovation is large-scale adoption occurs with the assistance of many public and private actors.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Macro-level (or landscape-level) transition describes the phase where a technology achieves near-universal acceptance with the support of policies, practices, and infrastructure that both endure for decades and, in turn, create barriers to competition from new technologies and practices.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par9">The USA is distinct in some ways which make it able to undertake specific transitions faster than other nations, such as a relative abundance of domestic energy resources and financial and technological capacities. However, its large area, distribution of political power, and cultural affinities with certain types of energy use such as large vehicles raise distinct challenges too. Similar energy transitions are occurring in other countries. Indeed, some transitions are occurring earlier and faster elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Primary energy</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Changing consumption</title><p id="Par10">Two macro-scale metrics of energy demand are Total Primary Energy (TPE) consumption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and Total Primary Energy consumption per capita (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Since then, TPE has oscillated with economic cycles in the range of 100–106 exajoules (EJ). During this same period (1999–2017), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 46% and population by 17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">U.S. TPE consumption per capita peaked before the two oil crises of the 1970s and declined in response to them. Irregular growth resumed from a low in 1983 to reach another peak in 2000 (3% lower than the peak of 1979) before beginning a long but uneven decline of 14% through 2017. The ongoing decline in TPE has occurred through significant variations in economic and political conditions. The current level of TPE consumption per capita was last seen in 1967.</p><p id="Par13">Other countries that industrialized early, like those of the European Union (EU), have followed a similar pattern in primary energy use as the U.S. The EU nations experienced a TPE per capita peak in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, aggregate EU TPE per capita is less than half that in the United States reflecting significant differences in economies, population densities, travel behavior, public policies, culture, and other factors.</p><p id="Par14">Countries which were less industrialized in the 1950s and 60s have undergone rapid TPE consumption growth associated with increases in GDP and population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Industrialization has provided many billions of people with access to modern forms of energy and the benefits of the services that they provide. As should be expected, the relative share of global energy consumption by long-industrialized countries has declined (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Projections are part of an Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) that provide the most widely used vision of the United States energy system over the coming decades, typically through 2050.</p><p id="Par16">EIA projections of U.S. primary energy consumption made in the early 2000s for the period through 2020 proved to be significantly higher than was ultimately consumed, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The NEMS projection in the 2000 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO2000, released in late 1999) is used for comparison purposes later in this paper.

Projections are forecasts based on specified assumptions about resource availability, economics, technologies, and policies. The AEO reference projection “generally assumes that existing laws and regulations remain unchanged throughout the projection period” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many of the changes in the U.S. energy system stem from unexpected events, such as the boom in unconventional oil and gas production, that did not get recognized by the assumptions included in modeling for AEO2000.</p><p id="Par18">The Great Recession of 2007–2009 significantly impacted the economy and energy use of the United States. A simple linear correction for economic growth is made to provide a more appropriate comparison to EIA projections. Recognizing GDP was 5% lower in 2017 than projected in AEO2000, reduces the 2017 forecast to 118 EJ, or 15 EJ higher than actual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Three changes in production</title><p id="Par19">The three most noteworthy shifts in U.S. primary energy production since 2000 were a boom in unconventional oil and gas production, a rise in biofuel use, and a rise in variable renewable energy (wind and solar).</p><p id="Par20">The most significant change in U.S. primary energy production since 2000 is the rapid expansion of unconventional “tight” oil and “shale” gas production after 2007, which reversed the decline in U.S. oil and gas production and produced new record high levels of production of both (Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

U.S. natural gas consumption reached a historic high of 30 EJ in 2017.</p><p id="Par23">The second primary energy change is the expanded use of biofuels such as corn ethanol and biodiesel following the adoption of a national Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The RFS requires the blending of biofuels with hydrocarbon transportation fuels in increasing volumes. In 2017, biofuels provided 1.5% of all primary energy and 5% of the energy used in the transportation sector (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). Since 2014, most retail gasoline sold in the United States contains 10% bio-based ethanol (E10), and there is widespread use of biodiesel too.

That is, technologies such as batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and thermal energy storage devices are beginning to be deployed at scale, often with incentives from state policies.</p><p id="Par170">The electricity system of the United States is, therefore, in “mid-transition” with a decade of significant change completed, but several decades of change ahead.</p><p id="Par171">While many scholars have explored scenarios of the future of the U.S. electricity sector with deep decarbonization of emissions, there is significant debate about the what energy sources will be used. Jacobson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>] have proposed a transition to 100% renewable hydroelectricity, wind and solar power. However, Clack and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>] have noted significant challenges to such as transition and proposed models with an 80% decarbonization relative to 1990 levels and a more diversified set of energy sources, including some fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. The Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the state of California in September 2018 of 100% “clean energy” by 2045 includes both geothermal power and the option of nuclear power but excludes fossil fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par172">The ambitious Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the state of California (12% of U.S. electricity consumption) also illustrates the ongoing importance of the federal system in the United States. State governments have considerable power over many kinds of energy use separate and distinct from the policies (or lack thereof) adopted by the national government. Some states, like California, have consistently demonstrated a desire to promote energy efficiency (through Energy Efficiency Resource Standards) and specific energy sources (as through Renewable Portfolio Standards) through state law; while other states have taken a more hands-off approach. Such differences result in significantly different levels of energy use and rates of deployment of specific energy practices.</p><p id="Par173">It should also be noted that state-level Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERSs) described above with respect to electricity consumption are also applied to natural gas consumption in 16 states (compared to 26 states for electricity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. As with electricity EERSs, natural gas EERSs are highest in New England states. Other state-level policies incentivize specific energy technologies (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels) and energy-use practices (e.g., carpooling) that have socially desirable outcomes.</p><p id="Par174">Federalism in the United States also provides challenges to the ongoing transition in electricity. Models of deep decarbonization of the electric power system require significant sharing (or “averaging”) of power generation and consumption over large geographic areas, which will only be possible with significant new transmission infrastructure. However, as noted in “<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Electricity regulation and markets</xref>” section, individual states can stop the construction of new transmission lines crossing their territory which do not directly benefit them. Federalism can thus both enable and slow energy transitions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Transportation</title><p id="Par175">Energy use in the transportation sector has undergone two modest transitions in the past decade; the use of biofuels which accounts for 5% of energy use in the transportation sector; and, an increase in new vehicle efficiency as a result of fuel economy standards. However, two emerging technologies, electric vehicles and autonomous driving vehicles may bring about much more profound transitions in the coming decades.</p><p id="Par176">The fundamental impact of electric vehicles will be to diversify energy sources for transportation to include all those used to generate electricity.</p><p id="Par177">Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and full battery electric vehicles (BEVs), accounted for slightly over 1% of new light vehicle sales in the United States in 2017 and 16% of electric vehicle sales worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. Electric vehicles are support by federal tax incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>] and state-level incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. The key metric for cost-effective electric vehicles is the cost of battery energy storage which has dropped from over $800/kWh in 2010 to approximately $200/kWh in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. Further cost declines to $100/kWh by 2025 are forecast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>].

The AEO2018 projects BEVs at 14% of total U.S. Vehicle Sales in 2050 and PHEVs to be 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. However, other estimates are higher.

Depending on the timing of electric vehicle charging and how electric vehicles are integrated into the grid, electric vehicles may both accelerate deployment of variable sources of electricity such as wind and solar and create additional demand for generating capacity using all fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>].</p><p id="Par180">Autonomous (self-driving) vehicles represent a micro-level transition in 2018 with research and development and prototype deployments primarily financed by private investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>] and policies oriented toward the future deployment of small fleets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. However, autonomous vehicles will move to a meso-scale transition in the next few years, with the deployment of taxi fleets in certain cities. At what point autonomous vehicles become a macro-level transition in transportation is a matter of much speculation and dependent on both technological and policies advances.</p><p id="Par181">The energy impact of autonomous vehicles is also difficult to predict. Autonomous vehicles may decrease energy consumption by increasing energy efficient driving; “platooning” vehicles to reduce air resistance; allowing weight reductions because of increased safety; and reducing weight by electrifying the powertrain. Alternatively, by reducing the cost of travel and increasing safety, autonomous vehicles may increase energy consumption by increasing travel; allowing higher speeds; increasing commuting distances; and, providing increased mobility to low-served communities such as the elderly and disabled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>]. Thus, autonomous vehicles may decrease or increase transportation energy use, making projections of future energy use in the transportation sector more uncertainty than in prior years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Primary and final energy use</title><p id="Par182">The current National Energy Modeling System projection (contained in AEO2018) of the total primary energy consumption of the United States in 2050 under the reference case of assumptions is 115 EJ, 12% higher than in 2017. Nearly all of that increase is projected to occur in the industrial sector with no change in the residential and transportation sectors and a modest 0.4% growth in the commercial sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par183">However, “reference case” assumptions for NEMS in prior years have projected higher energy use than experienced in most years. Fischer and colleagues, for example, reviewed NEMS projections from 1994 to 2006 and found “a fairly modest but persistent tendency to underestimate total energy demand by an average of 2% per year over the one- to five-year projection horizon after controlling for projection errors in gross domestic product, oil prices, and heating/cooling degree days” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. The tendency for NEMS projections to be higher than ultimately seen is rooted in the model’s treatment of several factors. Most significant is a business-as-usual policy assumption. NEMS does not recognize the future lowering of demand as the result of new energy efficiency policies such as more aggressive state-level Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERSs) and Renewable Portfolio Standards (which, as shown above impact the efficiency of electricity generation). The impacts of all efficiency gains grow in significance with longer-term projections. Additional factors that impact the accuracy of NEMS projections include projections of energy production and prices, fuel composition, and the impact of new technologies and their rate of deployment. All projections of future energy use must be understood in this context.</p><p id="Par184">If we assume that the projections in AEO2018 are 2% higher per year higher than the actual energy demand that occurs (that is a year with a projected 1% projected growth in TPE will have a 1% decline) primary energy demand in 2050 would be 29% lower than in 2017. This is not a forecast, but an observation about the considerable range of possible energy demand over the coming decades.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Emissions of greenhouse gases</title><p id="Par185">As part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United States submitted an Intended Nationally Determined Commitment (INDC) “to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%.. .. This target is consistent with a straight line emission reduction pathway from 2020 to deep, economy-wide emission reductions of 80% or more by 2050.

The electric power sector emissions, before allocation to end-use sectors is projected to be 29% lower than 2005 in 2025 and 26% lower in 2050. Thus, the AEO2018 projection shows the United States falling short of its INDC.
