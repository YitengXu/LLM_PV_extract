Herein, it is found for the first time mainly based on the time-resolved- and atmosphere-controlled- surface photovoltage responses that the modified chloride would effectively trap photogenerated holes so as to prolong the charge lifetime and hence promote charge separation of single-crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods. Its strong capacity to trap holes, comparable to the widely-used methanol and Co(II) phosphate, is well responsible for the exceptional photoactivities for PEC water oxidation to evolve O<sub>2</sub> on rutile nanorods with a proper amount of chloride modified, about 2.5-time high as that on the resulting anatase nanoparticles, even 10-time if the surface area is considered. Moreover, it is suggested that the hole trapping role of chemically-adsorbed chloride is related to its lonely-pair electrons, and to the subsequently-produced intermediate Cl atoms with proper electronegativity for evolving O<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, this finding is also applicable to the chloride-modified anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>. This work will provide a feasible strategy to design high-activity nanostructured semiconductor photoanodes for PEC water oxidation, even for overall water splitting.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep21430.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep21430" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep21430</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">To realize the potential benefits of solar energy as a renewable energy source, it is desirable to develop a method to efficiently convert and store solar energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Since the first report of water splitting by a single-crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode from Fujishima and Honda over 40 years ago, the photocatalytic water splitting has been of particular interest as it can be used to produce H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although the wide-bandgap TiO<sub>2</sub> can only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light, its photocatalytic properties have been widely studied as a model system due to its low cost, high stability and thermodynamically-proper valence/conduction band energy levels for water reduction and oxidation to respectively evolve H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Among the three confirmed polymorphs of TiO<sub>2</sub>, anatase phase is the most popular one, usually with good photocatalytic performance, which is mainly attributed to its large surface area. On the contrary, rutile phase is seldom investigated owing to its small surface area and hence low photocatalytic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This is because that the rutile phase is prepared via the traditional method of calcinating anatase crystallites with a high temperature (&gt;550 °C), in which the rutile phases begin to occur at the interfaces of the aggregated anatase nanoparticles and hence make the formed rutile greatly grow up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In fact, rutile phase possesses several advantages over anatase, such as high chemical stability, narrow band gap and high refractive index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This implies that rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> might have a great potential for utilizing solar energy if it has a large surface area, especially with single-crystal structure and rod-like morphology facilitating the charge transportation and separation.</p><p id="Par3">In addition, the low quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water splitting still greatly limits the wide use of TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This is usually attributed to the slow half-reaction processes between photogenerated holes and water molecules within s timescale, compared to the recombination processes of photogenerated electron-hole pairs within ~μs timescale. The slow reaction for O<sub>2</sub> evolution is also much slower than that for H<sub>2</sub> production within ~μs timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Naturally, it is widely accepted that the slow reaction process, with loss of 4e<sup>−</sup> and 4H<sup>+</sup> from two H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to evolve O<sub>2</sub>, is considered to be the rate-determining step for overall water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, it is highly desired to develop a feasible strategy to effectively trap the photogenerated hole to prolong its lifetime, and/or to simultaneously catalyze the water oxidation. As for this, cobalt-based co-catalysts have been well investigated for efficient PEC water oxidation on TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In those works, it has been clearly demonstrated that the modified Co species could trap photogenerated holes effectively to produce high-valence Co ions, further inducing oxidation reactions with water molecules and subsequently returning to the original-valence ones. Very recently, a metal-free carbon nanodot-carbon nitride nanocomposite with the impressive performance for photocatalytic water splitting has been successfully fabricated, in which the modified carbon nanodots could play important roles as co-catalysts for evolving O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our previous works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, it is clearly demonstrated that the formed surface negative fields after modification with phosphoric acids could prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges of nano-sized TiO<sub>2</sub> and BiVO<sub>4</sub> by trapping photogenerated holes, leading to the enhanced photoactivities for PEC water oxidation. It is evident that for overall water splitting, it is very necessary to promote the trapping of photogenerated holes much efficiently. Therefore, it is much significant to develop feasible strategies to effectively trap photogenerated holes.</p><p id="Par4">Since the photogenerated electrons and holes are respectively taken as negative and positive charge carriers, it is understandable that they would easily be trapped by the formed opposite electrostatic fields on the surfaces. Surprisingly, it is confirmed based on the transient absorption spectra that the surface carried positive charges have almost no effects on the charge carrier lifetime of nanocrystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> in pure water and its photocurrent density in the NaClO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte, indicating that it is not beneficial for water oxidation to trap the photogenerated electrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This is related to the point that the reactions between electrons and water molecules are faster compared to those between holes and water molecules. Similar to the formed surface negative field, it is expected thatthe surface anionic polarization by modifying with proper-electronegativity nonmetallic anions, like Cl<sup>−</sup>, would be favorable to trap photogenerated holes so as to prolong the charge carrier lifetime and hence to improve the activity of PEC water oxidation. In addition, it is worthy of noting that some biologists had found in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century that the chlorine species exhibited essential effects on the rate of oxygen evolution in the photosynthesis process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Naturally inspired, it is much interesting to confirm those assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, it has not been reported until now. Obviously, it would be of great significance from the scientific and engineering point of views in the photochemical energy conversion field.</p><p id="Par5">Based on the above analyses, we try to deeply reveal the effects of modified chloride on the photogenerated hole trapping, charge carrier lifetime, charge separation and photoactivities for PEC water oxidation to evolve O<sub>2</sub> on single-crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> as a model system, mainly by means of time-resolved- and atmosphere-controlled- surface photovoltage responses, especially in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Interestingly, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the modified chloride would effectively trap the photogenerated holes so as to prolong the charge lifetime and hence to promote the charge separation of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods, leading to the exceptional photoactivities for PEC water oxidation to evolve O<sub>2</sub>.

The XRD peaks at 2θ = 25.2° and 27.4° are often considered as the characteristic peaks of anatase (101) and rutile (110) phases, and the mass content percentage of rutile in two-phase-mixed TiO<sub>2</sub> can be evaluated from the integrated characteristic peak intensities by means of the quality factor ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It is noticed that the content percentage of rutile phase mainly depends on the concentration of HCl used, and it gradually become large with increasing the HCl amount. When the HCl concentration exceeds 2.0 M, the resultant product is only rutile phase TiO<sub>2</sub>. This is in good agreement with the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S1B</xref>). Meanwhile, it is noticed that the specific surface area of the resulting TiO<sub>2</sub> greatly decreases from 180 (pure anatase) to 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g (pure rutile). It should be pointed out that the obtained surface area of rutile is rather larger compared to that (generally &lt;5 m<sup>2</sup>/g) of rutile prepared by traditionally calcining anatase nanoparticles. According to the TEM image (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> inset), the obtained rutile nanoparticles display rod-like morphology, with ~20 nm in width and ~60 nm in length, and from the HRTEM (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), it is confirmed that the obtained rutile nanorod exhibits a single-crystal structure. Thus, it is naturally expected that the rutile phase composition, large surface area and nanorod structure of the as-prepared TiO<sub>2</sub> are much beneficial for efficient photocatalytic reactions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Rutile contents, tested BET surface areas, and residual Cl atom contents of different TiO<sub>2</sub> samples prepared by varying the concentration of HCl solution used from 0 to 3.0 M (<bold>A</bold>), HRTEM image (<bold>B</bold>) and TEM image (<bold>B</bold> inset) of T2.5.

The XPS spectra of O1s are broad and asymmetric, implying that there exists at least two kinds of oxygen chemical states, including crystal lattice oxygen (O<sub>L</sub>) centering at 529.5 eV and hydroxyl (O<sub>H</sub>) one centering at 531.5 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The XPS peak at 197.8 eV is mainly assigned to the chemically-adsorbed chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>) on the surfaces, and the amount of adsorbed chloride is increased as the rutile phase is gradually formed (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Based on the chemical shift toward the higher binding energy of Ti2p, it is deduced that the chemically-adsorbed chloride on the surfaces is present in the form of –Ti-Cl by substituting surface hydroxyl groups. This well agrees with the point that the modified chloride by linking with Ti induces the direct formation of rutile in the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, the modified chloride would influence the surface physiochemical properties of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, from the EDX spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S1C</xref>), one can see that the chlorine exists in the T2.5 sample.</p><p id="Par8">To investigate the photogenerated charge properties of as-prepared TiO<sub>2</sub>, the steady-state surface photovoltage spectra (SS-SPS) and the time-resolved surface photovoltage (TR-SPV) responses are measured in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. It is well known that the SPS responses of nanosized semiconductor oxides mainly arise from the photoinduced charge carrier separation via the diffusion process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Generally speaking, no SPS response for anatase or rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> can be detected in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere since there is no any acceptor or donor species so that the surface charge amount before and after irradiation is unchanged. However, an obvious SPS signal can be detected in O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere due to the adsorbed O<sub>2</sub> as the acceptors to trap photogenerated electrons. Differently, the as-prepared TiO<sub>2</sub> displays the gradually-enhanced SS-SPS responses in N<sub>2</sub> with increasing the rutile phase content (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and the complete rutile phase TiO<sub>2</sub> (T2.5) exhibits the strongest SS-SPS response. Obviously, the observed SPS intensity mainly depends on the amount of modified chloride on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces. In the case, the adsorbed chloride would act as donators to trap the photogenerated holes so as to make corresponding electrons diffuse preferentially to the testing electrode surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, if the residual-chloride amount is too much, it would be unfavorable for the surface charge transportation. As a result, the SS-SPS response tends to decrease, like T3.0 sample. More important, it is observed from <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> that all the rutile-containing TiO<sub>2</sub> samples exhibit negative TR-SPV responses under laser pulse irradiation with wavelength 355 nm. This further confirms the role of modified chloride for trapping photogenerated holes. And also, the negative TR-SPV responseis gradually enhanced as the amount of modified Cl<sup>−</sup> increased, with the prolonged charge lifetime, especially for the T2.5 sample. This is well consistent with the SS-SPS results.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SS-SPS (<bold>A</bold>) and TR-SPV (<bold>B</bold>) responses of different TiO<sub>2</sub> samples in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep21430_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Based on the above analyses on the enhanced SPS/SPV responses, it is deduced that the modified chloride would effectively trap photogenerated holes so as to promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, it is anticipated that the Cl-modified rutile nanorods would exhibit high photoactivities for PEC water oxidation. For this, we have also prepared the corresponding TiO<sub>2</sub> films on the FTO glass substrates. Based on the XRD patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S3A</xref>), it is confirmed that the phase composition of resulting TiO<sub>2</sub> keeps unchanged. As expected, one can see from the SEM micrographs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S3B</xref>) that the anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> without Cl exhibits a spherical form with about 10 nm size, while the rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> (T2.5) does a nanorod morphology, with the thickness of about 500 nm. As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, it is noticed that no current is observed at the applied bias below 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl standard electrode for all nano-sized TiO<sub>2</sub> films. Interestingly, the photocurrent density is gradually increased as the rutile content (or the modified Cl amount) become large, and the rutile nanorod exhibits an exceptional photocurrent density. It is worthy of noting that the photocurrent density of T2.5 sample is enhanced by 2.5 times at 0.8 V bias compared to that of anatase one, accordingly being &gt;10 folds if the surface area is considered. This is further supported by the amount of evolved O<sub>2</sub> in the PEC water oxidation (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Obviously, the photoactivity for PEC water oxidation to produce O<sub>2</sub> is in good agreement with the SS-SPS (or TR-SPV) response intensity. In general, hydroxyl radical (·OH) is usually taken as the intermediate products for O<sub>2</sub> evolution, and it is measured by the widely-used coumarin fluorescent method, in which the introduced coumarin easily reacts with ·OH to produce luminescent 7-hydroxycoumarin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. One can see from the inset in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> that, as the amount of modified chloride is increased, the FS intensity related linearly to the amount of formed ·OH gradually become large, and that for T2.5 is the largest. However, over excess amount of modified Cl<sup>−</sup> is unfavorable for further increase in the formed ·OH radicals, as for T3.0. This is well consistent with the evolved O<sub>2</sub> amount.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>I–V curves (<bold>A</bold>) and produced O<sub>2</sub> amount (<bold>B</bold>) of different TiO<sub>2</sub> samples under illumination (solid-line) and in the dark (dash-line).

Thus, a possible mechanism schematic closely related to the modified-Cl role for PEC water oxidation is depicted in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. As for this schematic, the modified chloride is firmly fixed on the surfaces in the form of [−Cl<sup>−</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, so as to trap photogenerated holes to form the Cl atoms [−Cl·H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>] as fixed radicals (step 1). Then, the formed Cl atoms oxidize the complex water molecules to produce ·OH (step 2), subsequently followed by O<sub>2</sub> evolution, meanwhile changing to the anionic state [−Cl<sup>−</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x−n</sub>]. Finally, it would return to its original form, [−Cl<sup>−</sup><bold>·</bold>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>] by coordinating water molecules (step 3). Differently from Cl modification, the improved photocatalytic performance of TiO<sub>2</sub> by modification with F<sup>−</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> mainly depends on the formed negative electric field, which could induce positive holes so as to promote photogenerated charge separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

This indicates that the observed large photocurrent is not correlated with the used electrolyte, and the modified chloride is fixed stably on the surfaces of TiO<sub>2</sub>. We have also synthesized the single-phase rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> (called T0–800) by calcining the nanocrystalline anatase (T0) at 800 °C according to the XRD patterns(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S5A</xref>). As expected, no SS-SPS response for resulting T0-800 is observed in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S5B</xref>), indicating that there are no donators to trap the photogenerated holes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This leads to the rather small photocurrent density of T0-800 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S5C</xref>), as compared to T0. Moreover, after post treating by a hydrothermal process at 160 °C for 2 h, the rutile crystallinity of T2.5 sample keeps almost unchanged, while the chemically-adsorbed chloride on the surfaces is mostly removed, denoted as T2.5-Cl-free, as shown in the XRD patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S6A</xref>) and Cl2p XPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S6B</xref>). Differently from T2.5, the T2.5-Cl-free sample does not exhibit a detected SS-SPS response in N<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S6C</xref>). This is reasonably responsible for the greatly-decreased photocurrent density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S6D</xref>). Obviously, it is clearly confirmed based on the above-designed experiments that the modified chloride is vital for greatly trapping photogenerated holes and hence for efficient water oxidation to evolve O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par12">Thermodynamically, it is easily understandable that the photogenerated holes on TiO<sub>2</sub> are trapped by the adsorbed chloride to accordingly form atomic Cl with proper electronegativity, which possesses enough capacity to oxidize water. In our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, it was suggested that the borate groups could be modified on the surfaces of Cl-adsorbed rutile nanorods via the coordination bonds between lonely-pair-electron Cl and orbit-unoccupied B based on the XPS measurements, leading to the promotion of O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and then photocatalytic activity for degrading colorless pollutants. Surprisingly, although the rutile phase keeps unchanged after borate modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S7A</xref>), the SPS attributeis changed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S7B</xref>), to say that an obvious SPS response is disappeared in N<sub>2</sub>. Consequently, the photoactivity for PEC water oxidation is markedly decreased as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S7C</xref>. Therefore, it is concluded that the lonely-pair electrons at the modified chloride is necessary conditions to trap photogenerated holes.</p><p id="Par13">To further prove the above-mentioned roles of modified chloride, we have also carried out the chloride modification to the anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> (T0), obtained as T0-XCl, by a hydrothermal process at 160 °C for 6 h in the presence of different concentration of NaCl solution. From the XRD patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S8A</xref>) and UV-vis DRS spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S8B</xref>), it can be seen that the chloride modification does not change the crystal phase and crystallinity of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>. The XPS spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S8C</xref>) indicate that the amount of modified chloride becomes large with increasing the NaCl concentration. As expected, the SS-SPS responses for different T0-Cl samples could be detected in N<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S8D</xref>), and its intensity is dependent on the amount of modified chloride. This is responsible for the enhanced photoactivity of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> for PEC water oxidation to evolve O<sub>2</sub> after a proper amount of chloride modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S8E,F</xref>). Therefore, it is further demonstrated that the modified chloride exhibits great effects on hole trapping, charge separation and water oxidation.</p><p id="Par14">Since that is the case about the role of modified chloride, it is expected that the presence of Cl<sup>−</sup> would have positive effects on the photocurrent of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S9A</xref>, the photocurrent density in the NaCl-containing electrolyte is significantly increased, which is naturally attributed to the adsorbed Cl<sup>−</sup>. This is in agreement with Li’s and Iguchi’s works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, in which it was demonstrated that the activities for photocatalytic water splitting and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the presence of Cl<sup>−</sup> were enhanced by the formed intermediate product of HClO, while the roles for effectively trapping photogenerated holes by the adsorbed chloride were neglected. However, it should be pointed that no oxygen evolution is observed(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S9B</xref>). By comparison, it is suggested that the firmly-modified chloride on the surfaces of rutile nanorods is much favorable to form the intermediate ·OH, different from the formed intermediate HClO.</p><p id="Par15">Based on the above discussion, it is believable that the modified chloride could effectively trap the photogenerated holes so as to promote the charge separation of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>. To reflect its capacityto trap photogenerated holes, we have completed two confirmatory tests. Firstly, a certain concentration of methanol, often used as the hole scavenger, is introduced into the electrolyte during the PEC measurements of T2.5-Cl-free. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S10</xref>, the chloride-modified T2.5 exhibits the nearly same capacity to trap holes as the T2.5-Cl-free in the 0.01M methanol electrolyte. Secondly, we have taken the widely-employed cobalt (II) phosphate to modify T2.5-Cl-free as a ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Interestingly, it is confirmed according to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S11A</xref>, that the photocurrent of T2.5 is higher than that of the cobalt (II) phosphate-modified T2.5-Cl-free. Thus, it is evident that the capacity of modified chloride on rutile nanorods to trap photogenerated hole is rather high. For further comparison, we calculated the photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values of T0 and T2.5 using our PEC system under 365 nm wavelength illumination at bias of 0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM93">Figure S11B</xref>). The result shows that the IPCE of T2.5 is 2.5-time larger than that of T0.</p><p id="Par16">In summary, it is concluded that the modified chloride on the surfaces of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods could effectively trap photogenerated holes so as to promote the charge separation, leading to the exceptional photoactivities for PEC water oxidation to evolve O<sub>2</sub>. Its capacity to trap holes is comparable to the widely-employed methanol and Co(II) phosphate. The key of modified chloride is its lonely-pair electrons for trapping holes and its firm immobilization for keeping stable to form the intermediate Cl atoms and then ·OH groups for O<sub>2</sub> evolution. This work would help to deeply understand the photophysical processes, and provide a feasible strategy to improve the photoactivities for efficient water oxidation on semiconductors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of materials</title><p id="Par17">For the synthesis of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>, the precursor (Tetrabutyl titanate) was added dropwise to a preferred concentration of HCl solution, kept in an ice bath, while maintaining the temperature below 10 °C.
