Cybernetic adaptation is now recognised as a cornerstone of biological and technological evolution and as well as of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognition. It is expected that chemical evolution, preceding biological evolution, will have a cybernetic explanation as well. Among all evolutions, only AI evolutionary computation and cognition are accessible via the scientific method. For biological and technological evolutions, we only have the example of one, while for chemical evolution we have no template at all. The aim of this essay is to look for commonalities in all evolutions and attempt to fill in the missing pieces of the chemical and technological evolutions with knowledge that can be obtained by observing evolutions with a complete record. Types of information – quantum, chemical and functional – are defined, and their roles explained. It is proposed that the temporal survivability of information should be considered as a factor of general evolutionary fitness for all evolutionary adaptations. This study further suggests that because all experimentation spaces are finite they may become exhausted due to convergence towards optimal configurations. Such exhaustion of important experimental areas might reflect the observed decay of technological innovation and economic growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chemical evolution</kwd><kwd>Biological evolution</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd><kwd>Innovation</kwd><kwd>Exergy</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary cybernetics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40322_2017_Article_41.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth System Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biogeosciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Epidemiology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biodiversity</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>SC7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Invention is a search result that endures over a space of combinatorial possibilities, while innovation involves the replication and diffusion of inventions. Inventors have explored and tested potential ideas that might become inventions, which were subsequently retested on the market as replicated products and services (Kell and Lurie-Luke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>). Scientists have long observed that technological innovation closely resembles biological evolution (Nelson and Winter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1982</xref>); moreover, ideas based on evolution have been introduced into computational artificial intelligence (AI) (Forrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1993</xref>; Koza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1999</xref>). AI, technological development, and evolution can all be considered creative processes within the universal Darwinism proposed by R. Dawkins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1983</xref>). These processes all generate, process, and test information for fitness (Bedau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>). When tested, this information faces oblivion. If identified as unfit, this information will eventually be forgotten and erased. Surviving information presents a new addition to the combinatorial space for further improvements, where experimentation provides for information reuse.</p><p id="Par3">Currently, it is not well understood how these informational processes work in nature (Bedau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>). In particular, biology has not been able to adequately explain early evolution (Yockey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2005</xref>), where the period of prebiotic, chemical evolution is of particular interest. It is a prolific view that chaotic dissipative processes with observable criticality or known self-assembly or self-organising processes might have somehow played a part in chemical evolution. Abel and Trevors (Abel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>) brought this view into question by pointing out the simple fact that entropy-generating dissipative processes destroy information and leave none behind after the driving force is removed. This is in stark contrast to processes of life where information is built up and even left behind after the driving force is removed. Abel and Trevors postulate that the origin of life must be cybernetic. The aim of this study is to provide sought cybernetic view of the processes of life through the description of inventive processes in nature.</p><p id="Par4">Thermal disequilibrium is known to play a role in life processes. Its precise role from a cybernetics standpoint is to generate physical information. Christopher Jarzynski pioneered this field, which today is a prolific branch of physics called fluctuation theorems (Jarzynski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>). The conversion of energy into physical information, combined with exploration processes from evolution and AI sciences, provides a plausible explanation for early inventive processes in nature (Ruelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>). Evolution and technological development likely evolved through stages of increasingly evolved exploration and exploitation mechanisms (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A ‘noisy search’ is proposed here as a mainstay of all exploration processes in nature. This process incorporates physical information generated or distorted by thermal disequilibrium noise into experiments within the environment. Therein, unfit information is lost through naturally present entropy-increasing events, and the remaining information becomes invention. Among the three currently recognised requirements for natural selection – variation, fitness differences, and replication with heredity (Griffiths and Gray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>) — variation and fitness evaluation are fundamental. With the addition of energy disequilibrium as an information generator and mechanisms for information addition and diffusion, variation and fitness evaluation are sufficient for evolution to continue. The mechanism for information addition provides for the adaptation of biological and technological complexity. Such a view enables the question of primordial plausibility in the search for the origin of life to be overcome as it relies on informational mechanics rather than the exact chemical pathway, which may never be known. This change of view is significant and requires some time to be accepted by a reader used to dealing with specific chemicals.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Innovation milestones throughout the evolution of the Earth</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Physical information representation</p></th><th><p>Small organics</p></th><th><p>Polymers</p></th><th><p>RNA</p></th><th><p>DNA</p></th><th><p>DNA, neural, technological</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Algorithm:</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Exploration method,</p><p>Far search</p></td><td><p>Molecular noisy search</p></td><td><p>Molecular noisy search</p></td><td><p>Molecular noisy search, high frequency mutations</p></td><td><p>Low frequency mutations</p></td><td><p>Neural experimentation through neural noisy search, numerical mutation operators in AI</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Exploitation method,</p><p>Near search</p></td><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>Information addition (polymerisation), horizontal chemical information exchange</p></td><td><p>Old information addition (polymerisation)</p><p>+ horizontal gene transfer</p></td><td><p>Old information addition (polymerisation)</p><p>+ horizontal gene transfer + sexual information crossover</p></td><td><p>Thought experimentation, numerical crossover in AI</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Invention diffusion method</p></td><td><p>Diffusion in liquid solvent</p></td><td><p>Parallel chemistry, solvent diffusion</p></td><td><p>Replication, solvent diffusion</p></td><td><p>Replication by heredity, solvent diffusion</p></td><td><p>Offspring,</p><p>industrially manufactured copies</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dominant exergy source</p></td><td><p>Radiation (UV) + planetary dynamics</p></td><td><p>UV + some metabolic</p></td><td><p>UV + metabolic</p></td><td><p>UV + visible + metabolic</p></td><td><p>Metabolic (+ nuclear, solar…)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>From left to right, small organics primarily based on solar ultraviolet (UV) light and thermal noise are the first carriers of information concerning the first experimental outcomes. The next process, where previously stored information is added in small molecules, involves polymerisation or elongation. RNA is the next major evolutionary step in the information selection method. RNA facilitates horizontal gene transfer and replicates to diffuse information. After the appearance of metabolism, inventions tended to be oriented towards an increasingly elaborated protection schema. A great advance in horizontal information exchange was gained by the invention of sexual DNA reproduction by the systematic crossing of previously known inventions at reduced mutation rates and provided a mechanism against deleterious mutation accumulation (enabling reduced mutations). Moreover, within intelligent, neural beings, inventive processes have arguably ascended to another level, much more advanced than the solely genetic level, into a higher realm of thought experimentation. In humans, perhaps we see an even higher level evolved, that of consciously directed thought experiments</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Inventive processes: the two pillars</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pillar 1: Information origin</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Three levels of information: quantum, chemical, and functional</title><p id="Par5">Quantum information is thought to be universally conserved. A quantum of energy can only be transferred forward (Samal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2011</xref>). A system about which nothing can be said contains no information. Three distinct levels of information can be identified regarding other systems. A paper document, a genome, and an optical cable, for example, carry functional information (Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">1973</xref>; Landauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1996</xref>; Jablonka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2002</xref>) relative to those who can evaluate it. Anything is a source of <italic>functional</italic> information if it has a range of possible states, and one variable carries information about another to the extent that their states are physically correlated (Godfrey-Smith and Sterelny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>). At a step lower, there is information on the paper’s chemical and physical configuration represented by free energy or configuration entropy. At an additional level lower, there is quantum information regarding the underlying energy quanta and their arrangements (Zeilinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2005</xref>). Information on the chemical configuration of the paper ‘is encoded’ as numerous metastable chemical states relative to the world in which the paper exists (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Here, ‘world’ should be viewed as an intuitive thermodynamic abstraction defining the planetary-scale chemical composition at reference levels of temperature and pressure. For example, if we burn a sheet of paper in such a world, and the ash and gaseous products further decay, then all the information concerning the chemical composition of the paper will eventually be degraded into quantum thermal noise and irradiated into the universe as heat. Chemically-encoded information is diverse and considered to be everything that is not in a state of maximum entropy in the world. Such information might include the chemical composition of various materials, such as amino acids, sugars, organic membranes, and bones, and the chemical structure of a light-emitting diode, a fuel injector, and other entities. Occupants of the world can use such objects of chemically encoded information to store the highest-level functional information. Thus, we should consider quantum information to be absolute, information in a chemical configuration is relative to its world, and functional information is relative to those to whom it is readable (Jablonka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2002</xref>). For example, imagine that one delivers a written paper document to a highly evolved species in an alien Earth-like world. Those aliens would not be able to read the functional information in the writing on the document, but would be able to decipher the molecular structure of the paper.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The metastable state as a perishable chemical information repository. The metastable state of elevated potential energy remains that way, at least for a while, and requires some perturbation for the return to a low, stable state. An external energy push is needed for potential energy to return to an elevated metastable state. In the case of ordinary matter, information can only be ‘written’ in a sequence of quantum energy jolts, pushing matter into reconfigured metastable states. The matter of ordinary atoms is an elementary medium in which chemically-encoded information can be stored in metastable bonds. Gibbs free energy, <italic>G</italic>, is the chemical potential with primary usefulness in recognising the chemical (meta)stability points and the spontaneous flow of the chemical reactions. The standard Gibbs potential is defined for a standardised state of chemical elements, which is typically well above the lowest energy state when such elements react in an environmental mixture. Exergy, <italic>E</italic>, essentially defined as the Gibbs potential (<italic>ΔE = ΔG</italic>), has the advantage of having its state of <italic>E = 0</italic> defined precisely at equilibrium with the environment. Matter free of any chemically encoded information at a given temperature is in a state of maximum entropy. The lowest potential energy state is stable and in total equilibrium with the environment. Therefore, ‘writing’ is the delivery of energy in a manner such that after the writing is completed, the metastable chemicals of the writing are identified, and local entropy decreases as a consequence of the configuration of chemical ordering. The exergy of a system represents its chemical (physical) information state</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40322_2017_41_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Origin and loss of chemical information</title><p id="Par6">If an imaginary world without an energy source remained untouched at constant temperature <italic>T</italic>, eventually all of the local disequilibrium would disappear and all metastable states would empty, reflecting spontaneous thermal decay. This world would reach a state of maximum entropy, i.e., Boltzmann’s ‘heat death’<italic>.</italic> Here, we consider a thought experiment using such a ‘dead’ world with a composition capable of covalent and ionic chemical bonding. Before the ultraviolet band (UV) pulse irradiates the imaginary world, there is uncertainty concerning which molecules would form and remain preserved. This uncertainty represents the missing information prior to the experiment. After the UV pulse irradiates the planet, the remaining photochemically synthesised metastable molecules (Ranjan and Sasselov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>) remove this uncertainty by holding experimental outcome information. These newly synthesised, metastable molecules decay unevenly, depending on the molecular structure and local environmental conditions. These molecular decay times vary vastly among different molecules. For example, metastable organics might have aqueous solution half-lives that range from minutes to billions of years (Lazcano and Miller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1996</xref>). If these molecules were left to decay indefinitely, then the imaginary planet would slowly return to its original ‘heat death’ state. Should the UV source be reignited prior to the return of the planet to the dead state, more complicated molecules would form based on those preserved from the previous experiment. This chemical information build-up, without intent or purpose, reflects natural experimentation, where natural selection facilitates the reuse of molecules that survive environmental stress.</p><p id="Par7">Thermal molecular jiggling (spontaneous erase), photon absorption (photolysis), or bindings with other molecules can erase the information in a metastable chemical (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This latter process is common in metabolic reactions where the partial loss of previously stored chemical energy occurs. In all of these cases, chemical (or physical) potential energy dissipates into low-level thermal quantum information, which eventually diffuses out of the world and into the colder universe as heat through an increase in entropy. The irradiation of the quantum ‘ash’ of the ‘dead’ information into the universe makes such information irrecoverably lost to the world.</p><p id="Par8">Chemical information storage is proportional to the temperature of the local environment. A substantial increase in temperature would result in the massive decomposition of stored information. Increasing the temperature of our fictional paper message would induce decomposition. This is true for all biological, organic material and any other material used in industrial manufacturing processes. In contrast, decreased temperature increases the survivability of chemical and functional information and enables the storage of more functional information in the same chemicals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Origin and loss of functional information</title><p id="Par9">In his brilliant analysis of Maxwell’s demon, L. Szilárd (Szilárd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1929</xref>) proposed that the possession of functional information might have thermodynamic consequences. It was shown by (Brillouin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1953</xref>; Bennett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1982</xref>) and (Toyabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2010</xref>) that chemically (or physically) storing functional information bit value requires at least <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> ln(2) of thermodynamic work, where <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann’s constant and <italic>T</italic> is the environmental temperature. This thermodynamic work represents the energy needed to instil information into matter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, it takes a jolt of energy of at least <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> ln(2) to store one functional bit of information chemically or physically into a metastable state, where ‘physically’ refers to information storage by means of metastable physical mechanisms such as those in electronic computers.</p><p id="Par10">Functional information written over a chemical information base has been recognised in information theories, texts, digital computers, genomes, and other arenas. Functional information emerges as a result of a noisy search on the level of chemical evolution, as will be explained in the section of this study dealing with the emergence of functionality. When functional information emerges, it can be refined by higher-level experimentation such as conducted by sentient beings or on the level of biological functional information by Darwinian evolution. The erasure or ‘death’ of such functional information, the cornerstone of Darwinian natural selection, is viewed in terms of the Landauer principle (Landauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1961</xref>; Bérut et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>), where any loss of functional information results in the conversion of some free energy into heat and in a corresponding increase in thermodynamic entropy.</p><p id="Par11">Because any functional message can be written in more bits than the minimum necessary, a functional bit of information can be chemically encoded in multiples of <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> ln(2) to achieve better message survivability and reading resolution. In the metaphorical message on paper, increasing chemical information bits would mean the use of thicker, more rugged paper and thicker writing ink. When considering the messaging efficiency, multiples of <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> ln(2), required for encoding functional information, are as close as possible to a value of one. Example of such tightly optimised functional encodings include digital data communication devices.</p><p id="Par12">The thermodynamic-entropy-like mathematical tool called Shannon entropy (Shannon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1948</xref>) should not be confused with thermodynamic entropy, which reflects the chemical or physical configuration at one level lower. Indeed, the relation between the two entropies becomes less clear in a limiting case, where an information bit of encoded functional information approaches the <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> ln(2) limit. The two entropies probably converge in such a limiting case.</p><p id="Par13">For instance, the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) bacteria is thought to contain 0.6 MB of specific genetic functional information (Blattner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1997</xref>), while the entire <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterium contains up to 20 GB of discoverable chemical information calculated after (Morowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1955</xref>). Both forms of information are readable to us. Genetic information can be measured in terms of Shannon entropy, and this information represents white paper written instructions for the functioning of <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p id="Par14">As the information of quantum systems is not originated and cannot be destroyed, the natural selection mechanisms must be classical. <bold>The proposition of information ‘death’ is essential for natural experimentation and fitness selection.</bold> The chemically metastable exergy stored in the world can be viewed as an experimental information repository available to nature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exergy as chemical information potential</title><p id="Par15">Engineers, and recently economists (Warr and Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>), have recognised the advantageous treatment of energy conversion into thermodynamic work through exergy. Chemical exergy, introduced by (Rant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1956</xref>), is defined as the maximum work obtained when the considered system is brought into a stable reaction with reference substances present in the environment at its reference pressure and temperature. The beauty of using exergy theory lies in the fact that the chemically stored exergy in the world also represents stored chemical information potential (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). If we return to the thought experiment with the imaginary world irradiated with UV light, we can conclude that photochemically-generated metastable molecules represent increases in free energy, exergy, and chemical information. All these notions are equivalent. As UV light can be converted into thermodynamic work, this energy can also be considered as an exergy source. The UV light of the stars in the universe carries low-thermodynamic-entropy quantum information to worlds, where this information is partially converted into stored chemical information or chemical exergy. Thus, stars are exergy sources for feeding chemical exergy to worlds (Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pillar 2: Exploration mechanisms</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>A noisy search through cybernetic exploration and exploitation</title><sec><p id="Par16">In biological theory, functional information is sometimes regarded in terms of noisy information channels, where certain specific, genetic information is communicated relative to processes in the organism (Yockey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2005</xref>). Newer approaches, however, depart from this view, as genetic information is somewhat less specific than originally thought (Longo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>). The exploration ‘decision’ processes at an intracellular level depend on noise for input (Balazsi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>). (Tyagi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>) elegantly explained this notion using <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Experiences in the field of AI (Koza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1999</xref>; Traulsena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2009</xref>) and biological evolution (Balazsi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>; Tyagi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>) have shown us that the initial exploration and exploration beyond the known range requires distortion or mutation of the information. A noisy search is conducted in nature with chemical and functional information. This noise makes biological information less specific and thus ensures the necessary variation. Noise sources comprise thermal molecular jiggling, radiation noise for chemical experimentation, or visual and audible noise (Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>) input that sentient beings receive, or any other form of natural noise capable of influencing an evolutionary search.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par18">Exploration and exploitation are two distinct search mechanisms in evolutionary optimisation algorithms. Now, do not let the word ‘algorithm’ sway you into thinking that these processes are somehow isolated to something done with computers. Quite the opposite. These mechanisms were first identified by evolutionary biologists soon after the genetic mechanisms of evolution were discovered. Even before these mechanisms morphed into digital computers in the 1990s, from the 1950s to 1980s economists increasingly realised that technological development resembles that of biological evolution and the terms “exploration and exploitation” were first proposed in the economics of innovation in technology (March <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p id="Par19">Let us return to the 1950s. Geneticists realised that information contained in genes was now and then modified by mutations which caused the appearance of new modifications of life. Usually, a new variation of simple life has a low chance of survival and the chance that this new entity has a fitness improvement over the previously known inventions of nature is very small indeed. Mutations generate changes that can reach any combination from the combinatorial space. This makes the probability that a mutation search point ends up near an existing solution remote. Therefore, a mutation-based exploratory search is also referred to as a far search. This far search does not need any previous knowledge. Exploration thus boldly goes into the unknown. If the new solution has at least sufficient fitness, its information will remain preserved. If not, it will be deleted.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par20">It took until the 1993 work of Hilario and Gogarten (Hilario and Gogarten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993</xref>) before the horizontal gene transfer of complex life became understood. Genetic information crossover in sexual reproduction was of course known beforehand, but was poorly understood. Its function in protecting the genetic material was quickly recognised; <bold>its function in the execution of an exploitation evolutionary search</bold> became clearer after Hilario and Gogarten’s work was combined with the experiences of the in-silico computational experimentation with evolutionary search algorithms that became widespread in the 1990s. Nature invented numerous ways to exchange these complete segments of prior knowledge. The best known is sexual reproduction, where the genetic material of relatives is transferred. In this way, the offspring would have a high chance of survival and changes to the phenotype would be small, incremental, and seemingly continuous. This is an exploitation near search. Exploitation is capable of a limited far search as horizontal gene transfer can be achieved in nonsexual ways that overcome the safeguards of sexuality, but these events are rare. Nevertheless, even this exploitation far search is limited to the knowledge range previously identified by exploration. It cannot extend beyond it.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Why is an exploitation search so much more advantageous than an exploratory far search?</title><p id="Par21">A mutation search might yield an improved solution in one in a million, for example. An exploitation search through information crossover might yield an improvement in just one in ten trials (Doerr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). And nearly all subjects survive. The advantage increase might not be as radical as would be achieved in a far search, but to beat competitors it is sufficient if you are 5% more fit. There is no need to be 300% more fit to win the local struggle for evolutionary fitness.</p><p id="Par22">And indeed, genetic mutation rates in biological evolution first decreased when evolution moved from RNA to DNA and later again when sexual crossover was introduced (Drake et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>). Changes to mutation rates were several orders of magnitude per transition. This inevitably means that exploratory far searches were pushed aside and replaced by more productive near searches (Szabó et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2002</xref>), which gave the fundamentally discontinuous biological evolution an appearance of gradual change.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>What about cognition, technology, and AI?</title><p id="Par23">All of them have been identified as employing exploration and exploitation principles when dealing with information and optimisation/adaptation. Human inventive thinking (Campbell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1960</xref>) had been associated with an evolution-like process even before C. Darwin published his famous book on evolution. As early as 1855, A. Bain (Bain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1855</xref>) discussed trial-and-error thinking as part of the human intellect. Cognition in humans obeys the principles described above. When a child is born, it possesses little prior knowledge. A newborn child starts a noisy search. He or she makes random-like experimental movements, which the child evaluates and thus slowly builds knowledge in his or her neural network. Later in life, we also store highly abstract knowledge that originates in experimentation. Prior knowledge is again used thorough exploitation.

In general, EA is used in various applications where a previously unknown solution to a problem must be located within a predefined exploration space.

Competitors must add similar properties, thereby also increasing complexity. Once a high level of complexity is attained, complexity adaptation must be considered; a decrease in complexity may become advantageous. For example, jet engine complexity decreased over the years to improve efficiency and reliability (Koff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). Polymerisation is a mechanism of chemical information addition (Andrieux and Gaspard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>) and experimental complexity build-up (Joyce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2002</xref>; Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012</xref>) in chemical evolution.

In general, functionality emerges as a consequence of a noisy search where unfit (those with short decomposition times) polymerisation attempts perish and selected configurations with functions that aid survivability, such as resistance to UV radiation or resistance to thermal or hydrolytic decomposition, remain. Such informational polymers are expected to have configurations that are non-random and can thus be associated with a configurational component that is recognised as biological functional information, as explained by (Yockey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2005</xref>) in Chapter 6.</p><p id="Par27">These information addition processes take advantage of horizontal information exchange, which when genes become available is considered to be horizontal gene transfer (Hilario and Gogarten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993</xref>; Woese <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2002</xref>; Arnoldt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>).

However, the greater importance of the MU experiment might lie elsewhere. The MU experiment generated a small-scale natural experimentation model involving both exploration search and chemical information addition through polymerisation. Chemical information addition generated high-molecular-weight tholins at the bottom of the experimental flask. These tholins represent the point of experimental exhaustion. Prolonged experimentation did not influence the outcome, as heavy molecules excluded themselves from further experiments by accumulating away from the exergy source. In this case, reduced diffusion of chemical information through over-polymerisation exhausted the experimentation process. Unrestricted polymerisation is a problem requiring further consideration, as overcoming this obstacle on early Earth might have been a decisive pathway for further chemical evolution into individual entities rather than a giant polymerised rubbery blob, which could have formed instead. For evolution to produce several cooperating or competing agents, there must be a naturally present condition that limits polymer overgrowth (Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012</xref>). The MU experiment showed another profound property of nature: <bold>nature can conduct inventive experimentation, a form of natural selection, without heredity and/or self-replication</bold>. Experiments are conducted in parallel with the direct production of experimental chemicals without the need to replicate these materials from a template. In the MU experiment, a sparking source induced gaseous components to excite, ionise, and subsequently decay. Excited and ionised components primarily relaxed and recombined, but while in an excited state, some components bond to other neighbouring molecules. The end-results only showed chemical products with decay times long enough to survive until a human observer evaluated them.</p><p id="Par30">An experiment to test for the presence of bioinformation (i.e., functional information) in tholins can be devised.

All experimental spaces and sub-spaces are finite with finite maximum configurable or discoverable (when previously configured) information. Thus, experimentation can reach an exhaustive point at which the results diminish to small refinements. If the experimental space is at least quasi-static, the experimental process would eventually uncover the entire experimental space and store information concerning accessible yet unrefined inventions.

If mere geothermal disequilibrium under a solid crust were sufficient, then we would have observed signs of evolved natural experimentation beneath the Earth’s crust. There, observed from the standpoint of chemical evolution, polymerised glassy volcanic minerals, such as obsidian, are the most evolved metastable structures (Zotov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2003</xref>).

Until 1900, searches were predominantly exploratory far searches, as discovery-level inventions were accumulated. Examples of discovery-level inventions include fire, electric power, wire and wireless messaging, fossil fuel power, pharmaceuticals, and many others. By approximately the year 1900, enough of these far-search points had been accumulated that it became clear that the refinement thereof through systematic research could be more advantageous. Surely it was evident that improvements to the automobile made more sense than exploring for an entirely alternate mode of transportation. Improvement of existing ideas seems to be the way to go. This is how exploitation slowly replaced exploration in technology.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>We, humans, evaluate technological inventions through our own evolutionary fitness.</bold> An invention whose utilisation cannot enhance the user’s fitness will be rejected and deleted from use. This is how biological natural selection finds its way into technology.</p><p id="Par51"><bold>“Endogenous growth”</bold> is an idea in economics that claims that the best growth results can be achieved through investment into targeted R&amp;D. The downside of this paradigm is that it calls for a reduction in far-search exploration, which happened, as evidenced in Youn’s analysis of patents (Youn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2015</xref>). A far search is deemed too risky and uneconomical. No one seems to have noticed that such overuse of exploitation necessarily results in ever smaller improvements in consecutive inventions.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Innovation exhaustion and economic slowdown</title><p id="Par52">(Gordon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref>) and (Buchanan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) documented general innovation contraction in the U.S. Specifically, for silicon chip technology (Esmaeilzadehy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>; Austin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>) it is still technologically possible to further decrease microprocessor resolution, nevertheless, the efficiency boundaries in multiprocessor die arrangements have been reached and the cost jumps resulting from the introduction of even smaller chip resolutions yield a positive return with ever more difficulty (Austin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). Even if the number of transistors on a chip is doubled, such efforts will no longer result in equivalent performance gains (Austin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). A similar situation can be observed with conventional drugs. Previous studies (Scannell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2012</xref>) reported an increase in efforts towards pharmaceutical discovery in accordance with ‘Eroom’s law’ (Moore’s law in reverse). These observations were correct, but the analysis seems to be wrong. However, these authors did notice a ‘low-hanging fruit’ problem, suggesting that easy things have already been discovered. Nevertheless, the authors ascribe the innovation slowdown to other factors. This and other slowdowns in nearly all engineering fields reflect ‘the low-hanging fruit’ problem or, more precisely, the problem of the exhaustion of the experimental space. The most obvious example is the near exhaustion of thermodynamic-conversion efficiency improvements in combustion engines in the late 1960s (Ayres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">Since 2010, D.

Strumsky et al. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) propose the number of technology codes (areas of prior art) as an indicator of inventions incorporating new exploration fields and use this indicator to present convincing evidence that inventions identifying new experimental fields are indeed lagging.

In the presence of a substantial thermodynamic disequilibrium, information is constantly generated and tested, representing a new view of chemical reaction models where reactants are observed in terms of survivability. Pre-biotic chemical evolution does not require replication with explicit heredity but, rather only needs information addition, diffusion, and an exergy source. A form of informational ‘heredity’ in terms of an exploitation search is required, however.</p><p id="Par59">The information potential, <italic>B</italic>, is introduced to aid in the understandability of chemical evolution informational processes. Because any functional information is superimposed over chemical information, it represents the maximum functional information in a world. The physics-based necessary condition for evolution can be defined as the requirement for an experimental space with the innovation process running. However, this is not a sufficient condition in itself. The sufficient condition is only fulfilled when innovation-generated information exceeds the amount of information lost to deleterious processes.</p><p id="Par60">Evolutionary optimisations (i.e., inventive processes) have three recognisable phases. Initially, this is a random, noisy exploratory search. Once exploration yields sufficient stored information (i.e., knowledge) the evolutionary process transits to an exploitation search, which can be recognised by a lower number of information ‘mutations’ and increased combinatorial inventions. An exploitation search greatly speeds up convergence towards optimal configurations. Improved communication between agents further speeds up convergence towards the inevitable exhaustion of the experimental space.</p><p id="Par61">For economic development and technology, the statistical mechanics-based productivity limits suggest that the productivity of any process cannot be increased without a decrease in energy efficiency if no change is made to the apparatus. Changes to the apparatus in technology are becoming incrementally less significant due to exhaustion.</p><p id="Par62">Human inventors also evaluate their own fitness gains through their inventions. If the societal (taxes) or organisational situation in a corporation, for example, is such that others would benefit from a tentative innovation more than the inventor, then he or she will strive to move elsewhere or to withhold worthy ideas.</p><p id="Par63">Current innovative management strategies are oriented towards systematic approaches based on perceived needs, which frequently result in pursuing matters of already exhausted experimental spaces with ever-diminishing returns. The exhaustion of broader experimental fields can only be overcome through the identification of new broad fields via basic sciences being pushed into the risky unknown through exploration searches.</p><p id="Par64">Exploration searches can be clearly distinguished from exploitation by not having definable, measurable goals. The measurability of the expected results should be taken as a strong indication that the prospective activity is exploitative rather than explorative.</p><p id="Par65">Although our options as regards the metabolic uses of fossil fuels seem exhausted, Earth’s primary exergy efficiency is merely 0.00003, which must be taken as indicating the direction of future exploration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author would like to thank Miroslav Halilovič, Boris Štok, and Yury Shimansky for their valuable comments, and especially thank Bob Skiles for his endorsement and detailed review of this work.</p></ack><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec id="FPar4"><title>Authors’ information</title><p id="Par66">AK is among world’s leading industrial researchers and inventors.
