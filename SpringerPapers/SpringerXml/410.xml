The genetic changes induced have far-reaching consequences, often leading to diseases such as cancer. A wide range of genotoxins exists, including radiations and chemicals found naturally in the environment and in man-made forms created by human activity across a variety of industries. Genomic technologies offer the possibility of unravelling the mechanisms of genotoxicity, including the repair of genetic damage, enhancing our ability to develop, test and safely use existing and novel materials. We have developed 3D-DIP-Chip, a microarray-based method to measure the prevalence of genomic genotoxin-induced DNA damage. We demonstrate the measurement of both physical and chemical induced DNA damage spectra, integrating the analysis of these with the associated changes in histone acetylation induced in the epigenome. We discuss the application of the method in the context of basic and translational sciences.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep07975.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep07975" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep07975</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA molecule is highly susceptible to damage from a variety of genotoxins, both natural and man-made. Endogenous DNA damage occurs spontaneously, at high rates, as a consequence of normal cellular processes including oxidative reactions, resulting in DNA base modifications and a variety of errors introduced during DNA replication. Exogenous DNA damage occurs due to chemical or physical insults, including radiations present in the environment and man-made chemicals. These often induce the formation of bulky adducts, cross-links and strand breaks in the DNA, which if not repaired correctly can lead to cell death or the proliferation of mutations. To ensure cell survival and to maintain the integrity of the genome, sophisticated networks of DNA repair pathways have evolved. These are critical to maintaining health and preventing genetic mutations, which may result in disease development and drive carcinogenesis.</p><p>Mutations induced in DNA by genotoxic agents are a product of DNA damage caused by exposure of cells to those agents and the cells' capacity to subsequently repair that damage. The ability to sensitively measure genome-wide levels and locations of genetic damage and rates of its removal by DNA repair, has major significance in a range of applications. In addition to determining the mechanisms of DNA damage induction and DNA repair processes in basic research, such a method may be employed in a variety of other settings. For example, current genotoxicity testing uses overly simplistic assays, often relying on animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Novel <italic>in vitro</italic> methods are being developed and a microarray-based tool for measuring DNA damage and repair would represent a significant advance in this area. Similarly, clinicians using DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs — mainstays in the treatment of patients with solid tumours — would benefit enormously from a method capable of predicting response to these agents based on the detection of genomic DNA damage and repair signatures. The development of such a method would represent an important advance and would enable personalisation of therapies. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies now permit whole genome mutation analyses and the sequencing of individual cancer genomes has revealed the presence of mutational signatures within the genomes of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The ability to detect and measure DNA damage and repair spectra with a view to associating these with the mutational end-points detected in cancer genomes would enable these early indicators to be used as predictive markers for the subsequent mutational endpoints. These may include markers which predict predisposition to and the progression of, disease, as well as the ability to determine the response of individuals to drug treatments of these diseases.</p><p>Here we present and, importantly, validate a novel, patented method to measure the locations and levels of genotoxin-induced DNA damage throughout genomes, or sections thereof, named 3D-DIP-chip: DNA Damage Detection (3D) by DNA ImmunoPrecipitation (DIP) on microarray chips (Chip). We describe for the first time the definitive protocols for the use of this method in both yeast and human cells. This method enables the examination and mapping of DNA damage at a high resolution throughout any sequenced genome (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We demonstrate the technology with DNA damage induced by three genotoxins: a natural physical source (UV radiation) and two synthetic chemical sources (the platinating chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and oxaliplatin) in cultured human cells and in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Representation of the 3D-DIP-Chip and ChIP-Chip procedure.</p><p>(a) Proteins are crosslinked to chromatin (top) or DNA damage is induced (bottom).

In the work presented here we investigate histone H3 lysine 14 (H3K14) acetylation changes in response to these DNA damaging agents using ChIP-chip in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Epigenetic changes in histone H3 acetylation are known to be an important cellular response to DNA damage, controlling the chromatin structure in the nuclei of cells, promoting efficient DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We compare these epigenetic changes induced by UV and platinum DNA adduct formation in cells in the context of the respective DNA damage spectra. We demonstrate how the integrated analysis of these related datasets, which is made possible via the bioinformatic software package Sandcastle developed in our laboratory, reveals the potential for gaining a systems view of genome stability, revealing how organisms organise and orchestrate their responses to genetic damage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Workflow</title><p>The 3D-DIP-Chip experimental workflow is described in detail in the Methods section of this report. The procedure is outlined in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly, protein cross-linked chromatin or damaged DNA is extracted from cells and fragmented by sonication (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, top and bottom respectively). Fragments of interest are affinity captured by immunoprecipitation (IP) using an antibody raised against that feature of interest, for example a damage induced DNA adduct, a DNA binding protein or a post-translationally modified histone (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Initial input (IN) samples are also collected. Following IP, DNA damages or DNA-protein cross-links are reversed, DNA is purified and IP and IN samples are amplified, differentially labelled using a two-dye system and applied to DNA microarrays covering the genome of interest (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). After hybridisation the microarrays are washed and optically scanned (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) and the fluorescence intensity values recorded for each probe representing a location of the genome are converted to numerical values, which can be analysed and plotted (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). The data from these files are loaded into the R statistical programming environment (R Development Core Team. <italic>R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R foundation for statistical computing</italic> (Vienna, Austria, 2011)) for analysis and analysed using Sandcastle, a suite of tools for the normalisation, analysis and graphical display of ChIP-chip data. The Sandcastle software and full documentation are available for download from <ext-link xlink:href="http://reedlab.cardiff.ac.uk/sandcastle" ext-link-type="uri">http://reedlab.cardiff.ac.uk/sandcastle</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Affinity capturing damaged DNA</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies for UV-induced CPDs and platinum-induced guanine adducts were used to affinity capture DNA damaged with the respective agents, with the resulting enrichment assessed by Q-PCR (full details are given in the Methods section). Dose-dependent enrichment is demonstrated for DNA from both yeast and human cells treated with cisplatin and oxaliplatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S1 a and b</xref> respectively), confirming the known characteristic that oxaliplatin forms fewer adducts than cisplatin at equimolar doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This demonstrates that 3D-DIP is a reliable method of affinity capturing DNA damaged by different genotoxins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Removing DNA damage lesions prior to PCR amplification</title><p>The IN and 3D-DIP samples contain DNA damage. Many DNA adducts, including CPDs and platinum adducts, inhibit DNA polymerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> which can restrict efficient downstream processing of samples by PCR. Removal of the damage is therefore required to carry out the full 3D-DIP-Chip procedure. Platinum-DNA adducts are very stable over a long period of time, but in the presence of cyanide ions most platinum residues are known to be removed from DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) has been proven to be the most effective chemical for disrupting platinum-DNA adducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and in the DIP studies described in this paper, NaCN was used to remove platinum adducts. Similarly, CPDs also need removal prior to downstream processing and this was achieved using a PreCR DNA repair kit (See Methods for details). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref> demonstrates the effectiveness of NaCN in removing adducts from cisplatin and oxaliplatin treated human DNA. Platinum damaged DNA treated with NaCN prior to immunoprecipitation shows no enrichment following immunoprecipitation, demonstrating removal of the platinum adducts. Effective DNA damage removal following immunoprecipitation of platinum induced adducts was also confirmed by demonstrating greater qRT-PCR amplification in DNA samples processed for damage removal after immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2 b and c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measuring DNA damage on DNA microarrays</title><p>To determine the levels and locations of DNA damage, the human and yeast derived samples were hybridised to two-colour Agilent 4x44K microarrays. Human samples were analysed on a custom-designed microarray covering a randomly selected section of the genome: 10 Mbp of chromosome 17. Yeast samples were analysed with the G4493A whole genome microarray. Log<sub>2</sub> IP:IN ratio values are used for all analyses giving relative levels of DNA adducts detected at the genomic locations represented by the probes on the microarray. Data from files created by Agilent's Feature Extraction Software (version 10.10) were loaded into R for analysis. Reproducibility was assessed by calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between datasets (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), demonstrating the range of correlation values for the respective categories described. The average of two human <italic>in vitro</italic> cisplatin treated datasets is shown as a Circos plot in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, demonstrating the heterogeneity of the DNA damage distribution over the 10 Mbp genome section analysed.

Genetic damage also induces epigenetic changes in the form of histone modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To investigate how these two parameters relate to each other in response to genotoxic exposure we treated yeast cells with the same genotoxins. Genome plots for UV and cisplatin damaged DNA are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>. Alongside this we employed ChIP-chip to measure the DNA damage induced changes in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9, which is known to be required for the efficient repair of UV-induced CPDs. To do this we measured the background histone H3 acetylation levels before inducing DNA damage and repeated these measurements after DNA damage, in order to determine the DNA damage induced change. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the results of measuring the distribution of genetic damage induced in the genome by exposing yeast cells either to UV light or to treatment with cisplatin. Different DNA damage profiles are generated from these different damaging agents as demonstrated by the negative Spearman's rank correlation (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), which reflects the fact that different DNA damaging agents induce damage at different dipyrimidine and dipurine bases. Indeed, by analysing and plotting the same data in relation to transcriptional start sites located throughout the genome (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>) it is possible to visualise the different patterns of cisplatin damage (solid black line) versus UV induced damage (solid green line). By plotting the predicted damage spectra for both cisplatin (dashed black line) and UV (dashed green line) induced DNA damage, as expected, it can be seen that the actual damage profile generally follows the predicted pattern. Significantly however, regions where these patterns deviate from the prediction can be observed, particularly in the promoter regions of genes upstream of the transcriptional start site, but also at specific locations in the open reading frames. This is particularly evident in the case of cisplatin damage where lower levels of damage are observed in the promoter regions of genes than might be expected based on the predicted pattern (see Discussion). This result demonstrates the significance of this technique as a tool for analysing DNA damage throughout genomes. Analysis of the spectrum of DNA damage-induced histone acetylation reveals a positive association between the UV versus the cisplatin induced DNA damage treatments (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). As expected, this is confirmed when plotting the same data in relation to all genomic transcription start sites (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). However, plotting the data in this context reveals the genomic location of a peak of DNA damage induced histone H3 acetylation that is observed immediately downstream of the transcription start site, just inside the open reading frame. These results indicate that the DNA damage-induced increase in histone H3 acetylation, which is known to be important for the response to and repair of DNA damage in chromatin, appears to be very similar, regardless of the individual patterns of DNA damage induced, or whether a physical or chemical DNA damaging agent is used. This may reflect DNA damage-induced changes in the epigenome and chromatin structure that are common to different DNA damaging agents and could provide insight into how these events are organised in the epigenome.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Examples of the types of analyses that may be undertaken with 3D-DIP-Chip and ChIP-chip.</p><p>Scatter plots show an inverse association between cisplatin and UV induced DNA damage (a) but a positive association between cisplatin and UV induced histone acetylation (c).

We first introduced the concept to measure CPD induction in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> following exposure to UV irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the current report we have extensively modified, adapted and, most importantly, validated, this 3D-DIP-chip assay for use in both human and yeast cells to measure different types of DNA damage with sensitivity and at a high resolution over the entire yeast genome and a 10 Mbp section of the human genome. This represents a significant technological advance in the measurement of genetic damage at a high resolution on a genomic scale. The key methodological modifications made to the original 3D-DIP-chip assay, which allowed successful measurement of DNA damage in human cells can be summarised by developments in two key areas. Firstly, the DIP protocol was optimised by improving the immunoaffinity capture stage. This involved increasing the stringency of the post IP washes and using a phenol-chloroform based post-DIP purification method. Secondly, an alternative method was used for amplifying the DIP sample prior to microarray hybridisation using a proprietary whole genome amplification method (WGA2, Sigma-Aldrich) instead of ligation-mediated PCR. This advance in the application of microarray-based technology now offers a novel method and protocol for examining DNA damage in human and other cells. The detailed methods that we describe here provide the basis for the analysis of many other types of DNA damage to which antibodies have been, or could be produced, opening the way to the genome-wide analysis of the full spectrum of genetic lesions.</p><p>The method is a significant advance compared to existing technologies and represents an important new application of microarrays. Current technologies can measure DNA damage at high-resolution in single genetic loci at individual nucleotide resolution. These include the use of sequencing gels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, low-resolution methods such as immuno-slot-blot assays of total genomic DNA samples are also used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The high-resolution techniques cover only very small sections of a genome and the low-resolution techniques do not offer sufficient sensitivity to be of use in many industrial applications, particularly in clinical and genotoxicity testing scenarios. It is worth noting that next generation sequencing technologies may in the future offer an alternative to the use of microarrays following the 3D-DIP stage of the protocol and we are indeed currently examining this. Others have already established techniques for measuring double strand breaks using next generation sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, using a technique that identifies the location of the DNA double strand breaks. We have developed a high-resolution technology, which can measure and locate DNA damage induction across a whole genome simultaneously. This now offers a functional assay capable of examining the DNA damaging lesions directly with significant relevance in the fields of genotoxicity testing, translational and personalised medicine, as well as in basic mechanistic laboratory studies investigating DNA damage and repair. For example, we are now using this method to examine clinical samples to characterise genomic DNA damage signatures that could be used as predictive biomarkers of response to the effects of DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents, which may subsequently allow personalised therapy.</p><p>Using platinum-induced DNA damage and UV-induced CPD formation as a paradigm for DNA damage, we validate DIP in capturing damaged DNA fragments with highly reproducible qRT-PCR data. We confirm this by comparing our experimental data with the predicted DNA damage patterns derived from algorithms developed following the use of other techniques for measuring damage in naked DNA. Furthermore, we report the detailed protocols for the measurement of two important sources of DNA damage; environmental UV radiation and cisplatin and oxaliplatin used extensively in chemotherapy treatment regimens for patients with solid tumours. The ability to examine platinum-induced DNA damage and its repair using these methods will offer important mechanistic and clinical information relating to the use of these drugs, particularly with regard to drug resistance for this therapy. As described, our approach allows us to map DNA damage events across whole genomes and to detect regions of preferential damage induction and repair within the genome, offering insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance. The data we show in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> for example demonstrates the power of these analyses by highlighting the genome-wide relationships for both the damage induced histone H3 acetylation pattern and UV versus cisplatin induced damage patterns respectively (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 a and b</xref>). More importantly, however, are the subtle differences that can be discerned by plotting the data in relation to genomic locations such as transcription start sites as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 b and d</xref>. Examining the data in this way enables differences in genetic and epigenetic changes to be detected according to their genomic location. These deviations from the predicted pattern are unlikely to be caused by repair of DNA damage in these regions in this case, since the data is derived from the DNA of cells, which was extracted immediately after DNA damage treatment. A possible explanation for the departure from the predicted pattern is that the <italic>in vivo</italic> induced damage pattern may be affected by differences in the epigenome and chromatin structure at specific genomic locations, which is not accounted for by the predicted pattern, since these are determined from data derived from DNA damage frequencies measured in naked DNA. Understanding DNA damage in the context of chromatin is fundamental for determining the impact of the chromatin structure on the extent and pattern of genome-wide DNA damage. How chromatin structure influences DNA damage induction throughout whole genomes and how epigenetic responses relate to the genomic damage induction remains to be determined. We present histone H3K14 acetylation data in response to UV and platinum exposure as a paradigm for how this can be achieved. We confirm histone H3K14 acetylation to be a prominent histone modification taking place globally in the genome following exposure to two different DNA damaging agents and that this response is remarkably consistent in the case of these two types of DNA damage. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of our method to understanding the effects of DNA damage on the epigenome at the genomic scale.</p><p>Furthermore, this technology can be considered as a paradigm for examining other DNA damages, providing that specific antibodies against that damage, or some other means of affinity capturing the damage, are available. As mentioned, this technology also has implications in the field of genotoxicity testing, where assessments of the efficacy and toxicity of new compounds are often still made based on simple laboratory assays or animal models. Our assay could be helpful in defining targets of new chemotherapeutic agents, delineating target sequences for DNA damage and detecting the unintended genomic damage, the so-called off-targets, caused by new pharmacology agents, such as those targeting the epigenome. Finally, next generation sequencing technologies are offering remarkable insight into the acquisition of mutations in genomes including cancer genomes. The results of these analyses appear to reveal the life history of mutagen exposure and, in addition, clearly reflect the associated DNA repair capacity of the cells in question. The 3D-DIP-chip assay described here could be used to further refine our understanding of the mechanisms of mutation, offering the possibility of identifying predictive DNA damage and repair signatures associated with subsequent mutational end-points and tumourigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Platinum analogue chemotherapy drugs</title><p>Cisplatin and oxaliplatin were obtained courtesy of the pharmacy department of Velindre Cancer Centre, Cardiff.

IN samples of 0.6 μg (1/10 of IP sample) of sonicated DNA were made up to 100 μl with TE buffer followed by the addition of 25 μl of 5 x pronase buffer and 6.25 μl of pronase (20 mg/ml) and incubated in a water bath at 65°C overnight. Following overnight incubation, IP and IN samples were processed for removal of the DNA damage (see next section) and 5 μl of DNase-free RNase A (10 mg/ml) was added during this process. DNA was then purified and for yeast samples this was achieved using the PureLink TM Quick PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen) and eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer and for human DNA samples it was achieved using a phenol-chloroform extraction method. Finally, to increase the overall DNA yield in the human DIP samples, DIP samples were processed in parallel and two samples pooled prior to the qRT-PCR stage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Removal of platinum adducts prior to qRT-PCR and microarray preparation</title><p>DIP DNA fragments detected by the CP9/19 antibody and the corresponding IN DNA samples will contain platinum adducts (apart from untreated samples), which are known to inhibit DNA polymerase function and interfere with microarray hybridisation. These samples therefore require processing for removal of these adducts prior to downstream applications. Platinum-DNA adducts are very stable over a long period of time, but in the presence of cyanide ions most platinum residues are known to be removed from DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) has been proven to be the most effective chemical for disrupting platinum-DNA adducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and in the DIP studies described in this paper, NaCN was used to remove platinum adducts. Following overnight incubation of the IP and IN samples with pronase DNA samples were incubated with 0.2 M NaCN for 2 hours at 65°C. 5 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) was added for the last 45 minutes of this incubation. Following incubation, DNA samples were purified as described in the previous section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Removal of CPDs prior to qRT-PCR and microarray preparation</title><p>Similar to work examining the platinum adducts, CPDs also needed removal prior to qRT-PCR, WGA and microarray hybridisation and this was achieved using the proprietary PreCR DNA repair kit (New England Biolabs) - a kit that removes many DNA damages including CPDs. 40 μl of IP and IN samples were processed for repair using this kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Following repair, DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 10 μl.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation of histone H3K14 acetylation</title><p>Yeast chromatin extracted from cells treated <italic>in vivo</italic> with platinum analogues was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using the anti-acetyl-histone H3(lysine14) antibody (Millipore, 07-353). 50 μl of Dynabeads (Sheep anti-Rabbit IgG, Invitrogen) per sample were washed three times using 500 μl PBS-BSA (0.1%). Washed Dynabeads were resuspended in 50 μl of PBS-BSA (0.1%) per sample and 2 μl of anti-acetyl-histone H3 (lysine14) antibody was added per 50 μl of Dynabeads for detection of histone H3 K14 acetylation. Dynabeads and antibody were incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes at 1300 rpm in a thermomixer (Eppendorf). Dynabeads were collected, washed three times with 500 μl of chilled PBS-BSA (0.1%) and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS-BSA (0.1%) per sample. 30 μl of 10 X PBS-BSA (10 mg/ml) and 125 μl of sonicated chromatin were added to each sample containing the Dynabeads and the final volume made up to 300 μl with PBS. Samples were incubated at 21°C for 3 hours at 1300 rpm in a thermomixer. Following incubation, samples underwent a series of washes as follows: first wash with 500 μl of freshly prepared FA/SDS buffer. This was followed by three washes with 500 μl of FA/SDS + 500 mM NaCl, one wash with 500 μl of LiCl solution and one wash with 500 μl of cold TE. Chromatin was eluted from the Dynabeads in 125 μl of pronase buffer at 65°C at 900 rpm for 30 min. 6.25 μl of pronase (20 mg/ml) was added to each sample and incubated at 65°C in a water bath overnight. IN samples of 25 μl of sonicated chromatin were made up to 100 μl with TE buffer followed by the addition of 25 μl of 5 x pronase buffer and 6.25 μl of pronase (20 mg/ml) and incubated overnight as the IP samples. Following overnight incubation, IP and IN samples were processed for damage removal with sodium cyanide as discussed previously and 5 μl of DNase- free RNase A (10 mg/ml) was added during this process. DNA was purified using the PureLink TM Quick PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen) and eluted with 50 μl elution buffer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Sample Preparation for yeast DNA microarray hybridisation</title><p>Yeast DIP and ChIP and input samples were processed for microarray hybridisation as described in the Agilent Technologies Yeast ChIP on chip protocol (Agilent Technologies Yeast ChIP-on-chip Analysis Protocol, version 9.2) and as outlined previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Briefly, the steps required are blunting of the ends of the DNA fragments followed by ligation of a common linker sequence of DNA to the ends of these fragments, ligation-mediated PCR amplification (LM-PCR), labelling and hybridisation to 4 × 44k format Agilent yeast microarrays. Following amplification the concentration of DNA was measured with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and sample concentration was normalised to 150 ng/μl with H<sub>2</sub>O. 10.5 μl of the IP and IN samples were differentially fluorescently labelled with Cy5 and Cy3 fluorophores respectively using the BioPrime Total Genomic Labelling System (Invitrogen), which yields sufficient quantities of labelled DNA for hybridisation to microarrays. For labelling, samples were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Labelling efficiency was determined using the MicroArray Measurement Module on the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, which measures DNA concentration and labelling effectiveness. Following labelling, the IP and IN samples were combined and 110 μl of the hybridisation mixture applied to each Agilent yeast 4 × 44k microarray. Mixtures were allowed to hybridise to microarrays for 24 hours at 65°C. The 4 × 44k microarray format signifies that 44,000 features are imprinted on a single microarray to represent the entire yeast genome and that 4 microarrays are printed on each glass slide. The method for each of the preparatory microarray steps of DNA end-blunting, linker ligation, PCR amplification, labelling and hybridisation were all conducted as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Sample Preparation for human DNA microarray hybridisation</title><p>Human samples were prepared for microarray hybridisation differently to yeast samples. A proprietary whole genome amplification method GenomPlex Complete Whole Genome Amplification Kit (WGA2, Sigma-Aldrich) was used for amplification rather than LM-PCR. This removed the need for a second round of PCR amplification preventing the introduction of amplification bias. This kit uses an amplification method based on conversion of genomic DNA fragments into PCR-amplifiable OmniPlex library molecules flanked by universal priming sites. The OmniPlex library is then PCR amplified using universal oligonucleotide primers to generate a representative amplification of human genomic DNA.</p><p>The manufacturer's protocol was followed except that the initial fragmentation step was eliminated since our samples were already fragmented. The entire DIP sample was used for library preparation and 2 μl of 1 x library preparation buffer and 1 μl of library stabilization solution were added to the DIP sample, followed by mixing and incubating at 95°C for 2 minutes and immediately cooling on ice. 1 μl of library preparation enzyme was added to each sample and samples incubated in a thermal cycler at 16°C for 20 minutes, 24°C for 20 minutes, 37°C for 20 minutes and 75°C for 5 minutes before proceeding to PCR amplification. 7.5 μl of 10 X amplification master mix, 47.5 μl of nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O and 5 μl of WGA DNA polymerase were added to each sample, mixed and incubated in a thermal cycler as follows: 95°C for 3 minutes, followed by 14–16 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec and 65°C for 5 minutes. Samples were purified using the PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen), eluted in 15 μl of water and DNA quantified using the MicroArray Measurement Module on the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. The expected yield was between 1–5 μg of genomic material, providing enough material for one microarray experiment. Following amplification, samples were labelled as described before using the BioPrime Total Genomic Labelling System (Invitrogen) except that human samples were labelled for 3 hours at 37°C. Multiple labelled IP DNA samples could be combined prior to microarray hybridisation as a means to boosting the microarray signal and samples were hybridised as described above for 24 hours at 65°C to custom-designed Agilent Technologies human 4 × 44k microarrays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Microarray washing, scanning and feature extraction</title><p>After hybridisation both the yeast and human microarrays were washed twice and scanned as described in the Agilent Technologies Yeast ChIP on chip protocol (Agilent Technologies Yeast ChIP-on-chip Analysis Protocol, version 9.2). The scanned image was analysed by Agilent Feature Extraction computer software, which converted the image into numerical values for data analysis. Microarray data analysis was conducted using the R statistical programming language (R version 2.15.2). All of the analysis presented in this paper was conducted using R using software developed in our laboratory.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported
