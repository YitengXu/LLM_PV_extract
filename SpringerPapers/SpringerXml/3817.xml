However, droughts resulting from climate change have limited the production of these crops. One of the strategies to attenuate water deficit damage in these crops is the use of silicate, which contributes to plant physiology. This strategy is likely to increase water use efficiency, thus promoting crop sustainability. Notwithstanding, studies on this issue are still incipient. This study assesses whether Si applied via fertigation and foliar spraying in the seedling production phase and as a complement after seedling transplanting to the soil is efficient in attenuating water deficit in sugarcane and energy cane. The study further elucidates physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in this process. For this, the authors conducted two experiments: one with sugarcane and the other with energy cane. Treatments were arranged in randomized blocks with 5 replications, in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme. Factors consisted of the absence (-Si) and presence of Si (+ Si) applied via fertigation and foliar spraying; and two water regimes: 70% (without water deficit) and 30% (severe water deficit) of the soil water retention capacity. Silicon was supplied during the formation phase of presprouted seedlings and during the transplanting of seedlings to pots filled with samples of Entisol (Quartzipsamment). In these pots, water regimes were induced from 7 to 160 days after transplanting. Severe water deficit reduced the water content and water potential of plants. This situation induced oxidative stress and impaired gas exchange and photosynthetic water use efficiency, reducing plant growth. Silicon supply via fertigation in association with foliar spraying in the seedling formation phase with complementation after transplanting was efficient in increasing Si accumulation in the plants. Silicon was effective in attenuating severe water deficit damage up to initial culm formation through mechanisms that maintain water and physiological balance by favoring the antioxidant defense system in sugarcane and energy cane plants.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Gelza Carliane Marques</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>17486</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_21680.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Drought is one of the factors that most limit agricultural production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that drought conditions have worsened recently and are likely to increase due to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, reducing sugarcane yield. This effect is important because the sugarcane growing area has expanded and currently occupies more than 100 countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This is due to sugarcane being a source of sustainable bioenergy that helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Irrigated sugarcane cultivation has expanded in this context, especially in top producing countries such as Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, reducing water consumption and increasing water use economy are of great importance to ensure adequate resources and sustainable agricultural production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">A strategy to reduce water deficit damage in crops is the use of silicon (Si). Silicon is the second most abundant element in soil, behind only oxygen. Silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) comprises 50–70% of the soil mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the soil solution, however, available Si is in the form of monosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) at low concentration (~ 1 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Silicon is a beneficial element absorbed in the form of H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. This form remains the same in the xylem sap, reaching the leaves through the transpiration gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It concentrates in leaf tissue in polymerized form as amorphous and biogenic silica, constituting 90% of the absorbed Si and being contained in Si-cellulose structures present in the cell wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The beneficial effects of Si on plants under water deficit prevent leaf water imbalance. This is because deposits of this element on cell walls reduce water loss by transpiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Silicon also induces an osmoregulatory response by modifying proline content that adjusts root hydraulic conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, it stimulates the activity of enzymes such as aquaporin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, increasing water absorption. The role of Si in regulating enzymatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and nonenzymatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> antioxidant defense systems favor plant tolerance to drought. By decreasing oxidative stress, Si preserves and increases photosynthetic pigments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> while maintaining high photochemical efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This should increase the duration of active green leaves and consequently photosynthetic rate and plant growth. However, further studies are necessary to prove this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par5">A high uptake of silicon is important for obtaining a biological benefit to the plant. This concerns Si application mode, which correlates with its source that can enhance biological effects and plant growth. Silicon can be applied to the soil in solid form using sources of limited solubility from calcium silicate. In addition, the element can be supplied either in fluid form via foliar spray or to the soil via fertigation using sources with high water solubility. These ways of applying Si have some important implications.</p><p id="Par6">Silicon can be applied with the use of calcium silicate; however, it needs to be incorporated into the soil at high doses (1000 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> of Si) that favor its dissolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Another way would be the use of high solubility sources (potassium silicate or sodium silicate). Soluble sources allow use via fertigation, which could reduce Si polymerization rates in the soil. This type of application uses low Si doses per area; however, these doses guarantee its adequate absorption by the plant. This is because fertigation allows the use of a solution with concentrations below 3 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> Si, avoiding polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown the efficiency of Si fertigation in optimizing the absorption of this element in forage plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and in presprouted sugarcane seedlings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding, further studies on plant cane are needed, especially regarding stages with high relative growth rates. These stages usually occur between 84 and 135 days after transplanting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> depending on genotype and growing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Studies addressing silicon focus on sugarcane and discuss physiological parameters only, without demonstrating additive effects of biochemical mechanisms. To our knowledge there are no reports on energy cane plants. However, it is noteworthy that water deficit induces oxidative stress, which increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, studies show increased planting of sugarcane and energy cane in areas with greater occurrence of water deficit that require a greater need for supplementary irrigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This strengthens the importance of using Si to promote rational use of irrigation water, which is a finite resource<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Research has not yet described the effects of Si application via fertigation in association with foliar spraying during the production of presprouted seedlings with complementation after transplanting to the soil. The same can be said for the effects of Si application on the initial culm formation of sugarcane and energy cane.</p><p id="Par9">However, it is important to evaluate two strategies involving Si optimization in crops. One would be the use of this element in its soluble form via fertigation as mentioned above. The other would be the use of Si after the formation of presprouted seedlings as well as after seedling transplanting to the soil. These strategies could maximize the biological benefits of this element in the plant to mitigate severe water deficit that normally occurs in the field for sugarcane and energy cane. Nevertheless, further studies on this topic are needed.</p><p id="Par10">Therefore it is important to verify three hypotheses. The first hypothesis is: i) Si fertigation in association with foliar spraying in the seedling formation phase with complementation after transplanting (&lt; 20 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> Si) provides high accumulation of this element in the plants. The second hypothesis is: ii) Si promotes benefits by inducing enzymatic—catalase (CAT), superoxidase dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)—and nonenzymatic (phenol and proline) antioxidant defense mechanisms, reducing oxidative stress. This would favor physiological aspects including water content and water use efficiency, pigments, photosynthesis, and consequently tillering, number of green leaves, and dry matter production of the two species under study. Finally, the third hypothesis is: iii) Si is efficient in attenuating severe water deficit damage up to the initial culm formation of sugarcane and energy cane.
</p><p id="Par11">To test these hypotheses, the authors of the present study conducted two experiments, one with sugarcane and the other with energy cane. The aim was to evaluate whether Si applied via fertigation in association with foliar spraying in the seedling production phase with complementation after transplanting to the soil is efficient in attenuating water deficit in sugarcane and energy cane. The authors also elucidated the physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved.</p><p id="Par12">Acceptance of the hypotheses of this study enables understanding the synergistic mechanisms between silicon and the physiological and biochemical aspects of sugarcane and energy cane. This allows using the benefits of mineral nutrition with Si in plants to increase water use efficiency. Environmental and agronomic gains could thus be achieved by favoring sustainable establishment of these species even in drought regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material and growing conditions</title><p id="Par13">The authors conducted two experiments simultaneously in a greenhouse at the State University of São Paulo—UNESP from January to September 2019.

The nutrient solution used was Hoagland and Arnon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> with a change in iron concentration in the Fe–EDDHA source to 368 μmol L<sup>−1</sup> as indicated by Cavalcante et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> In order to avoid substrate salinization, the concentration of the nutrient solution was maintained at 25% dilution during the first week of cultivation, increasing to 50% on the second week until the end of the seedling formation phase. A saturation test was carried out to determine the volume of solution to be applied, with a volume of 10 mL per cell being sufficient to saturate the substrate, avoiding loss by leaching. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 5.5 ± 0.2 with a solution of Hydrochloric acid (HCl) or Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), both at 1 mol L<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p id="Par18">The source of soluble Si used was sodium and potassium silicate stabilized with sorbitol (113.4 g L<sup>−1</sup> of Si, 18.9 g L<sup>−1</sup> of K<sub>2</sub>O, 100 mL L<sup>−1</sup> of sorbitol, and pH 11.8) at 2.5 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>. This Si concentration does not induce polymerization as this phenomenon only starts at a concentration greater than 3 mmol L<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Fifteen Si applications were performed at 4 day intervals, starting 10 days after emergence (DAE) of sprouts (S 1). More specifically, 10 mL of Si per seedling was applied via fertigation in the substrate (to induce root uptake) and 1.5 mL of Si per seedling was applied via foliar spraying (to induce foliar uptake). The pH value of the Si solution was adjusted to 5.5 ± 0.2. The amount of potassium present in the Si source was balanced in the treatments without the element by using a 1 mol L<sup>−1</sup> potassium chloride solution with root application and foliar spraying.

Therefore, almost one-third of the leaves were removed. This is a common practice in seedling nurseries since it helps decreasing water vapor loss by transpiration when transplanting the seedlings to soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

Silicon application via fertigation was performed by simulating a 5 mm irrigation blade of silicate solution, with 481 mL of solution per pot being applied via roots considering an area of 962 cm<sup>2</sup>. Silicon concentration was 2.5 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to 33.7 mg of Si per pot and equivalent to 3.5 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> of Si per application. Foliar spraying was carried out using a manual sprayer to ensure leaf coverage without any runoff. The pH value of the fertigated solution was adjusted to 5.5 ± 0.2.

To this end, undisturbed soil samples were collected using a volumetric ring with volume (v) of 98.125 cm<sup>3</sup>. Subsequently, the samples were saturated with water for 24 h, being placed on the tension table for 72 h, followed by weight determination (a). After that, the samples were dried in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h and the weight was determined again (b).

Thus, the soil mass used to fill each pot was strictly controlled, and pot mass was also defined to be subtracted from the total mass. For that, the mass restoring method was used considering water losses by soil evaporation and plant transpiration, which were controlled daily by weighing the pots. This ensured that the plants were maintained at the WRC levels proposed in the treatments, as adjustments were made in all pots. The same irrigation frequency was used for both species and for the irrigation treatments, that is, all samples were weighed daily.</p><p id="Par26">At the time of water replacement, 70% WRC pots had approximately 60% WRC, and 30% WRC pots had 25% WRC. Water variation was greater in 70% WRC pots because of the higher transpiration losses due to plant growth. In addition, irrigations were always carried out at the same time of day (at 5 p.m.). Preliminary tests showed that water loss was more accentuated between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m..

In this context, the present study proposed to enrich these species with Si in the seedling formation phase with complementation via fertigation in association with foliar spraying after transplanting as a strategy to increase plant resistance under water deficit.</p><p id="Par85">Silicon supply by fertigation in association with foliar spraying provided high uptake of this element in both species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a-d). This showed the feasibility of using Si in the seedling formation phase with complementation after transplanting. The efficiency of Si supply is due to proper handling of the solution by using a concentration that favors the permanence of the element in the monomeric form that is absorbed by plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, that is, below 3 mmol L<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Using an adequate source of Si also improved its efficiency. This study used soluble Si along with sorbitol, which favors the stability of the monomeric forms of the element. Silicon forms organic complexes when binding with this polyol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, which contributes to its uptake via roots. Sorbitol also increases the wetting properties of the solution by decreasing the deliquescence point of the leaf surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, delaying drying and contributing to Si uptake.

Furthermore, complementation after transplanting is also a possibility considering the expansion of irrigated sugarcane cultivation and the use of rescue irrigation, which occurs after transplanting seedlings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, the soil solution can be enriched with Si from its supply via fertigation, increasing H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> concentration in the root zone.

This finding has important practical implications as it should expand the use of Si in irrigated sugarcane crops. This is because the technique uses a low amount of Si (close to 20 kg ha<sup>−1</sup>) in relation to techniques using ther sources of lower solubility such as calcium silicate, which requires doses above 1000 kg ha<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

This adjustment in leaf water potential facilitated plant water uptake and increased relative leaf water content (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e-h). Higher leaf water content correlates mainly with physical changes caused by the deposition of silica that binds to cellulose in the leaf epidermis and below the cuticle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> This deposition acts as a barrier to water loss, decreasing transpiration.

These results agree with those of other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> who reported that Si application strengthened the antioxidant defense system and decreased lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in sugarcane plants under water deficit stress.</p><p id="Par95">In addition to activating the enzymatic antioxidant system, Si also provided a beneficial effect on the performance of nonenzymatic antioxidant agents such as proline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>g, h) and phenolic compounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, f). The increased concentration of proline contributed to maintain cellular osmotic adjustment, increasing cell water potential by stimulating an increase in cellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Proline can also act as a molecular chaperone, protecting the integrity of proteins and maintaining or increasing the activity of enzymes signaling ROS dissipation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Thus, the increase in proline content improved the defense system of plants of both species fertilized with Si. The contents of phenolic compounds were also comparatively higher in sugarcane and energy cane plants that received Si supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, f). This increase collaborated with the decrease in ROS accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. In other studies, the increase in phenolic content correlated with the decrease in ROS production in maize plants under water deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par96">The physiological and biochemical mechanisms modified by Si in increasing the tolerance of plants grown under water deficit increased the WUE of plants. This is an important physiological attribute, especially for plants under drought conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. In this study, the water deficit decreased WUE, which in turn was improved by Si supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i, k). The literature also indicates an increase of WUE by Si in sugarcane plants under water stress, but with the application of the element only via leaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par97">The beneficial effect of Si on the biological mechanisms under study attenuated severe water deficit damage on plants. Its application favored plant growth while decreasing leaf senescence, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., percentage of dry leaves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, d). Moreover, silicon application increased the number of green leaves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, b) and consequently leaf area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>g, h), also increasing tillering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e, f) and dry matter production of leaves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, b), culms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c, d), and shoots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e, f). Thus, the second hypothesis of this study was accepted, indicating that the enrichment of plants with Si applied in the seedling formation phase with complementation after transplanting provides a beneficial effect that attenuates water deficit damage up to initial culm formation. This occurred due both to the Si-induced mechanism that changes physiological parameters favoring the maintenance of cell hydration and to the biochemical benefits from the increased activity of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants, decreasing oxidative stress.</p><p id="Par98">It is noteworthy that the benefit of Si in increasing the tolerance of plants under water restriction occurred in a relatively long period, from 7 to 160 days after transplanting, including the phase of high relative growth rate of the crop. In other words, it indicates the efficiency of production of new dry matter over the existing one, which occurs close to 84 to 135 days after transplanting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Reduction of stress in this stage of high dry matter accumulation rate may even have a beneficial impact on the next phenological stages of the crop. When Si attenuates water deficit, it favors tillering, which is one of the main components of productivity of sugarcane or energy cane. The more the plant tillers in the initial growth stage, the greater the productivity of the crop.</p><p id="Par99">This research also made it clear that the use of Si under the conditions of this study can enable suboptimal irrigation for the cultivation of these species. This could save irrigation water denoting expressive environmental gains as it is a finite natural resource.</p><p id="Par100">Further research should be conducted under field conditions so that the use of Si can be expanded for sustainable cultivation of sugarcane and energy cane crops in different production cycles and in drought areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par101">Silicon supply via fertigation in association with foliar spraying in the seedling formation phase with complementation after transplanting is efficient in increasing Si accumulation in the plants. The presence of Si in the plant attenuates severe water deficit damage up to initial culm formation, maintaining water and physiological balance by favoring the antioxidant defense system in sugarcane and energy cane plants.</p><p id="Par102">The present research suggests Si supply in the seedling formation phase and after transplanting to the soil as a complementary strategy in areas with water restriction for the initial formation of culms of sugarcane and energy cane, especially in sandy soils and soils with low Si availability.
