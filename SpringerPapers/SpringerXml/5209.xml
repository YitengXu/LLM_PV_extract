Herein, a soft processable metal-organic hybrid material is developed and studied for photocatalytic activity towards H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO and CH<sub>4</sub> under visible light as well as direct sunlight irradiation. A tetrapodal low molecular weight gelator (LMWG) is synthesized by integrating tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and terpyridine (TPY) derivatives through amide linkages and results in TPY-TTF LMWG. The TPY-TTF LMWG acts as a linker, and self-assembly of this gelator molecules with Zn<sup>II</sup> ions results in a coordination polymer gel (CPG); Zn-TPY-TTF. The Zn-TPY-TTF CPG shows high photocatalytic activity towards H<sub>2</sub> production (530 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO (438 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>, selectivity &gt; 99%) regulated by charge-transfer interactions. Furthermore, in situ stabilization of Pt nanoparticles on CPG (Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF) enhances H<sub>2</sub> evolution (14727 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>). Importantly, Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG produces CH<sub>4</sub> (292 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>, selectivity &gt; 97%) as CO<sub>2</sub> reduction product instead of CO.

In recent years, a significant amount of research has been carried out to develop artificial systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> for mimicking the sophisticated methodology of nature’s water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> as well as CO<sub>2</sub> reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Natural photosynthesis rely on the occurrence of precise sequences of proteins/enzymes to the several elementary steps of intercomponent light-absorption, charge separation, and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The synthetic assimilation of these parameters precisely in a spatial organization of molecular components is indeed a challenging task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The recent upsurge of converting CO<sub>2</sub> into fuels like CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>4,</sub> or different chemical feedstock has gained widespread attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to hydrocarbon fuels would mitigate not only the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere but also reduce the dependency on fossil fuel-based economy. However, the photoreduction of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules is a complex and challenging process due to the very high dissociation energy of the C=O bond (~750 kJ/mol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Only a handful of metal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, metal oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and chalcogenides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> based heterogeneous catalysts were reported for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CH<sub>4</sub>, but most of them suffer from a low conversion efficiency and poor selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. CH<sub>4</sub> formation is thermodynamically favourable (E<sup>0</sup> = −0.24 V versus RHE at pH = 7) than CO formation (E<sup>0</sup> = −0.53 V versus RHE at pH = 7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> as the former reaction takes place at a lower potential. Nevertheless, from a kinetic point of view, the eight-electron reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub> is more difficult, especially under photochemical condition than the two-electron reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To address challenges associated with photochemical H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, a novel photocatalytic system needs to be developed by the innovative design of photosensitizer and catalytic moiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Recently, carbon-nitride based photocatalyst for H<sub>2</sub> evolution and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Moreover, there is a huge lacuna in designing and developing such versatile photocatalyst materials that can reduce both, water and CO<sub>2</sub> efficiently.</p><p id="Par4">To this end, developing soft hybrid materials, such as coordination polymer gel (CPG), assembled by the low molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker and suitable metal ions, could be an excellent design approach in the realm of photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Such hierarchical soft nanofibrous materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> can facilitate the facile diffusion of reactants to the active sites and will show efficient electron transfer between different components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These artificial hybrid synthetic systems can mimic the intricate functioning of the natural photosystem and can eventually show impressive H<sub>2</sub> evolution from water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> or CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Extended face-to-face arrays of the donor–acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> π-chromophoric systems would be an ideal candidate for light harvesting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. These systems will allow greater exciton mobility, which, in turn, leads to charge generation and subsequent electron transfer to the catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. To this end, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) moiety is a well-known p-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> semiconductor possessing high electron donation capability with excellent photostability and good charge carrier mobility. Further, the integration of a suitable electron acceptor unit to the TTF moiety could result in a system with excellent charge-transfer characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, designing a TTF containing donor–acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> based LMWG could be an elegant approach for developing new photocatalyst material. Such systems are likely to show low energy charge transfer in the visible range, which will further reduce the bandgap, and corresponding visible-light photocatalyst can be realized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Coordination driven array of donor–acceptor pairs would further improve photocatalytic performances by enhancing charge transfer to the catalytic centre. Thus, the introduction of a suitable metal-binding moiety like terpyridine on TTF containing LMWG could lead to the formation of CPG and provide an opportunity for further improving the photocatalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we aim to report an emerging class of materials known as ‘coordination polymer gel’ by integrating Zn<sup>II</sup> with TTF-based LMWG and explored as a photocatalyst for solar fuel production based on water and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. The intermolecular charge transfer is regulated by the innovative design of LMWG, where TTF derivative is connected with metal-binding terpyridine units (TPY) through a flexible alkyl amide chain. The coordination polymer gel (Zn-TPY-TTF CPG) provides a suitable platform for light harvesting as well as a catalytic center for H<sub>2</sub> production from water (530 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO (438 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) with 99% selectivity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, Zn-TPY-TTF CPG with nanoribbon morphology is conjugated with Pt co-catalyst, and the Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG shows many folds enhanced photocatalytic activity towards H<sub>2</sub> production (14727 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>). Interestingly, this Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG produces CH<sub>4</sub> (292 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>h<sup>−1</sup>) as a photoproduct with high selectivity (97%) and impressive quantum efficiency. Importantly, both Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG shows the potential to perform sunlight-driven photocatalytic activity under ambient conditions. The in situ DRIFT study and DFT calculations help to elucidate the plausible mechanism of charge transfer regulated CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO/CH<sub>4</sub> formation using CPG catalysts under visible light as well as direct sunlight irradiation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic presentation of visible/sunlight-driven photocatalysis in TTF-based coordination polymer gel (CPG).</title><p><bold>a</bold> TPY-TTF low molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker and corresponding organogel (TPY-TTF OG). <bold>b</bold> Self-assembly with Zn<sup>II</sup> toward the preparation of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and preparation of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG by in situ stabilization of Pt nanoparticles on the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. <bold>c</bold> Visible/sunlight-driven photocatalytic activity of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG towards H<sub>2</sub> evolution and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_27457_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and characterizations of TPY-TTF OG and Zn-TPY-TTF CPG</title><p id="Par6">The TPY-TTF LMWG was synthesized by the amide coupling reaction between 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl-propane-1,3-diamine (TPY-NH<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis (benzoic acid) tetrathiafulvalene (TTF(COOH)<sub>4</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (details are provided in method section and supplementary information (SI)), Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The newly synthesized TPY-TTF LMWG was characterized by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy, and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization -Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). UV-vis absorption study was performed for a well-characterized TPY-TTF LMWG in methanol (10<sup>−6</sup> M) and showed distinguished absorption bands at 270 nm and 320 nm corresponding to π→π* transition for TPY unit and TTF core, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Notably, a low energy absorption band appeared at 520 nm that can be ascribed to intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) interaction between TTF core and benzo-amide moiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The CT property of TPY-TTF has also been supported by time dependant-density functional theoretical (TD-DFT) computation where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are centered in TTF and benzo-amide groups, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">We have examined the gelation propensity of TPY-TTF LMWG in several solvent compositions (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The purple-coloured opaque gel of TPY-TTF organogel (OG) was obtained in the solvent mixture (methanol (MeOH), dichloromethane (DCM) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) in 2:1:1 ratio) upon heating at 60 °C followed by cooling to room temperature as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and characterization of gel was performed by different techniques (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). The strain-sweep rheology experiments for TPY-TTF OG at 25 °C showed the values of storage modulus (Gʹ) and loss modulus (Gʺ) move constantly in the linear viscoelastic (LVE) region, consisting of the larger Gʹ value under less strain range as compared to the Gʺ, indicating the stable viscoelastic nature, which is a characteristic feature of a gel material (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). TPY-TTF OG was dried under vacuum at 80 °C to prepare the xerogel and studied the properties of the material (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). Morphology of the TPY-TTF OG xerogel was recorded by the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) that showed micron size staked layered type of morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). We have also prepared aerogel using a critical point dryer (CPD) that also showed similar layered type morphology (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11b</xref>). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images have further confirmed such morphologies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The distance between the layers in the stacked morphology was found to be 3.4 ± 0.4 nm based on AFM measurement. The high-resolution TEM analysis showed that the lattice fringes at ~3.7 Å (2d: inset) for the layered morphology suggesting the self-assembly in TPY-TTF OG is driven by the intermolecular π–π interactions. This was also supported by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study of the xerogel that exhibited a peak at 2θ = 24° with a d-spacing of 3.7 Å (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Further, we have performed DFT calculations which also support that the self-assembly is driven by intermolecular π–π stacking interactions between TTF---TPY units at a distance of 3.68 Å (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) and TTF---TTF units at a distance of 4.02 Å (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The UV-vis absorption study for TPY-TTF OG xerogel displayed slightly red-shifted absorption as compared to the methanolic solution of TPY-TTF LWMG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). It showed absorption bands at 300 nm and 330 nm, which can be assigned for π→π* transitions of TPY and TTF units of LMWG, respectively. Notably, a broad absorption between 480 and 615 nm was also observed, indicating the existence of charge transfer (CT) in TPY-TTF OG in the xerogel state. The closer analysis of the CT band showed that it consists of two distinguishable adjacent bands with absorption maxima at 510 and 565 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>; inset). Further, in-depth analysis through TD-DFT calculations showed CT absorption band at 498 nm and 564 nm, displaying quite fair agreement with the experimental results. The theoretical absorption at 498 nm was consist of both intramolecular (TTF to PhCONH-) and intermolecular (TTF to TPY) CT transitions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Whereas absorbance at 564 nm was attributed to the intramolecular (TTF-PhCONH-) CT transition. Based on the experimental and theoretical observations, the supramolecular assembly of TPY-TTF OG is represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>, which showed that for both, TTF---TPY as well as TTF---TTF stackings are feasible. The optical bandgap for TPY-TTF OG, calculated by the Kubelka-Munk plot derived from UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry, was found to be 2.26 eV (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Preparation and characterizations of TPY-TTF OG.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Photograph for organogel formation.

To this end, we have chosen Zn<sup>II</sup> as a metal node for binding with TPY as such self-assembly is well explored due to soft acid-base interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. We have performed titration of TPY-TTF (8 × 10<sup>−6</sup> M in MeOH) with a methanolic solution of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (8 × 10<sup>−4</sup> M), and corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Notably, the presence of isosbestic point in the Zn<sup>II</sup> titration suggested the complex formation between Zn<sup>II</sup> and TPY-TTF LMWG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The UV-vis titration study illustrated the binding of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and TPY-TTF in the ratio of 2:1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The association constant (K<sub>a</sub>) of the Zn<sup>II</sup> ion with TPY-TTF was calculated to be 2.8 × 10<sup>4</sup> by the Benesi-Hildebrand plot (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14c</xref>). Next, Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and TPY-TTF gelator was taken in a molar ratio of 2:1 in the solvent mixture of MeOH, DCM and H<sub>2</sub>O in 2:1:1 ratio, respectively. Heating the reaction mixture to 60 °C followed by cooling to room temperature has afforded a deep purple-coloured coordination polymer gel (Zn-TPY-TTF CPG) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Similar to OG, strain-sweep rheology experiments were performed for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG at 25 °C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>). The value of Gʹ and Gʺ upto 0.01% was found to be ~10 times larger for the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG than the OG, illustrating higher stability of the former one, which is possibly attained due to coordination of the Zn<sup>II</sup> ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. More importantly, in both cases, tan <italic>δ</italic> (=Gʺ/Gʹ) value was found to be lower than one before reaching yield strain point, which is the intrinsic property of the gel phase (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). Next, the morphology of the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was evaluated by FE-SEM upon drying the sample at 80 °C under vacuum, which showed the 3D entangled nanofibrous morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The aerogel of CPG was also prepared by the CPD method, which showed a similar morphology suggesting that the fibrous morphology of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG is driven through metal coordination with LMWG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). TEM studies revealed that nanoribbons form 3D interconnected fibrous morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The AFM images of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG revealed the height of nanoribbon is ~7 nm and the diameter is in the range of 40–80 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f–h</xref>). The elemental mapping of the xerogel exhibited the uniform distribution of Zn<sup>II</sup> in a 3D network of the CPG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>). EDAX and elemental analyses also correlated the 2:1 ratio of Zn<sup>II</sup>: TPY-TTF in the CPG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). The high-resolution TEM analysis exhibited ordering in the nanoribbon, and lattice fringes were observed with a distance of 3.6 Å, which could be attributed to the intermolecular π–π stacking between the TTF---TPY units from the [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Further, the PXRD pattern for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG xerogel showed a peak at 2<italic>θ</italic> = 24.9° (3.6 Å), which was also observed in the gel state, justifying the presence of π–π stacking (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). In order to evaluate the nature of stacking, TD-DFT calculations were performed, which showed that the packing of TTF with [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> on top of each other was stabilized with a distance of 3.56 Å (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j, l</xref>) which is in good agreement with the experimental observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. On the contrary, stacking through TTF---TTF units on the top of each other was optimized, which revealed the TTF---TTF distance &gt;11 Å due to steric repulsion among the [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> units attached to TTF core, and therefore, the possibility of TTF---TTF stacking was ruled out (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22a</xref>). Further, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG in xerogel state was found to be similar to the TPY-TTF OG with an enhanced absorption in the visible region as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>. To analyse the reason behind enhanced absorption in the visible range, TD-DFT calculations were performed for the stacked model of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The result showed that the band observed at 510 nm was similar to TPY-TTF OG. Whereas the experimental band at 565 nm is mainly attributed to the theoretical band at 553 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22b</xref>). Importantly, the transition at 553 nm was observed due to the significant contribution of intermolecular CT from TTF core to [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> unit as shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The dominated intermolecular CT transition in Zn-TPY-TTF CPG as compared to TTF-TPY OG is mainly triggered by the planarization of terpyridine ligand, which occurred after the complexation with Zn<sup>II</sup> ion in CPG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Additionally, Zn<sup>II</sup> complexation also increased the electron-accepting tendency of terpyridine ligand from the TTF moiety, which further facilitated the intermolecular CT transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. The optical bandgap for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was calculated to be 2.27 eV, which is closer to the bandgap of TPY-TTF OG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). Next, as a controlled study, we found energies of the LUMO for TTF(PhCONH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> and [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> are −1.91 and −2.17 eV, respectively, in the aqueous medium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), which indicates that excited-state electron transfer is energetically favourable from TTF(PhCONH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> core to [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> centre.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>DFT calculations for CT interaction and band alignments in TPY-TTF OG and Zn-TPY-TTF CPG.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> HOMO-LUMO charge-transfer transitions with corresponding contributions from intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer (CT) for TPY-TTF OG and Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, respectively. <bold>c</bold> HOMO-LUMO band alignments of TTF(PhCONH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> and [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> for thermodynamic feasibility of electron transfer in the aqueous medium.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_27457_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Mott-Schottky analysis was performed for the xerogel of both TPY-TTF OG and Zn-TPY-TTF CPG to evaluate experimental feasibility for water and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (see SI for details).

The photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production activity of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was screened with different sacrificial electron donors, and the best activity was found with triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial agent (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>). Photocatalytic activity of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was examined in both gel and xerogel state, and similar H<sub>2</sub> evolution was observed for both under similar conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27a</xref>). However, catalytic activities in different conditions were performed using the xerogel because of the ease of handling the catalyst in comparison to the gel state. After optimizing the catalyst loading (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>), 1 mg of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG in xerogel state was dispersed in 38 ml of water for the photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production, and 2 ml triethylamine (TEA) was added into it, which acted as a sacrificial electron donor. The photocatalytic activity of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was monitored by gas chromatography (GC) analysis and showed 10.60 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> of H<sub>2</sub> evolution in 20 h (activity = 530 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) upon visible-light irradiation as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>. The amount of H<sub>2</sub> evolved was reached saturation in 20 h, and the turnover number (TON) was calculated to be 23.5, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>. The activity is higher than many other transition metal-based photocatalysts (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for H<sub>2</sub> production using Zn-TPY-TTF CPG catalyst was calculated to be 0.76% at 550 ± 10 nm. Further, the absence of H<sub>2</sub> formation with Zn-TPY-TTF CPG under dark condition (absence of light) confirming light is an essential component for catalysis. Next, we have also performed the recyclability test by recollecting the catalyst followed by reusing the photocatalysis for four additional cycles of 6 h each time (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27b</xref>). Interestingly, the amount of H<sub>2</sub> evolution was found to be similar in every cycle (&gt;99%). We also performed ICP analysis for as-synthesized Zn-TPY-TTF CPG sample as well as recovered sample after photocatalysis. In both cases, the amount of Zn content was calculated to be 5.9 (±0.2) wt%. Next, recycled catalyst (Zn-TPY-TTF) was collected at the end of the fourth cycle and analysed by FE-SEM and TEM studies and suggested no significant change in the structure and morphology after the catalytic reaction indicating high stability of the catalyst (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27c, d</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Next, we have examined photocatalytic activity for the OG to compare the importance of morphology, i.e. the spatial arrangement of the chromophore and also the role of metal directed assembly in CPG. Experimental conditions employed for the TPY-TTF OG was similar to the CPG. Interestingly, the H<sub>2</sub> evolution by the TPY-TTF OG upon visible-light irradiation was increased with irradiation time and reached saturation in 22 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The maximum H<sub>2</sub> evolution in 20 h was calculated to be 2 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> (activity = 100 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>), which is albeit lesser than the CPG but higher than most of the reported metal-free photocatalysts for H<sub>2</sub> evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. To understand the significant difference in photocatalytic activities between TPY-TTF OG and Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, photocurrent measurements were performed for both (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) in the presence and absence of light. The photocurrent for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG in the presence of light was found to be double as compared to TPY-TTF OG. This indicates the facile charge separation in Zn-TPY-TTF CPG under light irradiation; therefore, expected to show better photocatalytic activity as compared to TPY-TTF OG. This argument has been further validated by the EIS measurement, where the charge-transfer resistance for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was observed to be significantly lesser as compared to TPY-TTF OG under both dark and light irradiated conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). This can be attributed to the nanoribbon morphology of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG that provides a continuous charge-transfer pathway (via co-facial intermolecular charge delocalization) for the photogenerated electrons, which ultimately enhances the photocatalytic activity.</p><p id="Par12">We have also performed the photocatalytic study with individual structural units of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG to evaluate the importance of coordination driven assembly of CPG in catalysis. Notably, individual components, such as TEA, TTF(COOH)<sub>4</sub>, TPY-NH<sub>2</sub>, and [Zn(TPY-NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> as well as the physical mixture of TTF(COOH)<sub>4</sub> and [Zn(TPY-NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> were found to be not efficient in catalysing H<sub>2</sub> evolution reaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). Next, the photocatalytic study has also been performed by making a blend of Zn<sup>II</sup> salt with TPY-TTF (in 2:1 ratio) (details are given in SI). This showed aggregated spherical morphology (sphere diameter 80 ± 10 nm) as confirmed by FE-SEM study (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>), and the corresponding H<sub>2</sub> evolution within 6 h was found to be three times lesser as compared to the CPG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). This signifies the impact of nano-structuring in photocatalytic performances. To validate the role of intermolecular CT interaction, we have also synthesized a coordination polymer of Zn<sup>II</sup> (Zn-CP) with TTF(COOH)<sub>4</sub> and characterized by FE-SEM, EDAX, elemental mapping, TGA, PXRD and UV-vis absorption study (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>). Zn-CP showed micron-sized spherical particles with a diameter in the range of 2–3 µm. The Zn-CP showed 0.8 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> of H<sub>2</sub> production from water in 12 h which is eight times lesser in activity in comparison to Zn-TPY-TTF CPG photocatalyst under a similar condition (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). Overall, control experiments have unambiguously indicated that the coordination driven spatial arrangement of donor–acceptor chromophores and corresponding CT interaction have high significance in visible-light photocatalytic performances of CPG (Zn-TPY-TTF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preparation and characterizations of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG</title><p id="Par13">Further, we envisioned that the entangled hierarchical fibrous structure of the coordination polymer gels could easily immobilize co-catalyst like Pt on the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, which would facilitate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers by decreasing diffusion length and eventually enhance the photocatalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>.

High-resolution TEM and FE-SEM analysis have confirmed the stabilization of Pt NPs in self-assembled networks of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG within the size range of 2–3 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">36a</xref>).

Drastically increased H<sub>2</sub> evolution after Pt NPs stabilization could be ascribed to the efficient charge separation in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG as Pt centre is a well-known electron acceptor that accumulates a pool of electrons and subsequently exhibits efficient water reduction. Here, the photoexcited electrons from Zn-TPY-TTF CPG using the harvested light energy transferred to Pt NPs surface to reduce water into H<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the recyclability and reusability of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution were evaluated upto four cycles similar to the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">39</xref>). Photocatalytic activity of the recycled catalyst was found to be retained &gt;95% after 4th cycle. The formation of the Schottky junction in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was helpful to separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This argument was further validated by the EIS measurement, where the charge-transfer resistance for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was found to be almost half as compared to Zn-TPY-TTF CPG under both dark and visible-light irradiation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38b</xref>). Furthermore, approximately four-folds higher photocurrent was observed for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG as compared to Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38c</xref>), which corroborated the facile electron transfer from the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG to the Pt centre. Further, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG showed weak emission with a maximum at 581 nm due to the intermolecular charge-transfer interaction (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 510 nm). (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">40</xref>). PL spectra for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG upon excitation at 510 nm showed significantly quenched emission compared to Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. Therefore, to gain more insight into the advantages of Pt NPs in the increased charge separation, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay was studied on the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">41</xref> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). A higher average lifetime Zn-TPY-TTF CPG system (1.95 ns) compared to Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG system (0.22 ns) obtained by the TRPL studies confirms that migration of photoexcited electrons is much faster in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF compared to Zn-TPY-TTF CPG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. The decrease in the lifetime is attributed to the enhanced separation of photogenerated electrons in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, which play decisive roles in enhancing the efficiency of photocatalytic processes. To understand the charge-separation dynamics, transient absorption (TA) experiments were performed with Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. The TA spectra of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">42a</xref>) showed a broad excited-state absorption (ESA) band covering 450–700 nm region at early time delay. Such a broad ESA band is due to TTF cation and TPY anion radical formed by the electron transfer process by the photoexcitation. TTF cation has an absorption band at ~440 nm with a long tail extending upto 700 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, and Zn-TPY anion radical complex has a broad absorption band covering the range of 500–600 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Thus, the appearance of a broad band at early time delay suggested that the electron transfer from TTF to Zn-TPY is very efficient in Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and takes place within the time resolution of the TA instrument (120 fs). The fitting of the decay trace at 570 nm due to TPY anion radical complex gives an average lifetime of 563 ps (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">42b</xref>). Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG showed qualitatively similar TA spectra as of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. However, the transient signal at 570 nm decays significantly faster in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (average lifetime is 174 ps, see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">42c</xref>). Such faster decay kinetics in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG suggest electron transfer from reduced Zn-TPY to Pt NPs. Besides the TRPL and TA results, DFT calculations also revealed that in Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, the electron transfer could take place from TTF to Pt NPs via [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> unit. We have investigated the possible loading positions of Pt NPs in the CPG theoretically and the details have been given in SI (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">44</xref>). We were able to perform the stabilization energy calculations upto four atoms Pt cluster due to computational limitation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">44</xref>) and detailed experimental study related to Pt NPs stabilization will be carried out in future works. Furthermore, AQE for the water reduction to H<sub>2</sub> was determined for the Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG upon irradiating with monochromatic light of the wavelength of 400 ± 10 nm, 450 ± 10 nm, 500 ± 10 nm, 550 ± 10 nm, 600 ± 10 nm, 650 ± 10 nm, and 700 ± 10 nm (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">45</xref>). Notably, the highest AQE was obtained to be 14.47% at 550 ± 10 nm. These experiments suggested that the photocatalytic activity is mainly driven through intermolecular charge-transfer interaction. The H<sub>2</sub> evolution using Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was examined under both light and dark conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">39c</xref>). No H<sub>2</sub> evolution was detected under dark condition, indicating the importance of light for water reduction. Next, photocatalysis was also performed for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF and Zn-TPY-TTF CPG without any sacrificial donor (TEA). The aqueous dispersion of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG produced 0.92 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> of H<sub>2</sub> in 20 h, which is 11 times lesser than with TEA. Similarly, Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG showed 30 times lesser activity without TEA (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>CO<sub>2</sub> reduction activity of OG and CPG under laboratory condition</title><p id="Par15">As mentioned above, the theoretical and experimental bandgap alignment of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and TPY-TTF OG has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> as well. Therefore, we have performed visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with the xerogel of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and also compared it with TPY-TTF OG. TEA was used as a sacrificial electron donor for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. First, screening of the solvent composition for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction has been performed (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">48</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>), and the mixture of acetonitrile: water (3:1) have shown the best activity which could be attributed to high solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in acetonitrile, whereas, water acted as a proton source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Visible-light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by Zn-TPY-TTF CPG yielded 3.51 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> of CO in 8 h with &gt;99% selectivity (activity = 438 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>. The AQE of CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG at 550 ± 10 nm was calculated to be 0.96%. Such a selective CO production is noteworthy and one of the best results among various reported hybrid photocatalysts systems (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The TON for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG in 8 h was calculated to be 7.8 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Recyclability test for the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG photocatalyst was performed for four cycles, similarly as employed for the water reduction. The photocatalytic performances of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG were found to be almost unchanged (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">49</xref>). Further, the photocatalytic activity of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was examined upon isotopic labelling with <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>.

The TPY-TTF OG has displayed 1.12 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> CO formation in 11 h with &gt;99% selectivity (activity = 140 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>), and the corresponding TON was estimated to be 2.1 as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Photocatalytic activity towards CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Amount and TON for CO formation in the presence of TPY-TTF OG under visible light. <bold>b</bold> Amount and TON for CO formation in the presence of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG under visible light. <bold>c</bold> TON for CO formation under sunlight from 28th to 30th Sept 2019 (10:00 am to 4:00 pm) in the presence of Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. <bold>d</bold> CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (amount of CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> formation with time) under visible light. <bold>e</bold> TON value and % selectivity for CH<sub>4</sub> formation using Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG under visible light. <bold>f</bold> TON for CH<sub>4</sub> formation from CO<sub>2</sub> upon sunlight irradiation from 1st to 3rd Oct 2019 (10:00 am to 4:00 pm) in the presence of Pt@ Zn-TPY-TTF CPG.

A noteworthy peak at 2074 cm<sup>−1</sup> was indicated for the formation of the CO<sup>*</sup>. Most importantly, the peak intensity of the CO<sup>*</sup> intermediate was substantially increased with reaction progress, suggesting CO<sup>*</sup> formation increases with time. Based on the experimental results and in situ DRIFT study, we have computed a plausible mechanism for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, which is also in good agreement with the earlier report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">66</xref>). The photocatalytic cycle was initiated by the light absorption due to CT interaction in Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, and electron transfer took place from the excited state of TTF<sup>*</sup> to [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> units followed by reductive quenching of TTF<sup>+</sup> by TEA. As a result, the [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> converted to the radical cation species [Zn(TPY˙<sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(TPY)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>. Notably, the electron spin density distribution plot revealed that the electron was localized at the terpyridine unit of the catalyst that resulted in [Zn(TPY˙<sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(TPY)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> species with the stabilization energy of 0.52 eV. (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">65d</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">35</xref>). Next, as the reaction progress, the acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN), solvent molecule replaced one ligating site of terpyridine to afford [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> which is slightly uphill (ΔG = +0.77 eV) with a low activation barrier of 0.81 eV. This [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> intermediate subsequently binds with CO<sub>2</sub> molecule with a distance of 2.41 Å to Zn<sup>II</sup> ion and yielded the [Zn(TPY)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COO<sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> species (ΔG = +0.46 eV). The formulation of the intermediate as [Zn(TPY)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COO<sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> rather than [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COO)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> is supported by the spin density distribution plot (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38</xref>). Notably, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule acted as a monodentate ligand, and the ∠O–C–O angle was found to be 139.36°, keeping in mind that the free CO<sub>2</sub> has linear geometry (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">65f</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38</xref>). Here, it is worth mentioning that the one-electron charging over the [Zn(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> complex favours the binding of CO<sub>2</sub> molecule by increasing electron density around the metal centre, which is a prerequisite for the nucleophilic attack to the CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the complex [Zn(TPY)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COO<sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> was further reduced to form the singlet species [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COO<sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)] (ΔG = −0.79 eV) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">65g</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">39</xref>). Next, the carboxylate centre of the singlet complex gets readily protonated and results in the formation of [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COOH)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> complex (ΔG = −2.88 eV) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">65h</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">40</xref>). In the next step, subsequent protonation and water elimination from [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(COOH)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> intermediate lead to the formation of [Zn(TPY)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(CO)]<sup>2<bold>+</bold></sup> which is found to be a highly downhill process (ΔG = −2.55 eV). (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">65i</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">41</xref>). In this complex, the CO molecule is loosely attached to the Zn<sup>II</sup> centre at a distance of 2.66 Å. As a result, the CO molecule can be easily released from the metal centre. Thus, the intermediate [Zn(TPY)(η<sup>2</sup>-TPY)(CO)]<sup>2<bold>+</bold></sup> gets readily reduced, leading to the subsequent removal of CO (ΔG = −1.51 eV) which regenerates the active species [Zn(TPY<bold>˙</bold><sup><bold>−</bold></sup>)(TPY)]<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> and re-enters into the catalytic cycle. Specifically, in this photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction mechanism, the Zn-terpyridine complex involves retention of the bis-terpyridine ligation to gain the original coordination environment similar to as-synthesized Zn-TPY-TTF CPG.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Real-time photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction monitoring through in situ DRIFT study.</title><p><bold>a</bold> For CO formation by Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. <bold>b</bold> For CH<sub>4</sub> formation by Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_27457_Fig8_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>CO<sub>2</sub> reduction activity of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG</title><p id="Par17">Next, the photocatalytic activity of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG towards CO<sub>2</sub> reduction has also been examined under a similar experimental condition as applied for CPG and OG. Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG showed excellent CO<sub>2</sub> reduction activity, and more interestingly, CH<sub>4</sub> was produced rather than CO as obtained for Zn-TPY-TTF CPG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). It has already been reported in the literature that the presence of Pt NPs on the surface of semiconductor plays a key role in the formation of CH<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The formation of CH<sub>4</sub> has reached saturation in 30 h, and the corresponding yield was calculated to be 8.74 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> (activity = 292 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). During CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> evolution was also observed (~ 0.20 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> in 30 h), which was more in the initial hours but significantly decreased as the reaction progressed with time. Thus, the selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CH<sub>4</sub> formation in 30 h was noted to be more than 97% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). The TON for CH<sub>4</sub> was calculated to be 63.4 (w.r.t. Pt loading on Zn-TPY-TTF CPG; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) in 30 h, which is better than many of the earlier reports (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The recyclability of the catalyst, Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was examined for 6 h upto four cycles, and the amount of CH<sub>4</sub> formation in the fourth cycle was found to be &gt;95%, indicating high stability of the catalyst (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">56</xref>). The ICP-OES analysis of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was also performed after the fourth catalytic cycle, which showed 2.52 wt% of Pt present in the recovered catalyst. The partial decrease in catalytic activity (&lt;5%) could be attributed to the minimal loss of Pt NPs during the recycling process. The AQE of the Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG towards CO<sub>2</sub> reduction was calculated at different wavelengths using monochromatic lights (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">54</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). The highest AQE for the CH<sub>4</sub> formation was obtained as 0.81% at 550 ± 10 nm, which further confirms that the photocatalytic activity of Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF is attributed to the intermolecular charge-transfer interactions. The CO<sub>2</sub> reduction was also performed under both light and dark conditions using Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">55</xref>). The CH<sub>4</sub> formation was not increased under dark condition, justifying the importance of light in photocatalysis. Further, photocatalysis was performed with labelled <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> (isotopic labelling) using Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">53</xref>). This showed the formation of labelled <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> and confirming that CO<sub>2</sub> is the actual source for the CH<sub>4</sub> formation. Next, we have performed in situ DRIFT experiment for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF in order to monitor the real-time progress of the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). IR-stretching peaks observed at 1610, 1570, and 1426 cm<sup>−1</sup> could be attributed to the intermediates COOH<sup>*</sup>, COO<sup>*</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>*</sup>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Weak intensity peak for the CO<sup>*</sup> at 2062 cm<sup>−1</sup> illustrated that the CO<sup>*</sup> could be readily converted to other multi-electron reduction intermediates.

Based on the DRIFT study, the plausible mechanism for the CH<sub>4</sub> formation was elucidated with the help of free energy calculation of different intermediates using DFT, which suggested that the Pt NPs is likely to be the catalytic centre during the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">70</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sunlight-driven H<sub>2</sub> production</title><p id="Par18">The above discussions have clearly shown that visible-light photocatalytic activity and stability of both Zn-TPY-TTF CPG and Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG in the xerogel state is indeed impressive. Notably, the amount of H<sub>2</sub> evolution using photocatalyst Zn-TPY-TTF CPG is higher than previously reported non-precious metal-based photocatalyst materials (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Therefore, our next goal was to examine the potential of Zn-TPY-TTF towards H<sub>2</sub> evolution upon direct sunlight irradiation at ambient condition (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>).

The weather condition corresponding to the above-mentioned period can easily be found out on the web (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.timeanddate.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.timeanddate.com</ext-link>). Interestingly, maximum H<sub>2</sub> evolution of 5.14 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> in 6 h (activity = 857 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) was observed on 15th April, which is comparable with the amount of H<sub>2</sub> obtained under laboratory conditions (Xe-lamp irradiation). The TON for H<sub>2</sub> evolution was calculated for the above-mentioned period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). The highest TON value of 11.9 was obtained on 15th April 2019.

Next, similar to Zn-TPY-TTF CPG, we have also examined sunlight-driven photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> evolution for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG in xerogel state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). The experimental condition for Pt@Zn-TPY-TTF CPG was similar to the Zn-TPY-TTF CPG. Nevertheless, experimental timing was different for the Pt@Zn- TPY-TTF CPG.

The FE-SEM and TEM analysis, PXRD, FT-IR and UV-vis absorption experiments were performed for the recovered catalysts and found to be similar to the as-synthesized material, indicating that the structural integrity of the material remained intact after photocatalysis (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">64</xref>).

Here, charge-transfer-driven photocatalysis based on coordination polymer gel has been exploited, where earth-abundant metal ions play a crucial role in the spatial organization of donor–acceptor π-chromophores to drive the catalytic activity. Further, we have shown the catalytic activity of the CPG after decorating Pt NPs as co-catalyst. It enhances the rate of H<sub>2</sub> production in 20 folds and dramatically changes the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction product from CO to CH<sub>4</sub>. We have also demonstrated efficient catalytic activity of the CPG and Pt decorated CPG under sunlight with high selectivity. The real-time reaction progress of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction was monitored by DRIFT studies, and based on that, a plausible mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction was elucidated for CPG. The easy processability and structural tunability of LMWG offers a lot of room for designing efficient photocatalyst materials for practical application. Our work will pave the way toward designing coordination driven hybrid soft processable photocatalyst systems for solar energy driven fuel production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Reagent</title><p id="Par21">Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), 1,3-diaminopropane, 4′-chloro-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine, Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O), Ethyl-4-bromobenzoate (Br-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOEt), Cesium carbonate (Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), Palladium acetate, Tri-tertbutyl-phosphonium tetrafluoroborate (P<italic>tBu</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub>.HBF<sub>4</sub>), Thionyl chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>), Chloroplatinic acid (H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich chemical Co.
