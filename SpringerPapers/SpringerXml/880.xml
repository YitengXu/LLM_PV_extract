Towards this end, synergic assembly of these two building blocks is a key step but remains a challenge. Here, we show a one-step strategy for organizing QDs in a graphene matrix via interfacial self-assembly, leading to the formation of sandwiched hybrid QD-graphene nanofilms. We have explored structural features, electron transfer kinetics and photocurrent generation capacity of such hybrid nanofilms using a wide variety of advanced techniques. Graphene nanosheets interlink QDs and significantly improve electronic coupling, resulting in fast electron transfer from photoexcited QDs to graphene with a rate constant of 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Efficient electron transfer dramatically enhances photocurrent generation in a liquid-junction QD-sensitized solar cell where the hybrid nanofilm acts as a photoanode. We thereby demonstrate a cost-effective method to construct large-area QD-graphene hybrid nanofilms with straightforward scale-up potential for optoelectronic applications.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09860.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep09860" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep09860</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colloidal nanocrystals are among the essential building blocks employed in design and architecture of advanced functional materials because of their ability to interface inorganic, organic and biological components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among many applications studied, the use of colloidal nanocrystals for the fabrication of electronic and optoelectronic devices is of particular interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A colloidal nanocrystal is typically composed of an inorganic particle core and a capping layer. When the inorganic core of the particle is a semiconductor, the nanocrystal is commonly termed quantum dot (QD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. QDs exhibit strong quantum-size effects, leading to a sensitively size-tunable bandgap and high luminescence quantum yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These characteristics make them promising materials for a wide range of purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For example, their impressive contributions to biomedical research in the past two decades is well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and QDs have been crucial in the research and development of next-generation solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the latter, QDs are recognized as a novel type of light harvesters due to their high extinction coefficient, versatile tunability, high stability and capability of multiple exciton generation.</p><p>In a QD-sensitized solar power conversion system, the two key components are the QDs as sensitizer and the electrode as electron acceptor. Metal oxides (MO) such as TiO<sub>2</sub> particles and ZnO nanowires have been the most commonly used electrode materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The overall efficiency of a solar power conversion system is controlled by a sequence of electronic events. Upon photoexcitation of the QDs, charge separation proceeds via interfacial electron transfer (ET) or hole transfer (HT) from QDs to the electrodes. The development of new electrode materials, synergic assembly of the two key components and understanding of charge transport mechanisms are the central issues towards realizing optimal design and construction of high-performance QD based solar power conversion systems. Our recent efforts have been devoted to some of these fundamental aspects such as the ET mechanisms and key determinant factors in the systems consisting of CdSe QDs and ZnO nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, we have offered a precise approach both theoretically and experimentally to directed energy transfer in thin films composed of QDs with different sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>Graphene as a wonder material has emerged at an unprecedented pace over the past decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This material has continued to develop as an effective alternative to many conventional optoelectronic, photonic, plasmonic and energy materials. A recent report provides clear evidence for ultra-fast collinear scattering and carrier multiplication in graphene itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In contrast to its counterparts, the carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, the two-dimensional crystalline structure and high flexibility of graphene make it an ideal platform for the architecture of hetero-structured nanocomposites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> that can further improve light-matter interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Graphene can promote the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors for solar energy conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and combining chemically exfoliated graphene with QDs could produce a new kind of optoelectronic nanocomposite with high light-harvesting efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. A state-of-the-art study recently by Konstantatos and co-workers has clearly demonstrated that hybrid graphene-QD films enable achieving an ultrahigh gain of electrons per photon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, which is expected to significantly promote the development of new-generation phototransistors based on hybrid QD-graphene materials. Furthermore, solution-processed routes offer a cost-effective and operation-flexible method for the preparation of thin-film based photovoltaic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, synergic assembly of QDs and graphene nanosheets remains a challenging issue. Our current efforts aim at optimizing assembly of QDs in a graphene matrix for highly-efficient electron transfer. In this work, we have demonstrated that two-phase solution processing enables simultaneous attachment and self-assembly of sandwiched QD-graphene hybrid nanofilms. The as-prepared hybrid films show fast photoinduced electron transfer and display significant enhancement of photocurrent generation compared to the films composed of pure QDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Self-assembled construction of QD-graphene hybrid nanofilms</title><p>The building block materials, including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and CdSe QDs were first synthesized and characterized. GO was prepared according to our previous procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and characterized systematically. Single-layered GO suspensions were obtained and tested for two-phase reduction by hydrazine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figs. S1-S3</xref>). CdSe QDs (2.9 nm) were synthesized as reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and are featured by a strong absorption peak at 542 nm. The CdSe QD surface capped with oleic acid (OA) with a long alkyl chain is strongly hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>) facilitating a uniform dispersion of such QDs in toluene.</p><p>In a typical two-phase synthesis, we used toluene as the oil (O) phase and water (W) as the aqueous phase. Prior to heat-assisted reduction, CdSe QDs were dispersed solely in the toluene phase (the top layer in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), while GO nanosheets were located only in the aqueous solution (the bottom layer in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). For example, the initial absorbance of CdSe QDs at 542 nm is 0.25 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The water phase became almost colorless upon the reduction of GO to RGO by hydrazine, while the toluene phase color changed to dark brown. This is due to the attachment of CdSe QDs to RGO (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The attachment of QDs to RGO nanosheets from the toluene phase is evidenced by a dramatic decrease of the 542 nm absorbance to 0.01 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), i.e. only 4.6% CdSe QDs remained in the organic phase. The UV-vis spectra thus indicate that CdSe QDs from the toluene phase were strongly adsorbed onto the graphene nanosheet surface, driven by the hydrophobic interactions between the RGO planes and the capping ligand on the CdSe QDs. This is supported by AFM. High-resolution AFM images show that RGO nanosheets obtained by the O/W interface method have a lateral dimension of 1-2 μm with a height around 0.6-0.8 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). AFM images of CdSe QDs (e.g., <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) show an average height of ca. 3 nm, consistent with the TEM results (on average 2.9 nm). Once CdSe QDs met graphene nanosheets at the O/W interfaces, they were adsorbed on the graphene nanosheet surface in stable monolayers or sub-monolayers (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Formation and microscopic characterization of QDs-RGO hybrid composite.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>) Photographs of two-phase solutions before (<bold>a</bold>) and after (<bold>b</bold>) interfacial reduction of GO nanosheets.

When the QDs were heated in the presence of hydrazine, no peak shift is observed either but the intensity is reduced, most likely due to slight quenching by hydrazine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S6c</xref>). Little effect on the ET kinetics was observed, evidenced by similar kinetic photoluminescence (PL) spectra recorded before and after the treatment (see the discussion in the ultrafast spectroscopic analysis part).</p><p>By pre-inserting a quartz or glass substrate into the beaker and removing the reaction solution, a large-area RGO-QDs nanofilm is formed directly on the substrate surface via spontaneous and fast growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The RGO-QDs films on the quartz surface exhibit grey to dark brown color, depending on the film thickness which is mainly controlled by the concentration of GO. The color is dominated by graphene as the color of QDs is weak compared with graphene (e.g. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The presence of QDs in the organic phase thus does not affect spontaneous and fast growth of nanofilms, as long as the appropriate ratio (w/w) of GO to QDs is used.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Morphologic observations of QDs doped RGO nanofilms.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) Photograph of the nanofilm on a quartz substrate.

This technique offers a general overview of the crystallinity of a sample and the detailed crystalline structure, i.e. symmetry/phase and lattice constants for highly-ordered materials. As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> (blue line), the XRD pattern of pure QDs exhibits the typical characteristics of Zinc-blende CdSe structures with space groups of F-43m and a lattice constant of 6.14 Å. Three major peaks are observed at 2θ of 26°, 42° and 49°, corresponding to the crystal planes (111), (220) and (311)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The slight broadening of all three peaks indicates a size reduction of the QDs compared to bulk CdSe. In contrast, the XRD pattern of the pure RGO nanofilms is broad and featureless (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, black line), attributed to the (002) plane of O/W treated RGO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We compare the XRD patterns of pure QDs treated with O/W (green line) and QD-RGO (red line) samples. They both retain the structural characters of pure QDs without any peak shift or broadening. The results suggest that neither O/W treatment nor attachment to RGO causes changes in the QDs lattice structure or in the size distribution of crystallized QDs. These observations are consistent with the HRTEM analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S8d</xref>). However, the broad and featureless background occasionally observed is likely induced by some amorphous materials that cannot be structurally resolved by XRD. It is thus necessary to complement the characterization of our samples by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XAS does not require a material having long range order and can offer more accurate structural information about the first coordination sphere around the absorbing element.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Structural characterization of various graphene nanofilms by XRD and EXAFS.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) XRD spectra of various samples.

This indicates that the local order in the QDs and the O/W treated QDs found in the oil phase of the O/W mixture is the same. This is largely as expected, as the XRD patterns are indeed similar too (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The noise recorded in the green trace is simply due to the lower density of CdSe QDs in the QD-RGO samples than that in the pure QD samples drop-casted on quartz substrates. It should also be noted that the pure RGO samples do not show any absorption jump, as expected. However, the XANES L3 edge for the QD-RGO samples displays some differences (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, red trace) for some of the sampling spots investigated during the beam time. There is clearly an additional pre-edge absorption peak at 3540 eV in the QD-RGO sample, as shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, along with an overall alteration of the near-edge spectral lineshape. This indicates that another species containing Cd (denoted as Cd-X) is present in the QD-RGO samples. For the species Cd-X, however, the neighboring atoms of the Cd atom are not Se atoms, which is in principle the only possibility in pure QDs. The comparison with the CdO reference (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, grey trace) shows that the Cd-X species is not a simple CdO oxide either. The same trends are observed at the Se K edge in the QD XANES (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). This leads to the conclusion that there is at least another Se-containing species (denoted as Se-Y) in the QD-RGO samples as well.</p><p>We <italic>then</italic> turn to the analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at the Se K edge to investigate the Se coordination in more detail. First, from the k<sup>3</sup> weighted EXAFS function in k space, we can see a uniform, strong, well-defined, undamped oscillation for both the pure QDs and QDs-RGO samples until k = 14 Å<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). This means that the degree of disorder quantified by the Debye Waller factor is not significant. In other words, the QD-RGO samples probably contain Cd-X and Se-Y species but do not present compositional disorder, i.e. overall retaining well defined first coordination shells after QD/RGO attachment (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>.). This feature is even better reflected in the Fourier transform in R space, as shown without phase shift correction (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). The data clearly offer the evidence for the distance at which a neighbor of Se can be found. The main peaks for both pure QD and QD-RGO samples appear around 2.40 Å with a narrow distribution. This distance is the typical Cd-Se atom spacing in CdSe QDs. This peak is found at 2.63 Å after the phase shift correction in real space. However, the intensity of this peak decreases in QD-RGO and an additional peak appears at a shorter distance (1.3 Å). This indicates a coordination of Se with neighbors at a shorter distance (e.g. with low Z neighboring atoms C, N, O, since the distance is shorter than 2 Å).</p><p>As for the origin of this additional low-Z coordinated atom, <italic>first</italic> we can exclude the possibility of surface Se-O. Such a bond is present in a 1:4/3:4 ratio in the pure QD, but this peak is not observed in the pure QD samples. <italic>Secondly</italic>, the assignment as originating from Se-C where C belongs to RGO is not warranted either. This is due to the fact that only a very small amount of the surface Se atoms are involved in the bonding, regardless of the bonding nature (covalent, chemisorbed or physically adsorbed). We therefore suggest the following possible origin: during the synthesis, some QDs may not be fully passivated by the capping agent. As a consequence, such QDs react with hydrazine and decompose into Cd and Se ions. The charged ions could be trapped by the dangling bonds of RGO to form isolated Cd-RGO or/and Se-RGO species. In contrast, fully passivated QDs can survive in the oil phase and indirectly attach to RGO nanosheets via the OA alkyl chain while retaining their well-defined nanocrystalline structures. We believe that the majority of the QDs in the QDs-RGO samples are, however, fully protected by OA, as supported by the XRD patterns (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and the TEM analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ultrafast spectroscopy of electron transfer kinetics</title><p>We analyze the photo-induced kinetics of the QD-RGO system using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopies.

In order to identify different kinetic components, three types of samples were investigated in parallel: (1) pure OA capped QDs (i.e. neat QDs); (2) QDs extracted from the upper oil phase after QD-RGO synthesis (i.e. QDs treated). The upper solution was first centrifuged to remove the residual QD-RGO sheets and then dropcast on the glass (or quartz) substrate. It therefore only contains the neat QDs unattached to RGO.

It should be noted that during the measurements the excitation flux was kept very low (2.2 × 10<sup>10</sup> photons/cm<sup>2</sup>/pulse) giving an average number of excitons per QD (&lt;<italic>N&gt;</italic>) 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. The Auger recombination of multiexcitions is negligible at such low excitation flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. As summarized in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the PL decay of pure OA capped QDs exhibits a major long-lived component (7.3 ns) which can be attributed to radiative recombination in the QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

The deviation of quenching rates is typically within 7% (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p>In general both energy transfer and charge separation can account for PL quenching. The Dexter type energy transfer can occur in case of wave function overlap between the donor and acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

The Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been reported in several other QD-graphene composite systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.

Given the distance (d) between the QD center to graphene sheets 3.5 nm (i.e. the QD radius (1.5 nm) plus the 2 nm chain length of oleic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>), τ<sup>0</sup><sub>QD</sub> = 7.3 ns, α = 1/137, ε = 4.5 for glass substrate, emission wavelength of QDs λ<sub>0</sub> = 560 nm and randomly oriented dipole constant ν = 4/3 (ν = (2/3)ν<sub>||</sub>+(1/3)ν<sub>⊥</sub>), the maximum FRET rate in our system is estimated to be 3.9 × 10<sup>8</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. This estimated rate is significantly lower than the measured quenching rate (1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), suggesting that the FRET does occur but is a minor process in the present system. We therefore conclude that charge transfer is a dominating photo-induced process in the QD-RGO nanocomposite.</p><p>We further identified the charge separation to be electron injection from the conduction band (CB) of QDs to RGO by a comparison of TRPL spectra with TA analysis. The density of the excited electron states at the band-edge transition of CdSe QDs is significantly smaller than the corresponding density of the hole states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In the effective-mass approximation, the lowest excited electron state is only twofold degenerate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In addition, the hole states are more closely spaced in QDs. As a consequence, the signal of excited state bleaching of CdSe QDs is dominated by the state filling of electrons rather than the holes. At the same time the PL is sensitive to both carriers (i.e. electrons and holes). Consequently, the TA signal provides a means to ascertain or preclude the involvement of electron depopulation in PL quenching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, the TA kinetics probed at the maximum of bleaching (560 nm) of neat QDs and treated QDs exhibits similar average lifetime as TRPL. In particular, the normalized TA and TRPL decay curves of RGO-QDs sample almost follow each other (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). This comparison offers strong evidence that the emission quenching is caused by the depopulation of excited electrons in QDs.</p><p>An interesting concern is the effect of QD sizes on charge or energy transfer dynamics. We used a simplified way to evaluate this issue, i.e. by monitoring the dynamics of PL with different wavelength, as it reflects the size distribution in our QDs. We picked PL dynamics of RGO-QDs at two different wavelengths (500 nm and 600 nm) corresponding to a mean size of 2.3 nm and 4.6 nm, respectively. The PL decay follows the almost same trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>), indicating that the quenching rate is almost independent on the QDs size in our case. Although the reason for that is not clear yet, the results can simplify our conclusion that the electron transfer rate depends mainly on the QD-graphene coupling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Rational analysis of the nature of charge transfer</title><p>The band energy diagrams shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> prompt theoretical observations regarding the prevalence of electron or hole transfer. Electron transfer involves, <italic>first</italic> transfer of photo-excited electrons from the bottom of the QD conduction band (CB) to the graphene Fermi level or levels above this level, in a weakly exothermic process, i.e. the energy gap is ≤ 0.7 eV (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Hole transfer, or electron transfer is in the opposite direction, i.e. from electronic levels around the graphene Fermi level to levels below the top of the QD valence band (VB), liberated by QD photo-excitation. The energy gap of this process is much larger, namely 1.7 vs 0.7 eV. <italic>Secondly</italic>, electron or hole transfer between the molecular-size QD (2-3 nm) and graphene in the condensed matter environment (here solid state) must involve substantial nuclear reorganization, say low-frequency collective vibrational reorganization in the graphene matrix.

As no vacant electronic acceptor levels in the QD band gap are available, hole transfer from QD VB to graphene or equivalently electron transfer from graphene to QD VB therefore involves an energy gap that exceeds significantly the environmental nuclear reorganization free energy. In other words, hole transfer belongs to the strongly exothermic inverted reaction free energy region. In this region the rate constant drops approximately exponentially with increasing energy gap as first introduced for multi-phonon solid state electronic relaxation processes by Pekar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and by Kubo and Toyozawa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and broadly known for non-radiative electronic relaxation in large molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

The most likely scenario is then that the electrons are transferred through the metallic leads to the Pt-counter electrode where S is reduced to S<sup>2−</sup>. The holes left in the QDs are filled by oxidation of S<sup>2−</sup> to S. The ITO/graphene/QD electrode is thus the anode and the electrochemical process dominated by <italic>electron</italic> injection from this electrode to the Pt-cathode. In short, the photoelectrochemical experiments demonstrate: 1) QD-graphene hybrid nanofilm is a highly active optoelectronic material, which can be directly used as a photoanode in liquid-junction QD-sensitized solar cells; and 2) the results are consistent with those obtained by the ultrafast spectroscopy and rational analysis, i.e. electron transfer is a pre-dominant process in the present system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Large-area QD containing thin films are highly desirable for the fabrication of QD-sensitized solar cells and other QD based optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, it is noted that liquid-junction solar cells are on the way to become a new-generation efficient energy conversion setup for utilization of solar energy. To this end, graphene offers both an efficient scaffold platform and an electronically functional component. The present study has shown the feasibility of such type of combinations. The two-phase solution processing facilitates the formation of QD doped RGO nanofilms where the QDs retain their crystalline structures. We have employed ultrafast spectroscopies to study charge transfer kinetics in detail and to identify the nature of charge transfer, which is accompanied by rational analysis and photoelectrochemical measurements. A comparison of PL and TA spectra leads to the conclusion that electron injection rather than hole injection occurs from photoexcited QDs to graphene. The photoelectrochemical results offer strong evidence that electron transfer is a pre-dominant process over Förster energy transfer, in contrast to most previous reports. In short, graphene nanosheets enable multiple sandwich-like confinement of the QDs with a dramatic improvement of electronic coupling, leading to fast long-range electron transfer from QDs to graphene and a 15-20 fold enhancement in photocurrent generation. The performance of hybrid films, including electron transfer rate and photocurrent generation, could be further improved by removing the capping ligand oleic acids from QD surfaces, as suggested by a recent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, the stability of hybrid films could then become an issue of concern.</p><p>It is argued that electron transfer, rather than hole transfer is mostly likely to prevail in a charge transfer mechanism and that electron transfer belongs to the activationless free energy region, while hole transfer belongs to the “inverted” free energy region. The simplest representation of the rate constant, k<sub>ET</sub> is then<disp-formula id="Equ4"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09860_Equ4_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>with no activation free energy term. ω<sub>eff</sub> is the effective vibrational frequency of all nuclear modes reorganized and κ the electronic transmission coefficient which can be given the approximate exponential distance dependence form shown. R is the ET distance and κ<sub>0</sub> a quantity of the order unity. β (length<sup>−1</sup>) is the decay factor often with β ≈ 1 Å<sup>−1</sup> for ET through covalently bonded molecular matter but with both smaller and larger values reported.</p><p>We are unable to directly calculate the rate constants with sufficient confidence since the structural details of the capping oleic acid relative to QD and the graphene layers are not known. What we can do in comparing this simple formalism with the fluorescence decay and transient absorption date is to estimate the ET parameters needed for accordance with the data. The maximum value of ω<sub>eff</sub> would be ≈ 10<sup>13</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (10<sup>14</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), giving for the observed rate constant of 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> a transmission coefficient of κ ≈ 10<sup>−4</sup>-10<sup>−5</sup> for ET to be competitive. This corresponds to a β-value of about 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> if R is 20 Å (the oleic acid chain length) and 0.3 Å<sup>−1</sup> if R is 35 Å (the QD also included.). These values appear notably smaller compared with the often recorded value of β ≈ 1 Å<sup>−1</sup> but two observations are appropriate.</p><p>One observation is that the β-value depends sensitively on the tilt angle of the molecular linker giving a smaller value for larger tilt angles. This effect is rooted in the nature of the dominating molecular orbitals in the superexchange pathway between the donor (here the QD) and the acceptor (graphene). These orbitals change as the tilt angle changes. The other observation is that the process presently considered involves an excited electronic state whereas β-values around 1 Å<sup>–1</sup> determined from electrochemical processes at self-assembled molecular monolayers involve electronic ground states. This could lower the β-value as the energy gap between the donor and the intermediate molecular electronic levels, Δ, is significantly smaller, cf. the equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup><disp-formula id="Equ5"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09860_Equ5_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>a</italic> is the average extension of an intermediate molecular fragment and γ the electronic coupling between two nearest neighbor fragments in the molecular conduction chain.</p><p>High-energy excited states and low β-values finally raise the question whether electron “hopping”, say via the orbitals associated with the oleic acid double bond may be a contributing channel. This would further lower the apparent β-values. Weak distance dependence thus cannot distinguish between exponential and other well behaved distance dependence such as the inverse polynomial dependence characteristic for hopping. The conclusion is that the extracted ET parameters can well be in ranges where the ET decay channel prevails. A definite proof requires, however, more detailed structural information about the RGO-QD composites than presently available.</p><p>The present work is focused on the 2.9 nm CdSe QDs capped with oleic acid. However, the method applies to different-size CdSe QDs as well as to other types of QDs. CdSe QDs with other sizes were synthesized for preparation of RGO-CdSe QDs films (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>), in order to address size-dependent effects in the enhancement of photoinduced excited-state kinetics in on-going research.

RGO-CdSe QDs samples were also prepared using O/W induced interfacial assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S12b</xref>). In addition, CdSe QDs capped with different types of ligands instead of oleic acid have been used for the formation of RGO-CdSe QDs thin films, although they need to be studied in detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chemicals and Materials</title><p>Graphite power (&lt;20 μm, synthetic), potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>, ≥99%), potassium persulfate (K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, ≥99%), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, ≥99.999%), phosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, ≥98%), sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 95-97%), hydrazine hydrate solution (50-60%), ammonia solution (25%), toluene (99.9%), Cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.5%), selenium (Se,&gt;99.5%), oleic acid (OA,&gt;99%), octadecane (ODE, ≥95%), trioctylphospine (TOP,&gt;90%), Sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S) and Sulfur (S, ≥99.5%) were all from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

The detailed procedure is described as follows. The whole procedure for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) included two steps. In the first step, pre-oxidized graphite was prepared first. Graphite powder (5.0 g) was slowly added with strong stirring for 3 h into a hot water bath (80 °C), which contained concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution (7.5 ml), P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (2.5 g) and K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (2.5 g).

KMnO<sub>4</sub> (3.0 g) was then added to the mixture under slow stirring. The mixture was kept at 35 °C for about 2 h with slow stirring. 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution and Milli-Q water were added next into the mixture. Depending on the concentration wanted, the color changed from dark green to bright yellow. Finally, the mixture was washed with HCl solution to remove residual metal ions. The raw GO was then centrifuged and dialysed several times to obtain highly purified and dispersed GO.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Preparation of CdSe quantum dots (QDs)</title><p>The oleic acid (OA) protected CdSe QDs were synthesized using our previous procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, where different sizes of CdSe QDs (2.4 nm, 2.7 nm, 2.9 nm, 3.1 nm) were prepared, corresponding to absorption bands at 505, 526, 542, 551 nm, respectively. In brief, 10.5 g trioctylphosphine (TOP) and 3 mmol Se powder were dissolved in 10 ml octadecane (ODE) for 1 h stirring to receive a TOP-Se solution. At the same time, under the protection of N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere of a three-neck flask, 5.54 g OA and 0.51 g CdO were slowly added into 70 ml ODE solution and then heated to 180 °C forming a clear solution. The first TOP-Se solution obtained was quickly transferred into the three-neck flask. During the injection of TOP-Se solution, the Cd<sup>2+</sup> precursor solution was heated to 180, 200, 220 and 240 °C separately to obtain different sizes of QDs. After about 2 minutes’ reaction, the flask was quickly removed from the hotplate and cooled to room temperature. Methanol and acetone were used to rinse the precipitate of QDs, which was re-dissolved in the toluene for further use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Preparation of pure RGO nanofilms by O/W two-phase solution processing</title><p>RGO nanofilm was prepared by chemical reduction of GO with hydrazine in the O/W two-phase system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Briefly, mixing GO (0.15 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) in water solution and toluene together in volume ratio of 1:1 and then separating the two parts in a beaker, leaves toluene as the top layer. 100 μL hydrazine hydrate solution (5%) was added to the mixed solution and left for incubation in a water bath at 95 °C with strong stirring. The reduction reaction was fast and completed within 15 min, but was normally left for 30 min. The graphene nanosheets were spontaneously self-assembled at the interfaces between water and toluene or between toluene and glass wall. No RGO was left in the obviously fully transparent water phase. The as-prepared graphene nanosheets could be transferred onto a special substrate such as glass or quartz for device or other application. Pre-inserting a quartz substrate into the beaker and drop-casting the reaction solution immediately lead to spontaneous and fast growth of large-area RGO nanofilms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Preparation of RGO-QDs nanofilms by O/W two-phase solution processing</title><p>OA-capped CdSe QDs were dispersed in toluene, which could be used directly in the O/W two-phase system instead of only toluene. These two phases were prepared for synthesizing large-area graphene-QDs nanosheets by the O/W interface method. We attempted different ratios of GO to QDs to prepare the hybrid films. It was found that the optimal ratio is towards a volume ratio of 1:1 with a GO (0.15 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) water solution and a QDs toluene (8.13 μmol l<sup>−1</sup>) solution. This ratio ensured all individual RGO nanosheets to be decorated with QDs before their self-assembly into nanofilms. Before reaction, CdSe QDs with the orange color are located only in the toluene phase (with 542 nm peak absorption as an example). The dark yellow color in the bottom layer is from GO. After reaction with hydrazine at 95 °C for 30 min, the water phase became clear and colorless, while the QD phase changed to dark color forming RGO doped with CdSe QDs. When carefully examined the QD phase showed that most of the RGO-QDs layer adhered to the interface between toluene and water and some on the glass wall.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Photoelectrochemical measurements</title><p>Photoelectrochemistry was carried out using an in-house designed electrochemical cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.

The diameter of the pump beam at the sample was about 5 mm (not focused), while a 50 cm focal length concave mirror was used to focus the probe beam onto the sample. The focus spot size of the probe at the sample was about 0.5 mm and centered at the maximum of the pump beam in order to minimize the effects of intensity variation along the pump beam cross-section on the dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.
