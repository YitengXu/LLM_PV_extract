These variables are related to the areas of weather, physical structure, control, and load behavior. Estimating the future value of the active power to be generated is difficult due to their unpredictable character. However, because of the higher precision required of the estimation, this problem becomes more complex if we examine a short-term temporal prediction. This study presents a method for converting stochastic behavior into a stable pattern, which can subsequently be used in a short-term estimator. For this conversion, K-means clustering is employed, followed by Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithms to perform the Short-term estimate. The environment, the operation, and the generated (normal or faulty) signal are all simulated using mathematical models. Weather parameters and load samples have been collected as part of a dataset. Monte-Carlo simulation using MATLAB programming has been realized to conduct an experiment. In addition, the LSTM and the GRU are compared to see how well they perform in this system. The proposed method's end findings outperform the current state-of-the-art.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Renewable energy</kwd><kwd>Smart home</kwd><kwd>Short-term prediction</kwd><kwd>Stochastic behavior</kwd><kwd>Deep learning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>50</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13198_2022_Article_1649.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Quality Control, Reliability, Safety and Risk</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A smart grid is an electricity network enabling a two-way flow of electricity and data with digital communications technology. This gives the ability of monitoring, managing, and automatic decision-making. Besides, smart grid uses a wide range of resources based on information technology techniques to enable new and existing guidelines in minimizing energy costs and reducing electricity wastes. According to Ali et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>), the smart grid is one of the most complicated and largest systems considering the design and building processes, although it is one of the easiest to use. It uses all kinds of power plants (including hydro, solar, coal, nuclear, wind turbine, and natural gas, among others), substations, transformers, and high-voltage transmission lines (Hasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>), therefore, there is the need for a demand-responsive electrical grid with high efficiency of energy use. The traditional grid uses a one-way limited interaction, in which power flows to the consumers from the power plant. In contrast, the smart grid introduces a two-way interchange in which involve the exchange both information and electricity, in both directions (between consumer and power utilities). The growing network of computers, automation, control, and communications are instrumental in making the grid “greener”, more reliable, more secure and more efficient (Hasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">These grids could provide a rich dataset that could be used for analyzing and monitoring their activities, but these could also be used to provide an opportunity to use this data in different applications as well, such as using them for sensor data (Jakkula and Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">This data could be useful when being set to work with different aspects or dimensions of SmartGrid such as integration with renewable energy sources, management of intermittent power supplies, real-time data responses as well as the energy pricing strategies among others (Jakkula and Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). As such, it becomes a necessity that we would develop the right tools and methods which could help in conserving the energy by gathering the data from the smart grid using sensors which could then be used to recognize patterns from previous data and forecast or predict in order to conserve energy in the smart grids.</p><p id="Par5">Some of the algorithm that could be used for prediction which are related to deep learning algorithms like Long-short term memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In this work, the used predictor is the most efficient one of them, in terms of accuracy and delay.</p><p id="Par6">LSTM is an RNN variant that is meant specifically for time series data. The LSTM is used in addressing this problem in addition to empowering RNNs algorithms using internal memory cells (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">RNNs are a form of neural networks that adopt the feedback connections in various nodes in remembering the previous time steps values. As such, they can capture the time series data’s temporal behaviour. (Tealab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">GRU is a kind of gated RNN which is largely used in mitigating the gradient vanishing problem of RNNs using gating mechanism in addition to making the structure simpler without interfering with the effect of LSTM neural network (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">GRU addresses the vanishing gradient problem, which are the values used in updating network weights. According to (Agarap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>), GRU can solve this problem using two gates, the rest gate and the update gate. The gates are instrumental in deciding the information that is allowed to pass to the output in addition to having the ability to be trained for retaining information from farther back, thus allowing it to pass relevant information through a variety of events for making better predictions.</p><p id="Par10">However, since these prediction methods are based on regression techniques, which tries to find a common pattern for the historical samples to use it to predict the future values. Considering our application, the historical samples from the energy generators and also the load of the smart city, may not have a constant pattern. This is due to the stochasticity behavior of the environment. Therefore, in order to convert this dynamicity to a static pattern, in this work, K-Means clustering algorithm is used.</p><p id="Par11">K-means clustering algorithm refers to a simple unsupervised learning algorithm used in solving clustering problems which is useful in clustering analysis. According to (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>), the algorithm is applied using certain procedures that classify a certain set of data into clusters defined by the letter "K."</p><p id="Par12">Although several works have tackled the problem of the prediction in the SmartGrid context, most of these works focus only on the long-term prediction. The advantage of the long-term prediction is in bringing long-term strategy and planning, However, the methods that are currently used for this task provides in accurate predictions. On the other hands, short and very shorts terms predictions are important for the real-time control of the SmartGrid which requires real-time information from the real load and the natural resources in addition to the physical structure of the solar panels. Moreover, providing an accurate short-term prediction for the generated energy is also a challenging problem. This is due to the fact, that the amount of generated energy depends on several parameters, from the physical components of the unit to the weather conditions. All these parameters are totally stochastic and do not follow any accurate pattern.</p><p id="Par13">Our methodology in this work is to convert the stochastic behavior of the attributes into an accurate pattern using a clustering algorithm (i.e., K-Means). This allows us to be able to identify their fitting curve and use a suitable regression-based algorithm (i.e., LSTM and GRU) for an accurate short-term prediction.</p><p id="Par14">The main objective of this work is to propose a method that allows enhancing the accuracy of the short-term generated power prediction for the SmartGrid environment.</p><p id="Par15"><bold>The main contributions</bold> to the existing body of knowledge that this study will make include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par16">Identify the most useful factors that affects the accuracy of the Smart Grid short term prediction process.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">Implement a model (or a combination of already existing models) for recognizing patterns of failure in the Smart Grid.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Identification of the best deep learning algorithm to mine data from a synthetic testbed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Proposing a solution to provide a comparatively enhanced prediction results using unpattern-able (highly dynamic and stochastic) data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Providing a solution that enhances the protection level for smart grid dynamic environment against failures.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Providing an accurate future value for the short-term prediction in a relatively faster processing time.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par22">Efficient delivery of energy resources to the smart grid requires a balanced energy demand and supply by developing energy resource management strategies. However, the significant fluctuations in energy demand and supply enhance the challenges in the development of these energy resource management schemes. This problem has been tackled using different approaches.</p><p id="Par23">For instance, this work (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>) developed several approaches to predict energy supply and demand effectively. The study then develops machine learning-based methods for accurate energy consumption and generation forecasts. Lastly, the study used the prediction results to establish energy consumption upper and lower bounds realizing optimal demand and anomaly detections.</p><p id="Par24">The problem is the smart meters acquire large amounts of data through sophisticated signal processing algorithms. The methodology will be applied in the study for it will the first develops a new classification scheme that categorizes users based on their consumption patterns. The study will then test the proposed and benchmarked models. Additionally, this research uses semi-Markov models to generate more extensive and more realistic test data due to insufficient power consumption data. (Tornai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">The problem is electrical load prediction is a fundamental factor in the planning, operations, and resource management within the grid system. The numerous restructurings of the grid and the integration of new devices to the grid heighten the need for forecasting to better plan for energy supply and demand. The methodology will be applied in the study for it will the first proposes a prediction model capable of predicting load data. Additionally, the study assesses the prediction model’s performance and effectiveness against several metrics. (Chemetova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">The problem is difficulty in harvesting various renewable energy forms led to the use of the smart grids integrated with photovoltaic (PV) power. However, various atmospheric conditions, for instance, rain, affect solar irradiance occurrence. This solution proposes the adoption of wavelet transform and Elman Neural Network (WT- ENN) for short-term solar energy production and irradiance forecasting. The methodology, the first decomposed the original solar irradiance data into consecutive stable wavelet sub-series. Additionally, the study used ENN to optimize the new wavelet coefficients. Lastly, the study reconstructed solar irradiance using the prediction model and the new coefficients. The prediction model’s performance was then assessed using two real-world data solar irradiance datasets. (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">The problem is Smart grid systems allow consumers to use more energy from the grid or vend it back to the grid for other consumers. Smart homes with photovoltaic systems can establish the daily energy yield. This solution recommends the use of multi-layer perceptron based on photovoltaic forecasting on rooftop PV systems. The methodology will be applied, the first suggests the use of multi-layer perceptron-based PV forecasting. The study then trains its historical data, conducts cross-validation, and tests the model using real-world PV data. (Parvez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">The problem is emergence of smart grids offers better integration of power systems between energy producers and consumers. The bidirectional nature of these smart grids calls energy consumption optimization measures to maintain the grid’s reliability and supply–demand balance. The solution evaluates the available short-term energy consumption prediction models to determine next-day energy consumption forecasts at one-hour intervals realizing a 24-point forecast. This methodology conducted a thorough assessment of various high-level machine algorithms adopted to forecast and evaluate the various model instances to determine the most appropriate algorithm for energy consumption forecasting. (Petrican et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">The problem is Efficient energy delivery in the smart grid requires adopting energy resource management strategies that balance energy supply and demand. This solution proposes several techniques that accurately model and predict energy production and demand over time. Similarly, the study recommends modeling analyses that statistical output models of energy consumption and machine learning approaches improve prediction accuracy. The methodology, the first the statistical distribution of real-world meter reading data of several houses for over 200 days acquired from Stanford University. (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">The problem is several countries continue to record an increase in their solar power capacity connections to the distribution grids. Adopting the smart grid concept has since contributed to this increase. The solution study suggests a new forecasting model that uses autoregressive models and gradient boosting algorithms. Such promote the alleviation of these constraints and result in point and probabilistic solar power forecasts for medium voltage and low voltage distribution stations. The methodology, the first proposes a model that overcomes the information and communication technology (ICT) limitations to promote solar energy forecasts at secondary substation levels. It then combined the values obtained from various distributed sensors.

Since the generation of the electricity is based and affected by these resources and factors. This leads to the fact, that the prediction of the generated energy based on renewable resources is a challenging problem.

Also, the behavior of the normal traffic and that the behavior faulty traffic in the real life is a little bit of stochastic that does not follow a stable pattern. Therefore, we will not be able to identify the exact features of the input pattern and the target for them. Therefore, our problem can be defined as a clustering problem, In order to solve this clustering problem, We have used k-mean clustering algorithm the previously generated sample traffic have been sent to k-mean clustering algorithm then trained on it after that the clustering algorithm showed as a very clear recognition for the statues of traffic as shown in this figure, the given pattern is found in the first column of the table and then the predicted pattern have been output by k-mean clustering algorithm and as we see here both of them are identical with no any missing values.

The dependent variables used are the future active generated power, Qs, and the efficiency for the PV grid. While the independent variables are represented with the weather conditions and load behaviour. In this work we proposed a solution based on K-means clustering that converts the stochastic behaviour of the independent variables into a known pattern. Then it becomes easier for either the LSTM or the GRU to use it for the short-term future estimation of the dependant variable. A mathematical model in addition to dataset are used to build a complete environment, with its operation and signals. And mote- Carlo method is used for simulation. As outcomes of a comparative study, we can confirm that although GRU is a fast algorithm, LSTM provides more accurate short-term predictions. Moreover, it’s been concluded that stochasticity is an important factor to be considered in any future estimation process. However, the method proposed in this work shows clear outcomes in solving the stochasticity issue and enhancing the performance of the prediction. Uncertainty in this dynamic environment is an important factor that could be considered in future perspectives.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the anonymous reviewers forgiving their valuable comments and helping us to improve the quality of the paper.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The funding is provided by Anglia Ruskin University.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>Dataset employed by this research can be retrieved from UK Smart Grid Industry 2021–2024. <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.reportlinker.com/report-summary/Electric-Power/88256/UK-Smart-Grid-Industry.html" ext-link-type="uri">reportlinker.com/report-summary/Electric-Power/88256/UK-Smart-Grid-Industry.html</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par209">The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par210">All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
