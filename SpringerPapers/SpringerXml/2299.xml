Interface engineering is helpful for obtaining high efficiency and stability through control of the interfacial charge transfer in PSCs. This paper demonstrates that the efficiency and stability of PSCs can be enhanced by introducing stable α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> quantum dots (QDs) as an interface layer between the perovskite film and the hole transport material (HTM) layer. By synergistically controlling the valence band position (VBP) of the perovskite and the interface layer, an interface engineering strategy was successfully used to increase the efficiency of hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer, resulting in the power conversion efficiency increasing from 15.17 to 18.56%. In addition, the enhancement of the stability of PSCs can be attributed to coating inorganic CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs onto the perovskite layer, which have a high moisture stability and result in long-term stability of the PSCs in ambient air.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary" specific-use="web-only"><title>Solar cells: quantum dots resist degradation and increase efficiency</title><p id="Par2">Researchers have used tiny inorganic crystals known as quantum dots to engineer improved moisture resistance and enhanced power conversion into low-cost solar cells. Perovskites, a family of crystals that includes methylammonium lead tri-iodide, can be easily assembled into photovoltaic devices that harvest sunlight nearly as well as silicon. Baomin Xu and Chun Cheng from China’s Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, and co-workers report a solar cell containing cesium–lead–iodine quantum dots inserted between a perovskite film and an organic conducting material. The dots introduce new electronic states that improve extraction of photogenerated charge. They also migrate through pores in the perovskite film to form a water-repelling surface layer. This strategy enabled the team to operate the device with high efficiency for over a month in humid conditions that normally degrade perovskite films.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs3" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par3">Due to the matching energy level of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> quantum dots and perovskite layer, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells was substantially enhanced from 15.17% to 18.56% by introducing CsPbI<sub>3</sub> quantum dots as interface engineering layer.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Research to achieve high-efficiency solar cells is currently very active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As one of the most quickly developing solar cells, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a hot research topic because of their high solar conversion efficiencies and low cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. PSCs have made impressive progress in just a few years with record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) evolving from 3.8% in 2009 to a certified 22.1% in 2016 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, the development of PSCs is still restricted by the instability of the organic composition of PSCs in the presence of water and ambient moisture. To improve the stability of PSC devices, some recent papers have reported that composition engineering by doping with cations is effective for obtaining intrinsically stable perovskites with good properties. Seok et al. first found that the mixed type (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.85</sub>(MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.15</sub> perovskite exhibits an excellent efficiency and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Inorganic cations have also been incorporated into multiple cation perovskites, such as Cs<sup>+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup>, to improve the stability of PSC devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Although remarkable progress has been achieved, the crystal structure and energy band compatibility of the materials have largely hindered further improvement using this mixed perovskite strategy. Recently, another effective strategy was reported for promoting the stability of PSCs, i.e., coating barrier layers on the surface of the perovskite layer, and this strategy has been shown to be effective for improving device stability in ambient air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Yang et al. utilized hydrophobic ammonium ions to modify the surface of a perovskite layer and improved the moisture stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Wang et al. utilized a hydrophobic fluorosilane layer as a water-resistant layer, resulting in greater stability of the perovskite film in water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, these studies have ignored the band position matching factor (BPMF) between the barrier layer and the perovskite layer. On the other hand, a large number of studies have demonstrated that the BPMF greatly affects the charge transport efficiencies (CTEs) between the perovskite layer and the interface layer, which can substantially change the PCEs of PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These results inspire us to design a new interface engineering layer to improve both the stability and efficiency of PSCs at the same time. To achieve this strategy, the interface engineering layer should possess two important properties, a suitable band position and high moisture resistance. Unfortunately, until now, few materials have been recorded to possess these two properties.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, all-inorganic perovskite materials have exhibited better environmental durability than organic−inorganic hybrid perovskite materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the band position of inorganic perovskite quantum dot (QD) materials is tunable by adjusting the components of the QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, it is difficult to deposit a dense and uniform QD film. Therefore, to date, it is still a challenge to achieve high PCEs with PSCs fabricated using inorganic perovskite materials as the light-absorption layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Considering their advantages and disadvantages, we believe that inorganic perovskite QDs are appropriate for use as an interface engineering layer in PSCs due to their superior stability and tunable band gap position.</p><p id="Par6">Among all-inorganic perovskite materials, cubic CsPbI<sub>3</sub> may be the most appropriate candidate as an interface engineering material due to its high valence band position (VBP) and high moisture stability. In addition, the synthesis of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs can effectively improve the stability of the cubic phase due to the generous contribution of the surface energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this work, we propose an interface engineering method to enhance both the efficiency and stability of PSCs by introducing stable CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs between the perovskite layer and the hole-transporting material (HTM) layer. Furthermore, we used mixed-type perovskite MA<sub>0.17</sub>FA<sub>0.83</sub>Pb(I<sub>0.83</sub>Br<sub>0.17</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (marked as FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub>) as the light-absorption layer to further fulfill the VBP matching requirement between the perovskite layer and the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer. Our results demonstrated that PSCs containing CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs have a much higher PCE and better stability in ambient air than those without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. The results indicate that this is a new strategy to achieve both high efficiency and stable PSCs by utilizing inorganic perovskite QDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par7">Mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> paste (Dyesol), formamidinium iodide (FAI), lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), methylammonium bromide (MABr) and lead bromide (PbBr<sub>2</sub>) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Feiming Chemical Limited.

Afterward, the as-prepared films were heated at 100 °C for approximately 2 h until the color changed to dark red. After the substrate was cooled to room temperature, the CsPbX<sub>3</sub> QDs dispersed in chlorobenzene (20 mg/ml) were spin coated onto the above FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 90 °C for 2 min. The hole-transporting layer was prepared by spin coating an HTM solution, which was prepared by dissolving Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene (72.3 mg/ml) with 28.8 μl of a tBP solution and 17.5 µl of Li-<italic>bis</italic>(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (520 mg/ml).

Here, in our experiment, we chose a simple synthetic route and purification approach to prepare CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, which is one of the best methods to keep cubic phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs stable for months in ambient air and even at cryogenic temperatures. We synthesized cubic CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs using Cs<sub>2</sub>Ac and PbI<sub>2</sub> as the precursors and methyl acetate as the shape regulator.

The devices were made by a one-step spin coating of perovskite precursor solutions onto mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> (m-TiO<sub>2</sub>). PSC devices were fabricated by spin coating QDs onto the surface of the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite film and then using the same steps required for the mesoporous FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub>/HTM structure. Detailed information on the perovskite precursor solution preparation, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition, and fabrication of the devices is given in the experimental section. The optimal PSC device structure consists of a 30-nm thick compact TiO<sub>2</sub> (c-TiO<sub>2</sub>) layer on FTO, a 500-nm thick perovskite layer with mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>, a 150-nm thick Spiro-OMeTAD layer as the HTM layer, and a thermally evaporated Au layer (100 nm) as the back contact, as shown in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. It should be noted that both HTM and CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layers were processed from CB. To examine the effect of HTM processing for the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer, the pure CB was spin-coated on the surface of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer with same experimental condition. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layers show no obvious change after coating CB, indicating that the deposition of CB did not affect the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer. The synthesized CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs were deposited as an interface engineering layer between the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite film and the HTM layer, and an FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub>/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs/HTM device structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) was proposed and investigated in this work. Comparing the cross-sectional SEM images of the PSC devices without and with QDs, it is difficult to observe an obvious boundary between the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer and HTM. Therefore, to determine the thickness of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer, an atomic force microscopy (AFM) test of a single CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer deposited on a Si surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>) and cross-sectional SEM images of PSC devices without an HTM (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>) were processed. The thickness of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer calculated from these characterizations is ~30 nm. The formation of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer can be further verified from the top-view SEM images of the perovskite film before and after deposition of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, which are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, f</xref>, respectively. After depositing the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, both the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>) confirm that the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs were relatively homogenously deposited on the surface of the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> film. The impact of the number of spin coatings and the concentration of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs on the performance of the PSCs was investigated. The amount of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs deposited onto the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite film was tuned by changing the concentration of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD suspension and by varying the number of spin coatings. Qualitatively, the amount of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs significantly influences the photovoltaic performance. Spin coating a 20 mg/ml CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD solution produced the best performance in our experiments. All PSC devices interfaced with the perovskite QDs in this work were fabricated under these optimized conditions. It can be speculated that the deposited CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs penetrate the remaining, available perovskite pore volume, leading to a smoother top capping layer on the perovskite film. To demonstrate this assumption, we performed an AFM measurement to examine the surface roughness of a perovskite film surface in a 2 μm × 2 μm area. The typical AFM topography of a perovskite film without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. The grain size observed in the AFM image is consistent with that observed in the SEM image in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. Additionally, the AFM image shows a similar root mean square roughness value of 11.1 nm, which ranges from 9.5 to 13.9 nm, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, after the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition, the roughness of the perovskite dramatically decreased to 7.01 nm and ranged from 5.5 to 8.4 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>), indicating a promising effect of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs with respect to morphological control of perovskite thin films.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Structure and morphology of PSCs with and without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram showing the fabrication process of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD interface engineering. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>e</bold> SEM cross-section of perovskite solar cells without and with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Top-view SEM images of the perovskite layer before and after deposition of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. <bold>d</bold>, <bold>g</bold> AFM images of the perovskite film without and with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41427_2018_55_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">It is well known that due to higher HOMO level, the deposition of Spiro-OMeTAD on the surface of a perovskite layer will lend to the transfer of holes from the perovskite layer to Spiro, but the high energy gap between the perovskite layer and Spiro leads to high voltage loss and a low hole transfer rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, interface engineering by inserting CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs with a VBP located between the VB of the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite and the HOMO of the HTM can facilitate hole transfer at the interface, reducing recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes during the transport process. To confirm this idea, we investigated the influence of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition on the surface of the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> layer on the efficiency of the PSCs. The current−voltage (<italic>J</italic>−<italic>V</italic>) curves for the best PSC devices with and without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. Upon introduction of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, the photovoltaic performance changed dramatically. The best PSC without QDs (FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub>/HTM) produced an open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>) of 1.049 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>) of 20.94 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>,and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, corresponding to a PCE of 15.17%. The introduction of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs at the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub>−HTM interface increased the PCE remarkably to 18.56% because of significant increases in the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> (1.092 V) and <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> (24.42 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to those of the PSC without QDs. To obtain high <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, a high charge mobility is important as well as the suitable energy level alignment. The mobility for the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD film has been reported to be 0.23 cm<sup>2</sup>/V/s,which is over 100 times higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (1.80×10<sup>−3</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/V/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Hence, the CTE of PSC device could be significantly enhanced by the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs deposition thus leading to the high <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>. We also investigated the hysteresis effect in the <italic>J</italic>−<italic>V</italic> measurements of the device. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, the device shows a negligible hysteresis effect under the scan direction. The high-quality PSCs favor highly efficient charge collection, resulting in hysteresis-free PSCs. The certified efficiency of the PSC with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs for a 0.1/cm<sup>2</sup> area is 17.30% (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). The photovoltaic metrics for 20 devices are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows the corresponding incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the two PSC devices with and without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. The IPCE of PSCs with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs is markedly higher than that without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, and the integrated photocurrent densities are 23.47 and 21.25 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for PSCs with and without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, respectively, which is in agreement with the JSC values derived from the <italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic> measurements. These results indicate that the introduction of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs with a suitable VBP at the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub>−HTM interface improves the IPCE compared to that of the PSC without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, which meets our expectation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Device performance of perovskite solar cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Typical <italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic> characteristics and <bold>b</bold> corresponding EQE of solar cells W/ CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs and W/O CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41427_2018_55_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">To our knowledge, additional factors may influence the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. For instance, photocurrent generation is a direct result of the light-harvesting efficiency. The fluorescence from CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs may enhance light harvesting by the active layer because the emitted photons can be absorbed by the perovskite film. To validate the effectiveness of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD interface engineering strategy used, several different experiments were systematically evaluated. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the perovskite films with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs exhibited slightly enhanced light absorption compared to that without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, especially in the range from 500 to 700 nm. To further study this reason, we measured the light absorption of bare CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs film and it is found that the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs film showed weak light absorption in the range from 500 to 700 nm which is consistent with the above result. Furthermore, the strongly asymmetric enhancement in the EQE spectrum from 500 to 700 nm for PSC with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs can be explained by the increased light absorption of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. Because the light-harvesting efficiency of the films is enhanced by the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs deposition, the observed difference in performance could attribute to the more effective charge transfer resulted from the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs interface engineering as well as the increased light absorption of the whole PSC device. This mechanism can be further demonstrated by the results from the PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay curves of the perovskite films without and with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD deposition. The notion inferred above that charge transfer is facilitated by the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer is corroborated by the steady-state PL measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films without and with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. Under the same experimental conditions, both perovskite films without and with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs exhibit a PL peak at 780 nm. The PL quantum yield of the perovskite film with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs is largely reduced compared to that of the film without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, indicating the significantly enhanced charge carrier extraction arises from the addition of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. Here, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> can play a role as a hole acceptor and enhances the charge injection from the perovskite to the HTM layer due to its suitable VBP (slightly higher than that of the perovskite film). To further confirm our speculation, we performed TRPL measurements to study the hole-extraction kinetics at the perovskite−HTM interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, the PL decay lifetime of the perovskite film with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs was determined to be 11.13 ns compared to 13.24 ns for the film without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. The PL in the perovskite/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs/HTM film shows significant, faster decay than that in the pristine perovskite/HTM film, indicating fast charge transfer from the perovskite into the HTM. These results indicate that perovskite films with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs can extract and transport holes more efficiently than those without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, which is consistent with the higher performances of the PSC devices with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs compared to those of the PSC devices without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Light absorption and charge transport properties of PSCs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> UV−Vis absorption spectra of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD film, perovskite films W/O and W/ CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. <bold>b</bold> Photoluminescence spectra and <bold>c</bold> Time-resolved photoluminescence decay curves of perovskite films W/O and W/ CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. <bold>d</bold> Electrochemical impedance responses of PSC devices W/O and W/ CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs measured at an open-circuit voltage under dark conditions at a 0.8 V bias</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41427_2018_55_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">To further clarify the effect of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, EIS was carried out to study the photogenerated charge recombination processes in the PSCs.

Since excellent moisture resistance has been demonstrated in CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, PSCs with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD modification are expected to have good long-term ambient stability. To investigate the stability of the perovskite devices, the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was measured every 5 days for 35 days. The evolution of the PCE over time is displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>. The initial PCE of the PSC without the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs was almost entirely lost after 35 days, corresponding to an attenuation of 100%. In contrast, the PSC with the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs experienced a PCE drop of 20% (from 100 to 80%) after 35 days. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> inset, the color of the PSC device without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs became yellow after storage in ambient air for 35 days, indicating that the perovskite was mostly decomposed. In contrast, the color of the PSC device with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs remained brown, demonstrating that the perovskite hardly changed under the same conditions. Thus, compared to that of the PSC without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, the device with the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs exhibited better long-term stability in the ambient air at over 30% RH without any encapsulation due to the high moisture resistance of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. The maximum power output (MPO) decay under continuous light illumination is another important technical index for the stability of PSC devices. The PSCs with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs showed remarkably enhanced stability under continuous operation at MPO compared to that of the devices without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The PSCs with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs retained 81% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 100 h under 1 sun light irradiation. In contrast, the MPO of the PSCs without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs declined to 50% under the same conditions, which indicates that the stability of the PSC device can be remarkably enhanced with the addition of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD layer. As an all-inorganic perovskite material, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> has been demonstrated to exhibit a high stability in ambient air.

The high photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs can be ascribed to their matched energy levels and high hole transfer efficiencies. To further support this idea, we systematically investigated the influence of the VBP on interface engineering materials for PSC devices. The CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs with lower VBP than the perovskite film were introduced as an interface layer onto the surface of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8b and d</xref>, the successful synthesis of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs was confirmed by the typical PL spectrum and XRD pattern of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. It should be noted that the CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs were synthesized by a method similar to that of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, and the sizes of the two types of QDs were in the same range (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8a</xref>). First, to determine the energy levels of the perovskite, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs, UV−Vis absorption spectroscopy and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) experiments were performed. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> shows the UPS spectra of the perovskite, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QD films. The photoemission parameters obtained from the UPS measurements are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. The VBP values measured by UPS are −5.60, −5.33, and −5.85 eV for the perovskite, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD, and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QD films, respectively. As determined by UV−Vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8c</xref>), the band gaps for the three films (perovskite, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs) are 1.62, 1.83, and 2.40 eV, corresponding to −3.98, −3.50, and −3.45 eV CBP values for these films, respectively.

The CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs have a much lower VB edge than the FAMAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite, which hinders hole transfer from the perovskite film to the HTM layer. In contrast, because the VBP of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs is located between that of the HTM and the perovskite, more favorable energy-level alignment occurs at the interface, facilitating cascade hole extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To further investigate the role of interface engineering in influencing the performance of the fabricated PSC devices, the PL spectra of perovskites without QDs, with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs and with CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs were measured. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, the perovskite with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs exhibited stronger PL quenching than the perovskite without QDs, while the perovskite with CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs exhibited very little PL quenching. The increased PL quenching yield of the perovskite with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs indicates improved hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM. To further validate the effectiveness of the fabrication strategy, the <italic>J</italic>−<italic>V</italic> performance of PSC devices without QDs, with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs was measured in the study. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, the <italic>J</italic>−<italic>V</italic> tests for PSCs without QDs, with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, and with CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs were systematically evaluated, and the photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>. The average data for 20 PSC devices without QDs prepared under the same conditions were a <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of 1.02 V, <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of 22.22 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, and FF of 0.67, corresponding to a PCE of 15.14%. However, interface modification using CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs reduced the PCE significantly to 9.45% because of the significant decreases in the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and FF values compared to those of the PSC without QDs. The lower-lying VBP of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> compared to the VB of the perovskite results in a hole-transfer hindering effect, leading to significant decreases in the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, FF, and PCE values. In contrast, if the CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs were replaced with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, the solar cell device produced a <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of 1.05 V, <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of 24.28 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, and FF of 0.71, corresponding to a PCE of 18.14%. The enhancement in the PCE is attributed to the significant improvement in the <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and FF values as well as the slight increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>. The VBP of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs is located between the VB edge of the perovskite film and the HOMO of the HTM. In this situation, the photogenerated holes in the perovskite film produced by irradiation may first transfer to the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs and then to the HTM layer. As a result of the better matching of energy levels among the perovskite, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs, and HTM, the two-step hole transfer resulting from such interface engineering facilitates the hole transfer from the perovskite film to the HTM layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As a consequence, the <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> and FF values all are enhanced, leading to a significant improvement in the PCE. Our results demonstrated that CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD interface engineering was beneficial to PCE enhancement of PSCs, while the addition of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs had the opposite effect. According to the interface modification design, a suitable VBP is the key factor to improve charge transfer between the perovskite layer and HTM.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Band structure properties and device performance of PSCs with different QDs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results of the perovskite film, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs.

The charge-transfer efficiency at the interface of the perovskite/HTM layer is enhanced by CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs due to their intermediate VB position between the perovskite and HTM layers. The cascade energy level structure created by interfacial engineering of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs can remarkably improve the hole extraction and the FF, <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>, and PCE values of PSC devices. With this strategy, the PCE of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD-modified PSCs was substantially enhanced from 15.17 to 18.56% compared to that without CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD modification. Moreover, PSCs with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs maintained 82% of their initial performance for 30 days at over 30% RH without any encapsulation, suggesting that the stability of the PSCs was also markedly improved due to the high stability of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QDs. This as-established approach is fundamentally new, universally applicable and practically usable for the enhancement of PSCs, which will possibly result in a new pathway to simultaneously improve both the efficiency and stability of solar cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Project funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grants nos. 2016YFA0202400 and 2016YFA0202404), Peacock Team Project funding from the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (Grant no.
