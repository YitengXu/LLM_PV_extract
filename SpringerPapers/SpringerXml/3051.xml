Here, we analyze the trade-off between the decarbonization potential of the road transportation sector and its critical metal requirement from the demand-side perspective in 48 major countries committing to decarbonize their road transportation sectors aided by electric vehicles (EVs). Our results demonstrate that deploying EVs with 40–100% penetration by 2050 can increase lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese demands by 2909–7513%, 2127–5426%, 1039–2684%, and 1099–2838%, respectively, and grow platinum group metal requirement by 131–179% in the 48 investigated countries, relative to 2020. Higher EV penetration reduces GHG emissions from fuel use regardless of the transportation energy transition, while those from fuel production are more sensitive to energy-sector decarbonization and could reach nearly “net zero” by 2040.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">This study analyzes the trade-off between the decarbonization potential of the road transportation sector and its critical metal requirements in 48 countries.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow reaffirmed the Paris Agreement’s carbon neutrality goals and called for an urgent phase-down of fossil fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The transportation sector can contribute to approximately one-quarter of all energy-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and three-quarters of transportation emissions are from road traffic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, decarbonizing the road transportation sector is crucial. Reducing road traffic activities and improving the efficiency of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) can cut GHG emissions from combusting fossil fuels. Yet, deep decarbonization of the road transportation sector requires a substantial shift to cleaner fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Electricity generated from renewable sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and hydro energy, is seen as an ideal solution to mitigate GHG emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Substituting ICEVs with electric vehicles (EVs) powered by renewable electricity can pave the way to achieving transportation decarbonization goals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, European Commission has issued a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition to electrification, biofuels—defined as liquid fuels and blending components produced from biomass materials (e.g., bioethanol and biodiesel)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>—can offer great help to further decarbonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The current application of biofuels is still hampered by their higher production costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, water footprint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and land use change emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> compared with fossil fuels. More importantly, biofuel production consumes crops and competes with arable land for food production when total global food demands are expected to increase by 35–56% by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. With technological advances and production yield gains, the next-generation biofuels made from non-food-based feedstock, such as lignocellulose-based and algae-based biofuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, are expected to be sustainable energy sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In these contexts, biofuels and electrification effectively decarbonize road transportation.</p><p id="Par4">Adopting EVs is a key to decarbonizing transportation at the expense of tremendous critical metal requirements than their fossil fuel counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, exacerbating the supply risks of critical metals. Critical metals can generally be understood as those essential to the functioning and integrity of a wide range of industrial ecosystems, usually with a high economic value but also raising an equally high risk of supply disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This study focuses on the critical metals used for the electrification of the transportation sector. Current EVs are exclusively powered by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> due to the unmatchable characteristics of their high energy and power density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA), lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are currently the most widely used EV LIBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, for which lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese are needed in the battery cathode production. Other than these four metals, the criticality of platinum group metals (PGMs) has been credited much earlier due to their high rarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. PGMs, such as platinum and palladium, are used in catalytic converters to oxidize carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in tailpipe exhausts of ICEVs. The current fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) also adopt PGMs to catalyze electrode reactions, increasing the reliance of the transportation sector on the availability of PGMs. The booming EV market, therefore, may lead to the potential supply shortage of critical metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Hence, investigating the effects of deploying EVs on critical metals requirements and mitigation of transportation GHG emissions is essential. Past studies have explored the GHG emissions mitigation potential and critical material requirements of electrifying transportation in specific countries and regions, including China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, for various road transportation sectors corresponding to passenger vehicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, freight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, light-duty vehicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and heavy-duty vehicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> sectors. Despite the efforts made to project the impacts of EV deployment, several knowledge gaps still remain. First, most studies investigated a specific transportation sector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> or a specific category of EVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Lacking perspective from the full range of vehicles composing a fleet may lead to incomplete or truncated conclusions. The analysis scope can be broadened by considering the electrification of a broader range of vehicles, including battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and FCEVs in both light-/heavy-duty and passenger/freight sectors to lay out holistic strategies to mitigate GHG emissions and critical metal use. Second, current studies explored transportation electrification from an integrated global perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> or for a specific region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> without regional analyses to show the spatial and temporal variability of GHG emissions and material requirements associated with electrifying transportation. Therefore, localized projections of transportation electrification in specific areas would help better plan the regional EV adaptation strategies and identify hotspots for mitigating global GHG emissions and critical metal use. Third, existing studies considered the impacts of EV penetration and decarbonization of energy systems separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> but did not explicitly discuss the synergistic coupling between EV penetration and energy transition in alleviating GHG emissions and shortening the time to reach carbon peak. Finally, relevant studies only discussed the critical metal requirements and GHG mitigation potential of transportation electrification separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> without identifying potential integrated strategies for GHG emissions mitigation in a resource-efficient manner.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of GHG emissions and critical metals requirement in electrifying the light-/heavy-duty passenger and freight road fleets in multiple regions under different EV penetration and energy transition scenarios, considering a complete range of major EV technologies, including BEVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and FCEVs. Transportation fuels considered in this study include electricity, gasoline, bioethanol, natural gas, diesel, biodiesel, and hydrogen. Forty-eight countries committing to decarbonizing their transportation sector are considered in this study.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, NMC/NCA, LFP, and Li-S/Li-air are three typical technologies in the future EV battery market. NMC/NCA battery technologies are the most favorable to EVs. The specific energy of NMC/NCA LIBs has increased from less than 100 Wh/kg in the 1990s to more than 250 Wh/kg currently at the cell level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Because cobalt is not as abundant as nickel, the LIB industry has optimized the composition of NMC111 to produce material-efficient LIB alternatives such as NMC523, NMC622, NMC811, and NMC955. Compared to NMC/NCA batteries, LFP batteries offer a longer life span, greater economic viability, and excellent thermal and electrochemical stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. The specific energy of LFP batteries, ~170 Wh/kg at the cell level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, is relatively lower than that of NMC/NCA batteries. However, their greater thermal stability allows for the integration of the cells directly in the battery pack (i.e., “cell-to-pack”, or “battery blade”), thereby increasing their specific energy at the battery level to an extent similar to NMC/NCA batteries. Based on the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, we assume that the market share of LFP batteries will expand to 60% in 2030, then gradually decrease to 30% in 2040 and remain stable till 2050 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Moreover, this study considers two emerging solid-state battery technologies—Li-S and Li-air batteries—that are envisioned as next-generation technologies, outperforming LIBs in specific energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Solid-state Li-S batteries can achieve a maximum specific energy of 600 Wh/kg at the cell level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, leading to a longer EV range, light battery mass, and lower production costs.

As observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, if deploying EVs with 40–100% penetration by 2050, the demand for critical battery metals, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, can be continuously increased since 2020 by 2909 (S40% scenario)–7513% (S100% scenario), 2127–5426%, and 1039–2684%, and 1099–2838%, respectively, because of the higher EV penetration levels that require battery manufacturing. The annual demand for lithium increases monotonically from 2010 to 2050: 0.7–900 Gg in the S40% scenario and 0.7–2200 Gg in the S100% scenario. The demand for nickel tops that of other critical metals, ranging from 2.0 Tg in the S40% scenario to 5.2 Tg in the S100% scenario in 2050. The yearly demand for cobalt and manganese is in the same order of magnitude in 2050, at around 0.3–0.8 Tg and 0.2–0.5 Tg, respectively. The demand for PGMs, which fluctuates between 0.1 and 0.9 Gg over the 2010–2050 period, is significantly lower than for the other four battery metals. The demand for PGMs used in PHEVs and FCEVs increase to 0.3–0.7 Gg by 2050, while the need for PGMs in ICEVs peaks in 2026 at 0.7–0.8 Gg (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S15</xref>). In the S40% case, PGMs used for ICEVs still account for 58% of the total demand for PGM in 2050. However, in the S100% scenario, ICEVs cease to be sold in 2045, and from then on, PGMs are used exclusively for PHEVs and FCEVs only.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Annual and cumulative critical metal requirements and the closed-loop recycling potential of critical metals.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Annual demand and recycling potential with or without a second use. <bold>b</bold> Region-specific/vehicle-specific/battery-specific cumulative (from 2010 to 2050) demand for critical metals and the cumulative potential secondary production from recycling. <bold>c</bold> Sensitivity of cumulative requirement under different battery scenarios.

A higher EV penetration enhances the cumulative requirements for the four battery-related metals but reduces the need for PGMs. The contribution analysis of cumulative requirements is further shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. The region-wise contribution analysis illustrates that China is the world’s largest consumer of critical metals, accounting for ~50% of the cumulative demand for lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese and 40% of the cumulative demand for PGMs. Vehicle-wise breakdown of cumulative requirements indicates that over 90% of the total battery metal demand is for BEVs: 55–59% for heavy-duty and 29–38% for light-duty BEVs. PGMs show 59–85% of their total demand for ICEVs, with 43–60% for light-duty ICEVs and 16–24% for heavy-duty ICEVs. In the S40% scenario, PHEVs and FCEVs consume only 15% of the cumulative PGM demand, which rises to 41% in the S100% case. It is also noted that transportation electrification can slightly reduce the cumulative requirement of PGMs by 2050, but the annual demand of PGMs in the S100% scenario is 1.5 Gg higher than that in the S40% scenario in 2050. The battery-wise contribution analysis shows that ~40% of the lithium is used to manufacture NMC/NCA batteries, and around 30% of that is used for Li-S/Li-air and LFP batteries, respectively. It is also found that nickel, cobalt, and manganese are used almost exclusively for producing NMC/NCA batteries. We further evaluate the sensitivity of the assumptions on future battery markets to obtain the upper and lower bounds of the critical metal requirements. Based on the baseline battery market scenario (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), we examined three additional extreme battery market scenarios, in which the market shares of (1) NMC/NCA, (2) LFP, and (3) Li-S/Li-air battery technologies will gradually increase to 100% by 2050, respectively. The results of the sensitivity analysis in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> show that the cumulative requirement for lithium remains relatively stable across the three battery scenarios, while that of cobalt, nickel, and manganese could be halved in the Li-S/Li-air and LFP scenarios and may double if NMC/NCA battery technology dominates the future battery market.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Sankey diagrams for cumulative critical metal requirements (Gg) under the 40 and 100% electric vehicle penetration scenarios.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cumulative critical metal requirements (from 2010 to 2050) under the S40% scenario. <bold>b</bold> Cumulative critical metal requirements under the S100% scenario.

Resources for all five metals are sufficient to produce automotive batteries and catalysts. Regarding reserves of critical metals, manganese supply is sufficient regardless of the EV penetration level, as global manganese reserves in 2020 were above 1300 Tg and 200 Tg for EV batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, which far exceeds the cumulative demand for manganese in 2050 (3–9 Tg). PGM reserves for the automotive industry in 2020 are around 27 Gg, 90% of which originates from South Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. By 2050, PGM reserves can meet the cumulative demand, from 20 Gg in the S100% scenario to 24 Gg in the S40% scenario. Global proven lithium reserves for EV batteries in 2020 are around 16 Tg, 44% and 22% of which are in Chile and Australia, respectively. The cumulative demand for lithium ranges from 12–26 Tg, determined by the level of EV penetration. Therefore, lithium supplies fall short under a high EV penetration rate (60–100%). Nickel and cobalt suffer from their supply risks as their reserves in 2020 (7 Tg for nickel and 3 Tg for cobalt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>) fail to meet the cumulative demand by 2050 of 28–63 Tg and 5–11 Tg, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>.

Reusing discarded EV batteries as ESSs can delay the recycled content rate in batteries by 8–18% in 2050. However, it displaces the need for primary metals required for the manufacture of ESSs—although this has been left out of the scope of this study. Recycling PGMs can satisfy 77–121% of the demand in 2050. Between 2010 and 2050, the accumulated amount of recovered critical metals from discarded batteries can offset the need to extract metallic ores by 17–25%, further decreasing to 3–10% of all reused batteries. Moreover, recycling PGMs can offset natural resource extraction by 47–53% due to the earlier deployment of ICEVs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Road transportation GHG emissions</title><p id="Par15">We consider four EV penetration scenarios with three energy transition pathways (1.5–3.5 °C global warming limit conditions) to assess the GHG emissions from fuel for road transportation. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> (left) shows the global GHG emissions from transportation from 2010 to 2050. The 3.5 °C scenario presents a moderate growth in GHG emissions, whereas the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios witness a sharply declining tendency around 2025 and 2035, respectively. In the 3.5 °C scenario, an increment in EV penetration can lead to more GHG emissions, rising from 10.2 Pg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq in 2020 to 12.2 Pg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq in the S40% scenario and 13.6 Pg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq in the S100% scenario in 2050. In the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios, a higher EV penetration reduces GHG emissions. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> (right) shows the split of these emissions between fuel use and production. Both electrification and energy transition can cut GHG emissions from fuel use, but electrification dominates in emission mitigation from fuel combustion. In the 3.5 °C-S40% scenario, GHG emissions from fuel use in 2050 could be reduced by 23% from their 2020 level. For the most climate-ambitious 1.5 °C energy transition scenario, where the penetration remains at 40%, a 35% reduction in GHG emissions from fuel use could be achieved. If penetration increases to 100%, even in the mildest 3.5 °C scenario, the GHG emissions from fuel use can be reduced by 77%. GHG emissions from fuel production are more sensitive to energy transition than EV penetration. As seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> (right), the rise of GHG emissions from fuel production continues throughout the period in the 3.5 °C scenario.

Cumulative GHG emissions from road transportation in the investigated regions can be reduced by 12–33% compared with the baseline 3.5 °C scenario by 2050. Higher EV penetration leads to lower global GHG emissions from fuel use regardless of energy transition scenarios. The GHG emissions from fuel production will continue to increase through 2050 and grow with higher EV penetration in the 3.5 °C scenario but could reach nearly zero around 2040 in the 1.5 °C scenario. The period of 2010–2050 was selected as 2050 is a critical time point for most countries to achieve carbon neutrality. This study shows that no country is expected to achieve zero emissions by 2050 in the road transportation sector because GHG emissions from fuel use cannot be completely decarbonized in every region, and PHEVs still emit GHGs due to the combustion of fossil fuels. Biofuels are indispensable in providing an immediate solution to GHG emissions mitigation, especially before electricity and hydrogen production are decarbonized and fossil fuel-based vehicles are phased out. India is identified as the largest transportation GHG emitter (30–36%) among all surveyed regions; deploying EVs in India would not achieve a carbon peak under the 3.5 scenario by 2050.</p><p id="Par20">Other studies support the findings of this study to a certain extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Fuel-related emissions contribute significantly to the life-cycle carbon footprints of FCEVs and BEVs, and cleaner production of hydrogen or electricity can lead to much less GHG emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. At a global scale, even if electrification is not matched by power-sector decarbonization, using EVs has average lower GHG emissions than ICEVs in most individual countries in 2015, as suggested by Knobloch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. BEVs, for instance, have lower life-cycle GHG emissions than ICEVs in most European countries, as illustrated by Sacchi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. For the private transportation sector in China, transportation electrification and energy system decarbonization can reduce the GHG emissions from by 28% in 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. While adopting BEVs in a region mainly powered by fossil-based electricity may not immediately reduce GHG emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. For example, BEVs in some parts of India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> can pose more GHGs than conventional compressed natural gas and diesel vehicles in 2030. In some regions of the USA, operating BEVs and PHEVs can result in higher GHG emissions than HEVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">The potential trade-off behind electrification is critical, as investing in large amounts of critical metals might not immediately reduce GHG emissions. Our simulations suggest that deploying EVs increases the cumulative demand for critical metals between 2020 and 2050 in the regions surveyed by factors of 29–75 for lithium, 21–54 for nickel, 10–26 for cobalt, 11–28 for manganese, and 1.3–1.8 for PGMs. The future demand for critical battery metals far exceeds the 2020 production capacity, as evidenced in global-level studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Other studies also show that monotonic growth in global demand for critical metals to 2050 is the most prevalent trend, mainly driven by the EV market penetration and battery technology development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Another considerable challenge is that the current critical metals are centralized in a few politically unstable countries such as Chile, Congo, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa, according to the World Bank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. The unstable supplies of critical metals can exacerbate supply risks under surging demand. According to the contribution analysis, China’s EV deployment accounts for more than half of the total critical metal supply in the investigated areas. Around 93% of battery-related critical metals are used in BEVs, while more than half of PGMs (59–85%) are used for ICEVs worldwide. It is also worth noting that we should be cautious about the electrification of the heavy-duty sector, especially heavy-duty BEVs. Although HDVs only account for 4–11% of the total road fleet in each country, battery-related critical metals used in HDVs account for 62% of the total critical metal demand. Regarding battery technics, if NMC/NCA batteries dominate the future battery market, the demand for cobalt, nickel, and manganese may double. The LFP and Li-S/air batteries are promising alternatives to eliminate or remarkably reduce the use of cobalt, nickel, and manganese while keeping the lithium demand relatively stable. On the other hand, the supply of secondary feedstock from recycling EV batteries is increasingly crucial in reducing the primary production of all five critical metals by less than 1% in 2020 to at least 24% in 2050. However, reusing EV batteries as ESSs can reduce the displacement of primary production to 8–18% in 2050 due to delayed recycling. Note that in a broader system context, second use still helps alleviate that same need in other sectors, but our transportation sector-based material accounting system treats open-loop recovery as a “loss”.</p><p id="Par22">Policies are needed to secure the supply of critical metals. First, prioritizing alternative designs for cathodes/anodes and fuel cell systems is essential to reduce the reliance on primary critical metals. In addition to the metals’ high abundance in the crust, alternative cathode designs could also offer improved specific energy and operational safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that LFP and Li-S/air batteries could be adopted to reduce the use of cobalt, nickel, and manganese compared with NMC/NCA batteries. Other batteries with manganese-rich cathodes, such as lithium manganese nickel oxide batteries and lithium manganese iron phosphate batteries, use a higher share of abundant metal manganese and can also serve as a solution to reduce the reliance on cobalt and nickel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Post-LIB technologies such as sodium-ion and zinc-ion batteries are sustainable alternatives, enabling EVs to decouple from using lithium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. Similarly, the advancements in metal-organic framework-based catalysts can serve as a potential replacement for PGM in catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Second, a circular economy is also indispensable to secondary supply and even achieve a closed-loop supply chain in the future. Strategies should be considered to promote the recycling efficiency and recovery rate of EoL batteries at a proper pace. Investing in recycling infrastructure too early can lead to a waste of resources, as illustrated by our findings that waste battery metal flows will start booming around 2030. Reusing waste batteries for a second life can delay the emergence of the waste streams until 2035–2040. Therefore, long-term recycling plans need to be adopted to avoid oversupplies of secondary materials or idle infrastructure via strategically balancing the share of recycling/reuse with the capacity of infrastructure. Regarding recycling technologies, direct cathode reuse is considered a more advantageous route and should be boosted to improve recovery efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Standardizations and regulations on battery design of battery chemistries, types and sizes, labeling of cells, and pretreatment operations, including selective collection and sorting, should be established to ensure high-quality recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. For the waste batteries, we only consider the recyclability of EoL battery flows, while scraps in battery production also need to be considered as they are estimated to be over 900 Gg by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Therefore, scraps from battery production could be the main feed stream for battery recycling plants in the near future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Recycling and re-manufacturing scraps from the upstream could also be important to reduce the demand for critical metals at the early stage. Third, since the production and demand of critical metals remain timely dynamic, further analysis of the supply-side resilience and foresight for demand are needed to provide more information on the overall supply-demand balances for critical metals. Such information can facilitate the formulation of specific energy and resource security strategies in managing critical metals with the highest supply risk for both governments and industries. Finally, strategic actions are also required to actively attract and provide support for investments and cooperation in strengthening the critical metals supply chain both at home and abroad. Countries with major EV markets (e.g., China, the United States, and India) should enhance domestic supply by exploring new deposits and raising the production capacity based on the given supply-demand information. Those countries should also seek opportunities to strengthen and diversify their trading networks with third-world countries with abundant metallic resources (e.g., Congo and South Africa) via resource diplomacy and technology sharing. This may include collaboratively discovering and exploiting new reserves, establishing research and innovation partnerships in metallurgy, material engineering, and geomatics to raise production and mining efficiency and reduce scrap rate, and investing in workforce training to advance their technical capabilities and skills related to processing, refining, and recycling of critical metals.</p><p id="Par23">Regarding climate mitigation policies, decarbonization targets for road transportation should be coupled with EV deployment, the timing of carbon peak and neutrality, and accurate emission budgets. Higher EV penetration rates, earlier carbon peak and neutralization times, and lower GHG emissions may conflict. Therefore, climate targets that coordinate the different factors mentioned above can better facilitate the carbon-neutral transition of the transportation sector. Furthermore, biofuels can be considered a complementary strategy at the early stage of electrification. With embodied greenhouse gas emissions from biofuel production lower than in other regions, Turkey and South Korea are expected to expand the application of biofuels. In developing regions, such as India and South Africa, where grids cannot be fully decarbonized and hydrogen supply networks cannot be established in the short term, the potential adoption of biofuels and PHEVs should be considered as transition options for smoother electrification. A strong technological development trajectory for next-generation biofuels is essential for the introduction of electrification. Whereas widespread use of biofuels could also give rise to the lock-in of incumbent ICEV technologies, thus hindering further development of electrification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. To address this problem, various governmental efforts are needed. The government should have a clear phased blueprint for biofuels in future electrification. Regulations and legislations would create abundant niche markets so that some self-reinforcing entry and exit mechanisms for biofuel and EVs would become possible. In particular, coercive policies are crucial to escape lock-in. For instance, terminating sales of ICEVs can completely remove the path dependence on biofuels, such as Europe Union agreeing to end ICEV sales by 2035<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. Government should also endorse technological expectations of greater safety in EV batteries and assurances that the electrification will benefit in terms of energy efficiency and cost effectiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. In this way, biofuels could emerge as a viable complement to electrification rather than a substitute. Last but not least, integrated strategies should be set for both GHG mitigation and critical metal use reduction, especially in the heavy-duty sector. Heavy-duty BEVs require more than half of the battery-related critical metals due to the requirement for high battery capacity and necessary battery replacement. Deploying alternative EVs, such as FCEVs and PHEVs, and biofuels for the heavy-duty sector can also achieve significant savings in the use of critical battery metals. On the other hand, regional EV deployment strategies must follow local decarbonization plans for local power grids, biofuel supply chains, and hydrogen production networks to reduce fuel-related GHG emissions.</p><p id="Par24">Several limitations on the simplifications and assumptions exist in our methods. First, our study investigated the critical metals requirement for road transportation and fuel-related GHG emissions in 48 countries from 2010 to 2050. We aggregated the 48 countries into five major regions, which reduces the spatial resolution to some degree and might result in a biased global view. Further research could simulate the remaining variation within larger simulated world regions such as China and the USA, or perform case studies at a global level. These potential studies could also analyze the optimal EV penetration strategies combining the adoption of BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs for GHG emissions mitigation and critical metal requirement, or the spatial characteristics of environmental impacts of integrating EV batteries into the electricity grid as ESSs. Moreover, given the potential for hydrogen to play a significant role in decarbonizing the transportation sector, we anticipate a gradual increase in hydrogen production through steam methane reforming and coal gasification with CCS by 2050. However, it is important to note that the true impact of the widespread adoption of FCEVs will depend on the availability of green hydrogen sources, such as electrolysis and biomass, which will be evaluated as more ambitious energy transition scenarios become available in the IMAGE model. Then, instead of specifying the needs of each PGM, we model them as an aggregated group. Assessing the demand of each PGM individually can provide more comprehensive insights into sustainable resource management for deploying FCEVs. Additionally, we only considered the fuel emissions to specifically investigate the effect of alternative fuels on reducing road transportation GHG emissions. However, LIB and fuel cell system production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> can also drive EVs to higher GHG emissions than ICEVs. Investigating the complete life-cycle environmental impacts of the upstream processes, such as battery and fuel cell production, can provide more comprehensive insights into the decarbonization transition of the road transportation sector. Also, the choice of battery market modeling can significantly influence the critical metal requirements. Our study considered the three major battery options for EVs: NCA/NMC, LFP, and Li-S/air batteries. Despite the sensitivity analysis, advances in battery technologies can completely upend future battery market modeling assumptions. The critical metal requirement should be reinvestigated when the developmental trajectory of battery technologies becomes more predictable. Finally, like most studies, we applied a demand-based approach to account for the use of critical metals, whereas a trade-oriented or supply-based analysis can provide additional insights into global critical metals management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Overview of the methodologies</title><p id="Par25">The study uses a demand-based accounting approach to assess material requirements and GHG emissions leading to the decarbonization of the road transportation sector. As such, we consider the critical metal requirements and GHG emissions based on expected domestic end-use transportation services provided within a region. Therefore, the supply and trade of materials across countries are not considered in the material accounting system. This study considers the electrification of transportation in 48 countries, which are aggregated into 16 world regions based on the territorial division in the IAM IMAGE 3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The transportation and fuel market shares are modeled individually for each of the 16 regions. The results for critical metal requirements and GHG emissions for the 16 regions are then aggregated into five major economic entities: China, the USA, Europe, India, and the remaining regions. The time frame of this study includes a retrospective period from 2010 to 2020 and a look-ahead period from 2021 to 2050. Regarding the scope of material requirements, we account for the direct critical metallic material requirements for LIBs and catalytic converters, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese used for EV LIBs, and PGMs (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) used to produce catalytic converters in FCEVs, PHEVs, and ICEVs. Material requirements for lead-acid batteries are not considered.

We consider four EV penetration scenarios, in which the market stock share of EVs reaches 40–100% by 2050. The vehicle stock determines the battery stock in the second battery layer, which further determines the battery inflow and end-of-life (EoL) outflows. The battery flows then determine the critical metal requirements and recycling potential at the material layer.

The assumption on the recycling rate of each metal is listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. In the second-use scenario, all the EoL LIBs are second-used in a cascaded way as ESSs, and the catalytic converters are recycled immediately. After the second use, LIBs are recycled. It is assumed that the chemical composition of EoL LIBs remains the same after the second use. The lifetime of the second-used batteries is subject to the Weibull distribution with an average life span of 10 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Transportation market</title><p id="Par33">The data on the passenger and freight traffic activities of the regions under study is collected and adapted from IEA, OECD, Eurostat, and NationMaster. The obtained passenger and freight transportation activities are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The data for the transportation market is derived from two sources—external statistics and the results of the dMFA model. The ITF forecasted the share of public and private passenger transportation till 2050. It is assumed that there is a shift from the future demand toward public means (buses) of road transportation. Thus, the market share of private car transportation activities decrease from 71% in 2010 to 62% in 2050. Regarding freight transportation, the last mile transportation by vans accounts for 28–35%, and long-haul transportation makes up 65–72%. The transportation shares for each vehicle category for public and private passenger transportation, and last-mile and long-haul transportation are assumed based on the annual stock share from the dMFA model.

The SSP-RCP concept is an emerging scenario framework that facilitates the integrated analysis of future climate impacts. The SSP-RCP framework can provide region-specific and long-term energy transition background projections, which can serve as a basis for life-cycle inventory modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref></sup>. The SSP scenarios were established based on five alternative socio-economic developmental patterns: sustainable (SSP1), middle-of-the-road (SSP2), regional rivalry (SSP3), inequality (SSP4), and fossil-fueled (SSP5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref></sup>. We use the “middle-of-the-road” SSP2 pathway that anticipates a moderate population and GDP growth in line with historic development. RCP scenarios are radiative forcing trajectories proposed by IPCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref></sup>, including a concentration range of 1.9–6.0 W/m<sup>2</sup>. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency developed the IAM framework IMAGE 3.2 to address global environmental, energy, and resource challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. SSP2-RCP6 (middle-of-the-road development with a radiative forcing of 6.0 W/m<sup>2</sup> by 2100), SSP2-RCP26, and SSP2-RCP19 scenarios from the IMAGE 3.2 framework are selected to examine three different energy transition pathways to limit global temperature rise by 3.5, 2, and 1.5 °C by the end of this century relative to pre-industrial levels, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The unit fuel emission intensities are modeled by integrating the data from the SSP-RCP framework from the IAM IMAGE 3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> in the life-cycle inventory database <italic>ecoinvent 3.8</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref></sup> (cut-off system model). Compared to the 3.5 °C scenario, the 2 °C scenario has a higher level of decarbonized transportation energy systems and applies CCS technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref></sup>. The 1.5 °C scenario has even deeper decarbonized energy systems and CCS deployment. Moreover, in the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios, higher shares of bioethanol and biodiesel are blended into gasoline and diesel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Carbon footprint assessment</title><p id="Par35">We conduct a life-cycle-based carbon footprint analysis to compute the GHG emissions caused by the supply of energy to the passenger and freight transportation sectors. To that effect, regional and temporal developments regarding alternative fuels, including electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels, in the 16 regions of the IAM scenario are integrated into the life-cycle inventory database <italic>ecoinvent 3.8</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref></sup> using the open-source Python tool <italic>premise</italic> v1.2.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Compared with the classical carbon footprint analysis that only accounts for carbon emission and sequestration flows, a life-cycle-based carbon footprint compiles energy and material inventory data throughout the investigated system boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Hence, the life-cycle GHG emissions from fuels supplied to operate vehicles are calculated for each region and time step under every climate scenario. The carbon footprint of fuels for road transportation comprises the embodied GHG emissions from fuel production and operational emissions, specifically including direct and indirect emissions from every relevant step along the well-to-wheel supply chain of fuels. For conventional fuels, it ranges from refining crude oil to distributing the refined fuel product at the fueling station. For electricity and electricity-based fuels (i.e., hydrogen), it includes the extraction of primary energy as well as its conversion, distribution, and transmission at low voltage to the consumer (i.e., the BEV owner). Also, a total 1.5% mass loss of hydrogen is considered to reflect leakages along the different components of the hydrogen supply chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref></sup> (i.e., venting of electrolyzers, compression, storage, and evaporation). In relation to the combustion of fuel during vehicle operations, three GHGs are considered, namely CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CO. Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> are based on the stoichiometric reaction of the fuel oxidization, while emission factors for CO and N<sub>2</sub>O for the different vehicles and fuels are provided by European Environment Agency’s air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref></sup>. The emissions of other pollutants from the vehicle exhaust (e.g., NOx, NH<sub>3</sub>, SOx, PMs, etc.) are excluded because their contribution to climate change is negligible or inexistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref></sup>. Moreover, the emissions from battery and vehicle manufacture, road and vehicle maintenance, and EoL battery and vehicle treatment are also excluded. Life-cycle GHG emissions from producing biofuels are considered (i.e., farming, bioethanol conversion, and distribution), but the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions stemming from its combustion match the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by growing bioenergy feedstock and is therefore considered as net zero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref></sup>. The environmental indicator, Global Warming Potential (GWP), expressed in kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq from IPCC GWP 100a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref></sup>, is used to calculate the warming caused by the release of GHG integrated over 100 years. There is an exception for hydrogen, which GWP 100a impact from leakages is calculated using the central estimate provided by Warwick et al. (i.e., 11 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kg hydrogen)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref></sup>, as hydrogen is an indirect GHG and, as such, is not listed in the current IPCC GWP 100a impact method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref></sup>. Finally, the analysis is performed by the advanced LCA framework Brightway2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref></sup> to assess the GHG emissions per unit of fuel, including electricity, gasoline, bioethanol, natural gas, diesel, biodiesel, and hydrogen.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is financially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1643244.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>C.Z. and F.Y. contributed to the study design and analysis.
