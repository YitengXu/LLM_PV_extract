A new class of solution-processed semiconductors, which are of colloidal quantum dots (QDs), has been introduced some 30 years ago, and since then dramatic progress in the control of optical and electronic properties has enabled functionalities that are offered previously by bulk semiconductor with the added benefits of solution processability and facile bandgap tunability. Exquisite control over the shape, stoichiometry and composition of QDs has allowed for the demonstration of highly performing solar cells, light-emitting diodes and photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Doping of QDs lies at the heart of achieving new functionalities that are currently being offered by single crystalline semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The development of junctions based on QDs is instrumental to achieve high-performance solar cells and photodetectors, as it has been in the case of single crystalline semiconductors. Preliminary attempts to dope QDs were based on remote doping schemes in which ligand molecules served the purpose of the dopant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Ligands have also been utilized to passivate the surface of the dots allowing for n-type doping in PbSe QDs from the excess of Pb cations, leading to p- and n-type field effect transistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. More recently, the incorporation of substitutional and interstitial doping using heterovalent atoms has been proposed as a method for heavily doped semiconductor InAs QDs and their effect on the optical properties, and the density of states has been thoroughly studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. For chalcogenide dots of divalent cations, such as PbS and CdSe, p-type doping has been achieved with the addition of Ag<sup>1+</sup>, which is believed to replace Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, thus providing positive free carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, since PbS dots are typically p-type, because of oxidation of their surface, a more intriguing task would be to dope them n-type especially considering the technological applications of this material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recently and in contrast to the aforementioned cation-doping approaches, stoichiometry control was employed as a means to tune doping in QD solids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. N-type doping of PbS was achieved by substitution of S<sup>2−</sup> with monovalent halide ions resulting in free electrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> from the excess of Pb atoms in PbS QDs. This methodology has been utilized successfully for the creation of PbS QD homojunctions for high-efficiency photovoltaics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In another report, the evaporation of excess cations or anions on QD films has shown to tailor the doping profile accordingly. Excess of anions leads to higher p-type doping profiles, whereas excess of cations leads to n-type doping as monitored by field effect transistor measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but without any demonstration in optoelectronic devices. Relying on Pb atoms for the n-type doping has been reported to suffer from oxidation effects since the excess Pb atoms upon exposure to ambient air transform from electron-donating moiety near the conduction band to electron acceptor near the valence band turning the material into p-type. During the revision of the current manuscript, another doping scheme based on charge transfer from cobaltocene to PbS(e) QDs was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This was based on charge transfer from cobaltocene molecules to the conduction band states of QDs that allowed the demonstration of absorption bleaching in the heavily doping regime. However, robust functional optoelectronic devices based on this approach have yet to be demonstrated. In sum, a robust doping scheme for functional homojunctions that can operate under ambient environmental conditions still remains a challenge.</p><p id="Par4">We took the view that to develop a robust doping scheme we would have to employ a heterovalent substitutional doping methodology in which the excess electrons would be provided by the excess electrons offered by the valency of the dopant atoms. We posited that this dopant atom would have to possess at least an excess electron available for donation and an atomic radius similar to the original cation of Pb. Bismuth is an element with +3 valency and atomic radius similar to that of Pb; to test our hypothesis, we added bismuth acetate in the standard lead-oleate precursor method used for producing oleic acid-capped PbS dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In this method, PbS dots are synthesized in an acidic environment and incorporation of bismuth in the dots is expected to be favoured in accordance with the hard–soft acid–base theory as this has been extensively discussed in other works concerning QD cation-exchange reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our results confirm that bismuth is efficiently incorporated in the PbS QDs and suggest that it acts as an electron donor, influencing the QDs’ optoelectronic properties and rendering them suitably n-type as to be utilized in air-stable homojunction and Schottky junction solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Optical properties and material characterization of QDs</title><p id="Par5">We synthesized a range of Bi-doped PbS dots, with nominal atomic Bi/Pb precursor ratios from 0.1 to 4.5%.

This difference can in part be associated with the confinement of charge impurities in small QDs, its impact on the density of the states’ distribution and the formation of Urbach tailing in the confined states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition to the observed blue shift, we also noticed a progressive quenching of the excitonic feature with increasing Bi-doping. This can be because of effective filling with electrons of 1S<sub>e</sub> as reported also in the case of cobaltocene doping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the distortion of the crystal structure because of incorporation of bismuth and thus the lowering of the oscillator strength, or the combination of both mechanisms. The excitonic optical emission is blue shifted, although not as strongly as the absorption shift. Most profoundly, however, the emission strength is quenched by more than 94% for Bi/Pb ratios higher than 2%. This has been observed in charged and doped QDs and is attributed to strong local electric fields and Auger recombination, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These effects, taken together, are signatures of doping that have been reported to arise from the perturbation of the density of states after dopant incorporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and filling of optically accessible states of QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">To gain additional insights on the incorporation of bismuth in the PbS QDs, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on films prepared via a layer-by-layer spin-casting method in ambient atmosphere including ligand exchange with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) as used for the devices presented subsequently. As opposed to reference PbS QDs films, the spectrum (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) of a doped sample (Bi/Pb=3.2%) contains the bismuth 4f doublet peak in a spectral region that also includes three S2p doublets associated with PbS, bound and unbound thiols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. (Detailed analysis of XPS spectra is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Figs S6,S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>). Deconvolution of the overall region indicates that Bi doublets (158.3 and 163.5 eV) are associated with Bi-S bonds as closely referenced (0.1 eV difference) to bismuth sulphide (Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and that there is no secondary bismuth phase such as metallic Bi or its oxides. Analysis of sulphur 2s spectrum (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) shows that it can be deconvoluted to two peaks at 225.4 and 227.5 eV attributed, respectively, to PbS and thiolate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. A distinct signature of Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> in the sulphur peak can be elusive because of its overlap with the peaks associated to PbS and thiolates, given the particularly low doping ratio. Quantitative analysis of the XPS data indicates that bismuth incorporation is accompanied by an almost equivalent drop of the Pb content, retaining the total cation/S atomic ratio at 0.95 for both pure and doped dots. This analysis is in close agreement to the ICP-OES result regarding the Bi/Pb ratio for the same sample, 4.1% and 5.4% respectively for the two techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of these materials (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) has shown that the introduction of Bi does not induce an alteration of the crystal structure of PbS. However, it leads to a crystal distortion manifested by an increase in the lattice constant (by 0.02–0.03 Å for Bi/Pb=4.5%) with increasing doping density as observed by the position of the reflections of the crystal planes. Although the exact position of Bi atoms within the PbS QD cannot be determined (because of the similar atomic mass of the two elements), this study suggests the incorporation of bismuth in the PbS QD structure by substitution of lead.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electronic properties of doped QD films and homojunctions</title><p id="Par8">We now turn to the optoelectronic properties of the doped QDs and their employment in QD homojunctions intended for solar cell applications.

Photon-to-electron conversion in these devices occurs over the full spectrum of the QD optical absorption (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). This broadband photoresponse originates from both the p- and the n-type layers as also indicated by the EQE spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Figs S9,S11</xref>) of respective Schottky-type devices, proving the optoelectronically active nature of the doped PbS QDs.</p><p id="Par10">The effect of doping on the optoelectronic properties of the homojunctions was further studied by comparing the <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> values of homojunctions made of n-type Bi:PbS of different Bi/Pb ratios as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>. With Bi/Pb ratio increasing to 2%, the n-type character of doped dots and thus <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of the homojunctions are markedly improved, whereas heavier doping to 4.5% Bi/Pb leads to less pronounced increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> and a reduction in <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>. Doping of 0.1% leads to a reduction in hole carrier density pointing to a still p-type but less doped film. The transition from a p-type to an n-type character of the QDs occurs for doping concentrations of ~0.5–1% as observed by the ability of these films to form Schottky junctions with both aluminium and MoO<sub>3</sub>, as indicated in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>). It should be noted here that Schottky devices with 0.5–1% Bi-doping did not yield appreciable changes in the capacitance with reverse bias, even in very thick films; thus, the carrier density could not be determined by the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot. We call this a transition region in which we believe that Bi atoms compensate the p-type dopants of the PbS QDs and progressively lead to transforming them into n-type at higher Bi-doping concentration. The direct correlation between increasing dopant density and electron concentration of the n-type QDs is further explored from Mott–Schottky analysis (method described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Note 3</xref>) of the capacitance–voltage characteristics of NiO/Bi:PbS junctions as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>.

The n-type QDs are thus more heavily doped than the p-type PbS, which yield ~6.2 × 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> carrier density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Fig. S14</xref>). This reflects upon the distribution of the depletion region across the p-n interface of the homojunctions, as also studied by monitoring the electronic characteristics of diodes with varying p- and n-layer thicknesses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Tables S4,S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM980">Supplementary Figs S16,S17</xref>). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> schematically illustrates that most of the depletion region lies within the p-type layer.

In order to explore the effect on the Fermi level that Bi-doping has in our PbS QDs, and to support our hypothesis for n-type doping, we performed UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> shows the difference in the Fermi level from the valence band level of the two materials. The Fermi level of PbS QDs is 0.48 eV from the valence band, whereas the Bi-doped PbS has an energy offset of 0.81 eV. This yields a Fermi level difference between the two materials of 0.33 eV as supported by the cutoff spectra measurement shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>. Although this value is in accordance with other reports of UPS measurements on PbS QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, it is lower than the experimentally measured value in working homojunction solar cells. The origin of this difference is because of the fact that UPS measurements take place at very high vacuum conditions. Neat PbS QDs are known to become p-type-doped because of phys- and chem-adsorbed species of moisture and oxygen in working devices. Thus, in the presence of oxygen the PbS Fermi level is found to be ~4.8–4.9 eV (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>), as supported by Kelvin Probe measurements. This in turn would result in a Fermi level difference of ~0.48 eV with respect to Bi-doped PbS in agreement with the experimental values from electronic characterization.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Impact of doping on electronic structure of QDs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) UPS (UV excitation by HeI=21.21 eV) valence band-onset spectral region and measured <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub>−<italic>E</italic><sub>VB</sub> differences for PbS and two Bi:PbS unbiased QD thin film samples, and (<bold>b</bold>) cutoff region of the spectra with the samples biased at −5 V, including measured <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> shift by doping.
