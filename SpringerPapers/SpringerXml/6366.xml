However, their current industrial exploitation is limited by a productivity in photobioreactors that is low compared to potential productivity. The high cell density and pigment content of the surface layers of photosynthetic microalgae result in absorption of excess photons and energy dissipation through non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). NPQ prevents photoinhibition, but its activation reduces the efficiency of photosynthetic energy conversion. In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, NPQ is catalyzed by protein subunits encoded by three <italic>lhcsr</italic> (light harvesting complex stress related) genes. Here, we show that heat dissipation and biomass productivity depends on LHCSR protein accumulation. Indeed, algal strains lacking two <italic>lhcsr</italic> genes can grow in a wide range of light growth conditions without suffering from photoinhibition and are more productive than wild-type. Thus, the down-regulation of NPQ appears to be a suitable strategy for improving light use efficiency for biomass and biofuel production in microalgae.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep21339.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>The Authors retract this Article.

Among autotrophs, microalgae are potentially far more efficient than crops because of their rapid growth, high CO<sub>2</sub> assimilating capacity and high photosynthetic activity per biomass unit. Biofuel production from microalgae is a potential breakthrough in renewable energy production because microalgae do not compete for arable land and can grow in saltwater and wastewater derivatives can be used as nutrient supplements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Although the latest generation of photobioreactors have substantially improved light utilization, decreased area footprint and reduced installation cost, biofuel production from microalgae is still not economical because of the suboptimal productivity of full scale photobioreactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Microalgae have a theoretical solar-to-biomass conversion efficiency of 9–10%, with an expected maximum productivity of ~77?g biomass m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> (~280?ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) considering the average sunlight irradiance in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, yet the actual yield on large scale photobioreactors is far lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, implying that a large part of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation is wasted. Light harvesting occurs at Photosystems (PS II and PSI), in which chlorophyll excited states from photon absorption are delocalized between chlorophyll a molecules and trapped by reaction centers for primary photochemical reactions. These reactions drive electron transport to NADP<sup>+</sup> and the coupled proton transport powers ATP synthesis. Singlet chlorophyll excited states in excess of what can be quenched by photochemical reactions can be long lived (ns) and can undergo ISC (intersystem crossing) to triplet states whose reaction with O<sub>2</sub> yields <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) species that causes photoinhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. All oxygenic photosynthetic organisms have evolved photoprotective mechanisms known as NPQ (non-photochemical quenching)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which induces heat dissipation of the excitation energy absorbed in excess of the capacity of downstream metabolic reactions. NPQ prevents chlorophyll triplet formation by decreasing excess singlet chlorophyll excited states. Thus, photoprotective reactions compete with productivity. Green algae perform NPQ by the action of LHC-like protein(s), called LHCSR, which sense lumen acidification caused by excess light and trigger energy dissipation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, three genes encode LHCSR proteins and the <italic>lhcsr1</italic> gene product shares 82% identity to LHCSR3, which is encoded by two closely related paralogs, <italic>lhcsr3.1</italic> and <italic>lhcsr3.2</italic>. These LHCSR1/3 subunits are Chl <italic>a/b</italic>-xanthophyll-binding proteins that exhibit a fast excited state decay and respond to acidification by further switching to a dissipative state(s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The <italic>lhcsr</italic> genes are overexpressed in stress conditions depending on the activation of a thylakoid calcium sensor named CAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The photoprotective function of LHCSR proteins is synergic with other photoprotective mechanisms, such as cyclic electron flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and state transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. LHCSR3 binds to PSII supercomplexes through the PsbR subunit when cells are exposed to high light stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and the phosphorylated form of LHCSR3 might also interact with PSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Random insertional mutagenesis of the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> wild-type (WT) strain has produced the <italic>npq4</italic> mutant that lacks the <italic>lhcsr3.1</italic> and <italic>lhcsr3.2</italic> genes while retaining <italic>lhcsr1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a TILLING approach on the <italic>npq4</italic> mutant has allowed for the generation of the <italic>npq4 lhcsr1</italic> mutant in which all <italic>lhcsr</italic> genes are disrupted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In this work, we analyzed light use efficiency and photoprotection in WT, <italic>npq4</italic> and <italic>npq4 lhcsr1</italic> genotypes. The results showed that down-regulation of energy dissipation increases light use efficiency for biomass production, implying that this approach is a suitable strategy for the domestication of unicellular algae. However, complete deletion of LHCSRs reverses algae to a low productivity status because of enhanced ROS production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NPQ mutants and accumulation of LHCSR proteins</title><p>The phenotype of the WT, <italic>npq4</italic> and <italic>npq4 lhcsr1 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> genotypes studied in this work were investigated by growing the cells in conditions of high light (400?µmol m<sup>-2</sup>?s<sup>-1</sup>), under which LHCSR proteins accumulate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

To investigate whether the level of NPQ was positively correlated with the accumulation level of LHCSR isoforms per PSII, LHCSR and PSII complexes were quantified by immunoblotting with anti-LHCSR and anti-CP43 specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref> online). Interestingly, the accumulation of LHCSR1 was higher in the <italic>npq4</italic> mutant than in WT, suggesting that it compensates for the absence of LHCSR3. Under continuous light conditions, the accumulating level of LHCSR proteins increased linearly with the amounts of photons available during growth (Light A?&lt;?B?&lt;?C). In pulsed light conditions (400 or 800?µE m<sup>-2</sup>?s<sup>-1</sup>, Light D or Light E, respectively) the protein level of LHCSR1 in both WT and <italic>npq4</italic> strains was similar to that under Light B conditions (continuous light, 400?µE m<sup>-2</sup>?s<sup>-1</sup>), whereas the LHCSR3 level was similar to that under Light A conditions (continuous light, 200?µE m<sup>-2</sup>?s<sup>-1</sup>). A linear correlation between the accumulation of LHCSR isoforms and NPQ was obtained for both WT and <italic>npq4</italic> mutant when exposed to continuous light (Light A, B or C), but not under a pulsed light regime, suggesting a more complex regulation of excitation energy dissipation in the latter conditions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Kinetics of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) rise in dark-adapted cells.</p><p>Panel (<bold>a–e</bold>) NPQ induction and relaxation kinetics measured on WT (black) npq4 (red) and npq4 lhcsr1 (blue) mutants.

In this case the correlation between PCE and (Fm-Fm’)/Fm (%) was linear, highlighting the direct effect of excitation energy dissipation on photosynthetic efficiency. Accordingly, in comparison of WT to <italic>npq4</italic>, the mutant showed a higher capacity for photon conversion into biomass. However, an additional decrease in the <italic>lhcsr</italic> gene number, with loss of LHCSR1 and reduction of NPQ activity, abolished the benefits observed in <italic>npq4</italic> in the absence of LHCSR3, rather than further increasing PCE. It is important to note that according to the linear fit of PCE as a function of (Fm-Fm’)/Fm (%), thermal dissipation of 50% of the excitation energy absorbed would cause a 63% reduction of PCE, whereas dissipation of 79% of the excitation energy absorbed would be sufficient to give a null PCE. These results indicate that the loss of PCE is not only due to NPQ activation, but also is related to other stress-dependent effects, for example, ROS production in high light and photoinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Lack of LHCSR proteins induces photosensitivity</title><p>To further investigate the productivity loss in <italic>npq4 lhcsr1</italic> compared to <italic>npq4</italic>, we verified the hypothesis that the <italic>npq4 lhcsr1</italic> genotype underwent enhanced photoinhibition.

In a highly quenched state, photosynthetic biomass production is reduced, as is the risk for photoinhibition. LHCSR1 and LHCSR3, the gene products essential for NPQ in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, both accumulated when cells were grown at the different light intensities, inducing a light-dependent NPQ in WT and <italic>npq4</italic> strains but not in the <italic>npq4 lhcsr1</italic> mutant. The NPQ induction in cells grown in continuous light were linearly correlated with LHCSR3 and LHCSR1 accumulation, whereas this correlation was lost in pulsed light conditions, especially in the case of LHCSR3, suggesting the presence of more complex NPQ regulation in these conditions. However, the accumulation of LHCSR1 in the <italic>npq4</italic> mutant was not sufficient to fully compensate for LHCSR3 absence because the LHCSR1-dependent NPQ levels measured in <italic>npq4</italic> were always lower than those in the LHCSR3/LHCSR1-dependent NPQ measured in WT.

It is worth noting that although higher plants accumulate PsbS even at low light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, green algae accumulate LHCSR proteins in stress conditions only, suggesting that green algae prevent unnecessary quenching, i.e., loss of excitation energy, when growing in low light conditions.
