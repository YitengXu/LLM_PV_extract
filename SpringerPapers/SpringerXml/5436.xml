Africa is blessed with abundant resources of fossil fuels as well as renewable energy resources. Yet the continent, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is afflicted with power crisis. For example, in Nigeria, erratic electricity supplies will persist unless the government diversifies her energy sources and adopt new technologies available in the electricity generation sector. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has called for promotion of increased utilization of the continent’s vast renewable energy resources to accelerate development. This review examines the perspective of renewable energy from biomass as an important strategy for a sustainable development in Nigeria. The paper also addresses the use of pyrolysis technology––an efficient thermo-chemical process for energy applications. However, the study presents on applications either to replace fossil fuel in an existing diesel engine-based power generation system or to generate electricity using a gas engine. The work also presented herein addresses the use of industrial- and non-industrial-derived biomass residues for energy purposes with specific example on solid palm oil residues in Nigeria. The current status of pyrolysis technology and its potential for commercial application for bio-fuel production using microwave-assisted pyrolysis in Nigeria are presented. This study will extensively review the recent work on microwave-assisted technology applied to the pyrolysis process. It is estimated that electrical power generation potential at about 500 MW can be obtained by using only the available residues from oil palm industry in Nigeria. This potential can be increased 10-fold with more emphasis on expansion and modernization of oil palm industry in Nigeria. This will benefit in terms of higher revenue from the palm oil export as well as higher renewable energy generation from its biomass residue using the microwave-assisted pyrolysis technology.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nigeria</kwd><kwd>Bio-fuel</kwd><kwd>Bio-oil</kwd><kwd>Oil palm biomass</kwd><kwd>Microwave-assisted

id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Review</title><p id="Par2">Energy consumption has been used as an index for measuring the development of a particular region, country, and economy. Population growth is one of the factors that cause explosive demand for energy use. Nigeria has the largest population in Africa, with a population of over 170 million and forecasted to grow to 310 million by 2035. Agriculture remains a large sector in many African economies, accounting for around 20% of regional GDP (compared with a 6% share globally) and around 65% of employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Superimposed on this, the UN Population Division projects’ future increases in the world’s urban population are also expected to be highly concentrated in just a few countries depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Taken together, China, India, and Nigeria are projected to account for 37% of the increase of nearly 2.5 billion people in the urban population by 2050. Between 2014 and 2050, the urban areas are expected to grow by 404 million people in India, 292 million in China, and 212 million in Nigeria. Similarly, at present, the largest rural populations in Africa are located in Nigeria (95 million), and between 2014 and 2050, it is expected to register the largest increase of 50 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Contribution to the increase in urban population by country, 2014–2050.

There is a correlation between electricity consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) of a nation. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] sub-Saharan Africa has the highest population without electricity––about 640 million, rural electrification below par of 17% and yet, the region is known to have sufficient non-fossil and fossil energy resources largely unharnessed. The current energy production capacity has failed to support economic growth, infrastructural development, and in elevating living standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This makes many sub-Saharan Africa-based industries and manufacturing sectors uncompetitive and drags down annual GDP growth. For instance, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in their study on the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in Nigeria covering periods 1980–2008 found that there was bidirectional causality between the two. To fulfill the economic and social growth of the region, the ability of government to develop the huge electricity capacity deficit is very crucial. The mission to widen access to modern energy services has been influential in shaping some of the discussions on energy at the international level. The year 2012 has been declared year of energy access and 2030 has been set as the year for achieving universal access to modern energy services. For the vast majority of African countries, lack of access to modern energy services constitutes a major obstacle in boosting industrial, agricultural, urban, and rural development. For many commercial enterprises, unreliable and costly supplies of electricity and modern fuels impede production, growth, and development.</p><p id="Par4">Nigeria is richly blessed with primary energy resources. The country is endowed with large reserves of crude oil currently estimated to be about 36 billion barrels has an estimated amount of about 166 trillion standard cubic feet (5210 billion cubic meters). Nigeria holds the largest natural gas reserves on the continent and was the world’s fourth largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

The supply of electricity has been erratic with hydro and thermal routes being the major contributor of the electricity generation. Africa has the lowest level of electrification rate in the developing world at 25%. In China, East Asia, and the Middle East, the electrification rate is around 91.8% compared to south Asia at 62.2% and Latin America at 93.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Average amount of electricity consumed per capita in Nigeria is 137 kWh, which is one of the lowest in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Taking into account the desire to improve electrification, many African countries are putting great importance on power generation and distribution. Further to the shortage of power generation, transmission and distribution losses are also higher in Africa compared to the world average (11.3% compared to 9.2%). These losses exceed 20% in Senegal, Kenya, and Tanzania and 40% in Nigeria and Congo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite the vast abundance of fossil fuels (oil and gas), the fossil fuels have only contributed 18.1% to the total primary energy consumption in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The greater portion of the crude oil produced in the country is usually exported. In 2007, more than 98% of the crude oil extracted in the country was exported, leaving less than 2% for local consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite the ample coal, oil, and natural gas reserves, at the present rate of extraction, it has been estimated that these reserves, by the next 40 years, will be depleted to a point uneconomical to continue exploration. It therefore becomes imperative that alternative sources of energy are explored.</p><p id="Par6">When it comes to electrification, choosing the right technology available among the various technological alternatives is important. Both off-grid and on-grid options are normally promoted in parallel when pursuing rural electrification in many developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Sustainability is one of the key concerns in terms of energy access. Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] states that currently, energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion for heat supply, electricity generation, and transport, account for around 70% of total emissions including carbon dioxide, methane, and some traces of nitrous oxide. It is crucial to implement greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction technologies for fossil fuel combustion processes. Strategies for climate change mitigation are necessary on a global scale, particularly for high GHG emitters like the industrialized countries, countries in transition, and rapidly developing countries. It is vital that new energy demands are met, where possible, by sustainable and non-polluting means, in order to stop the escalation of the environmental effects of fossil fuel use. Furthermore, to meet emissions targets and reduce the environmental threat, current reliance on fossil fuels for all energy uses must be reduced drastically. Consequently, it will be necessary to re-evaluate the way in which energy is produced, distributed, and used worldwide. This, however, will not happen until less expensive, easily implemented, and equally reliable alternatives become available. To achieve the necessary reduction in fossil fuel use, a number of measures can be considered.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par7">The electricity supply grid can be supplied with an increasing amount of electricity generated from sustainable and non-polluting sources.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">The use of waste and biomass, or fuels derived from these, can be considered for transportation, heating and cooking, electricity production, and energy storage.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">The use of combined heat and power (CHP), where the waste heat from electricity production is used for space and water heating or cooling (increasing fuel utilization often by a factor of two or more).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Due to the availability of efficient small scale renewable energy generating plant, it can be worthwhile to consider on-site electricity generation for own use, especially where there are exploitable local resources (biomass or waste fuel, and/or a local wind or solar resource).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">In its Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the IPCC draws the conclusion that renewable energy sources can play an important role in this transformation process. The urgent energy situation requires the current existing energy system to undertake both fundamental reforms by shifting to other energy resources and gradual improvements by adopting more advanced technologies for energy generation and production. A shift of primary energy resources from fossil fuels to renewable energy could greatly reduce the current heavy dependence upon fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources can be highly transient and exhibit strong short-term and seasonal variations in their energy outputs. Their variability poses problems for applications that require a continuous supply of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, renewable resources typically have a low energy density, often large collection areas are required to generate modest power outputs. It has been projected that the production of liquid fuels from biomass will soar in the next 30 years irrespective of whether the oil prices are low or high; thus, new technologies must be developed for the efficient conversion of biomass to fuels that have high energy density and compatibility with the existing energy infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Two significant barriers impede widespread deployment of renewable energy, cost, and demand side servicing. While cost is an important factor, the variability related to the inherent temporal mismatch between resource availability (sun shining, wind blowing etc.) and the load poses a serious technical issue for the deployment of renewable energy. Power from these resources may not be available when required. For renewables to assume a role as a primary energy source, the availability issue must be addressed. One commonly quoted solution is to incorporate a broad mix of renewable sources. Countries like Denmark which have lead the way in incorporating renewable energy into their energy system have published energy plans which target 50% renewable by 2030 and 100% by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Currently, wind and solar power are assumed to be the key technologies in this development. However, their production fluctuates greatly over time (depending on changing weather patterns) and sites with high potential are often some distance from demand centers like cities. Lignocellulosic and other forms of biomass are some of the main renewable energy resources available and considered as promising alternative to provide the source of renewable liquid, gaseous, and solid fuels. It is the oldest source of energy used by humans, and it is able to supply all kinds of fuels, chemicals, and materials, which we currently obtain from petroleum, coal, or natural gas. The purpose of such review is to highlight the importance of renewable energy derived from biomass in complementing the present government of Nigeria’s effort to address the nations over dependence on its fossil fuels for federal revenues and energy mix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Renewable energy potentials in Nigeria</title><p id="Par12">Access to reliable, efficient, affordable, and environment-friendly modern energy services for basic needs is necessary for human development and sustainable economic growth. Though it is the fastest growing form of energy, renewable energy (RE) contributes just around 3% of the global energy supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Energy is one of the main factors that must be considered in the discussions of sustainable development. Current and future possible environmental, economic, political, and social consequences have force the countries to incline towards to renewable energy resources. Choice of the appropriate solution to be applied within energy sector is a complicated problem: great number of alternatives and criteria must be evaluated paying attention to the social, economic, technological, and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The basic premise of all renewable energy development policies is that they create demand for climate-friendly technologies that otherwise would not exist at all or not at desired levels under current market conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Determining the appropriate energy policy problem can be viewed as a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. A comprehensive list of evaluation criteria and indicators used in MCDM studies conducted on energy issues used by researches is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, where the sustainability aspects are grouped in technical, economic, environmental, and social criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Selection criteria for sustainable energy planning.

AHP is effective in dealing with complex decision-making because it reduces complex decisions to a series of pairwise comparisons. It generates a weight for each evaluation criterion and scenario according to the information provided. The AHP combines the objective and scenario evaluations to determine a relative ranking of the scenarios. In one particular study using AHP to evaluate the best renewable energy technology, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported that the multi-criteria decision analyses showed that the wind energy is the best renewable energy alternative. The ranking of the other alternatives in descending order were biomass, geothermal, solar, and hydropower. Also, the evaluation of criteria indicated that environmental effects are more important in this problem of technology selection. Renewable energy has considerable potential in Nigeria and could bridge the major energy gaps in rural areas, particularly northern Nigeria.</p><p id="Par14">Nigeria is greatly endowed with sufficient renewable energy resources to suffice its present and future development requirements. Renewable energy provides a safe and feasible option for the provision of a clean and environment-friendly energy. The huge potential for renewable energies is largely untapped in Nigeria. There have been various explorations of renewable energy in Nigeria since 1990s. Renewable energy supply in Nigeria is dominated by hydropower and solar energy. Quite a number of literature have reported the RE potentials in Nigeria as illustrated in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Renewable energy potentials in Nigeria––source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th><p>Resource</p></th><th><p>Potential</p></th><th><p>Current utilizations</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="5"><p>Biomass</p></td><td><p>Agricultural residues</p></td><td><p>91.4 million tons/year produced</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Animal wastes</p></td><td><p>245 million assorted animals in 2001</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Energy crops</p></td><td><p>28.2 million hectares of arable land; 8.5 cultivated</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Fuel wood</p></td><td><p>43.4 million tons/year consumption</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Municipal waste</p></td><td><p>18.5 million tons produced in 2005 and now estimated at 0.5 kg/capita/day</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Large hydropower</p></td><td><p>11,250 MW</p></td><td><p>1900 MW</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Small hydropower</p></td><td><p>3500 MW</p></td><td><p>64.2 MW</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Solar</p></td><td><p>4.0–6.5 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/day</p></td><td><p>15 MW dispersed solar PV installations (estimated)</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Wind</p></td><td><p>2–4 m/s @ 10 m height mainland</p></td><td><p>Electronic wind information system (WIS) available</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par15">These REs could potentially facilitate in overcoming the energy supply deficit and also decrease emission level and improved living standard of the Nigeria people.</p><p id="Par16"><italic>Solar energy</italic> potential is enormous in Nigeria, with fairly evenly distributed solar radiation averaging 19.8 MJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day<sup>−1</sup> and an average of 6 h of sunshine a day; ranging between about 3.5 h at the coastal areas and 9.0 h at the far northern border areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Conversion of biomass into renewable motor fuels, together with the associated environmental and geopolitical benefits, has driven considerable research in the area. The term biomass is commonly identified as biological material from living plant or dead plant. In the present context, biomass refers to dead trees, branches and tree stumps, yard clippings, off-cuts, wood chips, and agro residues. Biomass is considered as one of the renewable energy sources with the highest potential to contribute to the energy needs of modern society for both the industrialized and developing countries. While biomass is being used for cooking and heat, it is currently not being fully used to produce electricity in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Lignocellulosic biomass and energy potential</title><p id="Par21">The intermittency of renewable power sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) presents a major obstacle to their extensive penetration into the grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The quest for renewable sustainable energy sources has given biomass a prominence it had lost during the industrial revolution after the discovery of convenient fossil fuels like coal and oil. Biomass defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 2005)––<italic>“Is a non-fossilized and biodegradable organic material originating from plants, animals and micro-organisms. This shall also include products, by-products, residues and waste from agriculture, forestry and related industries as well as the non-fossilized and biodegradable organic fractions of industrial and municipal wastes.”</italic> On a comparative basis, biomass is considered carbon-neutral, meaning there is no addition to the CO<sub>2</sub> inventory by the burning of biomass, which is also worthy to clarify against cutting trees for energy supply because they serve as a CO<sub>2</sub> sink. A tree stops absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> after it stops growing or dies. Similarly, if left alone on the forest floor, it can release CO<sub>2</sub> through natural degradation or in a forest fire and even incomplete combustion as the case for household and cottage usage. Furthermore, a dead tree could release more harmful CH<sub>4</sub> if left to decompose in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Biomass comes in a variety of forms, which can be utilized as an energy resource. Loosely, biomass may also be classified into two broad groups: <italic>Virgin biomass</italic> includes lignocellulose (wood, plants, and leaves) and carbohydrates (crops and vegetables) and <italic>Waste biomass</italic> comprises municipal solid waste (solid and liquid wastes); sewage, animal, and human wastes; gases derived from landfilling (mainly methane); and agricultural wastes. Nigeria have in excess both types of biomass mentioned above; however, the present state of the Nigerian agricultural sector is overwhelmingly a small or medium scale production. The producers are not relishing the full scale production capacity and enhanced productivity because of the lack of basic amenities, finance, modern agricultural technology, and modern downstream processing technology.</p><p id="Par22">Lignocellulosic materials including agricultural wastes, forestry residues, grasses, and woody materials have great potential for bio-fuel production. Typically, most of the agricultural lignocellulosic biomass is comprised of about 10–25% lignin, 20–30% hemicellulose, and 40–50% cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Cellulose is a major structural component of plant cell walls, which is responsible for mechanical strength and chemical stability to plants. Cellulose is a linear crystalline polysaccharide, with general formula (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<italic>n</italic>. The polymer is formed from repeating units of cellobiose, a disaccharide of β-linked glucose moieties. The hemicellulose macromolecules are often repeated polymers of pentoses (including xylose and arabinose) and hexoses (including galactose, glucose, and mannose). Unlike cellulose, the composition of hemicelluloses and lignin is heterogeneous and can vary greatly even within a given biomass species. Hemicelluloses have an amorphous structure and display branching in their polymer chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Lignin which comprises from 20–30% of the wood is the cementing agent which binds the individual wood fibers together to form a substance of strength and rigidity. The lignins are highly branched, substituted, mononuclear polymers of phenylpropane units. The main components of plant biomass are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Currently, more focus is given on non-food crops (lignocellulosic) biomass.

As an example, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> gives an overview of the different processing methods for solid biomass waste from oil palm industry or other related agricultural crops. Methods such as gasification, torrefaction, and pyrolysis come under the category of thermochemical energy conversion methods. Fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis, and anaerobic digestion are classified under biological conversion methods whereas densification and shedding come under physical processes.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>General overview of processing technologies for oil palm or other agriculture crop solid biomass residues</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2017_126_Fig7_HTML.gif" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pyrolysis principles and mechanism</title><p id="Par34">Waste materials such as waste biomass, waste oil, and plastic are throughout the year all around the world. Some of these wastes are effectively collected and recovered for use as an energy source or chemical feedstock. Thermal conversion involves the use of a wide range of thermal decomposition processes such as combustion, pyrolysis, and gasification to decompose waste materials into smaller molecules that can be used as energy source or inputs for the synthesis of new materials. Combustion is a process which involves the complete oxidation of a product, gasification involves high temperatures but only partial oxidation, while pyrolysis is the thermo-chemical decomposition of hydrocarbon (or organic) materials at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen (typically performed by using conventional furnace heating).

Pyrolysis techniques have been developed as an alternative to treat and convert waste materials to products suitable for use as a potential energy source. It offers the potential for greater efficiencies and less pollution for the production of reactive intermediate products from biomass in comparison with other techniques. Lignocellulosic feedstocks including virgin resources and residues such as wood, coffee hulls, rice straw, waste tea, wheat straw, sewage sludge, and automotive industry wastes including auto shredder residues showed high potentials as the raw materials for the pyrolysis process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].

Once biomass reaches high temperatures (i.e., &gt;300 °C), it thermally depolymerizes to form small oxygenates (up to 80% yield) which are vapors in the reactor but condense to a liquid mixture (i.e., bio-oil) at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Onay and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] in a fast pyrolysis of rapeseed reported bio-oil yield of 68% at 550 °C. The authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] in a similar experiment with the same feedstock investigated the effect of temperature, heating rate, particle size, and sweep gas flow on the product yield. They concluded and reported maximum oil yield of 73% while char formation decreased from 27 to 14.5% with the increasing temperature within 550–600 °C, particle size of +0.6–1.25 mm, and sweep gas flow rate of 100 cm<sup>3</sup>/min. The ultimate benefit of pyrolysis is that solid biomass can be converted to a transportable liquid (bio-oil) while simultaneously increasing energy density (through deoxygenation). The products of biomass pyrolysis are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic for pyrolysis process</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2017_126_Fig8_HTML.gif" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">Depending on the thermal environment and the final temperature, pyrolysis will yield mainly biochar at low temperatures, less than 450 ºC, when the heating rate is quite slow, and mainly gases at high temperatures, greater than 800 °C, with rapid heating rates.

Therefore, the syngas from biomass pyrolysis can be considered as a renewable alternative fuel for IC engines and industrial combustion routes.</p><p id="Par41">Integrating microwave irradiation into pyrolysis is a novel alternative heating mechanism that has gained increasing attention in recent years. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) has many advantages over three conventional heating, including uniform internal heating of comparatively larger particles size, instantaneous heating rates, produces fewer ashes in the liquid product as it does not require any agitations, no syngas dilution by the carrying gas, and easier technology implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Early work on the development of MAP used batch-type process that is characterized under intermediate rate pyrolysis. A key to obtaining higher yields and quality of pyrolysis oil lies in increasing the heating rate and consequentially reducing the reaction time. In recent researches and developments, carbonaceous materials such as charcoal, activated carbon, carbon, and pyrolysis char are used as microwave absorbers to enhance the heat and mass transfers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. A microwave pyrolysis of wood sawdust and corn stover using SiC as microwave absorber by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] showed that temperature can reach up to 960 °C. Very recently, study was carried out to observe the influence of conventional slow and microwave pyrolysis on products yield. The results revealed that the use of microwave irradiation boosted the production of bio-oil.

More so, the liquid can also be used to produce a range of speciality and commodity chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Pyrolysis offers a flexible and attractive way of converting solid biomass into an easily stored and transported liquid, which can be successfully used for the production of heat, power, and chemicals. Due to its ability to produce potentially valuable products, vigorous efforts have been made to perfect the pyrolysis process and techniques for energy recovery from waste materials, in addition to offering an alternative solution to disposal of the waste by incineration. The wide variety of pyrolysis products indicates that the products may need to be separated and purified before they can be used further; this can usually be achieved through the use of existing distillery and refinery facilities.</p><p id="Par43">Different biomass constitution has consequences to the pyrolysis products which can be observed through the pyrolysis product yields and the quality of the oil. For example, the chemical structure and organic components in biomass are particularly important in the development of processes for producing derived fuels and chemicals. Numerous researchers in the literature have studied the pyrolysis of biomass on the basis of their components. In a particular study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] observed significant interactions between cellulose and lignin that caused a suppression of liquid product formation and an increase in solid residue yield. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] studied the pyrolysis of Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) in a bench scale fluidized bed reactor, where a non-homogeneous liquid (bio-oil) was produced. In another attempt, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] use washed OPEFB and a homogeneous liquid was produced. The bio-oil from the washed OPEFB had similar properties as wood-derived bio-oil. Pre-treatment is understood to break the internal lignin and hemicellulose bonds to increase the pore size of the biomass that can be potentially converted to useful products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Pyrolysis is a complex non-equilibrium process where the biomass undergoes multistage decomposition resulting in large changes in specific volume. Devolatilization is a key step in thermochemical conversion and describes the process where volatile matter consisting of gas and condensates are released as the solid fuel is heated, under an inert atmosphere. The release of volatiles is due to the scission of chemical bonds in the natural polymers that comprise lignocellulosic biomass. The reaction rate, order, and product yields depend on parameters such as temperature, heating rate, pre-treatment, and catalytic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The reaction mechanism can be approximated by combining the yields from the three lignocellulosic compounds despite synergetic effects. Cellulose is the focus of much research because it is the dominant lignocellulosic compound, and therefore, cellulose decomposition is best understood. The primary cellulose reaction is described by the Waterloo-mechanism, illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Primary cellulose decomposition according to Waterloo-mechanism</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2017_126_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par45">Even though various studies have been conducted, there is still a challenge in understanding the fundamentals of the science of biomass pyrolysis and a model that can explain the chemistry undergoing.

The studies on pyrolysis kinetics are paramount in the understanding of pyrolysis temperature range, degradation characteristics, pyrolysis process designing, and optimization of the process parameters for yield maximization.

A better knowledge of the kinetics concerning the thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic material is required. The abundant research literature on the field of biomass pyrolysis kinetics still leaves many key issues unsolved. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) is a technique used to determine changes in weight of a known quantity of sample in relation to a change in temperature. The data obtained from the TGA gives valuable information about the rate at which pyrolysis occurs. Derivative Thermogravimetry (DTG) is usually also applied to the TGA data, to determine the rate of weight loss as a function of temperature. The data generated from TGA include temperature, time, and weight changes during the pyrolysis process and these data can be used to calculate the activation energies and pre-exponential factor of different pyrolysis phases by means of a variety of mathematical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. TGA can be employed only at relatively low heating rates (1–50 °C/min) because the true temperature of the samples may become unknown at high heating rates. Normally, intrinsic kinetic parameters are obtained from thermogravimetric experiments performed with low heating rates and with fine particles below 1 mm, to produce a kinetically controlled regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Intrinsic parameters are scale independent and do not include the effect of transport phenomena, which make them more reliable for scaling up and reactor design. With high heating rates and large particle sizes, thermal gradients are observed and the process becomes no longer kinetically controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The various thermodynamic data obtained or calculated can then be used to model the pyrolysis process. Practical models that predict the evolution of specific products of interest are still expected in the literature. Numerous models exist for the pyrolysis process, each with their advantages and disadvantages. They range in complexity from simple first-order models to more mathematically complex models incorporating various factors which influence the kinetics of pyrolysis. There are various methods for evaluating kinetic parameters from TGA, and the most common of them can be classified into two major types: model-fitting and model-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In the model-fitting method, different models are fit to the experimental data, and the model giving the best statistical fit is selected as the model from which the activation energy and frequency factor are evaluated. Historically, model-fitting methods were broadly used because of their ability to directly calculate the kinetic parameters from the thermogravimetric analysis results. However, these methods have several drawbacks, the most important one being their inability to uniquely select the appropriate reaction model. This led to the decline of these methods in favor of isoconversional (model-free) methods which can estimate the activation energy without evaluating the reaction model. The greatest advantages of this model are its simplicity and avoidance of errors related to selecting specific reaction models. Isoconversional method is called model-free method because of its ability to determine the activation energy for different constant extents of conversion without considering any particular form of the reaction model. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], the isoconversional analysis based on non-isothermal data was successful in correctly describing the multistep kinetics. There is still room for improvement in developing kinetic models able to describe biomass pyrolysis for a wider range of operating conditions since the kinetic parameters obtained are often suitable only for a certain range of temperatures. Improving the mechanisms in terms of predicting the product yields and composition, suitability for a wider range of biomass and operating conditions are priorities to consider in future kinetic models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pyrolysis pyrolyzer</title><p id="Par50">The pyrolyzer is the heart of any pyrolysis process.

The most important and the most studied product out of the three is the bio-oil. Reason for this is that bio-oil can be upgraded into bio-fuel. It is generally believed that the new alternative source of energy has to be in liquid form for it to be a suitable replacement for petroleum-based fuels. Generally, fast pyrolysis and flash pyrolysis are more promising alternative approaches than slow pyrolysis due to the fact that they can convert a wide range of biomass feedstock for higher bio-oil yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The raw bio-oil is obtained from pyrolysis of organic material at 350–600 °C in the absence of oxygen that is not readily available for consumption; there are many issues that negatively affect the ability for raw bio-oil to be used as a source of fuel or for value added chemical. Its complex chemical composition is one of the main reasons it cannot be utilized directly in combustion systems. Bio-oil has a low heating value of 16–18 Mj/kg because of a 15–30 wt% of water and 35–50 wt% of oxygen; its high acidity of pH 2–3 also contribute to its undesirable qualities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Upgrading is used to improve the chemical and physical properties of the raw bio-oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. One of the main difficulties that occur during biomass pyrolysis is the selectivity of the desired compounds in the bio-oil. Different feedstock sources lead to different ratios in the chemical composition of the bio-oil. Recently, many investigations have been geared towards improving the bio-oil yield during the pyrolysis process as well as improving the selectivity of the desired compounds in the pyrolysis oil. Catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis has been at the center of many recent investigations whose aim is to improve selectivity and yield of bio-oil. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis has advantages over the conventional electrical heating processes. For the conventional electrical heating, heat is transferred from high-temperature gas to the fuel particle surface through convection mechanism and it is then further transferred from the outside surface to the inside core through conduction mechanism. A temperature gradient from outside to inside of the feedstock particle is formed due to the poor thermal conductivity of the feedstock material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. For the microwave-assisted heating, microwave penetrates the feedstock particle and microwave energy is transformed into thermal energy inside the particle. Due to the heat loss effect of particle surface, thermal energy constantly accumulates inside the biomass particle and is transferred outwards. A temperature gradient from inside to outside of particle is formed, and the released volatile diffuses from the inside core to the outside surface through a lower temperature region. These different heating mechanisms make microwave-assisted heating have different characteristics as compared with conventional electrical heating (Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab10"><label>Table 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between microwave-assisted and electrical heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th><p>Microwave-assisted heating</p></th><th><p>Electrical heating</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><p>Conversion of energy</p></td><td><p>Transfer of energy</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>In-core volumetric and uniform heating at molecular level</p></td><td><p>Superficial heating via conduction, convection, and radiation</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Hot spot</p></td><td><p>No hot spot</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Rapid</p></td><td><p>Slow</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Higher electricity conversion efficiency</p></td><td><p>Lower electricity conversion efficiency</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Selective</p></td><td><p>Non-selective</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Dependent on material’s properties</p></td><td><p>Less dependent</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Precise and controlled heating</p></td><td><p>Less controllable</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><p>Lower thermal inertia and faster response</p></td><td><p>Higher thermal inertia and slower response</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par52">Traditionally, zeolite catalyst has been employed in the oil industry for its refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>].

The product yield composition of flash pyrolysis is 2% bio-char (solid), 75% bio-oil (liquid), and 13% syngas (gas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Flash pyrolysis is the process with the best prospects simply because it has the highest liquid content in the products. It must also be noted that these heating rates cannot occur with only biomass inside the reaction chamber. Biomass by itself takes an extremely long time to convert into the products of biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. To facilitate this conversion process, a catalyst must be used. The addition of a catalyst to the bio-mass improves the heating rate. This allows the quantity of the bio-oil to increase. The so called catalyst mainly used in microwave pyrolysis to improve heating value are metal oxides and zeolites.

The task now for this country is to find ways to formulate national policies to integrate these valuable resources into generation while realizing sustainable development goals. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis can be a pathway out of poverty for developing counties. It can provide new incentives for agricultural development; offer farmers an additional source of income by providing the biomass residue for bio-oil and syngas production via pyrolysis. It will also be able to help in carbon sequestration and most importantly energy security for the country. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis is reviewed in this paper as an attempt to give strong indications on what lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis technology can offer in terms of converting waste agricultural residue, especially palm oil residue, to energy as well as helping in the reduction of overall GHG emissions for Nigeria. The overall prospect of pyrolysis technology is very optimistic because it is already a proven concept. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis appears as the most feasible of the thermo-chemical conversion techniques; capable of generating high temperatures with minimal energy. As with all new technologies, microwave pyrolysis has gained plenty of attention from researches; however, the large scale commercial plant is still not available yet. Currently, there are only few projects on continuous microwave-assisted pyrolysis which can later be scaled up into larger centralized bio-refineries. It is still difficult to precisely predict the microwave-assisted pyrolysis process and results by only judging the feedstock characteristics due to the variations in feedstock characteristics. The remedy to this dilemma has been recent investigations using pre-treatment techniques. Pre-treatment will bring about homogeneity to the feedstock which will allow the feedstock going into the pyrolysis process produce yield that are of similar chemical composition. Based on the analysis presented here and also that from other researchers, it is clear that there is still plenty that needs to be done in the future that will contribute to the efficiency of the overall process and its economic viability. The future works on microwave-assisted pyrolysis should focus on (i) the types of microwave absorbents since it is necessary to achieve desired temperatures, (ii) improving catalyst selectivity, (iii) optimizing reaction conditions to improve yield, (iv) study of the reaction kinetics and numerical simulation of the overall process, and (v) the pre-treatment of the lignocellulosic biomass to achieve homogeneity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>The authors would like to thank the University Tenaga Nasional for the research facilities.
