To make solar hydrogen production a reality, a significant cost reduction for the construction of a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

It absorbs a substantial portion of the visible spectrum (bandgap energy, ∼2.5 eV) and has a favourable conduction band edge position, which is very near the thermodynamic H<sub>2</sub> evolution potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a result, it demonstrated the most negative photocurrent onset potential for water oxidation among all n-type semiconductors (photoanodes) having bandgaps in the visible region. Also, it appears to be fairly stable against chemical and photoelectrochemical corrosion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A recent report shows that photoanodes composed of only oxide components, nanoporous BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrodes coupled with FeOOH and NiOOH as oxygen evolution catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, can achieve an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) for water splitting as high as 1.7% in a stable manner (equation for ABPE is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM873">Supplementary Information</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This result demonstrated the possibility for constructing a PEC for water splitting using only inexpensive and easy-to-process oxide components.</p><p id="Par4">One of the major limitations of BiVO<sub>4</sub> for further improving the solar energy conversion efficiency is its bandgap (∼2.5 eV), which fundamentally limits photon absorption. Considering that there are a substantial number of photons in the 2.0–2.5 eV region of the solar spectrum, a reduction in bandgap by even 0.1–0.3 eV can result in a significant efficiency increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

However, most previous doping studies of BiVO<sub>4</sub> were to increase carrier densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Studies reporting the change in photon absorption of BiVO<sub>4</sub> have been scarce and no clear elucidation of the effect of the dopants on the electronic band structures has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Considering that the valence band maximum (VBM) of BiVO<sub>4</sub> is significantly more positive than water oxidation potential, but the conduction band minimum (CBM) of BiVO<sub>4</sub> is very close to the reduction potential of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the reduction in bandgap of BiVO<sub>4</sub> will be the most advantageous if it is achieved by raising the VBM.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we report that mild annealing treatment of nanoporous BiVO<sub>4</sub> under N<sub>2</sub> flow results in nitrogen incorporation into the oxygen sites, which effectively decreases the bandgap while also improving carrier mobility. In addition, we discover that the same N<sub>2</sub> treatment generates oxygen vacancies that can increase the majority carrier density. The effect of nitrogen incorporation and oxygen vacancies on the electronic band structure and charge transport of BiVO<sub>4</sub> are systematically elucidated by <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations, which corroborate well with the experimental results. Owing to concurrent enhancement in photon absorption, carrier density and carrier mobility, the N<sub>2</sub>-treated BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrode, when paired with oxygen evolution catalysts, breaks the wall of 2% ABPE for solar water splitting, a first for a single oxide photoelectrode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and characterization</title><p id="Par6">Nanoporous BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrodes were first prepared by the method described in a recent study, which involves electrochemical deposition of BiOI followed by thermal and chemical conversion to BiVO<sub>4</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Nitrogen doping of BiVO<sub>4</sub> was achieved by annealing the BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrodes at 350 °C for 2 h while flowing N<sub>2</sub>. This is an exceptionally gentle procedure for nitrogen doping considering that nitridation or nitrogen doping of oxides is generally achieved by annealing with a flow of NH<sub>3</sub> at much higher temperatures (≥500 °C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Annealing under N<sub>2</sub> flow may create oxygen deficiencies in oxide compounds but is usually considered insufficient for nitrogen doping.

For charge-balanced incorporation of nitrogen, three O<sup>2−</sup> ions need to be removed for every two N<sup>3−</sup> ions, creating one oxygen vacancy. Therefore, the formula of nitrogen-doped BiVO<sub>4</sub> can be written as BiVO<sub>4−1.5<italic>x</italic></sub>N<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> if no other types of oxygen vacancies are present. The EPMA result showed that <italic>x</italic> is 0.31±0.05 (that is, BiVO<sub>3.54</sub>N<sub>0.31</sub>).

This indicates that unlike other oxides, nitrogen incorporation into BiVO<sub>4</sub> can occur using N<sub>2</sub> as the N source at mild temperatures.

This should be due to the changes in local coordination environments of Bi and V ions, including a change in ligand type (O to N) and a decrease in coordination number due to oxygen vacancies compensating the charge difference between O<sup>2−</sup> and N<sup>3−</sup>. In addition, the possibility that the N<sub>2</sub> treatment created additional oxygen vacancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which would result in partial reduction of Bi<sup>3+</sup> and V<sup>5+</sup> ions, cannot be excluded.</p><p id="Par10">The ultraviolet–visible spectra of BiVO<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>-treated BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrodes are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>.

The N<sub>2</sub>-treated BiVO<sub>4</sub> also shows a significant absorption before the absorption edge (wavelength &gt;550 nm).

This means that the 27% photocurrent enhancement observed at 0.6 V for the N<sub>2</sub>-treated sample is partially due to an increase in photon absorption and partially due to an increase in electron–hole separation (see the Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM873">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for detailed calculations).</p><p id="Par14">One plausible mechanism for N<sub>2</sub> treatment to increase <italic>φ</italic><sub>sep</sub> is to increase the carrier density by creating extra oxygen vacancies, which can serve as donors, in addition to the oxygen vacancies created for charge-balanced substitution of N<sup>3−</sup> with O<sup>2−</sup>. This can result in an improvement in electron transport and, therefore, in electron–hole separation. The carrier densities in BiVO<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>-treated BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrodes were compared by obtaining Mott–Schottky plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM873">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). For nanoporous films, since the regions that contribute to space-charge layer capacitance and the corresponding surface area cannot be precisely quantified, accurate quantitative analysis of carrier density using Mott–Schottky analysis is not possible.

The result shows that the slope of N<sub>2</sub>-treated BiVO<sub>4</sub> is ∼1/7 of the slope of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, indicating that the N<sub>2</sub>-treated BiVO<sub>4</sub> electrodes possess extra oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors.
