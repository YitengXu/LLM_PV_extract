Establishing an island microgrid is a relatively good solution to the problem. However, high investment costs restrict its application. In this paper, micro pumped storage (MPS) is used as an energy storage system (ESS) for islands with good geographical conditions, and deferrable appliance is treated as the virtual power source which can be used in the planning and operational processes. Household acceptance of demand response (DR) is indicated by the demand response participation degree (DRPD), and a sizing optimization model for considering the demand response of household appliances in an island microgrid is proposed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to obtain the optimal sizing of all major devices. In addition, the battery storage (BS) scheme is used as the control group. The results of case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, and the DR of deferrable appliances and the application of MPS can significantly reduce island microgrid investment. Sensitivity analysis on the total load of the island and the water head of the MPS are conducted.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Demand response</kwd><kwd>Micro

as solar, wind and tide energy, etc.), but still most of them are powered by diesel engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which has poor supply reliability and can cause noise and atmospheric pollutants. Microgrid is a flexible and efficient renewable energy utilization method and has advantages in guaranteeing the security of the power supply, improving the renewable energy utilization rate and the power quality. Therefore, renewable energy sources in the microgrid are considered as the best choice to solve small island energy supply problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Due to the randomness and intermittent nature of renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], as well as the load fluctuation, energy storage systems are required to be configured in an isolated microgrid. Most of the existing researches employ battery energy storage in the microgrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, battery storage has the disadvantages of short life, high cost, environmental friendliness and difficult maintenance. By contrast, because of their high reliability, friendly environment and low cost, pumped storage is the main energy storage form in a large power grid. In addition, the joint operation of a pumped storage power station and renewable energy station has been proved to be helpful in reducing the phenomenon of discard wind and solar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the application of a small or micro pumped storage system in an isolated microgrid is studied. A seawater desalination system powered by renewable energy and a pumped storage system are designed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the feasibility of the technology of a island wind/solar/pumped storage system is analyzed, and the results show that it is feasible to use a small seawater pumped storage system. Software for a hybrid system consisting of wind/solar/battery/pumped storage/seawater desalination is developed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Power sources capacity and reservoir capacity of a microgrid with a renewable energy and pumped storage system is optimized by using a genetic algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Many islands have abundant seawater pumped storage resources. According to the analysis of Hainan, et al. seawater pumped storage resources, these three coastal provinces have 81 sites that are suited for the construction of a seawater pumped storage system, 30 of which are islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is necessary to select an island energy storage form through technical and economic analysis. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the life cycle cost of a microgrid with different energy storage schemes (including battery storage, seawater pumped storage and hybrid energy storage systems) is analyzed under the condition of a given island microgrid with the necessary energy storage requirements. The results show that, in most cases, the cost of the pumped storage scheme is lower than that of the battery storage scheme, and the cost difference is related to factors such as the demand for energy storage and the rate of return on the investment of the assets.</p><p id="Par8">According to statistics in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], about 60% of the total residential load is controllable load. With the development of a smart home, most of the household appliances will become controllable demand response resources. Therefore making full use of the demand response has practical significance. The demand response is proved to have features of smoothing power fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], reducing operational costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], reducing pollutant emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and improving the utilization of renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there are few researches concentrated on microgrid configuration considering demand response. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], island microgrid sizing optimization considering demand response is studied, but the demand response resource is the fixed seawater desalination load without considering different demand response participation degrees. The demand response participation degree (DRPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is closely related to the interests of the demand response, but many of the current researches ignored the impact of the DRPD. For an island microgrid with the residential load as the main load, the demand response resources are primarily the deferrable load of the household appliances.</p><p id="Par9">In this paper, the configuration refers to the sizing of all major devices in an island microgrid including the number of wind turbines, number of solar arrays, pump unit capacity, turbine unit capacity and reservoir volume. And the optimal configuration model is established for the island microgrid with a solar–wind-pumped storage system considering demand response, which is solved by using a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Compared with the existing island microgrid configuration researches, the main contributions of this paper include: ① The scheme of pumped storage is adopted, and the quantity of the power source and the capacity of the energy storage system are optimized. ② The effect of demand response on capacity configuration is considered. ③ The microgrid capacity configuration of the battery storage scheme and pumped storage scheme is compared. ④ The effects of demand response participation degree, the household number, the demand response compensation cost and the water head of the pumped storage system on the microgrid configuration are analyzed.</p><p id="Par10">The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Section <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">3</xref> presents the optimal configuration model considering demand response.

Power sources consist of a photovoltaic array and wind turbine. The pumped storage system is used to store surplus power during the day time and generate power during the night time. The island load is composed of the non-deferrable load and the deferrable load. The frequency limitation problem of an island microgrid is attracting the attention of researchers. As the double-penstock system helps to regulate voltage and maintain a stable frequency with suitable control strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and as there is no suitable generator unit for a micro reversible pumped storage system, this paper adopts the double-penstock seawater pumped storage system rather than the single-penstock pumped storage system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure of island microgrid</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40565_2017_349_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Wind turbine</title><p id="Par12">The output power of the wind turbine is related to the wind speed, and it can be calculated by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext>WT</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="" open="{" separators=""><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ci</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mtext>WT</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=""><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ci</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ci</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>ci</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mtext>WT</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">co</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">co</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The operational optimization of the microgrid is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP).
