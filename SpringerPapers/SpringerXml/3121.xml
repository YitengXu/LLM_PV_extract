We analyzed the role of renewable energies (REs) in the future Japanese power sector using the results from the model intercomparison project Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) 35 Japan Model Intercomparison Project (JMIP) using varying emission reduction targets and key technological conditions across scenarios. We considered the uncertainties for future capital costs of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, and batteries in addition to the availability of nuclear and carbon dioxide capture and storage. The results show that REs supply more than 40% of electricity in most of the technology sensitivity scenarios (median 51.0%) when assuming an 80% emission reduction in 2050. The results (excluding scenarios that assume the continuous growth of nuclear power and/or the abundant availability of domestic biomass and carbon-free hydrogen) show that the median VRE shares reach 52.2% in 2050 in the 80% emission reduction scenario. On the contrary, the availability of newly constructed nuclear power, affordable biomass, and carbon-free hydrogen can reduce dependence on VREs to less than 20%. The policy costs were much more sensitive to the capital costs and resource potential of VREs than the battery cost uncertainties. Specifically, while the doubled capital costs of VRE resulted in a 13.0% (inter-model median) increase in the policy cost, the halved capital costs of VREs reduced 8.7% (inter-model median) of the total policy cost. These results imply that lowering the capital costs of VREs would be effective in achieving a long-term emission reduction target considering the current high Japanese VRE costs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Variable renewable energy</kwd><kwd>Resource potential</kwd><kwd>Capital cost</kwd><kwd>Battery storage</kwd><kwd>Renewable

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The large-scale development of renewables is essential to achieve the long-term climate goal stated in the Paris Agreement, the 2-degree and 1.5-degree targets. Luderer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>) analyzed the role of renewable energy in climate change mitigation using the results from a model intercomparison project (MIP) called the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) 27 and showed that the contribution of renewable energies (REs) to the energy supply strongly increases with climate policy stringency. Another MIP, called the ADVANCE (Advanced Model Development and Validation for Improved Analysis of Costs and Impacts of Mitigation Policies) project, focusing on the role of variable renewable energies (VREs) for power sector decarbonization, showed that carbon pricing has a substantial impact on VRE deployment (Luderer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). In the special report on 1.5Â Â°C, the global REs share in electricity in 2050 will reach more than 60% based on the analyses of four illustrative 1.5Â Â°C consistent pathways (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>). This may be true on a global scale, but what about on a national scale? Although Luderer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>) partially assessed national-scale data, since the participating models in these existing MIPs are global models and developed by researchers from all over the world, the unique characteristics of each country (e.g., capital costs, potentials, local policies, etc.) may not have been appropriately reflected. Indeed, the existing regional- and/or national-scale MIPs, such as EMF24 (Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>) and EMF32 (Murray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>) for the US, EMF28 (Knopf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>) for Europe, and a pilot study of EMF35 (Sugiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>) for Japan, provide implications for regional and/or national climate and energy strategies.</p><p id="Par3">The Japanese power system has unique characteristics in the area of VREs in terms of its relatively higher costs, lower potentials, and less flexibility with the grid connections than other major greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting countries. A global database of renewable energy from the International Renewable Energy Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>) shows that the global-levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs) from bioenergy, geothermal power, hydropower, and onshore and offshore wind have fallen to the fossil fuel cost range in 2010, and the costs from solar photovoltaics (PVs) reached the fossil fuel cost range in 2014. While the total installed cost of utility-scale solar PVs in Japan decreased by 74% from 2011 to 2018, their absolute installed cost of around 2000 USD2018/kW is still two times higher than in the other major GHG-emitting countries. Kimura and Zissler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>) compared the price and cost of solar PVs in Japan and Germany, and found that construction costs and module costs are the major factors generating the significant cost differences between the two countries. They point out that the difference in construction costs is based on the installation time in Japan, while the difference in the module costs is due to the import cost of foreign products and the price gap between domestic and foreign products. The capital cost for onshore wind in Japan shows a similar trend as solar PVs, i.e., about 1.5-to-3 times higher than the cost range globally. Mizuno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>) concluded that the high cost of wind in Japan is due to a lack of economies of scale, among other reasons. Kimura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>) analyzed the cost structure of onshore wind in Japan from actual data provided by 38 wind-power plants and revealed that construction work-related costs are increasing rapidly.</p><p id="Par4">As for the resource potentials, Luderer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>) compared those of solar PVs, concentrating solar power (CSP), and onshore wind for selected regions, and found that the potentials of solar PVs and offshore wind in Japan would comprise less than 20% and 70% of electricity demand in 2100 in the baseline scenario of the ADVANCE project, respectively. Since the resource potentials of these energy sources in all the analyzed regions, except for India and Japan, would comprise more than 100% of the electricity demand in 2100 in the baseline scenario of the ADVANCE project (with a high-capacity factor), the efficient use of resource potential is more necessary in Japan than in other countries.</p><p id="Par5">Another unique characteristic of Japanese power system is the relatively low flexibility in the grid connections. Particularly, the Japanese power grid is a longitudinal structure with few detours and different frequencies in Eastern (50Â Hz) and Western (60Â Hz) Japan. These conditions reduce the flexibility of power systems supplied by the interregional power transmission. The International Energy Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>) analyzed the VRE penetration potentials of electricity demand and showed that Japan has the lowest VRE penetration potential (19%) among the selected eight power areas due to its low grid strength, low coordination of flexible resource use, and the VRE forecasted use at the time of the analysis. Mizuno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>) pointed out that the development of wind has not increased to date due to this limited grid capacity, the current electricity market structure, and grid operating practices by the existing electricity power companies.</p><p id="Par6">We have developed the following three research questions and sought to answer them to provide policy implications for decarbonizing the Japanese power system based on its unique characteristics in VRE development. First, how much RE or VRE will be introduced in the future Japanese power sector under Japan's mid-century strategy? Second, how much does the uncertainty of the RE and VRE variables (i.e., the cost and resource potential) affect future RE and VRE shares and the policy cost of emission reduction? Third, how much does the varying emission reduction target affect the share of RE and VRE in the power supply?</p><p id="Par7">There are several existing studies that approach these research questions using power dispatch models. The research group of the University of Tokyo developed a high time-resolution optimal power generation mix model and revealed that integrating high VRE penetrations brings about a decrease in the capacity factor of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) combined cycle (Komiyama and Fujii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>), increases the importance of electricity conservations (Komiyama and Fujii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>), and makes necessary the capacity expansion of inter- or intra-regional power transmission lines (Komiyama and Fujii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). Matsuo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>) analyzed the possibility of the power system in Japan achieving zero emissions by 2050, and found that the required storage capacity is determined mainly by the duration of windless and sunless periods. Shiraki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>) estimated the future siting and scale of power plants under CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction targets using a dynamic multiregional optimal-generation planning model. Along with the above studies using power dispatch models, studies using energy system models and integrated assessment models (IAMs) also provided the impact of emission reduction targets on the power sector (Silva Herran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>; Kato and Kurosawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>; Fujimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). However, all of these studies implemented by a single model or a single-model framework. In addition, scenario protocols vary by study, and thus, it is difficult to provide an intercomparison of the results. A robust conclusion can be drawn by comparing the results of multiple model analyses under a unified scenario framework.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we analyzed the role of renewables in the future Japanese power sector using the scenario results from the model intercomparison project EMF35 JMIP by varying the key climate policy and technological conditions across the scenarios.

Thus, in this section, we briefly overview the current policy environment surrounding RE development in Japan. Reflecting the unique characteristics of Japanese REs, policies surrounding REs are described in terms of cost, resource potential, and grid flexibility. In addition, the current conditions of non-RE low-carbon generators, such as nuclear power, thermal power with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and hydrogen power, are summarized. A comparison of electricity system transitions, focusing on solar PVs, nuclear power, and wind power, between Germany and Japan is found in Cherp et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Readers can also refer to Yu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2016</xref>) for the development of Japanese solar PVs compared to those in China and Germany.

Like other countries, the FIT has accelerated the introduction of renewable energy in Japan. Over the 5 years since 2012, RE rates in electricity demand increased from 10 to 16%, with most of the increases coming from solar PVs (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). From the introduction of the FIT scheme until March 2020, more than 70% of cumulative purchased electricity comes from solar PV (275 TWh), followed by biomass (58 TWh, 14.8%), wind (44 TWh, 11.3%), small hydropower (14 TWh, 3.6%), and geothermal power (0.9 TWh, 0.2%) (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">The capital cost of solar PVs has been steadily decreasing from 465 JPY/W in 2012 to 364 JPY/W in 2017 due to technological development and the introduction of solar PVs in Japan. While the purchase price of FIT has fallen to less than half from 40 JPY/kWh in 2012 to 18 JPY/kWh in 2018 due to capital cost reductions, the FIT levy reached 2.2 trillion JPY/year (=â2.6 JPY/kWh) in 2017 (the currencies are as reported from the original reference and have not been converted to a value for a specific year, since there is almost no inflation in Japan).</p><p id="Par12">To control the ever-increasing FIT levy, an auction system was started to decide purchase prices for large-scale solar PVs (from 2017) and biomass power generation (from 2018) (International Energy Agency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>). While 39.8Â MW of solar PVs has been contracted at 10.99â13.00 JPY/kWh of the purchase price in the fifth auction round in 2020, biomass power generation has never been successfully bid until its second auction round. In 2020, the decision process for the purchase price of bottom-mounted-type offshore wind power will transition toward an auction scheme.</p><p id="Par13">In 2019, the Japanese government set a price target for commercial-scale solar PVs of 7 JPY/kWh by 2025, which is 5 years ahead of its previous target (Calculation Committee for Procurement Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>). In addition, the price committee also mentioned the need to accelerate the cost reduction effort to achieve a price target for wind of 8â9 JPY/kWh by 2030. There is also an increasing interest in offshore sources due to a new law that allows for the long-time use of an ocean area for offshore wind-power generation. The purchase price of the FIT for offshore wind was set to 36 JPY/kWh in 2019 compared to the several cents per kWh achieved in other jurisdictions, although the transition to an auction scheme is expected to drastically reduce the cost.

The objective of the act was to promote the utilization of specific maritime areas related to the development of power generation facilities while making efforts to harmonize with other measures related to the ocean. While all the offshore wind generators, which had been built by the end of 2018, were originally in demonstration projects, two of them have begun commercial operation, and there are 13 additional offshore wind projects (for a total output of about 4.4 GW) that are in the environmental impact assessment process (Ministry of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). The act designates four promising maritime areas as targets of the promotion projects and 11 candidates as promising maritime areas. However, most of them are in the Tohoku area, like resource potential for onshore winds, and, thus, inter-regional transmission is necessary to maximize the utilization of resource potential.

Furthermore, since RE resources are unevenly distributed, strengthening transmission lines is essential for utilizing RE potential. The transmission capacity between Hokkaido and Honshu increased 1.5-fold in 2019, and there is a plan to enforce the frequency converters connecting Eastern and Western Japan to 3 GW. Along with these infrastructure investments, the existing transmission facilities are planned for full utilization via changes in the policies and operations of Japanese power transmission system. This is a Japanese version of the âconnect and manageâ principle, and is composed of the rationalization of the anticipated current, the application of the N-1 power control (instantaneous power limit at the time of failure on a single transmission line or a transformer, a so-called N-1 contingency), and the non-firm connection (power source connection on the condition of limiting the output at normal times) (Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">As for flexible resources, energy resource aggregation businesses have been providing adjustment services to transmission and distribution system operators (TDSO) using demand responses (DR), battery storages, and private generators after 2016.

Thus, comparing cost parameters among and within the model helps in understanding the results of each model. The simplest approach is to compare the technoeconomic parameters (i.e., capital cost, operation and maintenance cost, conversion efficiency, etc.) separately. Another approach is to use the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The former promotes understanding of the variation in each input parameter in the models, but makes it difficult to compare unit generation costs within the model. The latter is helpful in identifying the order and range of unit generation costs and thus provides insight into the preferable (i.e., less-expensive) generator for each model. Moreover, a comparison of the LCOE among the models reveals the variation in the future expectations for the LCOE among the modeling teams. In this study, we adopt an LCOE approach to understand the precondition of the cost parameters in the participating models (for the simple comparisons of the capital costs for the selected generators and fuel prices among the participating models, see Supplementary Figs.

The simplest representation is to include the upper/lower limits of the penetration rate and growth rate of the VREs. Since AIM/Hub-Japan is myopic and a computational general equilibrium model, a maximum/minimum growth rate can help to avoid an unrealistic energy transition in the power sector. While DNE21 explicitly models some specific integration options, such as storage and curtailment, it includes a maximum share of VREs to be 15% of the total electricity supply to consider the difficulty of the VRE integration, which is not explicitly considered in the model.</p><p id="Par36">The second level of modeling the VRE integration is implicit representation as an additional cost. In general, increasing VRE requires battery storage and curtailment and thus increases the generation costs. In this modeling, the integration costs for the flexibility options are modeled as a function of the VRE share, which is calculated by other specific models. With this modeling of VRE integration, the model can consider integration cost even without the explicit modeling of the specific technology options for VRE integration. Among the participating models, AIM/Hub-Japan and IEEJ_Japan 2017 have such functions (for AIM/Hub-Japan, see Dai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; for IEEJ_Japan 2017, see Matsuo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). For more information on system integration cost, see Matsuo and Komiyama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">The third level of modeling the VRE integration is the explicit modeling of specific integration options. This modeling can include not only economic conditions but also technological conditions, such as conversion efficiency and capacity requirement. AIM/Enduse-Japan, DNE21, and TIMES-Japan explicitly model multiple integration options. Although most of the models considered storage and curtailment, demand responses and the constraint of spinning reserve are rarely modeled. While AIM/Enduse-Japan includes the expansion of inter-regional transmissions lines under the cost minimization process, other models consider it when the resource potentials of VREs are estimated.</p><p id="Par38">Another element of the VRE integration modeling is time and spatial resolution. AIM/Hub-Japan, the only general equilibrium model, considers the demandâsupply balance of electricity yearly. The other partial equilibrium models assume multiple and chronological load curves for both electricity demand and VRE outputs. While IEEJ_Japan 2017 itself has a time-resolution of six slices, it is soft-linked to a power dispatch model with an hourly resolution. Among the single-model frameworks (AIM/Enduse-Japan, DNE21, and TIMES-Japan), AIM/Enduse-Japan has the most detailed time-resolution of 96 slices (1-h steps for 4 representative daysâ=âthree seasonsâ+âpeak day). Detailed special resolutions are found in AIM/Enduse-Japan and a power dispatch model used in the IEEJ_Japan 2017 framework, which was set based on the Japanese TDSO areas.

In AIM/Enduse-Japan and AIM/Hub-Japan, wind-power turbines account for more than 25% and 40% of the power supply in 2050, respectively, due to their low LCOE. DNE21, the only model that does not have the upper limit of electricity supply from nuclear, estimates that nuclear can account for more than 45% of the power supply. In addition, the biomass in DNE21 occupies more than 20% of the power supply due to its assumption of the affordable and abundant biomass potentials. In IEEJ_Japan 2017, the share of hydrogen reaches more than 20% despite its high LCOE. The absence of biomass CCS and the upper limit of nuclear in IEEJ_Japan 2017 may result in hydrogen being used as a backstop technology.

AIM/Hub-Japan uses a logit function to determine the share of energy sources, and, thus, the share of generation technologies (and emission factor) does not change drastically without carbon prices. In addition, the high level of electrification in the final energy consumption increases the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the power sector. While the other models presuppose no climate policy in the baseline scenario, IEEJ_Japan 2017 sets a baseline scenario as an extension of the current condition, such as the development of REs and technological progress. This may have resulted in the reduction of the emission factor in IEEJ_Japan 2017âeven in the Baseline_Def scenario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sensitivity of the RE shares to technological parameters</title><p id="Par45">We intercompared four preconditions of the IAMs that would affect the results of the future RE share in the power sector in the <italic>model intercomparison of the parameter settings and modeling</italic> section. The technology sensitivity scenarios in EMF35 JMIP provide insights related to four conditions within and among the models: VRE cost sensitivity (LoVREcost and HiVREcost), VRE potential sensitivity (LoVREpot and HiVREpot), the difficulty of VRE integration (HighInt, LoInt, and LoStorageCost), and the availability of non-VRE low-carbon generators (NoCCS, LimNuc, and NoNuc) (the scenario prefix â26by30â+â80by50_â has been dropped in this paragraph for brevity in reporting).</p><p id="Par46">FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a shows the RE and VRE shares in the technology sensitivity scenarios. The REs supply more than 40% of the electricity in most of the models and scenarios when assuming an 80% reduction in 2050 (median 51.0%). On the contrary, the fluctuation in the VRE rate by the models is larger than those found in the technology sensitivity scenarios. The results, excluding scenarios that assume special conditions like continuous nuclear power growth and/or the affordable and abundant availability of domestic biomass and carbon-free hydrogen, showed that the median VRE share reaches 52.2% in 2050 in the 80% emission reduction scenario. On the contrary, the availability of the newly constructed nuclear power, affordable biomass, and carbon-free hydrogen can reduce dependence on VREs to less than 20%.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>RE and VRE shares in 2050 in the technology sensitivity scenarios</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11625_2021_917_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par47">Increasing the share of low-carbon generators, such as REs, nuclear power, thermal power with CCS, and carbon-free hydrogen, helps to reduce the share of conventional thermal power plants. The capacity factor of thermal power plants without CCS decrease rapidly after 2030 in all the technology sensitivity scenarios (Supplementary Fig. S4). In 2050, coal power plants without CCS are not used in almost any scenarios. The capacity factor of gas power plants without CCS in 2050 decreases to less than 15% in almost all the scenarios. These results imply that it is robust that the capacity factor of the thermal power plant without CCS sharply decreases under the 80% emission reduction scenario.</p><p id="Par48">FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b shows the difference in the RE and VRE shares in the technology sensitivity scenarios relative to the 26by30â+â80by50_Def scenario. The generation mix in 2050 in the technology sensitivity scenarios is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Compared to the absolute values of the RE and VRE shares, the differences in the RE and VRE rates have a certain level of consistency among the models. Among the parameters used in the technology sensitivity scenarios, halving/doubling the capital costs of the VREs has the highest impact on the VRE share (+â10.5/-13.5 percentage points, from the median, compared to the default technology scenario).</p><p id="Par49">TIMES-Japan has a strong sensitivity to VRE potential changes, since all the VRE potentials in TIMES-Japan are usedâeven in the 26by30â+â80by50_Def scenario. This resource exhaustion may also cause less sensitivity of the VRE cost reduction in TIMES-Japan.</p><p id="Par50">Except for AIM/Hub-Japan, while the unavailability of CCS increases zero-emission generators that can be used in the middle load, such as solar PVs and hydrogen, the unavailability of nuclear limits increases the zero-emission generators, which behave as a base load generator, such as coal with CCS, biomass, and wind. This result indicates that these four partial equilibrium models can capture the effect of the merit order due to their modeling of the chronological load curve. While AIM/Hub-Japan increases the wind share by 25 percentage points to offset the generators with CCS technologies, the impact of nuclear availability is small. The former may be caused by the low LCOE of wind in AIM/Hub-Japan along with their relatively simple representation of time-resolution. The latter is due to the low dependence of nuclear in the 26by30â+â80by50_Def scenario in AIM/Hub-Japan.</p><p id="Par51">Changing the difficulty of VRE integration has a lesser impact than the other parameters in most of the models. In IEEJ_Japan 2017, high battery cost and no curtailment assumptions result in a 10 percentage point reduction in VRE share. In the scenarios with low battery costs, AIM/Enduse-Japan and IEEJ_Japn 2017 increase the VRE share with 278 GWh and 130 GWh of batteries, respectively. Interestingly, in DNE21, the battery cost reduction increases the nuclear and gas without CCS shares and, as a result, reduces the RE share. This is because the additional battery storage enables a flattening of the daily load curve like pumped hydro storage does at present and thus increases the room for baseload and mid-load generators like nuclear and gas generations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sensitivity of policy costs to technological parameters related to REs</title><p id="Par52">FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows the relative discounted total policy cost in the technology sensitivity scenarios.

A doubling/halving of the resources decreases/increases the additional total energy system cost by 10.2/6.3%, respectively. (Values in this paragraph are the inter-model median of four energy system models measuring policy cost as the additional energy system cost.) Note that the non-intuitive results for IEEJ_Japan 2017 (i.e., the lower policy costs in high VRE costs and low RE potential scenarios) are due to non-power sector interactions (for more details, see Supplementary Information).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sensitivity of the RE shares to mitigation targets</title><p id="Par54">The EMF35 JMIP study set six policy sensitivity scenarios that weaken or strengthen 2030 and 2050 emission targets.

First, there is a wide variation in the representation of the VRE integration among the models. The participating models in this study include a model that has a high time-resolution and spatial resolution in the energy model itself, a model that has a soft link with the supplementary model for the power sector, and a model that has a simple time and spatial resolution. In addition, the flexible resources explicitly modeled vary by models, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. To estimate the impact of VRE development quantitatively using a model intercomparison study, detailed temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and an explicit representation of flexible options are desirable.</p><p id="Par62">Second, the technology options are not consistent across the models. For example, DNE21 assumes that nuclear power can be expanded, while other models set upper limits on the nuclear power supply due to public perception. IEEJ_Japan 2017, which has a technology option of imported hydrogen derived either from fossil fuels with CCS or REs, tends to have a lower VRE share than the models that do not assume imported hydrogen. Some models do not explicitly distinguish offshore and onshore wind generation. The most important problem is that these technologies, which are treated differently among the models, are key technologies in the mitigation scenarios in the models that assume these technologies. To analyze the future uncertainty of each technology by comparing the models, it is essential to analyze technology scenarios, each of which provides a unifying assumption for major technological options.</p><p id="Par63">Third, the preconditions of the baseline scenario with the default technology are not unified among the models. For example, AIM/Enduse-Japan and AIM/Hub-Japan assume no climate policy for the baseline scenario, but IEEJ_Japan 2017 presupposes a baseline scenario as an extension of the current policy conditions, such as the development of REs and technological progress. Since policy costs are calculated as the difference from the baseline scenario, the different preconditions of the baseline scenario among the models have impacts on the results. In addition, some parameter settings not stated in the scenario protocol are also inconsistent among the models. For example, while some models assume to halve the capital costs of VREs from the beginning of the calculation periods, others assume to halve them after 2030. Although we suggest that this inconsistency in assumptions does not affect our main qualitative conclusions related to the impact of the capital costs of VREs, it may potentially underestimate the qualitative magnitude of the impact of the capital costs of VREs. It is necessary to set comparable baseline scenarios while ensuring the diversity of future visions envisioned by each model team.</p><p id="Par64">Future steps to address the above three limitations include the following: first, the implementation of a model intercomparison between energy system models and power dispatch models; second, the harmonization of key technology options among the participating models; and, third, the harmonization of the policy conditions of a baseline scenario among the participating models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Policy implications</title><p id="Par65">There are two major policy implications in achieving Japan's mid-century strategy to be garnered from the results of this study. First, it would benefit to bring the capital costs of VREs closer to international levels. Lowering of power generation cost for any kinds of generator result in reduction of total energy system costs, but the room of cost reduction varies by generators and that for VREs is greater than for other generators. As mentioned in the <italic>policy environmen</italic>t section, since the current capital cost of Japanese solar PVs is twice that of other countries, the scenario of halving the capital cost of VREs is equivalent to reducing the VRE cost in Japan to the international level. In other words, the result of the scenario of halving the VRE cost shows that reducing the renewable energy price in Japan to an international level can reduce 8.7% (inter-model median) of the additional total energy system cost. As for the commercial scale of solar PV, the procurement of overseas modules, a reduction in domestic module prices, and the application of installation technology from other countries can reduce the cost difference (Kimura and Zissler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). In addition, cost analysis using actual data showed that the top 0.1% of companies could offer solar PV systems at less than 60% of the national average cost (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). Thus, there is an opportunity to converge the cost to the international price by encouraging price competition through the auction system, for example.</p><p id="Par66">Second, it would be important to promote non-RE low-carbon generators to complement REs. The results of the policy sensitivity analysis showed that it is necessary to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the power sector to almost zero or negative to achieve or intensify the mid-century target. The results also showed that non-RE low-carbon generators compensate for remaining electricity demand not supplied by REâalthough there is no consensus regarding promising technology among fossil power plants with CCS, hydrogen, and nuclear power. This result is consistent with findings from studies using a single power dispatch model and a single energy system model (Matsuo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>; Kato and Kurosawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). The common view among the models is that there will be almost no room for the operation of fossil power plants without CCS in 2050. It would be better to identify and promote promising non-RE low-carbon generators.</p><p id="Par67">Indeed, some of these policy implications have been discussed in the existing studies, which employed single energy system models. A major point of our study is that our policy implications are derived from the results of a multi model comparison study and thus have robustness. Future steps of multi model comparison study described in the previous section would expand and provide more robust findings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was performed by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF20172004) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan.
