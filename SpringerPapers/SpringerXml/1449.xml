Kingdom</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> A pharmacist-led cardiovascular risk clinic is established in two general practices. The pharmacist has implemented supplementary prescribing into routine practice. This study evaluated the opinions and expectations of doctors and patients one year after pharmacist prescribing was established. Clinical outcomes associated with the clinic are reported elsewhere [1, 2].</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A questionnaire was designed following semi-structured one to one audio taped interviews with three randomly selected patients. The questionnaire was piloted and posted to 201 patients. One to one structured interviews were audio taped with four doctors.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Two general medical practices.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Frequency and nature of questionnaire/interview responses.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The questionnaire response rate was 74% (148/201) with an equal proportion of responders from both practices with no gender differences. Hypertension management by the pharmacist was preferred by 91 (61%) patients, 6 (4%) preferred management by their doctor. The service was rated excellent or good by 133 (90%) patients, 132 patients (89%) fully understood the information provided about their medication. One hundred and fifteen patients (88%) were satisfied with the service they received from community pharmacy for minor ailments; however, only 32 patients (22%) agreed that they would be happy to have their hypertension managed in the community pharmacy. When suggested that a similar model to the practice clinic, might be available in community pharmacy, the proportion increased to 42%.</p><p>Doctors recognised the benefits of the clinic to both patients and themselves. Independent pharmacist prescribing was considered to be a natural development of this service and would enable prescribing for other conditions. Although the benefits in terms of continuity of care were acknowledged, doctors have concerns regarding competence and communication necessary to deliver a similar service from the community pharmacy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Patients and doctors are satisfied with the pharmacist’s supplementary prescribing clinic. They acknowledge that pharmacists have the skills and competence to provide these services which result in better patient care. Although the patients and GPs in this study were satisfied with the current service, they indicated less enthusiasm for new services with which they may lack confidence, an issue which must be addressed to support future development of supplementary prescribing.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Reid F; Murray P; Storrie M Implementation of a pharmacist-led clinic for hypertensive patients in primary care- a pilot study.

This paper reports findings on the use of PDRM indicators for dispensing.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Nineteen pharmacists from 16 purposively selected community pharmacies were asked to apply four dispensing indicators (06/2005–02/2006) in current practice. Two indicators involved the provision of unsolicited safety information to patients on tiamazol and beta-blocker eye drops; the others referred to oral NSAIDs, each was split into “with” and “without” prescription. Face-to-face qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 pharmacists (10–11/2005) on their reported experiences; a focus group discussion was held with seven pharmacists (03/2006) to follow-up their feedback. Quantitative data were analysed for descriptive statistics (SPSS v. 11.5); analysis of verbatim transcripts was performed using a framework approach (1) with the aid of NVIVO v. 2.0.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Community pharmacy.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Number of cases, themes emerging from the analysis of textual data.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A total of 666 cases were collected. A three-stage conceptual model was developed to explain the acceptability of the indicators. Two attitudinal factors were identified as necessary: commitment to provide patient-oriented services and pharmacist’s confidence. Assessing the benefit for the patient (second stage) lead to a decision on whether to provide information or not. This was influenced by patient-related factors (e.g. patient traits), information-related factors (e.g. perceived relevance) and drug-related factors (e.g. therapeutic class). If the pharmacist decided to counsel the patient the provision of information was affected by factors such as patient and/or pharmacist’s lack of time. The latter was cited as the most common reason for not providing applicable counselling (<italic>n</italic> = 28), but qualitative data indicates it was a barrier mainly in high workload periods and secondary in importance to the perceived benefit of information.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> It appears to be feasible to use validated dispensing PDRM indicators in Portuguese community pharmacy. The model developed offers an in-depth understanding on the acceptability of the indicators, which may be of relevance in the development of training initiatives.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Pope C, Ziebland S, Mays N.

The objective of this study is to evaluate acceptance and self-administration modification rate of SureClick<sup>®</sup> in predialysis chronic kidney disease outpatients treated previously with DA in prefilled syringe.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> During 3 months (September to November 2006) predialysis outpatients treated with DA in prefilled syringe by subcutaneous route were switched to pen prefilled (SureClick<sup>®</sup>) and extended dosing (pat receiving Q2W administration were converted to QM and those patients to QW were converted to Q2W). Patients were included in a pharmaceutical care program to give them information and training in the pharmacy about pen use and precautions. Next visit to the pharmacy, 30 days latter, a survey was performed to know acceptance rate and problems related to this new administration form (local side effects specifically pain at injection site related to prior prefilled syringe use and difficulties to pen use).

Eight patients (5%) were indifferent to SureClick<sup>®</sup> switch and 12 patients (7.5%) not accepted the new form and returned to prefilled syringe treatment. From 160 patients 29 (18.1%), 98 (61.3%) and 33 (20.6%) reported more, equal and less pain at injection site, respectively, and 19 (11.9%) reported some difficulties to pen use. SureClick<sup>®</sup> not acceptance reasons were more pain (3) haematoma (3) and difficulties to pen use (6). After switching to SureClick<sup>®</sup> 82 patients self-administered DA (self-administration rate = 51.5%), compared to 73 patients at baseline (self-administration rate = 45.6%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> SureClick<sup>®</sup> has higher preference in patients with chronic kidney disease.

There were 23 different PCIs in the total 179 categorised as: additional medication needs (27%), unnecessary medication use (13%), ineffective drug prescribed (1%), dose to low (11%), adverse drug reaction (27%), dose to high (4%), inappropriate patient compliance (16%). The checks or enquires identified as suitable for community pharmacist action were mainly medication needs (41%) and safety (32%). These were incorporated into the design of the document which was piloted in 33 patients and identified 144 PCIs for transfer. Following telephone reminders, 22 (67%) of questionnaires were returned. Information contained in the document was found to be useful in improving the pharmaceutical care provided in 91% of responses and 100% felt the document was user-friendly and facilitated communication between pharmacists in different care settings. Four respondents actioned all recommendations, 8 actioned none and 9 actioned 20–80% recommendations. Reasons given for lack of action included educational needs and confirmed action by others e.g. nurses.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> A pharmacy transfer document for palliative care patients has been designed and evaluated. The national palliative care pharmacists group have agreed to implement the document into practice with the aim of facilitating provision of consistent pharmaceutical care irrespective of care setting. Educational needs can be met through a currently available national distance-learning package.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Pharmaceutical care, Palliative care, Continuity of care</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>PC-81 Quality of life of male to female transgender who use and do not use female sex hormones</title><sec id="Sec14"><title><bold>Surarong Chinwong</bold><sup>1</sup>, Dujrudee Chinwong<sup>1</sup>, Sasiraporn Sutanyawatchai<sup>1</sup>, Somchai Suja<sup>1</sup>, Supawinee Siri<sup>1</sup>, Pariya Tantipatthananandh<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec15"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Pharmaceutical Care, Faculty of Pharmacy Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> To study and compare quality of life (QOL) between male and female transgender who use and do not use female sex hormones living in Chiang Mai province, Thailand.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A descriptive study was conducted.

Sixty-three and 76% of the users and non-users were students, respectively. Only occupation was significantly different between the groups. In the group of female sex hormone users, the decrease in sexual desire and weight gain were the most common adverse effects (66% and 51%, respectively). The majority in the group reported that using female sex hormones increased expenditure but without financial problems. In the group of non-users female sex hormones, 55%, 55% and 49% reported that the use of female sex hormones was without benefit, led to concerns about adverse effects and was not approved by their family. The QOL assessed by SF-36 questionnaire demonstrated that the average QOL finding in 6 domains were significantly higher in the group of non-users than users of female sex hormones i.e., physical functioning, role physical, general health, vitality, social functioning and role emotion.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The study could be considered as the preliminary and might be useful for further inquiry into transgender who consider whether or not to use female sex hormone.

Four week vocational placements were designed for undergraduate students (stage 0) to prepare them for the pre-registration year. A knowledge and skills framework was developed for achievement during these 4 weeks and to prepare graduates in a staged manner for demonstrating achievement of the performance standards of the RPSGB, a requisite for professional registration. In 1995, the Scottish Hospital Pharmacists Vocational Training Scheme (SHPVTS-stage 2) was developed and implemented. This was reviewed in 2005 to meet the training needs of today’s hospital pharmacist. The scheme covers clinical, technical, medicines information and quality assurance areas of practice. The knowledge and skills framework of this scheme attempts to develop the knowledge and skills required at registration and prepares pharmacists for specialisation, for example to study for Diploma/MSc in Clinical Pharmacy (stage 3). The reviewed SHPVTC manual contains the knowledge and skills framework for stages 0, 1 and 2 which allows trainees to clearly assess their position on the escalator. The portfolio of evidence is assessed by nationally approved local tutors and reviewed through a national peer review process. Qualification at the stage 2 level is accredited by CPP and provides eligibility for membership of CPP. Stage 3 is currently under development in terms of specialised modules within postgraduate university degree courses. The fourth stage of learning and development is completion of a leadership portfolio which is also accredited with CPP and provides eligibility for fellowship with CPP.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The implementation of nationally agreed standards for education and training provides an infra-structure to support the development of a suitable trained workforce responsive to a continually changing Health Service.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Education, Scotland</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>DI-314 New tools to register pharmacist interventions: implementation and analysis of the new system</title><sec id="Sec20"><title><bold>Elisabete Ardanza</bold><sup>1</sup>, Montserrat M.

Current national nutrition guidelines for the age group were reviewed and a 1 l TPN regimen formulated. Chemical stability information was obtained for the formulation, with and without the addition of a range of electrolytes, vitamins and trace elements. The formulation was manufactured at comparable costs to in-house formulation and stability data supported a 90 day shelf life. In the first 6 months of using the standard TPN bag 96% of prescriptions for patients (<italic>n</italic> = 334 prescriptions) under 2 years old were for a standard bag. The new standard bag supplied 84% (<italic>n</italic> = 292) and the Scottish Neonatal Standard bag 12% (<italic>n</italic> = 42) of the TPN prescriptions. The remaining 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 15 prescriptions), mostly fluid-restricted ICU patients, received tailor-made bags in line with previous practice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The new formulation meets the nutritional requirements for most patients. Additional advantages include minimization of dispensing errors, less aseptic manipulation and timeous availability of a product with which staff are familiar. This new standard formulation is now current practice.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Koletzko B, Goulet O, et al.

Prior to establishing the pharmacist-led cardiovascular clinic, a local audit of prescribing found three areas of low adherence to national prescribing guidelines [2]. The clinic pharmacist has addressed these, leading to 14 (10.4%) patients being started on an ACE inhibitor as well as 15 (12.4%) and 16 (13.2%) primary prevention patients (<italic>n</italic> = 121) being newly started on aspirin and statin therapy (respectively).</p><p>Of 490 documented pharmaceutical care issues, 153 (31%) were lowering blood pressures to target by increasing doses of antihypertensives, 149 (30%) were adding new drugs and 59 (12%) were adverse drug reactions. The pharmacist undertook 1034 monitoring checks and 941 recommended changes to patients medication. Most patient monitoring checks were effectiveness enquiries (731, 70.7%) and most drug therapy changes were drug selection issues (198, 21%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The pharmacist addresses areas that a previous audit identified as having low adherence to national prescribing guidelines. Other pharmaceutical care issues addressed by the pharmacist were optimization of antihypertensive dosage, prescription of additional therapy and avoidance of adverse drug reactions. The prescribing criteria most frequently addressed by the pharmacist will be incorporated into a pharmaceutical care plan to ensure consistent delivery of care among clinic pharmacists and other members of the health care team.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cockburn AJ, McKnight JA, Kinnear M, Lannigan NA and Strachan MWJ.

The IPCP helps to address the current gap in continuity of pharmaceutical care between sectors. The successful findings are preliminary, based on selective application, and so require wider testing.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Scottish Office Department of Health.

Two-thirds, 22/33 (67%) believed they waited more than 1 h for their outpatient prescription. Patients perceived longer waiting times than pharmacy statistics suggest (approximately 50 min). Eighteen (58%) patients/parents reported a feeling of frustration or anger at the length of wait. Parents/patients were generally satisfied with the information, communication and general pharmacy service as a whole. Approximately half the respondents reported detailed explanations of drug side effects, indications and appropriate use. In 97% of cases, communication was provided by the pharmacist in the patients preferred way. Parent/patient satisfaction with the pharmacy service was similar to that reported for the hospital service in general.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The perception of waiting for medicine was a source of dissatisfaction. Education and awareness of the complexity of the processes involved in chemotherapy dispensing (series of systematic checks for safety and accuracy) may reduce this dissatisfaction. The design of a patient journey poster will help in this respect, and more parents will be encouraged to collect medicines at more convenient times. The introduction of an appointment system for the outpatient clinic may reduce the overall time spent in hospital, although at present this remains as a recommendation. The standard of counselling, supply and information provided by the pharmacist to patients/parents was satisfactory and should be maintained.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cancer in Scotland: Sustaining Change.

The director and at least one head nurse of each NH were interviewed using structured questionnaires. The questionnaire for the director focussed on general characteristics of the NH, general care management, medication management systems and pharmaceutical care activities of supplying pharmacists. The questionnaire for the head nurses concentrated on the medication distribution process (registration, storage, distribution and intake control of medication).</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> 76 randomly selected NHs in 3 Belgian provinces.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Non applicable.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A self-reporting medication error system had been set up in 69.7% of the NHs. The medication process was regularly evaluated in 21.1% of the NHs only, while 39.5% had never performed such an evaluation. 31.6% of the NHs used an electronic prescribing system. The drug regimen of the residents was systematically evaluated in consultation with the GP in 66.1% of NHs. For mentally intact elderly, intake was visually controlled afterwards in 71.7% of NHs and during swallowing in 19.2% of the NHs. Pharmacists not only dispensed medications, but were also involved in evaluation (26.3% of NHs) and consulting tasks (42.1% of NHs). 69.6% of the nurses did not wait for a prescription before ordering chronic medication to the pharmacy. Before crushing medication, information was consulted only in 21.4% of the wards.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Despite quality of care regulations, the organisation of the medication process still offers potential for improvement. Pharmacists can have an important role in this amelioration, since they are specialised in medication usage and already more or less involved in the process.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Nursing homes, Medication usage, Quality of care</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>PEPI-86 Frequency and potential risk factors for Hospital Admissions Related to Medication (HARM) in The Netherlands</title><sec id="Sec51"><title><bold>Anne J.

For each case, one control patient was included in the study, matched on gender, age and hospital of admission.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Causality and preventability was assessed centrally according to Kramer et al. [1] and preventability according to Shumock et al. [2]. Medication errors were also classified [3]. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, using a Cox regression model with stratification on matching variables.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Almost 13,000 acute admissions were screened of which 714 (5.6%) were drug related. Almost half (46%; <italic>n</italic> = 332) of these admissions were assessed as potentially preventable. Extrapolated to the Dutch situation this implies 16,000 potentially preventable admissions every year with associated costs of 76 million euro per year.</p><p>Most drug related hospitalisations were haemorrhages associated with drugs affecting the blood coagulation like anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, NSAIDs or a combination of drugs.</p><p>The main potential risk factors for preventable drug related hospital admissions were polypharmacy, the number of comorbidities, non-compliance, impaired renal function, impaired cognition and non-independent living situation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Adverse drug events are an important cause of hospital admissions of which almost half may be preventable. Measures are urgently needed to decrease the number of drug related hospital admissions and reduce the burden of these admissions. Patients with potential risk factors identified in this study are an important target for (pharmacy based) intervention programmes.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Kramer MS, Leventhal JM, et al.

It is a substrate of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The purpose of this work is to investigate the possible clinical interaction between corticosteroids and tacrolimus in liver transplant patients.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> We reviewed 26 liver transplant patients treated with FK. All patients during surgery received induction therapy with standard dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg IV plus basiliximab 20 mg IV or daclizumab 2 mg/kg IV or MMF 1 g IV according to the different protocols. We also recorded all possible administered drugs known to interact with CYP3A and/or P-gp. Patients were divided into two groups: the first (12 patients) was treated with 20 mg of oral prednisone tapered to 5 mg daily after 1 month and then suspended if no sign of rejection occurred. The second (14 patients) was steroid-free. One and three-month serum creatinine levels (SCr), FK dosages and FK trough blood concentrations (Co) were recorded. Tacrolimus level/dose [L/D] was obtained by dividing the FK trough level (ng/ml) by the corresponding 24 h dose (mg/kg).</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> IsMeTT Palermo, Italy.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Review of clinical chart and laboratory data.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> One month after transplantation the average [L/D] was 87.2 ± 33.7 in the steroid group and 141.9 ± 83.7 in the steroid-free group. The three-month average [L/D] was 125.7 ± 46.3 in the steroid group and 227.6 ± 141.7 in the steroid-free group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at 1 month but not at 3 months. One and three-month mean SCr levels after transplantation were respectively 1.16 ± 0.24 and 1.59 ± 0.74 in the steroid group. In the steroid-free group the SCr level remained in the normal range and no significant difference was found at 1 month (1.22 ± 0.25) and 3 months (1.14 ± 0.25) after transplantation. Furthermore, the differences between SCr at 1 and 3 months were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, T-test for paired samples) in the steroid group, but not in the steroid-free group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> These results show that the use, even in low doses, of steroids in combination with FK, may change the pharmacokinetics of the latter agent. This might occur through induction of the CYP3A and/or P-gp activities. Although the limited number of patients involved we suggest that the interaction of steroids with FK could cause significant adverse reactions, in particular after discontinuation of steroids. For this reason, appropriate monitoring of FK trough level should be done.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>PT-131 Medication errors in orthopaedic surgery unit: impact of systematic pharmaceutical round and computerized system for prescription and administration of drugs</title><sec id="Sec57"><title><bold>Pourrat Xavier</bold><sup>1</sup>, Helene Bourgoin<sup>1</sup>, Dominique Delerue<sup>2</sup>, Philippe Rosset<sup>3</sup>, Luc Favard<sup>3</sup>, Jacqueline Grassin<sup>1</sup>, Daniel Antier<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec58"><title><sup>1</sup>Pharmacy Logipole, <sup>2</sup>Anesthesiology, <sup>3</sup>Orthopaedic Surgery, Chu de Tours, Tours, France</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> To measure the medical errors rate related to prescription and administration to in- patients over two consecutive 30-day periods: [P1] and [P2] before and after implementation of a computerized system dedicated to prescription and nurse’s order plan for drugs administration and to systematize pharmaceutical round in orthopaedic surgery unit.

Previous work from our research centre revealed that gathering practical knowledge is one of the strongest facilitators for Flemish community pharmacists to participate in continuing education (CE) programs. Lectures still remain the most preferred instruction method, followed by interactive sessions. Our studies further indicate that the concept of patient-centred care has gained general interest [1, 2]. Based on these findings, we developed and pilot tested an interactive, patient-centred course format (Project Patient Care) with oncology as the working theme.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> In spring 2006, a CE course on oncology was organized by IPSA, the main provider of CE programs for community pharmacists in Flanders. The course consisted of five evening lectures, focusing on clinical and pharmacotherapeutic aspects as well as psychosocial dimensions of cancer. The interactive sessions, which were organised a few weeks later, consisted of two major parts: (1) small group discussions based on one prescription for a particular patient and (2) role plays based on the same prescriptions, with one of the course-participants as the pharmacist. Feedback was provided, both by participants and instructors, on pharmacotherapeutic aspects and communicative skills. Participants evaluated the interactive session on 11 items using a four-point Likert-scale (1 = totally disagree; 4 = totally agree) and graded their overall satisfaction.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Interactive sessions on eight different locations in Flanders.

Participants gave an average appreciation of 16.6/20 with the course format. Additionally, 94% indicated that they would participate again if this kind of CE activity was organized later.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Although Flemish pharmacists are not yet used to interactive sessions, especially not to role playing, the evaluation of this project shows a high satisfaction among participants on the course format.

The admixture of these drugs for parenteral use would simplify the nursing care of patient; however this practice is forbidden by the technical documents of each drug. Consequently, the aim of this study was to validate the compatibility and the stability of paracetamol, ketoprofen and tramadol admixtures for parenteral use.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Stability of drug alone, and compatibility and stability of admixtures were assessed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min, and after 24 h of experiment, at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) and day light.

Montpied Hospital, <sup>2</sup>Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Clermont-Ferrand, France</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthlate (DEHP) is the most common plasticizer used to increase the flexibility of PVC medical devices as tubings for infusions. Because DEHP is not chemically bound to PVC it can leach from a PVC-containing medical-device into infused solutions and expose the patient to risk of toxicity: DEHP is a suspected human endocrine disruptor and a possibly reproductive toxicant. Pharmaceutical laboratories investigate alternatives to the DEHP as tri-(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate (TETM) to give flexibility to PVC medical devices.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Quantify the release of the TETM from PVC tubings in solutions in contact with these tubings.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Laboratory of clinical pharmacy and biotechnics, Faculty of Pharmacy.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> We have put in contact PVC tubings containing TETM with solutions of polysorbate 80 known to support the release of DEHP from PVC medical devices. We have exposed these tubings to various concentrations of polysorbate 80 (0.05–2 μg/ml), to different conditions of temperature (4, 25, 37°C). After 1, 5 and 24 h of contact, we have quantified TETM in the solutions by liquid chromatography after liquid/liquid extraction.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A release of TETM was highlighted in all the solutions of polysorbate 80 in contact with PVC tubings. However the quantity of TETM was very weak even 0.071 μg/ml. The release ± negligible. The average TETM concentration was 0.079 was not proportional to the concentration of polysorbate in solutions. It did not increase with the temperature or with the time of contact contrary to the release of DEHP. The concentration of TETM leached did not vary significantly with the temperature, the time of contact and the concentration of polysorbate 80 (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> TETM seems to be an interesting alternative plasticizer to DEHP in PVC tubings because its release is very limited.

These include setting up multidisciplinary teams with strong pharmacist involvement [1]. The introduction of non-medical prescribing in the UK is likely to provide opportunities and challenges for pharmacists to help ensure prudent use of antimicrobials [2, 3]. The objective of this research was to explore pharmacist perceptions of the feasibility and value of pharmacist prescribing of antimicrobials in secondary care.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A qualitative, exploratory approach was adopted. Pharmacists’ perceptions were explored using focus groups in six Scottish regions representing (a) rural and urban areas (b) district general hospitals and large teaching hospitals. Senior hospital pharmacists working in specialities where antimicrobials are crucial to patient management were invited to participate. A topic guide was developed to lead the discussions which were audio recorded and transcribed.

Pharmacists believe that the feasibility of antimicrobial prescribing is dependent upon the area of care. They identified potential roles and opportunities for prescribing of antimicrobials. Benefits included giving patients quicker access to medicines, reducing risk of resistance and applying evidence based medicine. Overall, hospital pharmacists felt more comfortable if prescribing for physician diagnosed conditions, but agreed that they have the adequate knowledge base to prescribe antimicrobials. Pharmacists are keen to work as part of a multidisciplinary team, with integration and communication even more important if they take on a prescribing role.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Practice developments should involve discussion with pharmacists to ensure integrated services aimed at optimising antimicrobial use.

It has radically transformed the part of pharmacists in out-patients’ care. Hospital pharmacists (HP) aimed to develop an intervention to inform CP on new oral chemotherapy, focusing on vinorelbine and capecitabine, in order to improve the quality of their counselling. The objective of this study is to assess the overall satisfaction and the impact of this meeting on the CP.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> The HP group nested in the regional oncologic network “Réseau Onco 93” has been meeting every 2 months with the network’s coordinator, an oncologist physician. Share of local experiences, standardisation of practice and elaboration of a teaching program destinated to CP are the main purpose of such meetings. Workshops destinated to CP were then set up and animated by a local HP in collaboration with an oncologist and a social worker in each of the three participating hospitals of the Seine Saint Denis department. The satisfaction of CP was anonymously assessed at the end of the 2 h meeting by mean of a standardized query.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> University Hospital (Avicenne, Bobigny), Regional hospitals (Montfermeil and Aulnay-sous-bois), Réseau Onco 93 (Bobigny), France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Interest of the topic, quality of the orators, estimated impact on usual practice and overall satisfaction were collected.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Of the 437 community pharmacies contacted, 90 CP working in 51 pharmacies (12%) were present. 94% of them were interested in the subject (81/86) and 91% found the quality of the interventions good (78/86). All the CP think that they are going to change their practice: totally for 74% of them (60/81) and partially for 26% (21/81). They prefer to be informed about the date of the next meetings by post-mailing (69%), e-mailing (26%), and phone call (5%). All of them were overall satisfied (very satisfied 41% and 59% satisfied).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> According to overall satisfaction, other trainings will be organised within the framework of this network: the management of post-chemotherapy side effects will be evocated on March 2007, and later on, the topic of the coverage of pain. The comments of the present CP led us to choose the topics of the next trainings, to modify their contents, and especially to determine their waitings on work (improvement of the contacts, diffusion of pre-established standardized prescription forms). The CP will then become the first line health interlocutor of cancer out-patient. It is necessary to promote collaboration between the CP and the hospital health care team.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Oral chemotherapy, Oncologic network, Community pharmacies</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec95"><title>PC-145 Overestimation of the risk for ADR’s due to the presentation in the package leaflets</title><sec id="Sec96"><title>Mai Lindström<sup>1</sup>, Eva Tärning<sup>2</sup>, <bold>Anders Ekedahl</bold><sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec97"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Health Sciences, Luleå University of Technology, Luleå, <sup>2</sup>Department of Medicine and Care, Division of Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, <sup>3</sup>R and D, National Corp. of Swedish Pharmacies and School of Pure and Applied Natural Sciences, University of Kalmar, Sweden</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Assessing the risk of drug treatment is important in the decision making by patients and is linked to compliance. Patients’ interpretation and estimation of risk depend on how the information is presented and may play a role for how the receiver understands and interprets the information as well as the acceptance or denial of risk.</p><p>It has been known for long that we tend to overestimate the risk for unusual and underestimate the risk for common events. Presentation of the risk for adverse drug reactions in verbal form is associated with large individual differences and overestimation of the risk, and increase negative perceptions of the medicine that may increase non-compliant behaviour.</p><p>Objective: To study how the risk for adverse drug reactions is presented in patient information leaflets (PIL).</p><p><bold>Design</bold> PIL for betablockers; opioids; anxiolytics; antihistamines and NSAID’s were collected at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.lakemedelsverket.se" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.lakemedelsverket.se</ext-link> (the Swedish Medical Product Agency).</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Sweden.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Which adverse drug reactions are mentioned and how the risk is expressed—verbally, numerically or both.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> On two-thirds of the 123 PIL, the risk for adverse drug reaction was expressed both verbally and numerically. On one-fifth verbal expressions only were used, and for about as many the risk was sometimes expressed numerically, sometimes verbally only and sometimes in a mix.

Criteria with the lowest adherence were “prescription of aspirin as stat dose” (46%) and “oxygen is prescribed according to local oxygen policy” (33%).Clinical pharmacists agreed that use of the evidence-based PCP would aid in the provision of consistent quality of pharmaceutical care during the stroke patient’s hospital journey and agreed its usefulness both in clinical practice and to support education and training.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Prescribing adherence to national guidelines was generally good and the pharmacist contributions further improved appropriateness of prescribing. The audit identified a need to redesign the prescription chart and the method of oxygen prescribing to improve prescribing practice in stroke patients. It also indicated the need for the PCP to be initiated by the pharmacist in the admissions unit to ensure timely prescribing of aspirin. Design of the PCP to include evidence-based prescribing criteria in accordance with national strategy provides a tool to aid pharmacists in the provision of equitable pharmaceutical care to stroke patients throughout their hospital journey. Use in routine clinical practice will refine the tool further.

PCIs were categorised as: adverse drug reaction (15%), additional medication needs (20%), dose too low (20%), dose too high (12%), unnecessary medication use (10%), inappropriate patient compliance (2%) and ineffective drug prescribed (2%). The checks or enquiries carried out by the pharmacist were mainly medication needs (41%), safety (39%) and effectiveness (13%). Incidence of PCIs was similar in autologous and allogeneic transplants except monitoring immunosuppressive medication (allogeneic = 100%, autologous = 0%). Thirteen PCIs occurred in every patient. The inter-rater reliability test demonstrated ‘good’ (<italic>k</italic> = 0.61–0.80) or ‘very good’ (<italic>k</italic> = 0.80–1.0) reliability of categorisation by the investigator. Pharmacists who piloted the pharmaceutical care plan rated the content, layout and ease of use of the document as good or very good. All would use the document in their clinical practice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> A pharmaceutical care plan has been developed, validated and agreed for use in haematopoetic stem cell transplantation in Scotland. The document will facilitate the equitable provision of pharmaceutical care to, assist in training of less experienced pharmacists and serve as a tool for the prospective audit of pharmacist activities.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Haematology, Transplant, Pharmaceutical care plan</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec110"><title>PC-222 A survey of the characteristics of critical care pharmacy services in the UK</title><sec id="Sec111"><title><bold>Matts Balgard</bold><sup>1</sup>, Ruth Forrest<sup>2</sup>, Steve Hudson<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec112"><title><sup>1</sup>The Hospital pharmacy, Norrlands University Hospital, Umea, Sweden; <sup>2</sup>Pharmacy Department, Western Infirmary, <sup>3</sup>Division of Pharmaceutical Care, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> To characterise the core components of UK critical care pharmacy and relative priorities, drawing on American experience (1) and an earlier UK survey (2).</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A 43-item web-based structured questionnaire survey based on defined service features identified from a literature review and five qualitative interviews with practitioners.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pharmacist respondents identified (<italic>n</italic> = 42) after a general email invitation to practitioners on a professional association register with two reminders (UK Clinical Pharmacy Association critical care group’s mail base; <italic>n</italic> = 238).</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Investigation of relative priority of all 43 service items (19 clinical features, 10 administrative/economic/quality assurance features, and 14 education/research features).</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Respondents in general were experienced and 42% had more than 5 years experience in critical care pharmacy. For 75% their present unit was general adult intensive care unit. The aim of the study was not to quantify prevalence of delivery so the low response rate (17.6%) does not invalidate the findings.</p><p>The most common features regarded as core service components were; evaluating safety and effectiveness of prescribed items (97%), advice on drug administration (79%), providing medicines information to support prescribing decisions (62%), therapeutic drug monitoring (62%) and obtaining updated patient medication history (57%). These were predominantly clinical features.</p><p>The highest priorities for further development were; advice on the evidence base for therapies (48%), maintaining documentation of pharmaceutical care issues and actions (43%), advice on drug administration (40%), improved systems to reduce medication errors (40%), writing local drug monographs and protocols (40%) and policies for safe and effective medication use in ICU (40%). Four of these were administrative/economic/quality assurance features. Education and training and the conduct of research were generally identified as core components/high priorities for development by &lt;20% of respondents.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The findings represent relative prioritisation amongst a group of established practitioners. Critical care pharmacists provide general clinical pharmacy contributions with an emphasis on advice on therapeutic drug monitoring and drug administration in ICUs. There is a priority to develop the administrative and quality assurance sides of practice. Developing educational activities or research in ICU patients was not an identified priority and requires further investigation.</p><p>This work has provided a structure for generating a service specification to match perceived needs of the critical care team in Sweden.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Rudis MI, Brandl KM.

Pharmacists thought current limitations of the service were the need for greater integration into the existing structure. Pharmacists were generally very comfortable talking about symptoms with their patients. Pharmacists thought that patients felt encouraged by the service to describe symptoms in a way that they may not have done previously.</p><p>In the patient survey the important findings were that: 66% of patients felt that talking to a pharmacist made a difference to how much they know about HF, with 72% and 58% overall saying that they knew more about their HF medicines and HF symptoms respectively. Some 48% thought that the service would make them more likely to tell their doctor or nurse about new symptoms. However, only 9% of the patients felt that it had made a difference to their routine for taking their medicines.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Patients with chronic heart failure are increasingly recognised as a target group for pharmaceutical care support [1, 2]. The evaluation showed that HF patients perceive educational benefit from the Community Pharmacy Heart Failure Service. The evidence from patients is that the service encourages early self-referral to primary care providers, an important advance for this patient group which has one of the highest rates of hospitalisation. The service requires to be developed to transfer the educational benefits into measurable changes in patient outcomes.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Rodgers A, Addington-Hall J, McCoy A, Edmonds P, Abbey A, Coats A, Gibbs J.

The main issue of our study was to analyse the modalities of wound dressing management.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Prospective study.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Department of Pharmacy.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> We prospectively reviewed all dressing wound prescriptions between Nov 5, 2006 and Jan 15, 2007. For each prescription, we systematically called the care unit to investigate the wound characteristics, the indication and the frequency of dressing changes. Our questionnaire had previously been validated by an infectious disease specialist.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> They were 68 wound dressing prescriptions that concerned 42 patients during the study period. Prescriptions were collected from 21 care units (2 external consultations/19 conventional hospitalizations). The general surgery (7 prescriptions), the external intra-abdominal surgery (12 prescriptions) and the dermatology (15 prescriptions) were by ascending order the 3 main prescribing care units. The median number of wound dressing prescriptions per patient was 3 (range 1–6). The most common wound treated was abdominal wound. Eight different dressings were identified: 1 hydrocolloid, 1 hydrocellular, 1 hydrofiber, 2 border dressings, 1 silver dressing, 1 hyaluronic acid dressing, 1 water dressing. The primary dressing used was judged inappropriate in 13 cases out of 68 (19%), 8 cases concerning the healing phase and 5 the infectious status of the wound. Inappropriate dressing affected 9 care units and 8 had used &lt;5 dressings during the last 2 months. Among the 13 inappropriate prescriptions, a modification due to our recommendation was accepted in 5 cases and refused in 3 cases. No alternative could be articulated in 5 cases and 3 concerned silver wound dressings.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> A significant proportion of wound dressing prescriptions was found inappropriate. The results of this study also highlighted the importance of providing training on wound dressing management for health-care workers. Dressing selection is a vital part of the successful management of wounds. The choice of an appropriate dressing should be based on the wound type and on clinically applicable measures, such as antibacterial action, healing, and exudate handling effects.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Wound dressing, Prescription, Prospective study</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec128"><title>PC-77 Structured patient assessment of quality of medication use in cardiovascular disease in primary care</title><sec id="Sec129"><title><bold>Thomas Kanis</bold><sup>1</sup>, Tobias T.

Senior medical officers work in both hospital systems and junior medical officers (JMOs) are based in public hospitals. Evidence-based guidelines provide recommendations for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. While funding for inpatient medications differs in public and private hospitals, medication funding and supply do not differ after hospitalisation. Medications begun in hospital are more likely to be continued post-discharge. The purpose of this project was to describe patterns of evidence-based medication (EBM) prescription at discharge in patients post-PCI and post-CABG.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Descriptive, observational, retrospective.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Co-located public and private hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Descriptive statistics including EBM prescription rates at hospital admission and discharge (aspirin, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs), beta-blockers, statins).</p><p><bold>Results</bold> During 2005/2006, data from the medical records of 300 public and 440 private patients were reviewed. The demographics of the 2 hospital populations were similar. 100% of public and 28% of private patients had a presenting diagnosis documented. 84% and 16% of public and 68% and 32% of private patients underwent PCI and CABG, respectively. 63% of public and 99% of private PCI patients received drug-eluting stents. 32% of public and 43% of private patients had some missing data regarding medication use. Information regarding antiplatelet use post-PCI was documented in both catheter reports and discharge letters in the public hospital but only in discharge letters in the private hospital. There was disparity between the catheter report and discharge letter in 10% of public patients. On admission, rates of prescribing of aspirin were 59% (public) and 64% (private), ACEI/ARBs 50% and 48%, beta-blockers 42% and 42%, and statins 60% and 64%. At discharge aspirin was prescribed in 98% (public) and 79% (private), ACEI/ARBs 71% and 59%, beta-blockers 70% and 41% and statins 87% and 79%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Differences in discharge EBM were noted between the 2 hospitals although baseline admission rates were similar. Concordance with EBM recommendations in the public hospital was comparable to published literature. Documentation was poor in the private hospital and may be associated with the availability of JMOs in the public hospital. Transfer of medication information to maintain continuity of care may not be achieved for some patients. Findings of disparity regarding antiplatelet prescription post-PCI have been communicated to public hospital prescribers. The finding that discharge prescribing may be different between the hospital settings suggests further follow-up investigation of these patients after discharge is necessary.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Evidence-based medication, Discharge, Hospital settings</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec134"><title>PC-192 Evaluation of the integration of a pharmacist into the hospital outpatient clinic providing care in rheumatoid arthritis</title><sec id="Sec135"><title><bold>L.

To understand prescribers’ approach on pharmaceutical forms and nurses’ practices, we investigated the different methods of drug-administration via a catheter (naso-gastric tube, naso-intestinal tube, gastrostomy tube and jejunal feeding tube) used in our hospital.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Our investigation consisted of going into care units and questioning nurses about their practices using a standardized questionnaire. Twenty-three care units were questioned in one day, so that we could draw up an inventory of common habits in care units. At the same moment, we also collected the prescriptions of every patients requiring enteral feeding to analyse their relevance.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pharmaceutical Unit, Care Units.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> We analysed 28 hard-copy prescriptions of catheterized patients.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Of the 594 patients hospitalized in the 23 units, 58 (9.8%) of them had an enteral catheter or tube. Twenty-eight hard-copy prescriptions were analysed, representing 142 actual prescription drugs prescribed (i.e. on average 3.7 prescription drugs per hard-copy prescription).</p><p>The investigation shows that 75% of the units have a tablet crusher. Sixty-four percent of them declare that they never call the pharmacy unit to check a drug’s compatibility with enteral catheter administration. Only 32% of nurses look for a drinkable form of the medication. Fifty-nine percent of them still believe that all injectable are drinkable. Seventy-three percent of the nurses think that all caps can be opened, and 86% of them think that all tablets are crushable. Fifty-five percent of units use injectable drugs in place of dry forms. In 91% of cases, water is used as drug vehicle.</p><p>Sixty-three percent of prescriptions contained at least one error. Twenty-nine percent of the prescribed drugs were not compatible with catheter administration. In 10% of cases, a drinkable form did exist, but the dry form was administered instead (e.g. Motilium<sup>®</sup> and Lasilix<sup>®</sup> in most of the cases). Administration of Inexium<sup>®</sup> was the most obvious case of misuse. Indeed, it is crushed by 75% of the nurses, whereas its galenical development has been based on the formulation of a soluble tablet used to facilitate enteral tube administration.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> This investigation was carried out in Pontchaillou Hospital, Rennes, and it highlights a lack in prescribers’ and nurses’ knowledge of galenic. This ignorance could be of concern for patients. To awaken practitioners to the importance of the subject, we are going to write an information sheet summarizing the results of the study and develop good practices guidelines on drug administration by enteral catheter.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Drug-administration, Catheterized patients, Enteral feeding</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec140"><title>PC-80 A study to compare antihypertensive prescribing patterns with the standard treatment guidelines in patents with diabetes</title><sec id="Sec141"><title><bold>Surarong Chinwong</bold><sup>1</sup>, Sunteep Batra<sup>1</sup>, Sittikorn Jailungka<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec142"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Pharmaceutical Care, Faculty of Pharmacy Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> To study the patterns of antihypertensive drug presentation in diabetic patients and to quantify (i) the achievement of target blood pressure control and (ii) adverse events of antihypertensive drugs.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Descriptive cross-sectional study.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Cardiovascular Clinic, Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Thailand.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Prescribing patterns, the achievement of blood pressure control, adverse events and appropriateness of prescribing.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A total of 200 out-patients were included in this study. The mean (SD) age was 62.4 (10.4) years and 56.0% were female. Dyslipidaemia and CHD accounted for 79.0% and 53.0% of patients respectively. The mean (SD) number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed was 2.4 (1.0). ACEI/ARB were the most frequently prescribed in 68.0% of patients. The majority of patients were prescribed two-drug combinations. There was no statistically significant association between blood pressure levels, fasting blood glucose level, the achievement of target blood pressure goal (&lt;130/80 mmHg) and number or type of antihypertensive drugs prescribed (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Only 79 (39.5%) of patients had achieved the target blood pressure goal. Almost all patients were appropriately prescribed antihypertensive drugs according to its treatment criteria and antihypertensive drug use. However, the achievement of target blood pressure goal, interval of follow up and the prescribing of heart disease prevention seemed to be less appropriate. Data from 116 patients (58%) who answered the postal questionnaire showed that almost all patients were advised on lifestyle modification especially in reduction of sugar consumption, reduction of consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol-rich diets and increased consumption of high fibre diet. The most common adverse events reported by the patients were urinary frequency, exhaustion, impotence, syncope and chronic cough (70.7%, 63.8%, 50.9%, 41.4% and 39.7%, respectively) The severity of these events were mild to moderate and related to types of antihypertensive drugs prescribed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The present study provided important information on prescribing patterns, blood pressure levels, adverse events and conformity to recommendation on lifestyle modifications in diabetic patients with hypertension. This information is useful to guide and increase awareness of physicians in selection of antihypertensive drugs in this group of patients in order to achieve blood pressure targets and to reduce possible complication.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Chobanian AV, Bakris GL, et al.

The majority of medication, 42.1%, were from the ATC C main group; 26.1% were from ATC A main group (which include the 18.0% antidiabetic medication); 11.9% were from the ATC N main group; 6.1% were from the ATC M main group; each of the other ATC main groups had a &lt;3% share. During the course of diabetes—with the progression of the disease—a significant increase was found in the number of patients using drugs from ATC C main group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), drugs from ATC B main group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), drugs from ATC M main group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.021), and drugs from ATC N main group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). No statistically significant changes could be detected in cases of other medication groups. Diabetic patients used much more medication than the average population: they claimed 3 times more prescriptions than the average citizen, and nearly 2 times more than what they had claimed just prior their diagnoses of diabetes. Although diabetic patients used more medication from most of the drug groups than the average population, the increase in the number of prescriptions for cardiovascular drugs (ATC C main group) was the most striking one. During the first year of diabetes males claimed 40.0 prescriptions and females collected 48.3 prescriptions on average. By the fifth year this increased to 54.8 and 62.3 prescriptions, respectively. During the first year males used an average of 10.8 different active ingredients which increased to 12.9 in the fifth year, and females used 13.2 active agents in the first year and 14.5 in the fifth year.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The concurrent use of several drugs not only increases the complexity of the treatment and results in higher health care cost, but also raises the risk of adverse drug reactions and drug–drug interactions. As polypharmacy is almost inevitable in diabetic patients, regular reevaluation of the therapy is essential to minimize the risk arising from polypharmacy.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Diabetes, Hungary, Co-medication</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec149"><title>PEPI-163 Quality of life in patients with tuberculosis</title><sec id="Sec150"><title>Fikret V.

Factors including the debilitating nature of the disease as well as the long-term treatment consisting of multiple drugs with potential toxicities seem to affect the TB patients’ quality of life. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of TB on patients’ quality of life by using a validated instrument.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> The study was conducted on three treatment groups: 1. outpatient TB patients (MDR or non-MDR) [<italic>n</italic> = 20]; 2. inpatient MDR TB patients [<italic>n</italic> = 20]; 3. inpatient non-MDR TB patients [<italic>n</italic> = 20]; and a control group [<italic>n</italic> = 20]. The control group consisted of non-TB, age and sex matched subjects of similar socioeconomic environment with the TB patients. SF-36 was used for quality of life assessment. The scale was administered via face to face interviewer-mediated sessions. The same interviewer was in charge through the whole study.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Sureyyapasa Center for Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery; Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The quality of life scores of TB patients.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The physical dimension and mental dimension scores for the of SF-36 was highest for the control group (P: 70.86; M: 62.85) where this was followed by the outpatient (P: 68.32; M: 65.53), inpatient non-MDR (P: 60.12; M: 58.91) and inpatient MDR (P: 55.25; M: 51.38) groups, respectively.</p><p>Only role-physical, social functioning and role-emotional scales showed a significant statistical difference among the groups. Role-physical scale score was highest for the control group where this was followed by the outpatient, inpatient non-MDR and inpatient MDR groups, respectively. The scores for the social functioning and role-emotional scales were the lowest for the inpatient MDR group; this was followed by the inpatient non-MDR, control and outpatient groups, respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Tuberculosis was found to have a negative impact on the physical and mental dimensions of quality of life in general. Especially scales constituting the mental health dimension were the most affected ones. This negative impact was most significant for the inpatients. The clinical pharmacist can help the TB patients improve their quality of life through reducing the drug-related burdens by counseling on medications and coping strategies.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Tuberculosis, Quality of life, Multi-drug resistant</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec152"><title>PEPI-31 Oral high dose dexamethasone: clinical use in patients with multiple myeloma</title><sec id="Sec153"><title>Nathalie Saurel<sup>1</sup>, Sophie Calvez<sup>1</sup>, Yvette Brasseur<sup>2</sup>, <bold>Bernard Do</bold><sup>3</sup>, Marie-Pierre Berleur<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec154"><title><sup>1</sup>Regulatory, <sup>2</sup>Pharmacovigilance, <sup>3</sup>Analytical Development Laboratory, Ageps EPHP, Paris, France</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder.

A few days prior to the admission she has fallen several times. The medication history taken by the clinical pharmacist in a standardised manner revealed routine use of lithium 350 mg TID for one year, venlafaxine, trazodone, duloxetine, bisoprolol, simvastatine, metformine, alprazolam and zopiclon. Nimesulide 100 mg OD had been prescribed to control her pain symptoms following frequent falls. Laboratory investigation revealed a lithium blood level of 2.16 mmol/l (Reference value 0.40–1.5 mmol/l). The clinical pharmacist at the emergency department suggested nimesulide to be the cause of her intoxication.</p><p>Although there are large interindividual differences in lithium clearance associated with different NSAIDs, they all have been associated with lithium toxicity. The exact underlying mechanism of the interaction between lithium and NSAIDs remains unknown. One hypothesis involves the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit the production of endogenous prostaglandins (PG) by the kidney. Reduced PGE2 levels are believed to mediate the sodium retention and would, therefore, be anticipated to increase the lithium reabsorption as well. Alternatively, inhibition of PG synthesis may reduce renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rates. However, aspirin decreases PGE2 levels by 70%, but does not appear to effect lithium clearance to a large extent.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> In the literature there are several reports of lithium poisoning caused by the use of nimesulide. The authorities even launched a warning about this interaction.</p><p>This case-report illustrates the importance of taking in depth drug histories and being aware of drug interactions especially when adding new medications.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Medication-history, Lithiumintoxication, NSAIDs</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec158"><title>PT-242 Non-adherence to guideline of rational antibioticotherapy/prophylaxis of dialysis patients</title><sec id="Sec159"><title><bold>Radka Vrbecka</bold><sup>1</sup>, Vilma V.

However, only few data are available on the prevalence of RI in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The French MATRIX study (MeThotreXate and Renal Insufficiency) was thus started to estimate the prevalence of RI, proteinuria, abnormal urine sediment, hypertension and diabetes in RA patients.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Data were collected for RA patients presenting at the Rheumatology department from April 18 to July 31, 2006: sex, age, weight, serum creatinine (SCr), drugs and theirs dosages. Proteinuria and abnormal urinary sediments were assessed with urinary sticks.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Rheumatology Department and ICAR (A National Medical Advisory Service on “Drugs and the Kidney”) located in the Nephrology Department, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Prevalence of SCr &gt; 110 mol/l was determined. Renal function was estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and the abbreviated MDRD (aMDRD) formulae. Prevalence of abnormal urinalysis was also assessed.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 129 (109 women, 20 men) patients were included: mean age 55.2 years, weight 66.6 kg, duration of RA 9.5 years. 102 (79.1%) and 99 (76.7%) patients had available data for SCr and urinary sticks, respectively. SCr was normal in 99% of the patients for whom data were available. With CG, GFR &lt; 90 ml/min was observed in 60/99 patients (60.6%). With aMDRD, GFR &lt; 90 ml/min/1.73 m² was observed in 68/102 patients (66.7%). Proteinuria (≥1+), hematuria (≥1+), and leucocyturia (≥1+) were observed in 16/99 (16.2%), 17/99 (17.2%) and 22/99 (22.2%) patients for whom data were available, respectively. Hypertension and diabetes were observed in 24.8% and 7.8% of patients, respectively. Methotrexate (MTX) (mean dose 15.5 mg/week and mean duration 4.6 years) was prescribed in 82.2% of MATRIX patients. When using CG, 20.5% of the patients treated with MTX should have had an adjustment of its dosage (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min). 92.5% of those patients had an adapted dose of MTX according to their renal function.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The results of the MATRIX study showed that RI is frequent in RA patients. SCr under-estimates this prevalence. Systematic estimation of renal function with CG or aMDRD formulae is mandatory. Clinicians must be aware of such a high prevalence since it may necessitate adjustment of drugs dosages.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Renal insufficiency, Rheumatoid arthritis</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec170"><title>PT-56 Glutathione for hepatic protection during raltitrexed and oxaliplatin treatment</title><sec id="Sec171"><title><bold>Lois Pollock</bold><sup>1</sup>, Aileen Cameron<sup>1</sup>, Moira Kinnear<sup>1</sup>, Ewan Morrison<sup>1</sup>, Lucy Wall<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec172"><title><sup>1</sup>Lothian Pharmacy Practice Unit, <sup>2</sup>Edinburgh Cancer Centre, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Raltitrexed and oxaliplatin are approved for treating colorectal cancers in the cancer centre. Both agents can cause transient, reversible increases in alanine transaminase, however, hepatotoxicy is greater with concomitant administration (RalOx).

Both X &amp; Y experienced 2 treatment delays due to increased ALT and were prescribed GSH as pre-medication on cycle 4 when their ALT had recovered to less than 2ULN. X experienced a 25% dose reduction in ralitrexed at cycle 4 in addition to GSH due ALT of 101 U/L.

Causality assessment method Begaud is based on seven criteria, that are separated in two groups (chronology and symptoms or signs) (1). It carried out independently for each drug taken. These scores result in five final possible causality score: I0 (no imputability), I1 (dubious imputability), I2 (possible imputability), I3 (likely imputability) and I4 (very likely imputability). Naranjo et al. use an algorithm base on ten questions; for each question, three responses are possible: yes, no and don’t know (2). Scores are added up range from −2 to +12.

Interns on the contrary were more reluctant towards a clinical pharmacist monitoring their prescribing behaviour.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> This qualitative analysis shows similarities as well as divergences in topics of concern between interns and staff members. Interns are more interested in the availability of extended information and support while staff members stress the relative character of guidelines. Staff members show a high approval of the role of the clinical pharmacist on the issue of antibiotic management while interns seem unfamiliar with their role. When increasing the contribution of the pharmacist in our hospital, their potential advantages e.g. as to informational support should be emphasized. In order to improve antibiotic use and guideline adherence in the hospital, the contextual and behavioural topics emerging from these focus groups will be useful in order to design and implement tailored interventions.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Steinman MA, Ranji SR, Shojania KG et al.

After 6 months of treatment and a decrease of the cognitive fonctions, donepezil was considered as ineffective and replaced by rivastigmine. The posologic plan has been prescribed by steps to reach the effective dose. This treatment was well tolerated by the patient and stopped the increase of his mesic troubles.

However 48% of units seems to have lack of information on drugs: no International Non-proprietary Name (INN), none therapeutic alternative and a difficult access to Vidal. According to the study’s results, we implemented new functions in Helios to answer caregivers’ requests. Helios allows from now to: look for drugs by INN or branded name; precise INN systematically; open drug’s Vidal page by clicking on branded name; open formulary and put drug in its therapeutic class by clicking on INN; suggest equivalent drugs held in pharmacy stock if required drug not referred; give different information about drug by icons (drug committee’s recommendations, out of stock, restricted indication).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The Helios new version is now in function and is favourably received.

It has anticonvulsant, analgesic and anxiolytic activity. Myoclonia have been reported as a relatively common side effect of pregabalin. It appears that a high dose or a rapid titration of pregabalin results in a higher frequency of myoclonia. With this case report we want to illustrate this potential reversible adverse drug event.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Case report and literature review.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Geriatric ward, University Hospital Leuven, Belgium.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Evaluation of pregabalin as a possible cause for myoclonia.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A 74-year-old man, with a history of diabetes mellitus complicated with a bilateral limb amputation, was admitted to the acute geriatric ward because of a pneumonia. For the treatment of phantom pain the patient received 150 mg pregabalin BD since 14 days. During the present hospitalisation two episodes of diffuse myoclonic jerks associated with drowsiness has been observed. No epileptic activity, encephalitis, meningitis or acute cerebral vascular disease could be detected. After the first event, the administration of pregabalin, was discontinued. Two days after restarting pregabalin 300 mg the patient experienced a new episode of diffuse myoclonic jerks. It is noteworthy that the renal creatinine clearance was only 11 ml/min the day before the first event and 9 ml/min the day after the second one, whereas 1 week before the creatinine clearance was 49 ml/min.</p><p>The most probable explanation for the first event is the accumulation of pregabalin, which is completely excreted by the kidney implicating dose adjustments when renal function deteriorates. The maximum dose for patients with a renal clearance of &lt;15 ml/min is 75 mg OD.</p><p>The second event is most likely caused by starting pregabalin in a dose too high without adjustments for the renal function.</p><p>For patients with normal renal function the starting dose is 75 mg BD, which can be increased to 150 mg BD within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. When after 2–4 weeks the drug is well tolerated but the effect is not optimal, dose may be increased up to 300 mg BD.</p><p>The Naranjo score, which estimates the probability of adverse drug reactions, is 6.

Next, we defined the competency profile of the future pharmacist. We identified the following nine outcomes (general and professional) to be mastered by pharmacy graduates: professionalism; communication; teamwork and interdisciplinarity; scientific reasoning and critical thinking; self-directed learning abilities; leadership; pharmaceutical care; community services; and finally management and operations. The next step was to make an inventory of all cognitive material essential for each outcome development including knowledge units, skills and attitudes. This material was then reorganised as follows: annual themes were identified. Knowledge mapping procedure was used to design learning modules. The 5 modules span over nine trimesters and integrate several disciplines: Module 1: Drugs and man; Module 2: Drugs and society; Module 3: Skills laboratories; Module 4: Integrative activities; and Module 5: Clerkships. Program architecture has been profoundly redesigned and now integrates externships and internships.</p><p>Instructional design for each integrated course will be performed by multidisciplinary teams which includes a clinical pharmacist.

Such delivery methods can overcome many logistical issues associated with interprofessional education (IPE). The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate a web-based virtual learning environment (VLE) IPE module. The objectives were to identify a topic of study relevant to the professional groups involved, to develop the course including the use of web based video content and to evaluate the attitudes and experiences of the students involved.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A VLE module on the topic of diabetes was developed and delivered to Year 3 pharmacy and medical students using the Robert Gordon University’s Virtual Campus. At the start of the module the students attended an introductory session outlining the course content and instructions on how to use the VLE. The students then took part in a series of online sessions over a period of 5 weeks using a range of information including electronic patient notes and online videos to jointly develop a clinical management plan. Focus groups and a quantitative survey were conducted to elicit information about the students’ needs, attitudes and experiences of the module. The data from the focus groups were transcribed and analysed using N-Vivo. The quantitative questionnaire included key themes identified in the focus groups as well as questions based on the Readiness for Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS) [1].</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Aberdeen.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Attitudes towards e-learning as a method of delivering IPE and course evaluation.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Despite a majority of respondents indicating that face-to-face interaction was preferable (77.8%) a number (33.3%) agreed that the course was likely to increase their future interprofessional communication. A large majority of respondents agreed that learning with other students will make them a more effective member of a health care team (88.9%) and indeed would welcome the opportunity to share some generic lectures and tutorials with other health care students (77.8%). The response rate to the questionnaire was 33%. Key themes arising from the focus groups included an appreciation of the potential benefits of interprofessional education and the importance of face-to-face and non-verbal communication.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Both sets of students finished the pilot course with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the other’s roles and responsibilities demonstrating that two interprofessional groups can successfully study together and that this can be achieved online. The module has now been embedded into the curriculum and has now been rolled out to all Year 3 pharmacy students.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Parsell G, Spalding R &amp; Bligh J.

In the context of transforming our bachelor’s degree into a professional doctorate in pharmacy (PharmD), it was decided that this competency would be the “pivot” or at the center of the 14 Pharmaceutical Care courses. In order to provide a uniform language amongst faculty and students, the pharmaceutical care process was reviewed. An integrated approach using different disciplines (pathophysiology, biopharmaceutics, pharmacology, pharmacotherapy, etc.) will be used in the new program. These courses will be organised according to the various biological systems (cardiology, nephrology, etc.). We describe herein how the pharmaceutical care process was mapped and used to create an interactive teaching tool for all 14 courses.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> This process was developed in three steps by a team of Faculty members: (a) systematic analysis of the competency; (b) development of a teaching tool prototype; (c) elaboration of Pharmaceutical Care courses.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Faculté de Pharmacie, Université de Montréal.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> A team of 6 community and hospital pharmacists, along with an instructional designer, developed a detailed map of the cognitive process involved in providing pharmaceutical care using software specifically designed for that purpose (MotPlus<sup>®</sup>). Then, using a simplified version of the cognitive process, the prototype of an interactive teaching tool of pharmaceutical care was developed.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Mapping of the cognitive process in providing pharmaceutical care resulted in 295 knowledge units. To facilitate the implementation of this active learning strategy, the prototype will be used to develop a Web tool that will allow students to “travel” throughout the process, to listen to audio capsules or to watch videos attached to the different knowledge units. This Web tool will be used in four different modes: consultation, problem solving, observation, and authoring. The simplified version of the pharmaceutical care process knowledge map will also be used by students in Pharmaceutical Care courses by our students to analyze and solve problems in order to acquire the necessary knowledge and gradually develop the competency.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> By making explicit this complex pharmaceutical care process by the use of a validated knowledge map and applying it throughout the different courses of the new program, the students’ learning process will be facilitated and allow a better development of the competency.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Making explicit this complex process by the use of a validated knowledge map and applying it throughout.</p></list-item></list></p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Pharmaceutical care, Knowledge map, Competency</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec237"><title>EDU-101 Non applicable</title><sec id="Sec238"><title>Claire Guisset<sup>1</sup>, <bold>Sophie Perriat</bold><sup>1</sup>, Laurent Giraudon<sup>1</sup>, Nanaz Afifi<sup>1</sup>, Christine Blondin<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec239"><title><sup>1</sup>Pharmacy, CHIBT, Sète, France</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Compliance of Health Care Centers to Recommendations for antibiotic treatment issued by the Anti-Infective Committee is a pre-requisite for harmonization of practice across centers, improvement of the quality of antibiotic treatments, and better control of bacterial resistance.</p><p>Evaluation of local compliance to Recommendations for antibiotic treatment appeared necessary in order to optimize the actions of Anti-Infective Committee.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Two-month observational prospective study to evaluate how Recommendations were applied.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> We analyzed, in three departments (medicine, surgery, geriatric), the conformity of antibiotic treatment used in urinary tract infections to Recommendations established in 2002 in collaboration with the doctors.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Type of urinary infections, antibiotics prescribed, treatment duration, germ involved and level of compliance to Recommendations….</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The study was conducted on 60 patients with mean age of 60.3 years. 58% of them had been hospitalised due to urinary infection.

Respondents; between 18 and 20 years old—RGU 63.9% (39/61)/Ghana 81.9% (104/127), female—RGU 67.2%, (41/61)/Ghana 43.3%, (55/127) and had never worked in a pharmacy practice setting—RGU 52.5% (32/61)/Ghana 84.2% (107/127). Preferred practice setting for the majority on qualification was; community pharmacy at RGU (57.4%, 35/61) and industrial pharmacy in Ghana (55.1%, 70/127). Statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference between students at each institution in the total score (median Ghana, 79.24 vs. RGU, 79.1; <italic>P</italic> = 0.776) for the 18 items on the instrument. However, there was a significant difference in each of the sub-themes relating to ‘working with’ (Median Ghana 35.67 vs. RGU 38.97; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and ‘emotion toward’ (Median Ghana 43 vs. RGU 40.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) patients with HIV/AIDS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Conclusions are limited by differences in response rates but this study indicates that pharmacy student attitudes to patients with HIV/AIDS may differ due to a variety of factors including demographics, preferred practice setting and practice experience.

The subject Clinical Pharmacy should be taught in seminars or workshops with suitable assessment methods. This project evaluated different methods for teaching and assessing undergraduate pharmacy students in a clinical placement. A three day intensive clinical pharmacy teaching programme had been delivered to a group of pharmacy students. The outcome of the students with different assessment methods had been evaluated.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Some 24 students of the Philipps-University in Marburg attending the eighth semester opted for the project and were assigned by random to four groups, including one control group. After one introduction day at the university in Marburg, the students of the intervention groups were attached for one day to a ward at the hospital in Fulda. Afterwards each student had to write a pharmaceutical care plan, judged by a clinical pharmacist.</p><p>All 24 students attended an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in Fulda and a final written examination at university, which is mandatory. The OSCE included 10 stations, 6 theoretical stations and 4 with a role-play-station with an interview of a simulated patient or doctor.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> The Clinical placement was held at the Klinikum Fulda, located 120 km from Marburg. The hospital is a teaching hospital of the Philipps-University in Marburg with 950 acute beds. The students had been attached to the neurological ward, the orthopaedic clinic or the day cancer clinic.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The OSCE had been tested for reliability. The OSCE and the final written exam had been compared for the ranking of the students. The outcome of the students of the intervention and the control group had been compared.

The main tasks carried out by clinical pharmacists in hospitals were originally the purchasing and distribution of medication. For the last 10 years, they have become aware of the importance of bringing together the various care units in a hospital in order to improve the use of medication. Nevertheless, this practice is not yet widespread in French hospitals. Residency is probably an ideal way to get the skills needed in CP.</p><p>The aim of our study was to consult all the residents being trained in France in order to collect information about their practices, their needs and their expectations about CP.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> We realized a questionnaire to assess: residents practices and knowledge on CP; CP activities according to Bond et al.

Among them, 38% were assigned to a clinical unit: 80% of them spent &lt;25% of their working time in clinical units. Sixty-two residents (70%) practiced at least one of CP activities according to Bond et al.: 1. information about medications (33%); 2. prescribing evaluation (28%); 3. adverse events management (18%). 70% are unsatisfied with their practical training and 90% expect CP courses during their Pharmacy degree.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The definition of CP is well understood by residents. Access to CP is still limited, but there is a positive evolution in its development. Of interest, CP activities are mainly focused on drug management and not patient-centered. In addition, French residents report a lack of practical and theoretical teaching of CP. This may represent a limiting factor to its development. Therefore, a systematic and practical teaching of Clinical Pharmacy should be a key to improve and standardize practices.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Bond CA, Raehl CL, Franke T.Clinical pharmacy services and hospital mortality rates.

However, vitamins miss in the binary admixtures intended for newborn and children developed by the Paris hospitals and so must be added before the perfusion. The aim of this study was to assess the stability of vitamins during 24 h (duration of an infusion) on these admixtures.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Three independent tests were carried out on three different mixtures.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> This study takes place in the public establishment of Paris hospitals.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The follow-up of the content of vitamins (10 among the 12 present in the solution) and the formation of potential products of degradation in the mixture was investigated by a method associating HPLC/UV/MS. The technique was developed and was validated at the laboratory and allows analyses the liposoluble and water-soluble vitamins simultaneously, with sufficient sensibility and specificity.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> After 24 h, no significant difference was noted concerning the aspect, the colouring and the limpidity of the solutions. The chromatographic profiles at T0 and T24 were identical. For all admixtures the vitamins stability remained within acceptable ranges except ascorbic acid. In the G15 and G25 children admixtures the rate of ascorbic acid was respectively 82.6 ± 4.9% and 87.0 ± 2.5% compared to the solutions at T0. In the G15 child mixture the lower limit of the confidence interval of dexpanthenol is near the limit of acceptability: 97.1 ± 7.6%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Thus, after 24 h, it was not observed major matrix effect on the stability of the vitamins. On the chromatographic profiles it was not appeared other compounds after the introduction of these vitamins. Lastly, there were no significant interactions of the container towards the contents. This study confirms the possible addition of vitamins in these parenteral nutrition admixtures.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Koletzko B et al. Vitamins.

The major indications were short bowel syndrome (71%), and chronic pseudo-obstruction or occlusion (13%). The underlying diseases in patients with short bowel mainly were Crohn’s disease (32%) and mesenteric ischemia (40%). Nutritive mixtures were tailored preparations that were provided with disposable equipment and infusion pumps by the hospital pharmacy. Nutritional mixtures were mainly (57%) delivered through tunnellized catheters and the regimen of perfusion was nocturnal in all patients. The mean duration of HPN was 3.3 years (range 2 months–10 years). The mean number of nutritional bags were 4.8/week (range 1–7) at the beginning of HPN treatment Two hundred and 57 hospitalizations occured for 47 patients, mainly in relation with catheter related infections (55%) and nutritional assessment (13%). Parenteral nutrition was withdrawn during 61.5% of the hospitalizations. At the end of the survey (December 31, 2005), 18 (34%) patients continued HPN, 13 (38%) had stopped and 18 (34%) had died.

DRP can lead to an ineffective pharmacotherapy and may cause drug-related morbidity and mortality [1]. Most DRP are avoidable and community pharmacies (CP) are assuming an active role in preventing and solving DRP.</p><p>The primary objectives of this study were to demonstrate the pharmacists’ performed counselling services concerning the prevention and solution of DRP as well as the spectrum of DRP.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Between February and May 2005, a nationwide survey was conducted in CP to record all identified DRP. Participating CP had the freedom to choose 1 week of documentation within the given time period. Each CP was requested to record basic data concerning pharmacy structure e.g., number of customers, prescriptions and dispensed drugs per week. All identified DRP were documented separately on a standardized documentation sheet. Besides patient-specific data like age and gender, drug-related data Rx or OTC, first-time or repeated prescription, problem description and solution were recorded. For a qualitative evaluation, DRP were categorised using a modified PI-Doc classification system [2].</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> All CP in Germany (21,476) were invited to participate.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Number, nature, and relative frequency of DRP and time spent to detect and solve a DRP.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 1,146 CP participated and documented in total 10,427 DRP (9.1 DRP/CP/week). A broad spectrum of DRP was detected with 9/10 DRP pertaining to prescribed medicines. Three levels could be differentiated where DRP can arise: the prescription-, the patient- and the delivery level. Overall, drug-drug interactions were the most frequently reported DRP (8.6%). According to CP, more than 80% of identified DRP could be solved. Thereby, the prescribing physician was contacted in 61% of all cases. Median (mean) time for detecting and solving a DRP was 5 (10) min.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> CP play an important role in the identification, assessment, and prevention of DRP and provide a valuable contribution for an effective pharmacotherapy and improved drug safety. A follow-up study should evaluate the prevalence of DRP in daily CP practice.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Johnson JA, Bootman JL.

Leeches progress within the pharmacy is wholly and clearly defined by written procedures: storage between 4 and 8°C, in identified aquariums (batch number) filled with spring water weekly replaced [2]. Dispensation is carried out in spring water added to 20 mg of gentamicin. After use, leeches follow the infected waste elimination process to be incinerated. Other 5 hospital pharmacies questioned all had comparable delivery process, but none which added antibiotic in the dispensation flask. Aside, the analysis of the 6 patient’s files treated with medicinal leeches in 2005 (4 in orthopaedic surgery (hand surgery), 2 in plastic surgery (venous congestion after mastectomy) revealed that only the infected one did not receive any oral antibiotic prophylaxis (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides), which is recognized to be the most efficient prevention against leech-related infections [3].</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The Pharmacy Department proposed a new protocol, systematically including an oral antibiotic prophylaxis (ofloxacin 200 mg, 3 doses/day), for prescription and dispensation of medicinal leeches, and submitted this protocol to the local Committee of Infection survey for validation, before its delivery to the concerned surgery units.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>De Chalain TM.

The aim of this study was to research PHN risk factors and characteristics and to assess treatment’s strategies and tolerability.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Retrospective study included all patients consulted in pain management center for PHN from January 2005 to December 2006 in Reims hospital.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pain management center in a teaching hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> From the medical records, a report sheet was set up with the following items: risk factors (age, pathologies and associated treatment, zoster localisation and treatment in critical phase, pain description), treatments chronology and tolerability.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 15 of 352 patients who have been treated in pain management center since 2 years suffered from PHN. The average age is 72 years old. Main pain were intercostal, continuous and paroxystic. Autoimmune diseases were associated for 6/15 patients. Bi-therapy is generally adopted in first line: anticonvulsants are used in continuous pain and tricyclics antidepressants in paroxystic pain. Gabapentine and now pregabline are indicated in both cases. Previous treatment (before pain consultation): most of them (7/15) had profited from two different molecules, gabapentine most often, then amitryptiline and clonazepam. Others treatments are put in place in pain management center: lidocaine patches (13/15), Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) (5/15), cryotherapy (2/15) or others molecules such as carbamazepine and oxcarbamazepine (2/15). Topical treatment with lidocaine patch is of benefit in many patients, while TENS and cryotherapy may be effective in some cases but often temporary. The study could not show superiority of efficiency between molecules. Treatment tolerability depends on the drugs used: Amitriptyline is the less best tolerated because of drowsiness and weight gain while gabapentine is well tolered. Two patients had developed irritated skin to patches’ glue and one patient to TENS electrodes. Reasons of treatment cessation were firstly inefficiency and secondly bad tolerability.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> No risk factors could be proposed in this study. PHN management appears very complex, because each drug offer variable levels of efficiency or tolerance and depend on the patient. A better comprehension of the pain would make it possible to better apprehend it. Also, after this study, an informative card was written and will be filled out during each consultation pain.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec291"><title>PC-82 Development of a pharmacist-managed cardiovascular risk reduction clinic</title><sec id="Sec292"><title><bold>Chantal Pharand</bold><sup>1</sup>, Jean G.

Around 80% of all patients evaluated in cardiology at our center present 2–4 risk factors and 50–60% of patients do not reach target values in terms of their lipid profile. Our objective was to develop a risk reduction clinic that would improve attainment of target values for 6 risk factors: dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> All patients discharged with acute coronary syndrome are referred to the clinic. The first visit is planned about 4 weeks after the post-discharge visit with a cardiologist, which should occur 2 months after discharge.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Outpatient cardiology clinic, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The main objective of this clinic is to inform patients and general practitioners of the patient risk and treatment objectives, as well as to help them reach these goals. Our clinic is composed of a cardiologist, a pharmacist, and a nurse. When needed, we refer patients to a nutritionist, an endocrinologist, a smoking cessation program, or a specialised fitness center.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> In anticipation of visits to a cardiologist and the risk reduction clinic, blood is drawn to assess lipid profile, glycemia, A1c, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine 6 weeks after discharge. At the initial clinic visit, patients meet the clinic cardiologist and pharmacist together, who evaluate risk factors, decide on treatment goals, initiate a treatment plan, and schedule a follow-up visit. At follow-up visits, patients meet only with the pharmacist, who is responsible for monitoring therapy and adjusting the medications in order to reach the established goals, based on treatment protocols approved by the institution. The nurse insures that all appointments are taken and answers patient calls. A combined cardiologist/pharmacist visit is planned once a year.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> A risk reduction clinic was developed to address a lack in our patient management system resulting in many patients not being treated to target. Patient visit to our clinic should result in an optimization of their therapy and hopefully a reduction in cardiovascular events.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Risk factors, Outpatient clinic, Pharmaceutical care</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec294"><title>PC-85 Determining lay attitudes on the prescribing of medicines for dementia</title><sec id="Sec295"><title><bold>Denise Taylor</bold><sup>1</sup>, Marjorie C. Weiss<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec296"><title><sup>1</sup>Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Many people will hold a belief about how medication may affect their medical condition [1]. For people diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease NICE [2] has suggested that a cessation point of treatment is agreed between the patient, carer and prescriber, before prescribing commences. In 2004 the Alzheimer Society [3], reported that carers of people taking antidementia agents described the positive effects of these medicines as: “seems brighter/happier/more aware/more active” to “calmer/less aggressive.” The end points of successful treatment seem at odds with those proposed by NICE [2]. It is therefore important to explore lay perspectives of medicines for dementia.</p><p>The aim of this research was to explore attitudes and concerns about medicines prescribed for dementia held by people who take these medicines and their carers. The objectives were to explore issues around compliance, decision-making; perceived efficacy, stopping treatment and provision of information.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> MREC approval was attained for a muliticentred qualitative study inviting people taking antidementia agents and their carer to either a focus group or semistructured interview.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Four Alzheimer’s Society branches in South West England.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Exploring attitudes and viewpoints of the prescribing and efficacy of medicines for dementia.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Three focus groups (<italic>n</italic> = 18 participants) and 11 semi-structured interviews were completed.

The redesign of the service was to deliver a more effective and patient-centered service. The pharmacy staff on the ward became part of a multidisciplinary care team [1]. This project was to validate and compare hospital clinical pharmacy inpatient process maps of services and characterise ward prescribing and pharmaceutical care activity using a defined set of parameters [1].</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Descriptive cohort study. Comparison of process maps across ward-based services in seven different clinical settings [2, 3].</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Two groups of 94 patients were recruited for the survey of prescribing activity and generation of the pharmaceutical care profile.

The total number of courses prescribed was 799; the mean (SD) number of courses was 8.5 (3.5) per patient, and 81% of all daily prescriptions were newly prescribed.</p><p>For the pharmaceutical care profile the patients (38% male) had mean (SD, range) age 60 (20, 14–92) years were recruited. The total number of care issues was 185; the mean (SD) was 2.3 (1.4) per patient representing 0.27 care issues per estimated course. Of the total care issues, 42 (22.7%) were recorded as checks and 143 (77.3%) were recorded as changes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The characterisation of the acute receiving ward has highlighted differences in the service provided from other wards featured in the ‘medicines management’ redesign; in particular the high prescription activity. The total level of activity required for the pharmacist at the acute receiving ward is much greater due to the high patient turnover. However the delivery of pharmaceutical care in terms of care activities per patient was comparable to that in other clinical settings.

The guidelines which were prepared by the rheumatology clinic pharmacist were divided into two parts, reconstitution protocol and administration and monitoring protocol. The reconstitution protocol offered a stepwise guide to reconstitution of the drug. The administration and monitoring protocol offered a stepwise approach to the calculation of the dose and the monitoring of the patient, before, during and after the infliximab therapy. The guidelines incorporated a documentation sheet of the dose and the monitoring parameters together with signatures of the respective health care professional carrying out the reconstitution and the monitoring of the patient.

All members of the team prescribe etanercept as first line TNF inhibitor and infliximab to patients who are intolerant to etanercept or in whom there is no adequate response to etanercept therapy. They prescribe methotrexate where possible in conjunction with either TNF inhibitor. Two prescribers (40%) request a purified tuberculin skin test (PPD) and a chest X-ray prior to starting treatment with a TNF inhibitor. Three prescribers (60%) did not carry out the PPD test on the basis that patients eligible for TNF inhibitors are failed methotrexate users for whom a PPD test would already have been carried out. A disease activity score, ESR, early morning stiffness, pain score and global assessment are carried out at baseline and during visits to the clinic by all practitioners. The pharmacist carries out a Health Assessment Questionnaire at baseline and at each visit to the clinic. Patients are screened by the nurse specialist prior to the administration of a TNF inhibitor. Where necessary, in the case of adverse reactions to TNF inhibitors patients are prescribed an antihistamine and a steroid prior to the administration of the TNF inhibitor and where appropriate the rate of infusion is slowed down.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Prescribers tend to follow strictly the local protocol for prescribing a TNF inhibitor.

A Regional law has identified the Prescribing Centres. Recent rules established that deferoxamine and deferiprone, according to their classification, are distributed respectively by Territorial and Hospital Pharmacies. Since 1996, new medical devices have developed, such as vertical needles and special filters for subcutaneous infusions, but their distribution is not scheduled in any law.</p><p>In ASL NA 1 there is only one Centre of distribution for infusion pumps, while needles and materials for medication are withdrawn in one of the 10 Territorial Pharmacies.

CP practice guidance issued following reclassification of simvastatin requires a limited risk assessment before over-the-counter (OTC) simvastatin sale [2]. The objective of this study was to determine the opinions of general medical practitioners (GPs) in Scotland toward the role of the CPs in the process of CVD risk assessment.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A prepiloted postal questionnaire was sent to all primary care medical practices in Scotland (1010, excluding 40 pilot practices) during the winter of 2005. The questionnaire was directed to a senior GP or one with a special interest in cardiovascular medicine (CVM). Grampian Research Ethics Committee advised that NHS ethical approval was unnecessary.

Only 11.5% (53) indicated a CP had referred a patient for full CVD risk assessment. Concerning GP-CP communication; only 9.1% (42) had discussed the general management of CVD risk assessment and lipid lowering therapy, 9.1% (42) sharing cholesterol test results and 9.5% (44) local policies for referral for a full CVD risk assessment. Two-thirds (62.6%, 289) disagreed that ‘CPs should have access to information in the medical records to allow them to assess CVD risk’. In contrast, 86.8% (401) felt CPs should inform GPs of the results of any pharmacy based risk assessment. GPs however did believe that CPs should be involved in monitoring; blood pressure, 61.0% (282), cholesterol, 70.8% (327), ADRs/drug interactions 83.3% (385) and compliance 75.5% (349).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> CPs are encouraged to discuss local CVD risk assessment policies with GPs [2] but our results show that such discussion is not widespread. GPs responding agreed that CPs should do monitoring of patients on OTC simvastatin. CVD risk assessment and monitoring needs access to information in medical records.

The questionnaire, which included a letter outlining the study, and a freepost envelope was to be passed to a senior GP or one with a special interest in cardiovascular medicine (CVM).</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Primary care medical practices in Scotland.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> GPs’ awareness and views of appropriateness of licenced indications, dose, cost and required tests for supply of OTC simvastatin; experiences with OTC simvastatin; and demographics.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The response rate was 45.7% (462/1010). Most were male (66.7%). 60% had been a GP for 16 years or more. 34.0% (157) indicated a special interest in CVM. Most (428, 92.6%) were aware of the licensed indication for OTC simvastatin; 55.6% (257) felt it inappropriate. 85.3% (394) were aware of the OTC licensed dose; 46.3% (214) felt it inappropriate. A third (33.1%, 153) were aware of the cost. 45.2% (209) were aware that cholesterol and 34.8% (161) blood pressure (BP) measurement is not required prior to OTC sale. Many felt this inappropriate; cholesterol, 56.7% (262,111 missing), BP 57.8% (267,109 missing). Few GPs (7.8%, 36) had encountered patients on OTC simvastatin; the majority (95.9%, 443) had never recommended purchase. 31.8% (147) indicated an increase in patient demand for statins.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> GPs showed high awareness of but low support for OTC simvastatin and low awareness that no full cardiovascular risk assessment is required, reflecting previous concerns [1, 2]. Few had patients using OTC simvastatin or had recommended it. GPs had perceived increased demand for statins which may reflect general advertising. Some GPs indicated awareness of aspects of OTC simvastatin supply but did not give a view on appropriateness.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Editorial.

This activity has increased since 2003, so we evaluated it more precisely. Considering technical constraints (isolator without fridge, no fax in the sector) and time constraints (sterilization and randomisation times can’t be reduced), we propose measures to improve our efficiency.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Qualitative and quantitative analysis of aseptic preparations considering activity report since 4 years and using a report sheet during 2 months: June and July 2006.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pharmacy of Lapeyronie-Arnaud de Villeneuve teaching hospital, Montpellier, France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Characteristics of the clinical trials and of the drugs involved in aseptic preparations and evolution of this activity (number, preparation time).</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 420 aseptic preparations of IMP have been realized in 2003 and 506 in 2006 (20% more). In 2006, 15 phase III trials promoted by pharmaceutical companies generate 16 aseptic preparations concerning rheumatology (12 trials in rheumatoid arthritis, 64% patients), Nephrology (1 trial in post-graft immunosuppressive therapy, 4% patients) and Haematology (2 trials in malignancies, 32% patients).</p><p>5 of the 8 IMP prepared are monoclonal antibodies, 2 are proteins, 1 is a small molecule. 3 drugs are administered subcutaneously and 5 intravenously. All the drugs except one must be stored in a fridge (5) or in a freezer (2), which prevents advanced sterilization, since there’s no fridge in our isolator. Post reconstitution stability ranges from 2 to 72 h but randomization process must be done after patient examination so, even for long-term stable drugs, preparation can’t be anticipated, which is a second technical constraint.</p><p>During the 2 months analysis, 82 preparations were realized (Mean/day: 1.95, 2 h work): 77% in rheumatology, 18% in haematology, 5% in nephrology. Mean time between prescription reception and drug delivery is 1 h 40, including 45 min sterilisation and 10 min IVRS randomisation in 55% of cases. Double control, effective in 77% cases, needs 1 h more work per day.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Most aseptic preparations concern rheumatology trials. To improve the safety of our work, double control must be generalised thanks to a better staff planning management. To reduce the delay of preparation and the patient expectation, we propose several measures:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Installation of a small fridge in the isolator</p></list-item><list-item><p>Installation of a new sterilisation system needing only 25 min</p></list-item><list-item><p>Acquisition of a fax to receive directly the prescription in the sector</p></list-item></list></p><p>Limiting constraints will allow us to take in charge the preparations more fastly and to improve our efficiency.</p><p><bold>Keyword</bold> Investigational drugs preparation</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec321"><title>PC-126 Evaluation of an assessment tool for adherence to medication guideline criteria in cancer pain management</title><sec id="Sec322"><title><bold>Ann Lisbeth Torbergsen</bold><sup>1</sup>, Gro D.

The observed errors have been classified as follows: deteriorated drug errors (including unidentifiable or without unit packaging drugs) (56.1%), omission errors (14.5%), improper dose errors (13.3%), unauthorized drug errors (11.6%), patient identification errors (including pill-box without label) (3.5%), wrong time errors (1.2%). No wrong dosage-form error was observed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Although the recorded error rate is high, in most cases, the consequences wouldn’t be of serious concerned to the patients. However, some of the errors like doses errors (some of them concerning oral anticoagulative treatments) and lack of identification (nurses preparing and those administrating drugs being different) could lead to serious iatrogenesis and worsen the security of drug use process. Unfortunately the checking step during the administration by nurses is not efficient enough, when no unit packaging exists. The literature data show that the DPEs rate is lower when pill-boxes are prepared with an unit dose drug dispensing system (UDDDS) centralized in the pharmacy department and errors detected are corrected before the dispensing step. UDDDS applying a unit dose and a patient-labelled system would contribute to decrease the iatrogenesis risk. This short study could confirm the pharmacist role in preventing iatrogenesis.

We report a case of an elderly patient who presented with AVK excess in relation with behavioural troubles, resulting in acute spinal subdural haemorrhage (SSH).</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Case report.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Neurosurgery department.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Follow-up of the patient’s state and clinical assessment.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A 78 year-old woman was admitted because of recurrent falls with temporospatial disorientation and difficulties ambulating after her son’s suicide a few days earlier. Past medical history included valvular prosthesis requiring previscian for 8 years. On examination, there was confused with slowed thought process. The INR was five and cerebral CT-scan showed subarachnoid haemorrhage. AVK was then replaced by heparin. Progressively the patient developed partial motor deficit of the inferior limbs. A first neurosurgical opinion was required in the absence of clinical amelioration but no surgery was hold. The deficit worsened and a MR scan confirmed the diagnosis of SSH and require an emergency decompressive surgery, performed in an another neurosurgical department. The clinical state, first improved, worsened 2 weeks later because of anaemia (resulting of an ulcer). Secondary ischemic cerebral vascular injury (related to anaemia) is resolved with blood transfusion. Ten months later, the patient still presented complete sensitivomotor paraplegia.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> This case recalls that anticoagulative treatments, even when supervised, have many bleeding risks and must be closely monitored during some more delicate periods, as the initiation period of treatment or the change in the drug therapy consecutive of an intercurrent disease. In this case report, AVK excess (probably resulting from taking the wrong dose of AVK tablets) may be related to the attention troubles. The resulting SSH is difficult to treat especially because it is a rare pathology, difficult to diagnosis and without treatment’s guidelines. For the elderly, a more frequent INR follow-up should be advised to avoid iatrogenesis.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Domenicucci M, Ramieri A, et al.

Practice nurses play a major role in the management of respiratory disease in primary care. Although an assessment tool is used to support inhaler device selection in hospitalised patients, it seems that no such tool exists for use by nurses in the community setting.

Repeat prescribing in primary care allows patients with chronic diseases to collect prescriptions every 56 days without medical review although review must be undertaken annually. Repeat prescribing accounts for approximately 75% of prescriptions. National standards exist to promote safe and efficient repeat prescribing systems [2]. The study aimed to define the patient pathway through the system in one medical practice and identify medicines management processes that could be improved with the aim of reducing medicines waste.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Observation of staff procedures mapped the process. Medical records for the previous year were reviewed for 81 patients (Group A, &lt; 65, <italic>n</italic> = 41; Group B, &gt; 65, <italic>n</italic> = 40) randomly selected from the disease register for ischaemic heart disease.

This was the preferred method of ordering reported by 18/39 (46%) patients. Medicine supplies were synchronised within 2 days for 95% of patients in group A and 78% in group B (overall 86%, target = 90%). Most patients (69%) were aware of the 48 h notice policy for ordering prescriptions. Overall 56 (69%, target = 90%) of patients ordered medicines to the set timescale (64% group A, 74% group B). Overall 36 (44%, target = 90%) had their medicines recorded as reviewed within one year (54% group A, 35% group B). Of the 39 (48% response rate) questionnaire respondents, 16 (41%) reported having received a review within the last year.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The repeat prescription ordering process did not adhere to national guidance and should be reviewed. Synchronisation of medicines was not identified as a problem but there is need to improve the frequency and/or recording of medication review. Implementation of the Chronic Medication Service section of the New Community Pharmacy Contract has the potential to improve performance against these standards and reduce waste generation.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The Scottish Executive.

A key development, following the review has been the pilot implementation of a newly designed insulin prescription/administration chart supported by prescribing and administration guidelines. The objective was to assess adherence to NHS Lanarkshire (NHSL) Insulin Prescribing and Administration Guidelines following the pilot implementation of a newly designed insulin prescription/administration chart.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Staff training for the use of the new chart was provided by clinical pharmacists, diabetes specialist nurses and diabetologists prior to the pilot. A 2 weeks insulin chart/medicine cardex audit was then carried out by pharmacists, assessing all aspects of the prescription and administration of subcutaneous insulin as specified in the NHSL Insulin Prescribing and Administration Guidelines. All patients prescribed subcutaneous insulin in designated wards were included in the audit. The audit standard set for this study was 100% compliance with the guidelines.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> The audit was carried out in designated wards across all three acute hospital sites within NHSL. The wards included three medical/diabetic wards and a surgical ward.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> It was demonstrated that 100% compliance with the guidelines was not achieved across all three acute hospital sites. This highlighted that further education and training for nursing and medical staff was essential to improve the prescription and administration of subcutaneous insulin.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A total of 22 in-patients were included in the audit. The charts were checked on 93 occasions on all designated wards during the audit. Results for each question in the audit schedule (18 in total) were ranked in order of percentage compliance with the guidance. Results were analysed and compared according to ward and hospital site. Following a multidisciplinary meeting after data collection, agreed action points were assigned to those outcomes ranked as highest priority to improve patient safety.

Peritonitis was nosocomial in 5 cases. Two patients, with community-acquired secondary peritonitis, died within hospitalization. Peri-operative intra-abdominal samples were noted for 9 patients (all positive). The median number of bacterial species isolated per patient was 2 (range 1–5). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. were the most common species isolated (respectively for 5/9 and 3/9 patients). Sixteen blood cultures were noted (all negative). The median duration of hospital stay was 17 days (range: 7–42 days).</p><p>Peri-operative empirical antimicrobial treatment was initiated in 22 patients. Ten different regimens were used and they contained 2 or 3 agents. Most of the patients (6/22) received ticarcillin/clavulanic acid with an aminoglycoside and metronidazole. During the post-operative period, all patients received antimicrobial agents. This treatment was modified for 6 of 23 patients between the peri and post-operative periods.

The mean duration of antimicrobial treatment is marketedly longer than that recommended in the French guidelines [1]. In addition, the number of antimicrobial associations used is too high and the association of metronidazole and ticarcilline/clavulanic acid is redundant. This supports the need to develop local recommendations with the different experts (surgeon, microbiologist, infectious disease specialist, pharmacist).</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Société française d’anesthesie et de réanimation.

The posology is two to three tablets of 12.5 mg/day. Following one case of overdose on tianeptine, the drug addictive profile has been examined.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Case study of an addiction to tianeptine and evaluation of the efficacy of the patient’s management.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Department of General Medicine and of Psychiatry at Dijon Remand Centre, France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> A 35 year-old man took fluctuating doses of tianeptine for about 10 years and up to 150 tablets of 12.5 mg of tianeptine per day. He regularly took 30–40 tablets per day for the last 4 years. He doesn’t suffer from depression but has a disabling neurosis. He has no history of addiction to opiates, psychoactive drugs and alcohol. He tried to stop taking tianeptine by himself several times. This lead to anxiety, shaking, abdominal pain and the need to take tianeptine again. The side effect which was associated with the overdose was a mydriasis. The patient did not show any sign of liver and cardiovascular toxicity. A withdrawal protocol which is based on 2 mg of clonazepam at the posology of three times a day has been established. The posology of clonazepam is maintained at 6 mg/day during the whole withdrawal treatment. The aim is to progressively and rapidly reduce the dose of tianeptine. The withdrawal is associated with a daily psychiatric follow-up. The dose of tianeptine has been decreased from 20 to 15, 9, 3 and 0 tablets a day within about ten days. Afterwards, the posology of clonazepam has been progressively decreased. In addition, the patient took some alimemazine to help him to sleep.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The association between tianeptine and clonazepam showed rapid benefits within a few days. The withdrawal signs which were observed when the patient entered the remand centre and before the treatment have considerably decreased. He does not feel anymore the desire to take tianeptine. However, the psychiatric follow-up has to be continued.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The management of the patient has been a success. Even though tianeptine has usually shown to be safe, it would be recommended to avoid prescribing it to patients who are likely to develop a strong addiction to psychoactive drugs.

A number of factors influence prescribing patterns and variations in prescribing rates have been identified.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death world wide. Many risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease. It is now well established that diabetes mellitus is an extremely common disorder in Saudi Arabia. Recently published surveys indicate that nearly one Saudi Arabian in 5 (20%) beyond the age of 30 has diabetes mellitus. A number of large clinical trials have established statins as effective agents in the prevention of both primary and secondary coronary heart disease (CHD). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 1997 recommended aspirin (ASA) therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with DM. This recommendation is partially based on the results of four major clinical trials showing that ASA prophylaxis reduced the risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with DM. Hence, this problem needs urgent study, in sufficient depth, to delineate the factors associated with inappropriate prescribing patterns as a prerequisite for effective and cost-effective intervention strategies. This proposed project attempts to address these concerns.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> This study has three main stages. A cross sectional study to study prescribing patterns of antidiabetic agents, antihypertensive, statins, and antiplatelets that prescribed for diabetic patients. Diabetic patients admitted to accident and emergency have been also evaluated.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Emergency and outpatient clinics of atertiary hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The Number of diabetic patient who require statins and antiplatelets but not taking.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The preliminary results of this ongoing study that include about two million prescriptions have been analyzed. Eight percent were for diabetic patients. Less than 20% are taking antiplatelets and about 15% on statins. More than 1500 case of stroke have been received by accident and emergency department. Seventy percent of these are diabetic or have co-morbid disease such as hypertension. Only 25% are taking aspirin and about 20% taking statins for primary and secondary prevention of stroke.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Although there is overwhelming evidence that patients with diabetes benefit from antiplatelets and LDL-cholesterol lowering with statins, a large number of diabetic patient need the addition of antiplatelets and statins to there medications. Both adopted evidence based guidelines and policies should recommend the use of statins and antiplatelets in the primary prevention of CHD and stoke. Diabetics are highly utilizing health care services. Those patients require special education program designed for the disease and its complications such as cardiovascular diseases and stroke and strategies to prevent these complications.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Diabetes, Prescribing, Statins, Antiplatelets, Aspirin</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec376"><title>PC-223 Pharmaceutical care of COPD patients in a hospital setting</title><sec id="Sec377"><title>Nils Keiner<sup>1</sup>, <bold>Marion Schaefer</bold><sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec378"><title><sup>1</sup>Hospital Pharmacy, HELIOS Klinikum, Erfurt, <sup>2</sup>Clinical Pharmacology, Charite, Berlin, Germany</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> To evaluate a pharmaceutical care programme for COPD patients in a hospital setting including patient education.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Prospective study during hospital stay (average 7.6 days).</p><p>Follow up using a questionnaire 6 months after release form hospital.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Medical admission unit, pneumonological ward, patients in ambulatory care in community pharmacies.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Effects of pharmaceutical care including quality of life, patient knowledge, inhalation technique and reduction of hospital days as well as number of re-admissions.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 105 patients (47 male, 58 female, mean age 69.9, SD 6.6) who had received a structured pharmaceutical care programme including three training sessions with a total of 83 min on average and covering the disease itself, drug therapy, breathing exercises, nutrition and in some cases smoking cessation showed improved scores in a pre-post comparison with regard to knowledge, self management, inhalation techniques and quality of life. Compared with data from a pneumonological ward and all other hospital units the number of hospital days as well as the number of re-admissions were significantly lower for the study population.

The practice of polypharmacy is a concern medically, socially, and economically as well as in terms of morbidity and mortality. In the clinical literature, the incidence of prescribing errors ranges between 0.5% and 18.8%.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A prospective study of all prescriptions in a three-month period (June–August 2003) in a tertiary hospital has been analyzed. The hospital provides both primary and secondary levels of care. Criteria used include frequency of selected prescribed drugs, average number of items per prescription, compliance to the hospital formulary, frequency of prescriptions for antibiotics and parenterals, generic prescribing and diagnosis. All prescribing errors were defined as deviation of the standard prescribing procedures (right patient, right drug, right dose and right duration). All prescribing errors were identified and documented in a special form. The incidence of prescribing errors was calculated by dividing the number of errors identified by the total number of prescriptions. The prescribing patterns and the incidence of prescribing errors were performed for selected specialties or clinics.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> A secondary care Hospital prescriptions.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The incidence of prescribing errors.

Emergency Room (ER) and primary care have the highest number of prescriptions (37.1%). The average number of items per prescription is 2.1. The most prescribed drugs by primary care (25.3% errors), emergency are antibiotics (28.2%), medicine (3.7), ophthalmology (22.3), gynecology (7.8), and pediatrics (17.8). The incidence of prescribing errors was 18.8%. The prescription errors were 13.6% in primary care and 22.3% in emergency department.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Total Prescription errors are related to frequency of prescribing antibiotics. There was a relation between prescribing of antibiotics and prescribing of trade names (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), compliance to the hospital formulary (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), frequency of injection use (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the incidence of medication errors and the average number of items per prescription. Several factors influence prescribing patterns and variations in prescribing rates has been identified. These include general physician behavior, differences in morbidity and mortality patterns, social perception toward illness, and physician clinical skills, experience and qualification, as well as physician continuing education and training.

This is even more important with hospital preparations; their presentation is seldom adapted for outpatients. This study evaluates in an outpatient hospital pharmacy the evolution of dispensing errors concerning the proportion of FLUDROCORTISONE AP-HP 10 g (F10) and 50 g (F50) after a change in presentation. 100 tablets boxes with similar colour for both dosage forms were replaced by 30 tablets boxes with a specific colour for each dosage form. A 30 tablet box was more appropriate to most prescriptions.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Each dispensing error concerning F10 and F50 was filed on a non-conformity form. The study covered the same time period before and after the packaging change. For F50, the survey was conducted over a 24 months period (packaging change on 15/12/05) and over a 14 months period for F10 (packaging change on 17/05/06).</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pharmacy outpatient unit.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Counting dispensing errors of F10 and F50. Statistical interpretation was done by counting the reduced split (Normal distribution) with 5% risk.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> F50: 6 934 deliveries with 18 errors noted before the change (error ratio = 0.26%) and 6 742 deliveries with 1 error noted after the change (error ratio = 0.01%). The decrease was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). F10: 408 deliveries with 15 errors were noted before the change (error ratio = 3.68%) and 415 deliveries with 7 errors after the change (error ratio = 1.69%). The decrease was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Results were more noticeable for F50 than for F10. This might be explained by a higher delivery frequency of the 50 g which encourages the dispensation of this dosage form by habit.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> High significant decrease in medication errors was noted when switching to new dosage forms of F10 and F50. We assume this decrease was due to the colour difference in each packaging. We can also think that dispensing the medicine in boxes instead of blisters contributes to reduce the error risk. We suggest the manufacturer could extend similar policy for other hospital preparations. A more specific package for each drug and each dosage form would certainly reduce delivery errors and enhance the safety of the medicine delivery process.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Fseil A et al.

Studies show that pharmacists take more accurate drug histories than physicians, are more likely to identify drug therapy problems and reduce prescription errors, which may lead to more accurate drug therapy [1]. One way of documenting drug history is to examine patients own drugs. In some countries PODs are used during hospital stay and studies show that their overall quality is very good [2]. Use of PODs also significantly reduce drug wastage and hospital costs [2, 3]. The objectives of this study were to (a) compare drug histories taken by a pharmacist to those taken by physicians; (b) identify and analyze drug therapy problems; (c) examine PODs in relation to their usability during hospital stay.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A cross-sectional design was employed where the researcher took drug histories from patients post-op and compared with those taken by physicians in a preadmission clinic.

During 33 days, 91 medical precriptions were dispensed. There were 28 different protocols: 10 of them contained one drug only. 18 drugs were used and included 374 chemotherapies (11.3 per days). The low and intermediary drug stability represented respectively 17.6% (bortezomib and azacitidine) and 1.6% of the whole chemotherapies. 37.7% of them had to be conserved at a temperature between 2°C and 4°C.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Circuit of injectable cytotoxic drugs is complicated.

Communication with patients, the physical conditions of the pharmacy and reaching the information were not barriers for the pharmacist in providing pharmaceutical care. The participants were divided into two groups: the pharmacist with over 15 years of experience (51.7%) and those with &lt;15 years of experience (48.3%), no difference was found in pharmacists’ point of view about the pharmaceutical care practice according to their professional experiences. 57.4% of participants claimed that they had provided pharmaceutical care services; but in fact they were mainly providing some kind of patient counseling services.

However, French physicians use it as a prescription tool, for which it is not designed for. As a result, information is often lacking as compared to available data in the international literature, when adequately searched for and analyzed. Providing Clinical Pharmacy services at bedside is a crucial help to improve patient care and drugs handling in those patients, even when the pharmacists is not particularly trained or experienced. Benefits should even be greater with experienced and/or specifically trained senior pharmacists. However, Pharmacy students already provide a significant help, leading to global improvement of patient care.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Pharmaceutical interventions, Renal insufficiency, Drug–drug interactions</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec424"><title>PC-278 Treatment of recurrent sinusal papillomatosis with intravenous cidofovir (Vistide<sup>®</sup>)</title><sec id="Sec425"><title><bold>Alexandre Cariou</bold><sup>1</sup>, Eugenie E.

The standard of care is surgical excision of the lesions. The effectiveness of intralesional injections of cidofovir has been investigated in the off-label use in various studies since 1995.

After the failure of a cidofovir aerosoltherapy he underwent a bilateral excision of nasal papillomas with a septum excision. Nevertheless, in January 2006 an evolutive relapse of the papillomatosis with encephalic extension has been diagnosed. Then it was decided to treat the patient with surgical conservative measures and cidofovir both intralesional and intravenous. From July 2006, according to literature data on laryngeal papillomatosis, he received 6 courses of treatment with intravenous cidofovir, 5 mg/kg/j, in conjunction with probenecid in order to diminish nephrotoxicity (creatinine clearance ranged from 100 to 90 ml/mn).

Pharmacists also think CPGs facilitate collaboration with GPs and improve quality of care and services.</p><p>Majority of Serbian GPs and pharmacists think there is no reason why CPGs should not be implemented. However GPs would not follow CPGs because they exclude possibility of individual approach towards the patients and because some of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are not available to them. They also fear of their creativity being limited and because the CPGs are not in line with their experience and current practice. Pharmacist observed that available CPGs are more for general practitioners than for themselves, and are not precise or they recommend non registered medicines.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The strong support for the utilisation of CPGs was found among Serbian general practitioners and pharmacists.

Furthermore, drug interactions in oncology are at particular importance owing to the narrow therapeutic index and the inherent toxicity of anticancer agents. Unfortunately, limited data exist on their frequency and clinical consequences. The aim of this study was to identify the nature and frequency of drug interactions related to chemotherapy in cancer patients admitted to oncology and pneumology clinical wards and to define recommendations to prescribers in order to optimize and individualize chemotherapy. Only unadvised associations and contraindications were communicated to prescribers.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> 487 computerized prescriptions of cancer patients hospitalized in oncology unit (10 beds) and pneumology unit (35 beds) were reviewed (February 2006 to January 2007).

Both health care professionals and patients make medication errors. Pharmacist is an expert on medication properties and is mainly the last health care professional who deals with drugs before their administration to the patient. He or she can identify any errors in pharmacotherapy of certain patient. To prevent medication errors effectively it is necessary to identify, record and notice the cause’s of errors. The target of a study was to prepare and test reporting system which will serve to record medication errors identified by pharmacists in Czech pharmacies.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Pharmacists identify and record all medication errors in a web questionnaire during their dispensing activities in the pharmacy. The pharmacists collect following pieces of information: types and causes of errors, pharmacist’s interventions, patient details, drugs and time concerning errors and subjects making errors.

Most of the categories of medication errors are evaluated as for example: indications of drugs, duplications of therapy, dosages of drugs, names of drugs, strengths of drugs, dosage forms and routes of administration of drugs. During a four-month period 40 pharmacists registered on this web site and recorded identified medication errors. 17 of them worked in the hospital pharmacy and 23 of them in the community pharmacy. There are 7236 pharmacists in the Czech Republic (year 2006).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> It seems that this reporting system of medication errors is good way of recording.

No drugs were detected in blood in 25/80 patients (45%), and in urine in 28/50 patients (56%). Licit drugs (60%), or ethanol (20%) and opioids (26%) were the compounds the most frequently detected. For 15% of patients identification of several compounds were observed. Ethanol concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 4 g/l. For pharmaceuticals, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, meprobamate and antidepressants (3%) were respectively found in 50%, 7%, 4% and 3% of the patients. Drugs of abuse were detected in 20/50 cases (40%) mainly cannabis (18%) and opioids (26%). Positive results for opioids and benzodiazepines could be explained by sufentanil and midazolam administration before admission.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Our results showed that the identified substances were not involved in the trauma.

The period studied was 2000–2005. We used national level wholesale data from Estonia and published drug utilisation data of Nordic countries for time-trend and international comparison.

The use of atypical antipsychotics rose 6.5 times during the same period and this subgroup counted for 20% in total use by the end of 2005. The corresponding proportion of atypicals in the Nordic countries was 50–60%.</p><p>The total wholesale value of antipsychotic group increased 2 times and the increase was solely determined by the increase in atypical segment, which counted for 60% of total value in 2005. Considering the utilisation comparison with the Nordic countries, this expenditure is expected to further increase 2–3 times.</p><p>Health Insurance data indicated that the introduction of new drugs has not affected the total patient numbers receiving the reimbursed antipsychotics. The proportion of patients getting the atypical antipsychotics had reached 40 by 2005, a result somewhat contradictory to the national level wholesale analysis and indicating the use in practice of doses lower than the DDD.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The change in antipsychotic therapy in Estonia resembles that of developed European countries, but happens considerably later. Introduction of atypical agents has not increased the total use of antipsychotics, but has had a considerable impact on treatment costs.

Each patient was observing himself.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Urology and Nephrology units, University hospital of Besançon.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Costs differences between the four approaches studied were analyzed.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Data was collected from 77 patients. The average duration of hospital stay was 19.4 days. Mean cost of renal transplant valued through the analytic accounting system of our hospital is 14,100 €. A significant difference was observed between our cost price and the other national valuation methods. Costs valued through these other approaches were significantly higher: 16,389 € (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025) through DRG hospital cost databases, 16,114 € (<italic>P</italic> = 0.033) when we readjusted to actual length of hospital stay and 17,369 € (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>) through official rates from the new French DRG prospective payment system. There was no significant difference between mean costs of each national methods and official rates.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Specific rate for kidney transplant through the new French DRG prospective payment system covers the committed expenditure by our hospital. These results are interesting, but in opposition to the management of other pathologies, especially in haematology. For acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), all the national valuation methods and official rates resulted in a two- to four-fold underestimation of local costs [3]. Finally, we have to consider this new French DRG prospective hospital payment system and the hospital budget as a whole, to take into account balancing between favourable and unfavourable DRG rates.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Am J Kidney Dis 2003;42(6):1228–38.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pharmacoeconomics 2004;22(18):1217–34.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bull Cancer 2006;93(8):13–9.</p></list-item></list></p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Kidney transplantation, Valuation, Hospital costs</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec469"><title>PEC-199 Should we still wash our incontinent patients?

The present prospective study was set up (1) to compare the efficacy and safety advantages of three no-rinse multifunctional cleansing foams over soap and water, (2) to calculate, by means of a microcost analysis, if they were cheaper care alternatives and (3) to evaluate satisfaction of both patients and nurses.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Four groups of 10 bedridden patients with either urinary, faecal or dual incontinence were randomly assigned to either a standard care regimen (soap and water cleansing) or one of three skin cleansing mousses: Abena, Menalind and Tena. Patients were treated with a single product container, for circa 10 days. Forty-three registered nurses participated according to a care protocol strictly standardized.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Rehabilitation and geriatric long-term wards in a teaching general hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The number of incontinence episodes, their type of soilings, degree of effort to care and time duration were recorded. On every care occurrence, the nurse was also required to score on subjective 5-point Likert’s scales the cleansing quality, safety, degree of skin hydration, ease of use and time gain as well as patient’s satisfaction. Problematic skin conditions were recorded. Statistical comparisons were made with Kruskall–Wallis non parametric tests. A microcost analysis was performed using a 15-years seniority nurse basic pay and official purchase prices of products.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The standard protocol was definitely more time-consuming, less efficient for washing and for moisturizing and less safe for preserving a skin functional status. It was less easy and less appreciated by the patient than foam cleansing (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The latter technique was also lower in cost, with a gain ranging from 1.0 to 1.8 euro per care occurrence, i.e. sparing between 22813 and 41063 euros per year in a 25-bed rehabilitation ward with half of the patients being incontinent. Ward nursing time saving amounted to 3 h/day. Selecting one foam for daily routine was not straightforward as they were globally comparable, with a slight preference for Tena.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Replacement of soap and water washing by foam cleansing should be recommended because it (1) reduces health care costs, (2) positively influences psychological and physiological aspects of incontinent, often bedridden, patients’ quality of life and (3) facilitates the caregiver’s work.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Washing foam, Pressure ulcer, Incontinence</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec472"><title>PEC-255 Therapeutic and economic differences in prescriptions for hypertension: a study from a community pharmacy</title><sec id="Sec757"><title>Görkem Sunal<sup>1</sup>, Rümeysa Demirdamar<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec758"><title><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Near East University, Lefkosa, TRCyprus</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Depending on the institution the prescriptions are obtained, and the insurance system the patient is covered by, there are differences in the medication in prescriptions.</p><p>The aim of our study was to investigate these differences and evaluate in terms of the cost of each prescription versus the outcomes of the patient in Hypertension Patients in a Community Pharmacy.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> In Turkey there are four insurance systems that cover health and medical expenses.

These annual savings per patient, was found to be roughly equivalent to the cost of a diabetic patient’s 1 month medication (of diabetes and the comorbid conditions) supply for the INS group, while it was equivalent to the cost of 2 months medication (of diabetes and the comorbid conditions) supply for the no-INS group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> While a generic substitution-based reimbursement system can reduce the medication costs; the bio-equivalency of some specific drugs should be ensured and the patients should be educated on the generic drug concept.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec476"><title>PEC-281 Economic evaluation advancement in pharmacy: discrete choice experiments (DCEs)</title><sec id="Sec477"><title><bold>Michela Tinelli</bold><sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec478"><title><sup>1</sup>General Practice and Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) [1] are an attribute-based technique to elicit preferences. When a price proxy is included, willingness to pay (WTP) can be estimated for both marginal changes in service characteristics and changes in the overall service. The last 15 years has seen an increased use of DCEs in health care [1], with more recent applications in pharmacy [2].

These strategies can both influence the quality of prescribing and the quality of medication usage. Drug formularies (standard lists with affordable, safe and active medicines for the most frequently occurring diseases) are not widely implemented in NHs, despite their long use and acceptation in hospital settings. They can theoretically increase the quality of prescribing and reduce costs of drug therapy, however studies evaluating their efficacy are lacking. The use of a Computerised Physician Order Entry-system (CPOE) equipped with a Clinical Decision Support module also is a powerful tool to prevent medication errors and is already successfully implemented in hospital settings. Studies in NHs agreed that CPOE is a promising technology that may be very useful. Pharmacist involvement (mainly medication reviews) and multidisciplinary approaches are more common, especially in the United States, where they have proven to be very effective, both on medication costs and quality of the medication usage.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Despite promising strategies, the quality of medication use in NHs still needs to be improved.

Recently, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a detailed alert stating that chemotherapy drugs are carcinogenic and despite current safety provisions they still pose a risk to nurses, pharmacists and others handling them. Teva Medical developed a new containment system, Tevadaptor, for the safe handling of hazardous drugs. It was designed to prevent the ingress of environmental contaminants into drug containers, and the spread of hazardous drugs (solid, liquid, aerosol or vapour) into the environment.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Laboratory tests were performed evaluating the safety and efficiency of Tevadaptor in Israel and Sweden.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Laboratory and environmental testing was performed by Analyst laboratories, Israel using LC/MS/MS. Sterility testing was performed by Aminolab, Israel. Environmental contamination was determined using a Tc99 radioactive tracer at Norrlands Universitetssjukhus, Umeå, Sweden.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The device was tested for sterility maintenance and its ability to prevent the spread of hazardous drugs into the environment.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Vial and bag sterility maintenance demonstrated solution sterility for at least 14 days. 12 Tevadaptor vial adaptors were challenged with cyclophosphamide vapour by passing 90 l of nitrogen through a cyclophosphamide containing vial equipped with a Tevadaptor; at a rate of 0.5 l/min. Tevadaptor units were tested after three differing sterilization conditions. In two control units without filtration systems, there was a passage of 28 and 32 ng of cyclophosphamide/90 l of nitrogen, whilst in all the Tevadaptor test units there was zero passage of cyclophosphamide. 75 Tevadaptors were used in an environmental contamination test. Vial contents were spiked with Tc99 for radioactive analysis of possible liquid spill. Used gloves and pads were wiped and tested for radioactivity using scintillation counting. All units were within the local standard of 100 nl per preparation (1 drop equals 50,000 nl).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The results indicate that Tevadaptor achieves its stated aims. A combination of a unique vented containment system together with an innovative connect/disconnect mechanism makes for a safe and user-friendly system; conducive to high user compliance.

Amongst six cigarette package warnings, “Cigarette smoke causes lung cancer” and “Smoking leads to COPD death” might be the most effective labels for reducing and/or quitting smoking. On the other hand, “Smoking makes you look older” might be the least effective. Most respondents suggested that demonstrating the dangers of smoking and using more terrible/disgusting pictures might increase the success of smoking cessation campaign. Moreover, 60.3% advised that information on how to quit smoking should be available on the package.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The prevent study demonstrated that the current cigarette package warning have some effects on behaviours and attitudes of smoking students.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>World Health Organization.

Neurotoxicity in transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus has been well documented. The most common symptoms of neurotoxicity associated with tacrolimus include tremor, headache, insomnia, hyperesthesias, and itching, also severe neurologic complications including seizures, coma, dysarthria, and encephalopathy, have been reported. We report a case of cerebellar ataxia induced by tacrolimus in a stem cell allograft recipient.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Case report.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Grenoble University Hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> A 54 year-old allograft recipient for follicular lymphoma received cyclosporine and mycophenolic acid for immunosuppression. Five weeks later, he presented tremor which was reversible upon discontinuing cyclosporine and he then started tacrolimus. Thirteen days later, he presented cerebellar ataxia with an unsteady walk and balance. Laboratory findings were normal (negatives tests results for Toxoplasmosis, Cytomegalovirus, Epsteinbarr virus, Cryptocococcus, Aspergillus, Rickettsis and Koch Bacillus). Computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. Tacrolimus was discontinued. His symptoms improved over the next ten days. He was then only treated by mycophenolic acid.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> We report a reversible cerebellar ataxia induced by tacrolimus in a stem cell allograft recipient. Neurotoxicity like tremors has been also reported with cyclosporine. These neurological complications are usually reversible after withdrawal of cyclosporine. The endothelial damage caused by cyclosporine may contribute to ischemia in the brain. The mechanism of tacrolimus induced neurotoxicity still remains unknown. It has been suggested that high levels of tacrolimus may contribute to drug-associated neurotoxicity. However, in our case tacrolimus levels were within the normal range. Surprisingly, brain MRI did not show abnormal signals as in a case previously reported of subacute cerebellar ataxia related to tacrolimus.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Physicians should be aware of potential neurotoxicity of tacrolimus even if MRI of the brain and tacrolimus level are normal. In our case, the patient presented symptoms with both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. We cannot exclude a common mechanism of neurotoxicity. Therefore in case of neurotoxicity with either cyclosporine or tacrolimus, withdrawal of the drug and replacement by the other should be cautious.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Tacrolimus, Neurotoxicity, Cerebellar ataxia</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec509"><title>PEPI-205 Sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest after varicose veins sclerosis with polidocanol: a case report</title><sec id="Sec510"><title><bold>Nathalie Sylvoz</bold><sup>1</sup>, Stéphanie Berthet<sup>1</sup>, Céline Villier<sup>1</sup>, Benoît Allenet<sup>2</sup>, Sylvaine Robin<sup>3</sup>, Michel Mallaret<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec511"><title><sup>1</sup>Regional Pharmacovigilance Center, Grenoble University Hospital, <sup>2</sup>Department of Pharmacy, Grenoble University Hospital, Laboratory ThEMAS TIMC UMR CNRS 5225, Joseph Fourier University, <sup>3</sup>Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble, France</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold></p><p>Polidocanol sclerotherapy is a well-established therapeutic modality for the treatment of varicose veins. This solution is highly valued by clinicians because of its high efficacy and excellent safety profile, which has been documented in large case series and a single randomised controlled trial. Systemic adverse effects are rare and are represented by allergic reactions and transient neurologic disorders. Feied et al. (1994) have previously reported an incidence of systemic allergic reaction of 0.3%. Some life-threatening reactions such as reversible cardiac arrests have been reported. We report a case of cardiac arrest after a first injection sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Case report.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Grenoble University Hospital; BP 217; 38043 Grenoble, France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> A 48-year-old woman, undergoing sclerotherapy for a symptomatic lower limb varicose, developed a malaise with tetraparesis, 5 min after 2% polidocanol injections (total of 7 ml). Her medical history included De Quervain’s subacute thyroiditis and an atypical thoracic pain a few days before for which she had seen a cardiologist. The patient did not take any medication. Sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest occurred within minutes after the symptoms appeared. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately started and continuously performed for 15 min, before restoration of pulses. Electrocardiogram and echocardiography were performed, which showed a ST-segment elevation and a normal Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) of about 60–70%. Because of a persistent hemodynamic instability, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit, where epinephrine and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation were used without success. Coronarography showed normal coronary arteries but echocardiography monitoring revealed a decrease in LVEF to 20%. The patient was finally connected to an extracorporeal circulation. After five days of intensive therapy, she recovered.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> In the absence of any other obvious etiology, this episode of cardiac arrest should be attributed to polidocanol. Because of the delayed LVEF fall, we suppose a myocardial toxic mechanism rather than an anaphylactic mechanism. As received doses were higher than the authorised doses, we wonder about a dose-dependant toxicity. Initial transient neurological disorders and ST modification suggest a vasospastic mechanism.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Our report describes a rare complication of polidocanol sclerotherapy. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of uncommon but life threatening adverse effects.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Polidocanol, Sclerotherapy, Cardiac arrest</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec512"><title>PEPI-206 Assessment of quality of life—SF-36- in Portuguese hypertensive patients in a community pharmacy survey</title><sec id="Sec513"><title><bold>Esperanca Silva</bold><sup>1</sup>, Margarida Caramona<sup>2</sup>, Rita Figueirinha<sup>3</sup>, Emanuel Ponciano<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec514"><title><sup>1</sup>Community Pharmacy, Farmacia Rocha, <sup>2</sup>Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, <sup>3</sup>Ibili, Faculty of Medicine, Coimbra, Portugal</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> The SF-36 has become one of the most widely used generic measures of subjective health status.

In Argentina there is no National o Institutional Programme to report Medication errors. Our Pharmacy department has recorded medication errors at different stages, and this has proved a challenge as it means also a cultural change in our Institution. These records revealed the need of a multidisciplinary working party approach to achieve better. Objective: To identify and classify paediatric errors develop strategies in order to avoid further occurrence.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Prospective observational study for one year 2004–2005.</p><p>Data collected by 5 pharmacists and reviewed with 3 pediatricians.

Use of brand names and abbreviations were the most frequent type of error. In Argentina the generic name must be used when prescribing, brand names or abbreviations can cause confusion and lead to the wrong drug being administered. Lack of demographic patient data, can make difficult for pharmacists evaluate dosage and nurses administer the wrong drug to wrong patient. The rest of errors were related to lack or wrong instructions on how to give drugs and this can potentially have serious consequences. As a result of this study we designed prescribing guidelines, approved by the hospital Risk Management Committee. Continuous monitoring is done ever since.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Brennan TA, Leape LL, Laird NM, et al.

Previous studies estimate its prevalence around 16% of the population. Said to be effective and well tolerated, antidepressants are more and more prescribed nowadays. Nevertheless, seizure is one of the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment that occurs rarely. We proposed a prospective study to assess the impact of antidepressants prescriptions on seizures appearance.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Prospective study.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Grenoble University Hospital; BP 217-38043 Grenoble Cedex 09, France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> A six-month prospective study was performed in emergency medical service. Patients who came to hospital because of seizure and/or taking antidepressant drug were selected. Medical history, treatment, compliance, alcohol intake, biochemical tests, brain imaging, EEG, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome were investigated.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A total of 8813 patients went to emergency medical service over the 6 months period. 296 of them had taken antidepressants. 114 cases of seizure were documented among which 31 were linked to antidepressants. Our findings showed an excess risk of seizure associated with antidepressants (Odds ratio 11.9; 95% confidence interval 7.75–18.25). Furthermore, in our study, seizures were significantly more frequent with tricyclic antidepressant than with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Moreover, in most of the cases, antidepressants facilitated seizures in patients with other risk factors such as epileptic patients (who correspond to 45% of convulsing patients with antidepressants), patients taking both antidepressant drugs and agents lowering seizure threshold, and those with predisposing factors such as alcohol intake, benzodiazepine withdrawal, acute renal failure and diabetic decompensation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Therefore, all antidepressant agents can lower the seizure threshold. Tricyclic antidepressants would be more frequently associated with a clinical risk of seizure than newer antidepressants. Clinicians should be cautious when prescribing antidepressant in patients with risk factors such as epilepsy, alcoholism, antipsychotic treatment, and should avoid the prescription of two antidepressant drugs at the same time.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Antidepressants, Seizures, Prospective study</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec527"><title>PEPI-263 Evaluation of the quality of the postoperative pain management in the surgical wards of the North Estonia Regional Hospital.</title><sec id="Sec528"><title><bold>Julia Zingel</bold><sup>1</sup>, Valdo Toome<sup>2</sup>, Helen Valk<sup>2</sup>, Jana Lass<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec529"><title><sup>1</sup>Pharmacy Department, <sup>2</sup>Anaesthesiology Department, North Estonia Regional Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> The treatment of acute pain is important in the postoperative period [1] and the provision of safe and effective pain management is a quality issue that addresses the needs and expectations of patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the quality of postoperative pain management in surgical wards by assessing the use of analgesics in the postoperative period in terms of adherence to the WHO Good Pain Management (GPM) standards [2].</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A retrospective audit was carried out on medical records of patients hospitalised onto the surgical wards of North Estonia Regional Hospital (NERH) and had surgery during November 2006.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Postoperative periods (<italic>n</italic> = 243) within urology, orthopaedic and oncology wards of NERH.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Percentage (95% confidence interval [CI]) of adherences to quality criteria of pain management in concordance with WHO GPM standards including: assessment of pain, administration of analgesics, prevention/management of analgesic adverse effects, clinically significant interactions.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Of the postoperative periods identified (<italic>n</italic> = 243), pain was measured by numeric rating scale in the wards 27/243 (11% [CI 7.8, 15.7]). The audit was unable to include 117/243 (48% [CI 42.0, 54.4]) postoperative periods due to various reasons including; poor or incomplete documentation in 29/243 (12% [CI 8.5, 16.6]) in the medical records of the oncological surgery ward; day surgery patients constituted 74/243 (31% [CI 25.0, 36.5]) and were excluded since they provided inadequate follow-up opportunity to make assessment and this group needs a special approach. Some 14/126 cases (11% [CI 6.8, 17.8]) had no record of analgesics being administered during the postoperative period and the further evaluation of the quality of pain management was impossible. The following findings indicated issues requiring to be addressed. Of 126 postoperative periods included in the final analysis, analgesics were administered regularly in 59/126 (47% [CI 38.3, 55.5]), analgesics were administered orally in 53/126 (42% [CI 33.3, 50.8]) although 91/126 (72% [CI 63.8, 79.3]) were able to take oral medicines. While 58/126 (46% [CI 37.6, 54.7]) of patients needed drugs for the management or prevention of adverse effects only 46/58 (79% [CI 67.2, 87.7]) of patients received these drugs.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The audit results indicate a rather low adherence to established GPM criteria and they have highlighted the need for further study. The audit method requires further development to be able to address problems such as incomplete documentation and shortness of stay. The clinical pharmacist has a role in the prospective evaluation of pain management and a prospective approach would enable direct interaction with prescribers as a means of obtaining more accurate information from prescribers themselves.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Kehlet H, Holte K.

In our establishment, we dispose of a nominative prescription and dispensations system for broad spectrum and/or expensive antibiotic, of which is levofloxacin (LEV). A pharmaceutical analysis of prescriptions were done in order to assess the usage pattern of this molecule.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Data were collected during 10 months in 2006, involving 8 medical and chirurgical units.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> A 1900 beds hospital in north of France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Levofloxacin prescription and agreement with our local recommendations.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> We analysed 253 files containing levofloxacin prescriptions for 240 patients.

Theoretical formulas and methods for free drug measurements have been developed and applied without consensus on their overall use and clinical relevance. Our case report illustrates this problem and was the onset of an in depth literature review.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Case report and literature review.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Medical Intensive Care (MICU), University Hospital Leuven, Belgium.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Recommendations for a correct interpretation of total phenytoin and valproate concentrations.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> A 58-year old patient with a complex medical history including peritoneal dialysis developed status epilepticus after surgical repair of a peritoneal leak. He was treated with lorazepam and phenytoin. Valproate was associated as no neurological improvement was seen. Over the next few days an obvious diminished consciousness and rigidity of the four limbs was observed. The neurologists proposed to correct the measured total drug levels of phenytoin and valproate for the patient’s hypoalbuminemia (22.5 g/l) using the Sheiner-Tozer equation (corrected total concentration = observed total concentration/[(0.2 x serum albumin level) + 0.1]) for phenytoin [1] and the equation of Hermida-Tutor(normalized total concentration = free fraction(in accordance with serum albumin of patient) x observed total concentration/6.5) for valproate [2].No free drug serum measurements were available. After calculation the total phenytoin level was 37 instead of 22.2 mg/l which is above the therapeutic range. The corrected total valproate level was 98 instead of 24 mg/l. The symptoms were interpreted as compatible with phenytoin intoxication and phenytoin administration was stopped. Nevertheless there was no improvement of the patient’s neurological state and finally he died.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> A correct interpretation of total phenytoin and valproate serum concentrations is difficult in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, renal failure and other highly protein bound drugs. In order to avoid unnecessary dose adjustments in a vulnerable population as critically ill patients the above mentioned corrections seem to be worth applying. Nevertheless further research is necessary to evaluate whether these corrected total drug levels are better correlated with toxicity and if this approach should become standard of care in therapeutic drug monitoring of these anti-epileptic drugs.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>ME Winter’s Basic Clinical Pharmacokinetics 3rd edition.

On day 21, he was transferred to the MICU because of neutropenic fever and progressive dyspnea due to pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. He was mechanically ventilated and intermittent hemodialysis was started because of acute renal failure. Meropenem 1 g OD was associated for bacteremia with Bacteroides fragilis. A progressively increasing serum Aspergillus antigen test and a CT scan of the chest was compatible with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis for which he was treated with caspofungin 70 mg OD. Last year, a liver biopsy revealed postalcoholic liver cirrhosis, which was classified as Child B9. Upon admission, total bilirubin level was 3.54 mg/dl and AST and ALT were respectively 104 and 140 U/L. As mentioned in the package insert of Cancidas, caspofungin dose should be reduced to 35 mg OD in patients with moderate liver failure due to a substantially higher Cmax and AUC found in this population. However, given the poor prognosis of invasive aspergillosis and good safety profile of caspofungin, it was decided to administer the full dose. Caspofungin plasma levels (trough and peak levels taken on day 13 and 14 of caspofungin therapy) were monitored using HPLC (Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C8 column) followed by UV detection at 215 nm. Trough levels were 3.81 and 3.88 μg/ml, peak levels were 8.01 and 9.07 μg/ml, which are within the expected therapeutic range [1]. Possible explanations for this result are pharmacokinetic alterations caused by critical illness e.g. capillary leak leading to a higher distribution volume or low albumin levels leading to a more rapidly elimination by the kidney or hemodialysis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> In critically ill patients with life-threatening invasive fungal infections, benefits and risks of adjusting caspofungin dose in accordance to chronic liver failure have to be carefully considered.

While the introduction of new antifungals has expanded opportunities for lowering drug toxicity, virtually all antifungal regimens still carry the risk for pharmacokinetic interaction.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> This paper presents the published data regarding the molecular determinants (enzymes, transporters, orphan nuclear receptors) of systemic triazole antifungals pharmacokinetics in humans, including itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pharmacy Department.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Literature review based on PubMed search.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> All available triazole antifungals are cytochrome P450 substrates to varying degrees, except to the posaconazole which is not metabolized to a significant extent through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The limited metabolism of posaconazole is mediated predominantly through phase 2 biotransformations via UDP Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme pathways. Nevertheless, all these drugs inhibit CYP3A4. This CYP3A4 inhibition seems to be a class effect of the triazoles and is possibly related to a common mechanisms of action. The systemic azoles are inhibitors of CYP isoenzymes (fluconazole and voriconazole versus CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, itraconazole and posaconazole versus CYP3A4). Posaconazole does inhibit only CYP3A4, so a limited spectrum of drug-drug interactions could be expected for posaconazole. Some of these drugs also inhibit activity of other enzymes. Then, UGT inhibition has also been demonstrated with fluconazole. Moreover, some of these drugs are also substrates (itraconazole, fluconazole and posaconazole) and/or inhibitor (itraconazole) of P-glycoprotein, a transport protein which can also be involved in drug-drug interactions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The mechanisms of triazole antifungals interactions regarding the molecular determinants can be divided into three following categories: (i) additive dangerous interactions; (ii) modifications of antifungals kinetics by other drugs; and (iii) modifications of other drugs kinetics by antifungals. These features are the basis for most of the interactions occurring during triazole antifungals therapy (e.g., in severe ill patients in the hospital who are treated with multiple drugs) and could contribute to a more effective prediction of interactions.</p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Antifungal azoles, CYP450, Drug–drug interactions</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec554"><title>PK-246 Bioavailabilities of two ubidecarenone products in korean healthy volunteers</title><sec id="Sec555"><title><bold>Hyesun Gwak</bold><sup>1</sup>, Inkoo Chun<sup>2</sup>, Kyungso Chun<sup>3</sup>, Eunyoung Kang<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec556"><title><sup>1</sup>College of Pharmacy, Ewha Woman University, <sup>2</sup>College of Pharmacy, Dongduk Womens University, <sup>3</sup>Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hanil Hospital, Seoul, South Korea</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> To evaluate the bioavailabilities of two ubidecarenone (CoQ10) products using healthy volunteers, which are being marketed in Korea, and compare them with their dissolution profiles.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Parallel study design for pharmacokinetic study and repeated ANOVA test for comparing the intrinsic CoQ10 levels for 3 days between groups.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Department of Laboratory Medicine in a Korean Hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Pharmacokinetic parameters and dissolution profiles of two CoQ10 products by a validated analytical method.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Chromatographic peaks of CoQ10 and IS were well-resolved at 6.8 and 5.3 min.

Their average length of stay was 22.1 ± 24.9 days (range: 7–56 days) during which the patients received an average of 4.7 ± 6.6 doses of rhEPO. However, at admission, 8 patients (12.7%) were not receiving rhEPO while a further 37 patients (58.7%) were found to have not received or were receiving inadequate iron supplementation (i.e., &lt;200 mg/day of elemental iron) despite being regular recipients of rhEPO. The majority of patients received subcutaneous EPO-beta at a median dose of 4000 units/week. Mean increases in Hb and Hct levels between baseline and end of the study period were 0.5 ± 1.3 g/dl and 1.3 ± 2.1%, respectively.

Except for inhibition of gastric acid secretion, the mechanism is not well understood. So we examined the effects of three PPIs (omeprazole (OME), lansoprazole (LAN) and rabeprazole (RAB)) on plasma levels of gastrin, somatostatin, motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P and calcitonine gene-related peptide (CGRP).</p><p><bold>Design</bold> OME (20 mg), LAN (30 mg), RAB (20 mg) or placebo was orally administered in five healthy male volunteers aged 25–30 years. Venous blood samples were taken before and after administration. Comparison of the mean peptide levels in plasma was made by analysis of variance.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Department of pharmacy, Oita university hospital.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Plasma peptide levels were measured by using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay developed by us.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> OME caused significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) increase in somatostatin-immunoreactive substance (IS) and motilin-IS at 60–240 min, and 120–180 min compared with the response of the placebo, respectively. OME significantly suppressed temporary elevation (30 min) of placebo gastrin-IS levels. OME had no effect on plasma VIP-IS, substance P-IS and CGRP-IS levels compared with the placebo. Compared with the placebo, LAN caused significant increase in somatostatin-IS, VIP-IS, substance P-IS and CGRP-IS at 120 min, 120 min, 90–240 min and 120 min, respectively. Similarly to OME, LAN significantly inhibited temporary elevation of placebo gastrin-IS levels. LAN had no effect on plasma motilin-IS levels. Single oral administration of RAB caused significant increase of gastrin-IS at 360 min and significantly decrease of motilin-IS at 180 min, but did not alter the other peptides.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Somatostatin is known that it not only inhibits other hormone release but also regulates gastric motility in the stomach and stimulates peristalsis in the intestine (1). Both of CGRP and substance P are vasoactive substances, which are released from the sensory afferent nerve endings against gastric mucosal injury in the stomach (2). Considering the result, we hypothesized that except for potent gastric antisecretory, OME might promote peristaltic reflex that might be useful to treat constipation, LAN might have gastro protective effect by increase of mucosal blood flow.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Grider J.

It is the only formulation which provides procaine as an injectable solution. During the manufacturing process, ampoules are sterilized by autoclaving. It is known that heat accelerates procaine hydrolysis in para-amino-benzoic acid (PABA), the main degradation product, and diaminoethanol.</p><p>Therefore, this work intends to study procaine stability after autoclaving and in a long-term storage. It consists in quantifying procaine after autoclaving and identifying its potential degradation products.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> First, a long-term stability study was performed on sterilized ampoules, stored at 25°C and analyzed after 4, 10 and 18 months.

This event may be correlated to chromophoric impurities which could derive from procaine oxidation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The drug shelf-date must be limited to reduce the amount of degradation impurities. Furthermore, the manufacturing process has to be modified. First, nitrogen gas may be used in order to inert the solution and limit oxidation.

Blood samples were used for routine clinical testing and morning urinary samples were tested for isoprostanes (8-iso-PGF2α), using an enzyme immunoassay.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Of the 201 coronary artery disease subjects tested, 8 were aspirin resistant. They presented higher platelet counts (318 ± 73 vs. 224 ± 53, 10<sup>9</sup>/l, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and lower daily aspirin dose (80 ± 0 vs. 187 ± 145 mg daily, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) when compared to aspirin sensitive subjects, suggesting that platelet turnover was increased and aspirin dosage was sub-optimal. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, 5.4 ± 3.3 vs. 3.5 ± 2.7 mg/ml, <italic>P</italic> = 0.07) were also higher in resistant patients, suggesting an underlying inflammatory process.

Cidofovir inhalation tolerability was confirmed by measuring pH and osmolarity of the solution, respectively 7.4 and 313 mOsm/l. Renal function was monitored by creatinine levels (68–76 mmol/l) and research of proteinuria (0.13–0.14 g/l) and glycosuria (0.3–0.6 mmol/l) in order to confirm tolerance of the medication. Plasmatic and urinary cidofovir levels allowed to evaluate the drug passage into the blood and to stop probenecid administration, if possible, as she suffered from important vomiting when she received it. Cidofovir plasmatic concentration was undetectable, whereas 25% of the inhaled dose was found unchanged in the 12-h urinary sample. These results confirmed the passage of inhaled cidofovir into the blood and its early renal elimination. To date, renal toxicity has never been observed when cidofovir is administered IV at 1 mg/kg [3]. Based on this information, oral adjuvant probenecid was stopped. This was benefic to the patient’s compliance, because stopping oral probenecid prevented her from vomiting.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> A CT-scan is carried out every month to assess treatment efficiency. If no improvement is noticed, cidofovir dosage may be increased up to 5 mg/kg every week, but probenecid would have to be reintroduced, given the absence of data on potential renal failure.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>M.

The median duration of PPIs therapy for patients already receiving one of the drugs was 27 months, 40% of them treated for more than a year. The prescribing of PPIs satisfied the approved indications in only 18 cases. Indeed, prevention of gastritis were made without suspicion of infection with helicobacter pylori. 21 of 25 prescriptions of PPIs for prevention of digestive toxicity of NSAID or mild/moderate oesophagitis concerned patients without risk factor (age &lt; in 65 years and/or any gastric ulcer antecedent). Patients treated with weak daily dosage of aspirin or coxibe benefited also of a useless prevention of digestive toxicity by IPP.

In this direction bacteriophages—specific viruses for bacteria are more actual throughout the world. The bacteriophages were discovered 100 years ago by Frederik Twort and Felix d’Herelle. Bacteriophages or phages are bacterial viruses that invade bacterial cells, disrupt bacterial metabolism and cause the bacterium to lyse using the bacterial components for their own multiplication. The Georgian scientist Giorgi Eliava laid foundation for bacteriophagology in Georgia, in 1923 together with Felixd’ Herelle he founded a world know Research Enterprise of bacteriology, bacteriophagology, vaccines and sera, which later became know as Research-and-Enterprise Amalgamation “Bacteriophage”.LtD “Biopharm-L” (Georgia) produce phage cocktails: Piobacteriofagum liquidum and Intestibacteriofagum. From biotechnological point of view the specificity of bacteriophages are challenge and the phagecocktails are more useful for the therapeutic purposes. Piobacteriofagum liquidum (P2815) is a mixture of sterile filtrates of phagolysates of staphylococcal, streptococcal, pseudomonas, <italic>E. coli</italic> and proteus—phages. It is used for management and prevention of skin, mucous viscelear organs purulent infections caused by the following bacteria: Staphylococci, Streptococci, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas auroginosa</italic>, <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>. Intestibacteriofagum (P2817) contains the mixture of following bacteriophages: shigella, <italic>E. coli</italic>; proteus, salmonella, enterococcal, pseudomoal, streptococcal, staphylococcal bacteriophages. Is available as liquid as solid (tablets) form of this preparation. It is using to cure gastrointestinal infection diseases.

Javachishvili Tbilisi State University, Scientific Research Institute of Pedeatrics.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Analysis of infected materials, isolation of bacteriophages specific for the virulent bacteria.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Why the phage therapy: The phages have been reported to be more effective therapeutic agent than antibiotics in treating certain infections in humans and experimentally infected animals. Bacteriophage taxonomy is based on their shape and size as well as on their nucleic acid. Most bacteriophages have ds DNA, however, some have ss DNA, ds RNA or ss RNA. Upon infection of bacterial host different phages can have quite different fates. Some phages follow the lytic infection cycle whereby they multiply in the bacterial cell and lyse the bacterial cell at the end of the cycle to release newly formed phage particles. Some phages may use the lysogenic pathway where the phage genome will integrate as part of host genome, replicate as part of the host genome and stay in a dormant state as a prophage for extended periods of time. The following phases can be distinguished in the lytic bacteriophage developmental cycle: 1. Adsorption of phage on the bacterial cell by binding to a specific receptor; 2. Injection of the nucleic acid into the bacterium; 3. Expression of the phage early genes, synthesis of early proteins, most involved in the shutting down of the host bacterium systems and phage genome replication; 4. Replication of the phage genome; 5. Expression of the phage late proteins involved in the formation of new phage particles and lysis of the host bacterium; 6. Assembly of the phage heads and tails and packaging of the genome; 7. Lysis of the host bacterium and release of the new phage progeny. Bacteriophage host range is determined primarily by the surface structures that phages use as receptors to dock on bacteria; both carbohydrate and protein receptors are known. Phage-associated side effects are uncommon since phages or their products do not affect eukaryotic cells. In addition, the cost of developing a phage system is cheaper than that of developing a new antibiotic. Up to now more than 1000 scientific article were published by Georgian scientist to the issue of bacteriophagology. (i) non-creation of secondary resistance of microbe strains; (ii) high specific mode of action; this specificy was made broad by making the “phage-cocktails”, using this way the phagopreparations received ability to kill more than one bacterial host (iii) no side effects and complication, the phages do not rise the disbacteriosis; (iv) Conformity with other therapeutic means, including antibiotics—they are main exallancy of phages (Black 2004) Safety. From a clinical standpoint, phages are bio-drugs which appear to be innocuous. In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, phages have been administered to humans (i) orally, in tablet or liquid formulations; (ii) rectally, (iii) locally (skin, eye, ear, nasal mucosa, etc.), in tampons, rinses, and creams, (iv) as aerosols or intrapleural injections, and (v) intravenously in the following case: pus—infected wound, cistitis, prostates, colecistites, pielitis, during and post operated, colites, enterocolites and by all kind of bacterial infection. The benefits listed above also hold true in the prophylactic treatment of food products: phages will not harm necessary bacteria in food (e.g., starter cultures), or accompanying bacterial flora in the environment. Moreover, since phages are generally composed entirely of proteins and nucleic acids, their eventual breakdown products consist exclusively of amino acids and nucleic acids. Thus, they are not xenobiotics, and unlike antibiotics and antiseptic agent, their introduction into and distribution within a given environment may be seen as a natural process (Carltoen et al. 2005).Recent in vitro and in vivo phage studies. There are excellent recent reviews on the phage therapy viable (Shkurnik et al 2006; Bradbury 2004; Projan 2004; Thacker 2003; Weber-Debrowska et al. 2002; Kalandarishvili et al. 1985; Matsuzaki et al. 2003).Surprisingly little detailed research has been performed on the fate of phages in animals and humans. Pharmacocinetics are complicated due to the selfreplicating nature of phage. The use of phages as drugs may differ dramatically from pharmaceuticals/antibiotics due to differences in the phage pharmacokinetics (Payne and Jansen 2003).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Bacteriophages are the antibiotics of XXI century, than they are (i) highly specific and very effective in lysing targeted pathogenic bacteria, (ii) safe, as underscored by their extensive clinical use as in human as in animals (iii) rapidly modifiable to combat the emergence of newly arising bacterial threats.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>JG Black—Microbiology, principles and exploration. 6th edition, John Wiley, INC. 2004.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Carlton RM, Noordman WH, Biswas B et al.

In two infusions diazepam (5 and 10 mg) was dissolved in 250 ml Neodolpasse<sup>®</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 2), an infusion solution containing diclofenc and orphenadrine citrate. In 45% of the infusions the used vehicle was not one recommended by the manufacturer. The drug combinations diclofenac or tramadol with diazepam induced a long lasting (&gt;11 h) sedative effect by diazepam and its metabolite, but only a moderate duration (approx. 7 h) of analgesia. The combination of the two analgesic drugs diclofenac and metamizole with or without vitamin B was acceptable as long as metamizole was used at 2.5 g/100, 250 or 500 ml. At the lower dosage of metamizole the duration of analgesia was shortened. The necessity of pantoprazole during short-term application of diclofenac in patients without any risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding is questionable. With the administered doses of metoclopramide and lidocaine, therapeutic plasma levels would apparently not be reached, but sufficient data for safe and effective dosage are lacking. The only infusion combination which might be harmful to patients consisted of tramadol, metoclopramide and triflupromazine, and is no longer used.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> In 45% of the 29 bedside prepared infusions the vehicle was not suitable. For all of the drug combinations in use no interactions of clinical relevance were observed. However, changing of infusion regimens might achieve optimisation of pain treatment in respect of duration of analgesia and sedation. The combination of analgesic drugs was in accordance with evidence-based medicine.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec620"><title>PT-132 Gb pharmacists’ perceptions and attitudes towards supplementary prescribing training</title><sec id="Sec621"><title><bold>Derek Stewart</bold><sup>1</sup>, Johnson George<sup>1</sup>, David Pfleger<sup>1</sup>, Christine Bond<sup>2</sup>, Lesley Diack<sup>1</sup>, Scott Cunningham<sup>1</sup>, Kim Munro<sup>1</sup>, Anne Watson<sup>3</sup>, Dorothy McCaig<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec622"><title><sup>1</sup>School of Pharmacy, The Robert Gordon University, <sup>2</sup>Department of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen; <sup>3</sup>Pharmacy, NHS Education for Scotland, Glasgow, United Kingdom</title><p><bold>Background and objective</bold> Pharmacist supplementary prescribing (SP) was introduced in GB in 2002 and pharmacists are now practising SP [1].

Graves’disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by hyperthyroidism. The role of B lymphocytes in thyroidal and extrathyroidal Graves’disease is established. Thus, some authors proposed that treatment with Rituximab may become a clinically relevant treatment option to prevent a possible dramatic evolution of Graves’disease [1].</p><p><bold>Design</bold> We report the benefit of Rituximab in a patient presenting a refractory form of thyroid-associated ophtalmopathy.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Internal medicine unit and Pharmacy department</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> In 1998, a 53 year-old woman was addressed to Internal Medicine Unit for bilateral exophtalmy associated with diplopia. A Graves’ disease diagnosis was established for this patient. She recovered on 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. But steroids had to be discontinued because of psychiatric adverse effects and cyclosporine was started as a steroid-sparing agent. After 2 years, treatment was withdrawn, but exophtalmy and diplopia recurred, with a decreased visual acuity linked to a compression of her right optic nerve. High dose of steroids associated with eye muscle and optic nerve decompression surgery led to remission. During the five following years, permanent low dose of prednisone was necessary. Eight years after the onset of the disease, a new recurrence failed to respond to steroids as well as to Azathioprine. The patient refused a new surgery and radiotherapy.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> In this context, Physicians and Pharmacists decided after discussion to establish a treatment including Rituximab. Patient received four weekly pulses of 375 mg/m² of Rituximab with a spectacular clinical response concomitantly to the fall of her B-lymphocytes blood count (2/mm<sup>3</sup>). One strengthening pulse was given 3 months after initial pulses. No adverse event was mentioned. Five months after the first rituximab pulse, the patient is doing well without receiving prednisone.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> In thyroid-associated ophtalmopathy, both humoral and cellular immunity are involved. Rituximab, since it induces B cell depletion, probably participates in autoantibody production decrease, and in cellular orbitrary infiltration inhibition.

Eleven (55.0%) pharmacists reported accessing the PLP website using broadband internet connection. None had to download additional software. Nine (45.0%) reported printing material from the PLP area. The trainees perceived the FAQs to be the most useful, followed by the handbook, and quotes from pharmacists and DMPs. Of those 11 pharmacists accessing the PLP website, most either agreed or strongly agreed that: it was easy to access the PLP pages (9); the PLP area was well laid out (9); and that the material was easy to read (9). At the time of the study, none of the DMPs had used the PLP website using the login and password provided.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Although many of the pharmacists had used the PLP website and had positive views, none of the DMPs had accessed the site. Further research is required to evaluate the website in larger numbers of pharmacists, to determine the extent to which the website can meet educational needs and to explore methods of facilitating DMP use.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.

Aprotinin (Trasylol<sup>®</sup>; Bayer Pharma) is widely used in this indication. However, its efficacy and harmlessness has recently been discussed. Indeed, Mangano et al. have described an increase of cardiovascular mortality and renal dysfunction with aprotinin use without obvious improvement on bleeding compared to tranexamic acid (TA)1. Our aim was to analyze the effectiveness and toxicity of the aprotinin in cardiac surgery.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A retrospective study of benefit risk ratio of aprotinin in adult cardiac surgery.</p><p>Aprotinin was compared with TA according to the type of surgery: coronary artery bypass or valve surgery.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> A French general hospital of 450 acute beds.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Mortality and spontaneous declaration of adverse drug effects. Blood loss and hematocrit during the first 24 h after intervention.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 676 patients were included in our study. Incidence and type of adverse effects were not different between aprotinin and TA. For coronary artery bypass, aprotinin was more effective than TA to reduce blood loss after intervention (719 ± 435 ml; <italic>n</italic> = 171 patients vs. 947 ± 586 ml; <italic>n</italic> = 244 patients <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Nevertheless, no difference of post-operative bleeding was 745; ± observed between the two anti-fibrinolytic drugs for valve surgery (825 605; tranexamic acid; <italic>n</italic> = 127 <italic>P</italic> = 0.426). Per operative ± aprotinin; <italic>n</italic> = 134 vs. 809 variations of hematocrit were identical between the two drugs and independent of the surgical process. The drugs’ cost per CPB was respectively of 50€ for TA and 240€ for aprotinin.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Our preliminary results indicate that tolerance to aprotinin is as good as for tranexamic acid. Concerning its effectiveness, results differ according to the type of surgery. Aprotinin is more effective than TA to reduce blood loss for coronary artery bypass surgery. In valve surgery, our data suggest that TA, as effective and much less expensive than aprotinin, should be recommended.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Mangano DT, Tudor IC, Dietzel C.

Immunosuppression was maintained on tacrolimus (FK506) monotherapy (therapeutic whole blood trough level range: 5–10 ng/ml; MEIA). For H. Pylori gastritis treatment, oral eradication tritherapy with amoxicillin, omeprazole and clarithromycin was initiated. Seven days hereafter, the patient presented in our hospital with seizures, oliguria, diarrhoea, vomiting and overall signs of dehydration. Lab monitoring revealed a six to seven-fold increase in tacrolimus blood trough levels affecting renal function. More than plausible explanation for the rise in blood FK 506 levels was a pharmacokinetic interaction between tacrolimus, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4 mediated metabolism in liver and gut and the potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin. As reported by few case reports, exacerbating factors were probably an increased absorption of tacrolimus—resulting from a decreased P-glycoprotein P mediated efflux in the damaged gut—and secondly, hemoconcentration due to dehydration. Clarithromycin was promptly discontinued and replaced by metronidazole (weak CYP3A4 inhibitor). Tacrolimus was withheld until therapeutic blood levels were reached and titrated within the therapeutic range with no further problems. Renal function and lab values all returned to normal.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> These observations describe a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between tacrolimus and clarithromycin in the liver and gut.

His main symptoms were panuveitis on his right eye, recurrent orogenital ulcers and arthritis. The uveitis had been refractory to prednisone (1 mg/kg/day), cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate. Due to the high risk of getting blind, a new treatment with infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks is begun as a Compasionate Use. Concomitant treatment with methotrexate 7.5 mg/week was taken. Before this treatment began the ophthalmological examination showed the following measures: Finger counting level 75 cm, Tyndall(+) on anterior chamber, Tyndall(+) in vitreum and retinal infiltrates. First dose was given in October 2005 being reported an improvement in symptoms. At date, the patient has received 7 doses without any side effects being reported, although exacerbation of mucocutaneous, ocular and arthritis symptoms occurred during the treatment period.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Using in a long-term infliximab seems to be a useful therapeutic approach to prevent relapses in patients with BD refractory to previous immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>BD is a recidivate disease so this could explain the exacerbation of symptoms.

Erlotinib (TARCEVA<sup>®</sup>, an oral treatment) is indicated for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer after failure of at least on prior chemotherapy. According to the monography, the most frequent adverse events (skin toxicity and diarrhoea) can lead in some cases to treatment interruption; nevertheless no notification has been reported to the Regional Centre of Pharmacovigilance.</p><p>Therefore the aim of this study was to assess tolerance of erlotinib in a population with a non small cell lung cancer.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> The study consisted of an eight-months retrospective study between January and September 2006 based on erlotinib prescriptions in pneumology departments.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Pharmacy and Pneumology departments, Godinot Institute and University Hospital, Reims, France.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Patients receiving erlotinib for the period January 2006- September 2006 were identified from the pharmaceutical records and erlotinib adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were analysed in the patients’ files (type, time and evolution).</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 13 patients, average age 56.2 years (45–76) were treated by erlotinib.

Fluoroquinolones (FQ) account for a substantial proportion of hospital antibiotics consumption, with a particularly high risk of bacterial resistance development. Thus the committee set up a pre-printed prescription formulary for FQ displaying recommendations. The pharmacy department performed a study to assess their current use and compare them with these guidelines published few years ago.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> The study has been conducted over 1 month at the pharmacy department in interplay with the bacteriology department.

Acute cystitis were managed in 41 cases, 14 were asymptomatic. Bacteria were isolated in 49 UTI (71.4% Escherichia coli). Ofloxacin was the most prescribed FQ (64.1%) in UTI, in accordance with the number of E coli susceptible to all FQ (60%).

The severe OM prevalence can vary from 28% to 100%*, the most important rates are encountered by patients who receive intensive treatments, particularly the conditioning regimen by BEAM (80%) and total body irradiation (99%). In the literature, no predictive factors for OM are clearly reported. In this context, we wanted to determine factors to optimize the use of palifermin targeting more precisely a population to be treated.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A retrospective study over 8 years included all patients with lymphomas receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen by BEAM and haematopoietic progenitor cells rescue.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Haematology unit.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> The studied patients were classified in 3 groups: Group A patients without OM, Group B patients with OM of moderate grades (1–2 grades**) and Group C, patients with severe OM (3–4 grades**). For each patient, 10 factors were analyzed: sex, age over 60, initial disease diagnostic, previous chemotherapies, nutritional condition, dental condition, active smoking, nauseas and vomiting frequency (NVF), positive herpetic serology and the used of drugs causing an oral dryness.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> 39 patients were included (22 males, 17 females).

In the analysis, the OM appearance seems to support by 2 factors (A vs. B–C): average or severe NVF (<italic>P</italic> = 0.029) and the used of drugs supporting an oral dryness (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). Moreover OM aggravation factors were distinguished (A–B vs. C): female sex (<italic>P</italic> = 0.022), age over 60 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and average or severe NVF (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). The analysis showed also that, among these elements, a single factor was not sufficient to develop severe OM and the association of several factors increased the risk: in the group A, only 2 patients associated 2 or 3 factors while in the group C, 9 patients had more than 2 factors.

Splenectomy is the traditional second-line therapy for ITP when glucocorticoids fail.The platelet count typically increases within the first 2 weeks after splenectomy [1]. Some patients have an immediate post-operative major increase [2]. This prompt response is consistent with the theory that the spleen is the major site of destruction of antibody-covered platelets. Furthermore, an increased risk of thrombosis has also been reported for patients following splenectomy due to procoagulant platelet microparticles which cannot be filtered anymore by the spleen after a splenectomy [3].

The hemodynamic effects seen after levosimendan administration are due to the pharmacological activity of levosimendan and its metabolites. Levosimendan is reduced to OR-1855 in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria. After absorption, the reduction product OR-1855 is further acetylated by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme to form OR-1896. NAT2, involved in the formation of OR-1896 metabolite and the equilibrium between OR-1855 and OR-1896 metabolites, is a polymorphically distributed enzyme.

Protein level of cranial CSF proved to be 34 times higher than lumbar CSF which suggested obstruction of CSF circulation. Spinal MRI represented a mass 20–25 mm in diameter at the level of the second lumbar vertebra causing obstruction of the vertebral canal. Histological sample was taken by biopsy.

The aim of this project is to evaluate the added value of a clinical pharmacist.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> Since 3 months a pharmacist has been attached to the team of neurosurgeons and neurologists. The clinical pharmacist evaluates patients’ pharmacotherapy and gives advice in accordance to the local guidelines, based on pathology and lab results. The interventions are discussed during daily ward rounds.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> Neurosurgery (28 beds) and neurology ward (28 beds) in the 1900-bed University Hospital of Leuven, Belgium.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Improvement of quality of individual drug therapy and standardisation of general drug management.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Although the general way of working is similar on both wards, the focus differs. Regarding the experience of clinical pharmacy on a traumatology ward [2], basic aspects of pharmacotherapy on the neurosurgery ward are similar: pain management, peri-operative anticoagulant management, follow up of postoperative infections and continuation of patients’ regular medication during admission. On the other hand clinical pharmacy on a neurology ward requires a specific knowledge about neurological drugs and pathology to interpret whether the prescribed drug therapy is adequate.</p><p>In a 2 months period the clinical pharmacist registered 113 interventions. Most interventions were initiated by the pharmacist (78), but in 28 cases the physician and in 6 cases the nurses asked the pharmacist for advice. Rate of acceptance was 88%. Most common interventions are: giving information about dosing and administration (28%), discontinuation (21%) and association (16%) of drugs. The most common involved drug classes are antibiotics (20%), pain medication (12%) and anti-ulcer drugs (11%).</p><p>Besides the daily follow up of patients’ pharmacotherapy, the pharmacist completes some projects to standardise general drug management. Among other things the pharmacist optimises the implementation of guidelines concerning pain management and administration of drugs in patients with swallowing difficulties.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Although neurosurgery and neurology are unusual wards to attach a clinical pharmacist, we believe that our project illustrates the additive value to the quality of pharmacotherapy.</p><p><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Welty T.

Clinical pharmacists working on four orthopaedic surgical and rehabilitation wards recorded medication incidents occurring over a two-week period. Clinical pharmacists in Greenpark routinely record medication incidents observed on the ward however this information is not analysed. The objective of this study was to analyse the information gathered with regard to the type of incident occurring, severity and potential future risk and to determine if any trends were occurring.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> A data collection form was designed using tick boxes for ease of completion. Medication incidents were broken down into six main categories, patient details, allergy status, prescribing, drug history, administration and miscellaneous. Incidents were graded using a severity matrix [1]. Over the study period clinical pharmacists recorded all medication incidents identified at ward level. One clinical pharmacist graded the incidents using the severity matrix to ensure consistency. Grading was peer-reviewed by a second clinical pharmacist.</p><p><bold>Setting</bold> The audit was conducted in four orthopaedic surgical and rehabilitation wards totalling 70 beds.</p><p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To obtain the total number of medication incidents over the study period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To grade incidents according to severity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine which drug or drug groups were involved in medication incidents.</p></list-item></list></p><p><bold>Results</bold> Over the study period a total of 121 incidents were recorded. Of these 83 (68.6%) were categorised as prescribing incidents. Incidents involving allergy status and drug history accounted for 14 (11.6%) respectively of the total. The total number of incidents involving named medicines was 83, of these warfarin was involved in 10 (12.1%), antihypertensive medicines were involved in 6 (7.2%). A wide range of medicines involved in incidents was identified during the audit.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The audit provided information about medication incidents, which occur within the trust, and individual medicines involved. Further analysis of the information recorded will allow training needs of medical and nursing staff to be identified which will be addressed by clinical pharmacists.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Doing less harm, Department of Health and National Patient Safety Agency, 2001</p></list-item></list></p><p><bold>Keywords</bold> Incident, Pharmacist, Medication</p></sec></sec></sec></body></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Internal Medicine</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Medicine &amp; Public Health</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Pharmacy</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">Pharmacy World &amp; Science</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2009</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"/><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
