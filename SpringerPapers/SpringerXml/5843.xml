This self-assembly can provide a high flexibility in the control of the chemical composition and pore structure of the resulting LDH-based nanohybrids. The hybridization with POM nanoclusters remarkably enhances the photocatalytic activity of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH, which is attributable to the formation of porous structure and depression of charge recombination. Of prime interest is that the excellent photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared Zn-Cr-LDH-POM nanohybrid for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation can be further enhanced by calcination at 200 °C, leading to the very high apparent quantum yield of ∼75.2% at 420 nm. The present findings clearly demonstrate that the self-assembly of LDH–POM is fairly powerful in synthesizing novel LDH-based porous nanohybrid photocatalyst for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>2553</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2013_Article_BFsrep02080.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep02080" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep02080</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The photoinduced generation of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> molecules by semiconductor photocatalysts attracts a great deal of research activity because of its usefulness to harness solar energy and to transform it to user-friendly chemical energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Yet most of photocatalysts ever-developed do not possess a sufficiently high efficiency for visible light-induced production of O<sub>2</sub> gas because of their non-optimized band structure with wide bandgap energy and the mismatched position of valence band (VB). To achieve high photocatalytic activity of the visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation, it is of crucial importance to finely tune several electronic characteristics of photocatalysts such as bandgap energy, band position, the lifetime of electron and hole, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. One of the most effective ways to tailor the band structure of inorganic solids is to control their chemical composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A facile tailoring of the electronic structure via chemical substitution renders layered double hydroxide (LDH) a promising candidate for photocatalytic O<sub>2</sub> generation and CO<sub>2</sub> conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In particular, Zn-Cr-LDH material receives prime attention because of its unusually high efficiency for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Actually this LDH phase is one of the most active visible light photocatalysts for O<sub>2</sub> generation. In addition to the control of chemical composition, the hybridization with other semiconducting species is also fairly effective in optimizing the photocatalytic activity of the LDH materials through an expansion of the wavelength region of light absorption and an increase of electron–hole lifetime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Taking into account the fact that negatively charged polyoxometalate (POM) nanocluster can act as an effective electron acceptor for positively charged LDH nanosheets via a strong electrostatic interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the hybridization with POM species can provide a powerful way of further enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the Zn-Cr-LDH phase. Under the irradiation of UV or visible light, the POM nanoclusters hybridized with the LDH nanosheets can accept photoexcited electrons from the conduction band (CB) of hybridized LDH lattice, leading to the formation of reduced POM* species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The reduced POM* species can be readily reoxidized to the initial POM state via several oxidative pathways, which makes possible the role of POM nanocluster as an effective reversible redox shuttle (i.e. an electron transfer mediator). In addition to the enhancement of charge separation, the self-assembly with POM 0D nanoclusters can induce the surface expansion of the LDH material via the formation of porous intercalation structure, which is also beneficial for the photocatalyst performance of the resulting nanohybrids. In comparison with conventional ion-exchange route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the self-assembly process between exfoliated inorganic 2D nanosheets with subnanometer-level thickness and 0D inorganic nanoclusters with very limited molecular dimension (∼1 nm) would be much more effective in achieving a strong electronic coupling between these two semiconductors as well as in maximizing the surface area of the layered material via the formation of porous stacking structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

The effects of hybridization with POM on the photocatalytic activity and the surface area of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material are investigated together with the accompanying variations of their crystal structure and physicochemical properties. A strong electronic coupling with POM leads to the remarkable enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH by ∼4 times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To probe the effect of chemical formula on the physicochemical properties of the resulting nanohybrid materials, two different molar ratios of POM/Zn-Cr-LDH (i.e. a charge-balanced ratio and a 3-fold POM excess ratio) were applied for each POM species. The obtained self-assembled Zn-Cr-LDH–W<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub><sup>6−</sup> nanohybrids with a charge-balanced ratio (POM:Zn-Cr-LDH = 1∶2.57) and a 3-fold POM-excess ratio (POM:Zn-Cr-LDH = 1∶7.71) are denoted as <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCW-2</bold>, respectively. Similarly the Zn-Cr-LDH–V<sub>10</sub>O<sub>28</sub><sup>6−</sup> nanohybrids are denoted as <bold>ZCV-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-2</bold> with the molar ratio of POM:Zn-Cr-LDH = 1∶1.81 and 1∶5.64, respectively. The powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared <bold>ZCW</bold> and <bold>ZCV</bold> nanohybrids and their calcined derivatives at 200°C are plotted in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, as compared to that of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH. The pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material shows typical Bragg reflections of hexagonal LDH phase with interlayer nitrate ions, confirming the formation of Zn-Cr-LDH–nitrate phase. Like the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH, all of the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids exhibit a series of well-defined (<italic>00l</italic>) Bragg reflections at low 2θ region, indicating the formation of layer-by-layer-ordered intercalation compound. All of the (<italic>00l</italic>) reflections of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH are distinctly displaced toward low-angle side after the self-assembly with POM, clearly demonstrating the intercalation of POM nanoclusters in-between the host LDH lattice. For all the present nanohybrid materials, there is no distinct dependence of the basal spacing on the ratio of POM/LDH reactants, reflecting a high tolerance of the host LDH lattice for the variation of guest concentration. As illustrated in the right panel of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, the <bold>ZCW</bold> and <bold>ZCV</bold> nanohybrids possess expanded gallery heights of 1.06 and 1.20 nm, which is greater than that of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH (0.89 nm). The in-plane (<italic>110</italic>) peak of hexagonal LDH phase and a broad hump peak are also observed at 2θ = ∼60° and ∼32–42° for all the present nanohybrids, respectively, underscoring the maintenance of the in-plane structure of the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets with disordered stacking structure.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structural and microscopic study.</p><p>(a) Powder XRD patterns of (i) the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH and the as-prepared nanohybrids of (ii) <bold>ZCV-1</bold>, (iii) <bold>ZCV-2</bold>, (iv) <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and (v) <bold>ZCW-2</bold>.

The heat-treatment at 200 °C induces only a slight shift of (<italic>00l</italic>) peaks toward low angle side, suggesting the decrease of <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice parameter; the <italic>c</italic>-axis parameter of the calcined derivatives of <bold>ZCW-1</bold>, <bold>ZCW-2</bold>, <bold>ZCV-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-2</bold> nanohybrids is determined to be 0.95, 1.00, 1.08 and 1.14 nm, respectively. The observed shrinkage of basal spacing upon calcination is attributable to the evaporation of interlayer water molecules. A further elevation of heating temperature to 300 °C causes a remarkable depression of (<italic>00l</italic>) peaks, suggesting the destruction of intercalation structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1</xref>). Yet the in-plane peak of the LDH nanosheets as well as a broad hump at 2θ = 30–40° is still discernible for all the present materials calcined at 300 °C, indicating the maintenance of the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets even with the collapse of intercalation structure.</p><p>As illustrated in the left panel of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, cross-sectional HR-TEM analysis provides strong evidence for the formation of layer-by-layer-ordered intercalation structure for both the <bold>ZCW</bold> and <bold>ZCV</bold> nanohybrids. Both of the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrids display similar HR-TEM images showing the house-of-cards-type stacking structure of the heterolayered crystallites. The equally-spaced parallel lines corresponding to the layered lattice of Zn-Cr-LDH material are commonly observed for both the nanohybrid materials. From the enlarged views of the HR-TEM images, the distance between two consecutive fringes is determined to be ∼1.0 and ∼1.1 nm for the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrids, respectively. The estimated interline distances are in good agreement with the <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice parameters determined from the XRD analysis. The present HR-TEM images of the Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids are very similar to those of self-assembled nanohybrids composed of exfoliated metal oxide 2D nanosheets and guest 0D nanoclusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The maintenance of the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets after the hybridization with POM and the following calcination is confirmed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses at Zn K- and Cr K-edge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2 and Fig. S3</xref>). The local symmetry and oxidation state of guest POM nanoclusters in the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids and their calcined derivatives are also examined using XANES analysis at W L<sub>III</sub>-edge and V K-edge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2 and Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>The crystal morphology of the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids is investigated with FE-SEM analysis.

The house-of-cards-type stacking structure can be stabilized by the edge-to-face interaction of restacked LDH nanosheets. Such a mesoporous stacking structure is common for the self-assembled hybrid materials synthesized by the restacking of 2D nanosheets with 0D nanoclusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The heat-treatment at 200 and 300 °C has little influence on the highly anisotropic 2D shape of the LDH–POM nanohybrids, underscoring the high morphological stability of these materials. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>According to energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS)-elemental mapping analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S5</xref>), all of the component elements, i.e. zinc, chromium, tungsten, vanadium and oxygen, are uniformly distributed in entire parts of the as-prepared and calcined nanohybrids, clearly demonstrating the homogeneous hybridization of the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets and POM nanoclusters without any phase separation. The hybridization between Zn-Cr-LDH and POM is cross-confirmed by the EDS-line profile analysis, highlighting the homogeneous distribution of zinc, chromium, tungsten, vanadium and oxygen elements along the line centered in the crystallites of the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S6</xref>).

This sharply contrasts with the poor tunability of the chemical composition of the nanohybrids prepared by conventional ion-exchange method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>The pore structure and surface area of the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids are investigated with N<sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements. As plotted in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, all of the as-prepared nanohybrids exhibit significant N<sub>2</sub> adsorption at pp<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> &lt; 0.4. Since the adsorption of N<sub>2</sub> in the low pressure region occurs mainly on the micropores, the observed distinct N<sub>2</sub> adsorption in the region of PP<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> &lt; 0.4 indicates the presence of micropores in the present materials. A distinct hysteresis is commonly observable for all the nanohybrids at pp<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> &gt; 0.45, showing the presence of mesopores in the present materials.

The observed dependence of surface area on the content of POM is attributable to the blocking of pores by the excess guest POM nanoclusters. For most of the present nanohybrids, the calcination at 200 and 300 °C induces the significant depression of the surface area, a result of the decrease of interlayer spacing and the partial destruction of pillared structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7</xref>). The decrease of surface area upon the heat-treatment is less prominent for the <bold>ZCW-2</bold> and <bold>ZCV-2</bold> nanohybrids with a higher POM/LDH ratio than for the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-1</bold> ones with a lower ratio, indicating the enhanced stability of the pillared structure by the intercalation of a larger amount of POM nanoclusters. In contrast to the present self-assembled Zn-Cr-LDH−polyoxotungstate nanohybrids, the homologue synthesized by ion-exchange method shows much smaller surface area of 35 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>, clearly demonstrating the merit of self-assembly method in optimizing the pore structure of the resulting intercalative nanohybrid.

From these results, the present Zn-Cr-LDH-POM nanohybrids are expected to show a higher photocatalytic activity than the previously reported Zn-Cr-LDH–layered titanate nanohybrid and the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>PL spectroscopy and proposed charge transfer mechanism.</p><p>(a) PL spectra of the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> (dot-dashed lines), <bold>ZCW-2</bold> (dot-dot-dashed lines), <bold>ZCV-1</bold> (dashed lines), <bold>ZCV-2</bold> (dotted lines) and pristine Zn-Cr-LDH (solid lines).

This internal charge transfer process is highly effective in depressing the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes via their separation in space, which is mainly responsible for the significantly reduced PL signal of the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids. The POM nanoclusters can act as a role of electron transfer mediator since the reduced POM* nanoclusters can be easily reoxidized to the initial POM nanoclusters via electron transports through the following effective pathways in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; (1) POM* → Ag<sup>+</sup>, (2) POM* → O<sub>2</sub> and (3) POM* → holes in partially occupied interband Cr 3<italic>d</italic><sub>t2g</sub> state.</p><p>The variation of the photocatalytic activity of Zn-Cr-LDH upon the hybridization with POM is investigated by monitoring time-dependent O<sub>2</sub> generation under the illumination of visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm), see <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. As reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material shows high photocatalytic activity for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation, confirming its usefulness as photocatalyst for O<sub>2</sub> production.

The observed improvement of photocatalytic activity upon hybridization with POM nanoclusters is attributable to the effective electronic coupling between the two semiconductors (Zn–Cr–LDH and POM nanoclusters), leading to the increase of the lifetime of electrons and holes, as evidenced by PL measurements. Also the expansion of surface area upon hybridization with POM makes additional contribution to the observed improvement of photocatalytic activity through the provision of more reaction sites.

Taking into account somewhat similar surface areas of the Zn-Cr-LDH–POM and Zn-Cr-LDH–layered titanate nanohybrids, the observed merit of the hybridization with POM nanoclusters is surely attributable to more effective internal electron transfer of LDH with POM than with layered metal oxide.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Time-dependent photoproduction of O<sub>2</sub> gas under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm).</p><p>(a) the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH and the Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids of (b) <bold>ZCV-1</bold>, (c) <bold>ZCV-2</bold>, (d) <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and (e) <bold>ZCW-2</bold>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2013_Article_BFsrep02080_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Among the present nanohybrids, the <bold>ZCW</bold> nanohybrids show much better photocatalytic activity than the <bold>ZCV</bold> homologues. The higher photocatalytic activity of the <bold>ZCW</bold> nanohybrids is attributable to the high photocatalytic activity of both Zn-Cr-LDH and polyoxotungstate for O<sub>2</sub> generation and also to the effective electronic coupling between the two components (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, the different molecular sizes of the polyoxovanadate and polyoxotungstate (V<sub>10</sub>O<sub>28</sub><sup>6−</sup> and W<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub><sup>6−</sup>) nanoclusters make additional contribution to the dissimilar photocatalytic activity of the <bold>ZCV</bold> and <bold>ZCW</bold> nanohybrids. As guessed from their molecular formulas, both of the POM nanoclusters possess different molecular sizes but the same molecular charge. Since the self-assembly between LDH and POM nanoclusters occurs in terms of electrostatic attraction, both of the <bold>ZCV-1</bold> and <bold>ZCW-1</bold> nanohybrids show nearly identical POM content, as evidenced by the inductive coupled plasma (ICP) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>). Thus, the same number of the isovalent POM nanoclusters is supposed to bind with the specific surface area of Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets both for the <bold>ZCV-1</bold> and <bold>ZCW-1</bold> nanohybrids. Taking into account the fact that the polyoxovanadate nanocluster (V<sub>10</sub>O<sub>28</sub><sup>6−</sup>) possesses markedly larger molecular size than does the polyoxotungstate nanocluster (W<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub><sup>6−</sup>), the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheet in the <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrid is supposed to have a greater surface coverage by the POM nanoclusters than the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheet in the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> nanohybrid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Since the visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation occurs mainly on the surface of Zn-Cr-LDH, a severer surface blocking of Zn-Cr-LDH by the larger polyoxovanadate nanoclusters makes a significant contribution to the lower photocatalytic activity of the <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrid than the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> one. The suggested influence of the surface blocking of LDH nanosheets by the POM nanoclusters on the photocatalytic activity of the Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids is supported by the fact that the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrids with lower POM contents show higher photocatalytic activity than the <bold>ZCW-2</bold> and <bold>ZCV-2</bold> nanohybrids with higher POM contents.

Since the latter materials have more POM nanoclusters for the specific surface area of the Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets than do the former materials, they suffer from severer steric hindrance among the intercalated POM nanoclusters. As a consequence, the <bold>ZCV-2</bold> nanohybrid with larger polyoxovanadate nanoclusters shows a lower POM content than does the <bold>ZCW-2</bold> nanohybrid with smaller polyoxotungstate ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>).

In comparison with the as-prepared <bold>ZCW-1</bold> and <bold>ZCV-1</bold> nanohybrids, their derivatives calcined at 200 °C show even higher photocatalytic activity for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> evolution. The resulting photocatalytic activity of the <bold>ZCW-1</bold> nanohybrid calcined at 200 °C is 4 times higher than that of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of photocatalytic O<sub>2</sub> evolution is the most appropriate parameter to establish the photocatalytic efficiency. AQY for <bold>ZCW-1</bold> nanohybrid calcined at 200 °C is calculated to be 75.2% at wavelength 420 nm. Significant differences between experimental conditions adopted in the present study and in previous literatures make it difficult to directly compare the photocatalytic activity of the present self-assembled nanohybrids with those of other efficient photocatalysts ever-reported. However, taking into account the fact that the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material is one of the most effective photocatalysts for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the <bold>ZCW</bold> nanohybrid calcined at 200 °C can be evaluated as unusually highly active photocatalyst. A further elevation of heating temperature to 300 °C (right panel of <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) gives rise to the marked reduction of the photocatalytic activity of the present nanohybrids. This observation can be understood as a result of the significant decrease of surface area and the structural frustration of Zn-Cr-LDH nanosheets after the calcination at 300 °C. As can be seen from <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, all of the present nanohybrids display a higher photocatalytic activity for the initial stage of reaction than for the following stage after 1 h, which is attributable to the gradual consumption of sacrificial agent and also to the initial degradation of interlayer water molecules in-between the Zn-Cr-LDH layers. Similar time-dependence of photocatalyst performance is also reported for the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>The photocatalytic activity of the Zn-Cr-LDH–polyoxotungstate nanohybrid prepared by the conventional ion-exchange route is also tested under the same condition, revealing much weaker photocatalytic activity than the self-assembled homologue.

The Zn-Cr-LDH–polyoxotungstate nanohybrid calcined at 200 °C shows unusually high photocatalytic activity for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> generation, which is 4 times higher than that of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH. Considering that the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH phase is one of the most efficient visible light photocatalysts, the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids with much higher photocatalytic activity must be one of the best photocatalyst materials for visible light-induced O<sub>2</sub> production. The remarkable enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH upon the hybridization with POM is attributable not only to the formation of highly porous structure but also to the strong electronic coupling between the two components, leading to the depression of electron–hole recombination. In comparison with previously reported nanohybrid of Zn-Cr-LDH–layered titanate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the present Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrids are much more photocatalytically active because of the remarkable depression of charge recombination. Also the higher photocatalytic activity and the greater tunability of chemical composition of the self-assembled Zn-Cr-LDH–POM nanohybrid compared with the ion-exchanged homologue provide straightforward evidence for the merit of self-assembly method over the conventional ion-exchange method. The experimental findings presented here underscore that the self-assembly of LDH 2D nanosheets with electron accepting 0D nanoclusters can provide a very powerful way of developing highly efficient visible light active photocatalysts. This synthetic strategy based on the electrostatic interaction is readily extendible for diverse couples of cationic LDH nanosheets and anionic 0D nanoclusters. Currently we are underway to explore efficient visible light active photocatalysts from the self-assembly between photocatalytically active LDH 2D nanosheets and carbon 0D nanoclusters like fullerene species having a great electron accepting ability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preparation of Zn-Cr-LDH-POM nanohybrids</title><p>The nitrate form of Zn-Cr-LDH was synthesized by conventional co-precipitation method, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.
