</title><p id="Par1">We are living in an age when data centers are expanding, require abundant spaces, and are an integral part in the urban communities, using massive amounts of environmental resources, and remains in the foreseeable future as the primary driver of the global energy consumption. This demand is disruptive and at times of both peril and opportunity due to impacts such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which is altering the demand of digital infrastructure around the world. With the global call for zero carbon emissions, there needs to be solutions put in place for the de-carbonization of data centers. New innovations are made available, which will have an economic, social, and environmental impact on data centers. Concepts such as circular economy and fourth industrial revolution technologies are useful procedural tools that can be used to systematically analyze data centers, control their mining and critical raw materials, can be utilized in the transition towards a sustainable and circular data center, by objectively assessing the environmental and economic impacts, and evaluating alternative options. In this paper, we will look at the current research and practice, the impact on the United Nations Sustainable Development goals, and look at future strides being taken towards more sustainable and circular data centers. We had discovered that decreasing the environmental effect and energy consumption of data centers is not sufficient. When it comes to data center architecture, both embodied and operational emissions are critical. Data centers also have a vital societal role in our daily lives, enabling us to share data and freely communicate via social media, transacting on the blockchain with cryptocurrencies, free online education, and job creation. As a result, sustainability and efficiency measures have expanded in a variety of ways, including circularity and its associated tools, as well as newer technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The increasing demand for data center sustainability and efficiency is directly proportional to the cost-effectiveness and daily demand of the environmental resources with regard to the manufacturing of data center products, construction, operation of the data centers, and reduction in the environmental impacts such as the carbon emissions and waste. They must also keep up with external factors, including driving forces of the likes of Industry 4.0 or also known as the fourth industrial revolution (4IR).</p><p id="Par3">We have seen a growth in technical developments since the commencement of the industrial revolution. Factories were first powered by water and steam engines in the nineteenth century, then by electricity in the twentieth century, and ultimately by automation in the 1970s. We are presently on the verge of a revolutionary digital industrial technology. Cyber physical systems can communicate with one another in this fourth technology wave in business by employing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), among other technologies. Japan proposed the intelligent manufacturing system (IMS) in the 1980s, and the US followed suit with the cyber physical system (CPS). Germany recently offered Industry 4.0, while China advocated China Manufacturing 2025. Productivity and growth will surely improve as a result of Industry 4.0.</p><p id="Par4">If we are to succeed with circular economics in the data center industry, we must deliberately depart from the linear practices, transition to circular thinking, utilize newer digital technologies, measure our progress throughout the lifecycle for a data center, and facilitate these changes for those who design, build, manage, and maintain them. Therefore, the entire life cycle needs to be considered. Circular economy tools can assist in the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy in a data center, which in turn can lead to sustainability, efficiency, and optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Like industrial systems, data centers require significant amounts of natural resources with a growing demand for energy and materials. It has a certain significance, and it is regarded as the dedicated space used for inventory management of computer hardware, require sufficient space, environmental control (air conditioned cooling, fire suppression, water usage), data connectivity, and power supply. Therefore, the large-scale data center industry is responsible for substantial environmental degradation and is now on the radar of growing environmental concern due to huge amounts of annual carbon dioxide emission. We need to rethink how <italic>not</italic> to, dig up materials, turn them into data center products, generate large volumes of carbon emissions, waste heat in the data center operation, and discard the electronic waste (e-waste) in the environment. We need to adopt circular thinking to create new sustainable products, as the circular economy synchronizes with each phase of the data center life cycle keeping materials in circulation. Several solutions and research outputs have been put in place for data centers to create sustainability and circularity.</p><p id="Par6">Think of data centers as ever-evolving to support the surge of 2.7 billion online meeting minutes per day in the month of March 2020, the on-demand data analytics in zettabytes caused by tele-medicine and tele-diagnostic applications, and the sensors in the 40 billion IoT constantly gathering and correlating data. The Google Sustainability post reports 54% of the worldâs population lives in the urban areas which account for 75% of natural resource consumption, 50% of the global waste production, and 60â80% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). According to the United Nations Migration report, 68% of the global population is expected to migrate and reside in urban communities, giving rise to 10 more megacities each with over 10 million residents. More data centers will be built in these urban communities; there is an opportunity now to develop âcircular data center citiesâ to adapt to the digital transformation changes. The data center life span depends on use, design, build, and operation. Just as you would care for a human being, the same is needed for data centers in the form of new technology adoption, maintenance, and upgrade of the physical and digital infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Circular thinking is not just for data centers; they range from general construction to any electrical, mechanical, manufacturing, safety, and other systems. By using circular economy tools, stakeholders gain better insight into their buildings and businesses, while at the same time achieving sustainability and circularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">While the data center sector continues to expand and its efficiency is being scrutinized more closely, it is important to raise awareness about where its highest economic, social, and environmental effects are. Examining the factors that affect this impact can help guide policy makers and decision makers, as well as promote the development of sustainable and circular data centers. It is time to adopt sustainability practices within data centers and simultaneously maximize their life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data Centers and Information and Communication Technology</title><p id="Par9">Since the late 1950s, when American Airlines and IBM collaborated to create a passenger reservation system provided by Sabre, the idea of data centers has existed, automating one of its main business areas.</p><p id="Par10">Data centers are information-based repositories which include server farms and networking equipment that store, process, and transmit enormous amounts of data.

The data center is the physical repository of the cloud, providing instantaneous access to digital services and cloud applications with unlimited compute, network and data scalability, and storage. Internet, cloud computing, and data centers make the internet possible. All the machines on the internet either provide the cloud and digital services to other machines (servers) or are used to access data of social media, digital services, and cloud applications (clients) using Internet protocol (IP) addresses. IP addresses are uniquely allocated to a computer or server that links to the internet. They assist in command mediation, addressing, and processing of data. The conversion of IP addresses into domain names (e.g.,.com,.co,.za,.org, or.gov) radically altered the essence of the internet to deliver equal and ubiquitous access.</p><p id="Par16">Tiers are used by Uptime Institute to identify the redundancy representation of the data center components at the infrastructure level to compare the uptime of different data centers, namely:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par17">Tier 1 â a single path for power and cooling and few, if any, redundant and backup components.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Tier 2 â same as tier 1, but with less down time annually.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Tier 3 â has multiple paths for power and cooling and systems in place to update and maintain it without taking it offline.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Tier 4 â built to be completely fault tolerant with redundancy for every component.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par21">Most large communications companies have dedicated backbones of their own which link different regions.

Data centers contribute about 0.3% of total global carbon emissions, whereas information and communications technology (ICT) accounts for more than 2% of global emissions. This is predicted to increase to 20% by 2030, which in turn rises the carbon footprint of economies, according to the International Energy Agency in 2017.

This includes emissions from resource extraction, production, and transportation, as well as emissions from the installation of materials and components needed to construct the built environment. It also covers lifetime emissions from continued usage, such as maintenance, repair, and replacement, as well as end-of-life activities such as deconstruction, transportation, trash processing, and disposal. These lifecycle emissions must be taken into account in order to calculate the overall embedded carbon cost. However, because embodied carbon is largely paid up front as the facility is built, there is a strong rationale to incorporate it in all assessments and data center design decisions. A whole life carbon strategy that incorporates embodied and operational emissions gives the possibility to positively contribute to SDGâs goal to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, while saving money. More information on embodied carbon in data centers can be found in i3 Solutions white paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as well as the use of life cycle assessment when examining the effect and utility of design decisions on a cradle-to-cradle basis, taking the circularity of the facility and its components into consideration.</p><p id="Par57">The control of hazardous and unethical mining and materials processing for data centers are of utmost importance, particularly the effect this has on the SDGs. Mining, whether large-scale industrial mining or small-scale artisanal mining, is a hazardous industry. The majority of data center equipment is made up of ordinary metals, polymers, and key critical raw materials (CRM). Many of these and other commodities are extracted using hazardous chemicals, and because much of their mining is uncontrolled and/or illegal, the accompanying negative environmental and social repercussions are severe. Many of the componentsâ functionality is dependent on CRM. Twenty-three of the 30 CRMs are found in server, storage, and networking equipment. This implies that the resources we rely on for the worldâs data centers are in low supply or are politically unpredictable. CRMs are finite materials provided by the European Commission that are in short supply globally; examples of some of these materials are titanium, lithium, germanium, etc. Because these raw materials are in low supply globally, there are no viable substitutes; hence, the answer to the CRM problem is a circular approach. This can be done by minimizing mining of these raw materials from the earth and re-use our existing resources. Choosing used equipment has several environmental, financial, and performance advantages. Selling obsolete IT equipment from data centers is another excellent approach to keep technology alive. We can get a return on undesired equipment while assuring that all data is unrecoverable. As a result, by implementing circular economy waste reduction measures, such as product life extension through recycling, reuse, and remanufacture, could prove fruitful for the mining sector. Furthermore, facilities can be designed for these circular processes while at the same time develop ethical, well-paying opportunities that allow workers to work in ecologically safe, non-hazardous settings. Not forgetting, to have a positive social impact, mining projects should be controlled globally, and they must find better methods to connect with local populations, such as via active engagement in social development, increased respect for human rights, reduction in pollution, and assistance in overcoming poverty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Current applications and research towards circular and sustainable data centers</title><p id="Par58">Global business has a vital role to play in switching from a <italic>take-make-dispose</italic> model-based economy to a restorative and regenerative system-based one.

Water consumption is an important factor in data centers, especially because it is tied to the SDGs. Data centers are predicted to need between 1047 and 151,061 m<sup>3</sup>/TJ of water. Data center outbound data traffic has a water factor of 1â205Â l/gigabyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), worldwide water consumption for industrial industries would rise 400% between 2000 and 2050. As a result, in order to achieve Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID), water consumption efficiency must increase. United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) describes water stewardship as, the use of water in a socially fair, environmentally sustainable, and economically profitable manner. This is accomplished through a multi-stakeholder process that includes site and catchment-based activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Water is used to cool servers in data centers, which have an influence on local water resources. As a result, water stewardship efforts in data centers should concentrate on lowering water demands. Water stewardship initiatives should include efforts targeted at replacing water consumed and enhancing overall watershed health, in addition to water consumption reduction. To get the most sustainable solution for data center cooling, power and water use must be balanced.</p><p id="Par74">What we learned from previous economic dislocations, such as the dotcom bust and the 2008 financial crisis, is that data center providers adapt, emerge, and stay resilient. The acceleration of new business models, the data center hyper-scalersâ pledge to climate change and the leading sustainability leaders to rebuild the economy to a more sustainable future. The data center sector is the beneficiary of the shift to a socially distanced, contactless, work-anywhere new normal. Furthermore, some environmental, social, and governance (ESG) fund managers are outperforming the broader market during the pandemic, meaning new capitals invested in ICT and data center infrastructure have been more resilient. ESG, being the three main factors towards measuring sustainability and socio impacts of an investment in companies, is a data center in this case. ESG reporting towards sustainability has become compulsory in some organizations and countries around the world.</p><p id="Par75">With the global call for zero carbon emissions, there needs to be solutions put in place for the de-carbonization of data centers; these include: <italic>low carbon materials</italic>; <italic>embodied carbon</italic>, which is the carbon emitted in the manufacture process and transport of building materials; and <italic>operational carbon</italic>, which is the carbon load generated by the heating and power consumption of the building.</p><p id="Par76">The cleanest data centers are the ones that are not built at all. Digital transformation is a necessity to keep society running, especially in times of mass shutdowns to slow down the burden to our society of the transmission of COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to promote digital services and sustainable cost of ownership throughout the data center life cycle to improve human, social, and environmental welfare. The data center materials must comprise a circular nature, not harmful to the environment, simultaneously prolong the longevity of nature and human progress, and zero carbon emissions and waste. A circular economy enabled sustainable data center is designed for disassembly, where each connection of the data center can be taken apart and each material component can be refurbished, reused, recycled with zero waste and remake into a new material to give rise to a circular economic growth.</p><p id="Par77">In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, we put theory to practice by mapping the circular economy for a data center lifecycle. Sustainable materials that are both friendly to the environment and people can have a perpetual life of use throughout the data center lifecycle. We align with the UN-SDGs in the data center design to protect the planet and ensure all people enjoy peace and prosperity. We select data center sites to locations with affordable renewable energy and utilize CFE generation for net-zero energy consumption. We build data center products and facilities with sustainable materials. We operate and maintain data center with a circular thinking to keep materials in circulation for multiple uses.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The circular economy approach embraces end to end sustainability throughout the lifecycle for a data center and facilitates these changes for those who design, build, operate, and maintain them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43615_2022_191_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par78">In the last decade, significant progress has been made in data center efficiency and sustainability. Access to clean, renewable energy is vitally necessary. It is mandatory to be environmentally friendly when making decisions about using carbon free energy. Another critical component of an adaptive data center is advanced cooling technology that can result in 80% less energy and 85% less water. Global sustainability and data center leaders have made 100% clean energy pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote carbon free energy, and adopt a de-carbonization pathway of fossil fuel for data centers. SustainInfra is the new infrastructure standard to use naturally clean energy generation for data center sites with 99.999% uptime, achieved naturally by location design of data centers at the source of renewable energy grids powered by hydroelectric, wind, or solar. Sustainable data centers are measured by zero carbon, zero emission, and zero waste. They use naturally generated renewable energy, increased resource-use efficiency, environmentally sound technologies such as outside air cooling and circular economy processes to reuse, recycle, and remanufacture waste. All countries will take action to adopt a clean energy infrastructure for the ICT sector.</p><p id="Par79">CFE design enables a data center located anywhere to achieve the same net zero results; use of hydrogen, renewable gas with fuel cells â a technology to convert clean electric power generation on site â offers a good alternative. The use of fuel cells for powering data center racks is a reality today and can be a cornerstone of the data center industry establishing itself as a global energy leader. Powering data centers with fuel cells is a departure from the status quo model of purchasing power from a third-party utility provider who generates and delivers power. Instead, in a design technique called rack level fuel cells (RLFC), renewable power is generated onsite with fuel cells installed at the server rack level. When paired with renewable natural gas (RNG) as a fuel source, fuel cells become a carbon negative power generation choice, therefore allowing a data center to be independent from the electric gridâs cost, reliability, capacity, and carbon footprint.</p><p id="Par80">Keppel Corporation is a Singaporean conglomerate who has made sustainability an important part of their business. Keppel data centers partnered with NUS engineering department to develop an energy-efficient and cost-effective cooling system for data centers. Floating data centers are one solution to save energy and water; the IT equipment is cooled using the natural temperature of the water that data center floats on, thereby reducing water consumption.</p><p id="Par81">While environmental, energy, and carbon impacts are important with regard to sustainable data centers and the SDGs, social impacts play an important role as well. Data centers are hubs for major social media platforms globally; this allows for freedom of speech online, advertising, business opportunities, and social communication. The increase in sustainable data centers can lead to an increase to access to the internet to many more people around the world; this will in turn lead to more education opportunities for the less fortunate. Google, being a good example, allows people access to many forms of hyperlinks. They have enabled students to incorporate material for research projects, individuals to keep track of the stock market, and consumers to take advantage of unusual chances. With this increase in accessibility and sustainable data centers, more jobs are created. These are all important factors that are directly linked to the UN-SDGs.</p><p id="Par82">Cryptocurrencies and crypto mining is presently disproportionately hurting the most vulnerable, worsening social, and environmental difficulties for people already suffering from numerous forms of deprivation. For the crypto blockchain to exist, the mining process necessitates enormous processing power and a great deal of energy, and has a significant impact on data centers. The social impact of some cryptocurrenciesâ unsustainable trajectory disproportionately affects poor people, and vulnerable communities, where miners and other actors profit from economic instabilities, weak regulations, and access to cheap energy, and other resources. Therefore, sustainable data centers need to implement stricter policies in order to curb these negative impacts left by crypto mining. One solution would be to decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for blockchain and cryptofinance, by implementing low-carbon technologies and tools such as circular economy. Policies need to be also put in place by governments in order to support the sustainable data center, to limit the number of miners in a particular area. We need to also take note of the positive impacts crypto and the blockchain have on the UN-SDGs; (SDG 1) â cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based tokens enable the worldâs 2 billion UN-banked people to trade and transact, (SDG 3, 12, 14, 15) âsharing of important data securely and efficiently, it has the ability to allow for a more circular economy by ensuring excellent provenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par83">We promote sustainability, circularity, combined with the UN-SDG goals in this paper for the data center. We came to understand the latest research and practice, as well as looked at future strides being taken with the use of 4IR digital technologies. What does this mean for the future data center?

We need to reduce data center environment degradation by reducing carbon emissions. Resilience and 99.999% uptime are the primary goals of data center design and build. The next-generation data center should also include clean energy infrastructure, carbon free energy use, and net zero management; certain practices that were deemed groundbreaking a few years ago have now become common best practices. Every year, 50 million tons of e-waste composed of CRMs that may be reused, reconditioned, or repurposed are thrown to landfill. This quantity is expected to more than treble to 110 million tons by 2050. Therefore, by implementing circular approaches for future sustainable data centers would surely prove fruitful, particularly by controlling hazardous and unethical mining and materials processing. Finally, by following the ground rules set out by the UN-SDGs, we can manage engineering and innovations of data centers for a better environment and a better world for all.</p><p id="Par85">Data centers are ever-growing and complex facilities; therefore, sustainability is challenging in an unpredictable world and unexpected circumstances such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, which will affect our choices. We can conclude that while reducing the impact on the environment and energy consumption of data centers is important, it is not enough. Embodied and the operational emissions are both important when it comes to the design of data centers. Data centers have an important social role in how our daily lives function. Social media allows individuals to freely interact and share data with those they trust. Similarly, data centers make education available to everybody through a variety of online platforms and smart apps, and the ability to complete business transactions and others, using the blockchain and cryptocurrencies through responsible crypto mining. Most critically, there has been significant employment creation. Therefore, sustainability and efficiency measures have grown using a number of methods; these are in the form of circularity and its relevant tools as well as newer 4IR digital technologies.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>M.
