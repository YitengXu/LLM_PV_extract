Here, we demonstrate ZnTe:O highly mismatched alloys synthesized by high dose ion implantation and pulsed laser melting exhibiting optically active IB states and efficient sub-gap photoresponse, as well as investigate the effect of pulsed laser melting on the structural and optical recovery in detail. The structural evolution and vibrational dynamics indicates a significant structural recovery of ZnTe:O alloys by liquid phase epitaxy during pulsed laser melting process, but laser irradiation also aggravates the segregation of Te in ZnTe:O alloys. A distinct intermediate band located at 1.8 eV above valence band is optically activated as evidenced by photoluminescence, absorption and photoresponse characteristics. The carrier dynamics indicates that carriers in the IB electronic states have a relatively long lifetime, which is beneficial for the fast separation of carriers excited by photons with sub-gap energy and thus the improved overall conversion efficiency. The reproducible capability of implantation and laser annealing at selective area enable the realization of high efficient lateral junction solar cells, which can ensure extreme light trapping and efficient charge separation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep44399.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep44399" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep44399</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An intermediate band material has at least one partially filled intermediate band, by which the sub-band photons can be absorbed by exciting electrons from valence band (VB) to intermediate band (IB) and from IB to conduction band (CB), namely a two-step photon excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Highly mismatched alloys (HMA) like GaAs:N and ZnTe:O are predicted to be a class of promising IB materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For instance, the isoelectronic O in ZnTe leads to the formation of a narrow, O-derived band of extended states as an IB within the ZnTe bandgap, which is well predicted by band-anticrossing (BAC) model and confirmed in experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. So far, ZnTe:O ternary alloys have been produced by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques, in which low solubility of oxygen seriously limited the incorporation efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To overcome the solubility limitation of <italic>in-situ</italic> doping, ion implantation is an alternative technique which has unique advantages in precise controlling of depth and dose of dopants into the host materials. The attempts to fabricate ZnTeO ternary and ZnMnTeO quaternary alloying thin films have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The main disadvantage of the high-dose ion implantation is the generation of massive lattice disturbances such as additional strain and high density defects, and even nanocrystallization or amorphization of the implanted layer, which consequently degrades electrical and optical properties. Annealing processes out of thermo-dynamical equilibrium are needed to recovery lattice crystallinity while activating dopants with the preserved implanted profile. Pulsed laser melting (PLM) is an effective annealing technique widely used to achieve lattice recovery in the type of processed IB materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Such process produces a melt of the implanted layer and a rapid recrystallization by liquid phase epitaxy at the radiated area within the short laser pulse, leading to a high lattice crystal quality and producing a high impurity trapping that surpasses the equilibrium solid solubility limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The degree of properties recovery and thermal diffusion of dopants are strongly dependent on the condition of pulse laser melting. In this work, the PLM processes have been optimized on O-implanted ZnTe with extra high dose to achieve high crystalline quality and formation of optically active intermediate band. The crystalline and optical recovery has been assessed by various means and the carrier dynamics related to intermediate band has been investigated in details as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structural recovery of high-dose oxygen implanted ZnTe:O.</title><p id="Par3"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a and b)</xref> show the HRXRD 2θ-ω and ω rocking curves of (002) plane recorded for ZnTe single crystal, as-implanted and PLM annealed ZnTeO samples, respectively. The rocking curve of ZnTe single crystal has a small full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 108 arcsec, which indicates relatively high crystalline quality. For the as-implanted sample, additional broad tails appear on both sides of single crystal ZnTe peak in 2θ-ω curves. The appearance of the low-angel peak indicates the lattice expansion in crystalline domains which have larger lattice constant than that of the single crystal, while the broad tail at high angle is related to the formation of vacancies or/and their clusters. In the ω-scan rocking curves shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>, the shoulder feature at the low-angle side is more distinguished as the ω-scan method is highly sensitive to the short-range-order scattering caused by the scattering from local Bragg diffractions of agglomerated point defects or structural grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the rocking curve for the as-implanted sample, the thickness fringes cannot be clearly detected, which may be caused by a highly disturbed region or inhomogeneous strain distribution. High-energy implantation is expected to generate a variety of defects, such as randomly oriented mosaic blocks, dislocations, and large number of Frenkel pairs (vacancies and interstitials). As calculated by the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) software, the implanted layer has extremely high vacancy concentration of about 10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> within the projected range of 550 nm, which is beyond the critical dose for amorphization of ZnTe due to ion bombardment effect.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The HRXRD 2θ-ω (<bold>a</bold>) and ω rocking curves (<bold>b</bold>) of ZnTe (002) planes for ZnTe single crystal, as-implanted and PLM processed ZnTe:O samples.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep44399_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Upon laser annealing with energy of 0.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, the sample still exhibits similar characteristics with the as-implanted sample in 2θ-ω scan curve. It indicates that PLM processes driven by the energy of 0.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup> is not sufficient to cross the threshold of melting and thus can only eliminate partial vacancy-interstitial pairs. The implanted layer still exhibits the lattice expansion with a compressive strained layer in ZnTe (001) orientation, as illustrated by a separated peak at low diffraction angle in ω-scan rocking curve in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. As laser energy increases to 0.15 J/cm<sup>2</sup> and above, the observed peak tails in both sides of single crystal peak in 2θ-ω scan curves disappear. It suggests that the damaged lattice is almost recovered at higher laser power. The ω-scan curves for samples S2 and S3 illustrate that the peak separation become lower, which is caused by the shrinkage of lattice expansion and also the substitution of O ions into the ZnTe lattices. Meanwhile, a noticeable peak also appears at the right side of ω-scan curves for sample S2 and S3, and shoulders are also observed in their 2θ-ω scan curves. It is resulted from the partial crystalline domains which have a smaller lattice constant than the host ZnTe materials. As named highly mismatched alloying, oxygen and tellurium have large differences in atomic size and electronegativity, and oxygen ions prefer to substitute Te sites forming the stable Zn-O with shorter bond lengths, which has been confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, not shown here). In addition, it is noted that the sample annealed at 0.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> exhibits reduced intensity and broadened width of diffraction peak, indicating that excessive laser energy may lead to the bombardment effect on the implanted layer. Thus, in this work, the energy density of 0.15 J/cm<sup>2</sup> is desirable for the recovery of crystalline structures.</p><p id="Par5">The lattice evolution can be also evaluated directly by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a and b)</xref> show a bright-field and HAADF STEM cross-sectional images, respectively, of sample S2 after PLM processing with energy density of 1.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Overlapping black and white contrasts are visible at depths between surface and 550 nm in the bright field TEM image. This depth corresponds well to the projected range with high oxygen concentration, indicating that the implanted layer even after PLM process still consists of low density dislocations and/or dislocation loops of both vacancy and interstitial types. For HAADF STEM image, the intensity is approximately proportional to the square of the atomic number (Z-contrast imaging) and atomic column occupancy, allowing heavy atoms and vacancy clusters to be detected from the contrast features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The white contrast presented in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref> may be resulted from the segregation of Te at the grain boundaries induced by laser irradiation during PLM processes, in agreement with the fact that Te has a larger atomic number than that of other atomic species (Z<sub>Te</sub> = 52, Z<sub>Zn</sub> = 30, Z<sub>O</sub> = 8 and Z<sub>ZnO</sub> = 38).

The observed excellent lattice order and the bright spots in SAED patterns illustrate the substrate has the excellent crystallinity with a typical zinc-blende phase. In contrast, the ED diagram of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a)</xref> exhibits extra spots distributed between the main spots corresponding to the [0–11] zone axis. This unusual pattern is an indication of the presence of dislocations and staking faults within (111) planes. In both <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b and d)</xref>, an inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) analysis on the corresponding inset SAED patterns was performed. By filtering the corresponding spots with IFFT, the strain and atomic displacement maps in (111) plane are obtained and shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b and d)</xref>. As compared to the substrate, lattice distortion in the form of bent planes is visible and extra half planes on the (111) planes are observed as donated by arrows, which are the sessile Frank partial edge dislocations formed by condensation of self-interstitials, such as displacement of Te on {111} clos-packed layer because of their low formation energies. The extrinsic stacking faults observed in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b)</xref> might be associated with local aggregation of implanted oxygen or segregation of Te. Based on the analysis of TEM results, it can be concluded that the overall crystallinity of the implanted layer has been almost recovered and a small deformation remains after PLM process, which can be ascribed to the remaining edge dislocations, dislocation loops or extrinsic stacking faults.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>High resolution TEM image and the corresponding inset selective-area electron diffraction patterns of the implanted layer for sample S2 (<bold>a</bold>) and substrate (<bold>c</bold>); Inverse fast Fourier transformation images of the highlighted spot pairs in the patterns of implanted layer (<bold>b</bold>) and unimplanted layer (<bold>d</bold>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep44399_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Vibrational dynamics in ZnTe:O alloys</title><p id="Par7">To access the atomic displacement and impurity location in the ZnTe host lattice, Raman scattering characterization was conducted with a low laser density (0.2 mW) to avoid the heating effect and possible laser irradiation damage. As the bandgap of ZnTe material is about 2.26 eV, which is sandwiched between excitation energies of lasers with wavelengths of 633 nm and 514 nm, Raman scattering is under off-resonance and resonance conditions, respectively. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a)</xref> displays off-resonance Raman spectra for series samples of ZnTe bulk single crystal, oxygen-implanted ZnTe:O and PLM processed ZnTe:O materials (S1–S3). According to the Raman selection rule, in a backscattering geometry along (100) orientation, Raman spectra mainly consist of the allowed LO branch at 204 cm<sup>−1</sup> and a second-order LO (2LO) at 410 cm<sup>−1</sup> for the ZnTe single crystal sample. Although the transverse optical (TO) branch induced by the deformation potential mechanism is forbidden, a week TO branch at 177 cm<sup>−1</sup> and TO + 1LO zone-center phonon combination at 304 cm<sup>−1</sup> are poorly resolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This could be ascribed to the presence of faceting on ZnTe surface. For the oxygen-implanted sample S0, dipole-forbidden TO mode becomes distinct accompanied by the appearance of broad high-order LO phonons, strongly implying the enhanced short-range interaction between lattice displacement and the electrons in the lattice distorted layer. It is expected that the structural disorders induced by high dose implantation result basically in the breakdown of translational symmetry of the periodic lattice, which yields a partial relaxation of the q = 0 selection rule for first- and second-order Raman scattering, and phonons from the whole Brillouin zone can be observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, implantation induced localized subgap electronic states bound to defects will act as an intermediate state for extrinsic Frohlich interaction, which leads to an additional enhancement of forbidden scattering efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Additional anomalous vibrational modes is also observed at the low frequencies of 110, 124, 141 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which have been observed in ZnTe nanowires, laser-irradiated ZnTe epilayer and CdTe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These modes can be assigned to E<sub>LO</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>LO</sub>/E<sub>TO</sub> modes of the crystalline Te phase, respectively, indicating that ion implantation leads to serious Te segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Upon PLM process with the increased laser power density, deformation potential induced TO modes gradually vanish, which is an indication of weakened short-range interaction between lattice displacement and electrons due to lattice recovery. Another evidence for reduction of lattice distortion is the enhanced and narrow LO phonon observed in PLM processed samples, in agreement with the XRD and HRTEM analysis.

In general, the electronic and optical properties are vitally sensitive to the electron-phonon interaction, which is generally originated from deformation potential and Frohlich interaction. Normally deformation potential that involves the short-range interaction between lattice displacement and electrons determines the TO Raman scattering cross section ratio, while Frohlich interaction has a long-range nature and contributes to LO Raman scattering together with deformation potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

As shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>, the slight variation of optical bandgap and LO phonon energies has negligible effect on the changes of η, which are mainly determined by the phonon coherent lengths and exciton line widths (Γ), and often used to evaluate the domain sizes in ZnO, ZnTe, CdSe nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. For the excitons in ZnTe bulk single crystal (sample S0), electrons are more delocalized than the hole within the large crystalline domains, and the charge coupling to the lattice vibration is via long-range Frohlich interaction. The small value of η observed in the implanted sample is due to finite phonon correlation length. It is noted that high dose implantation leads to the nanocrystallization or even amorphous effect within the implanted region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. As a result, the superposition of wave function of electron-hole pairs is enhanced due to the localization of excitons in the nanograins, and the electric field caused by phonons can hardly polarize the excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Namely the intensity of exciton-LO phonon coupling is weakened, resulting in the decreasing of the intensity ratio. Additionally, lattice disorder introduces abundant and dispersed localized subgap electronic states bound to defects, which act as intermediate states for extrinsic Frohlich interaction to enhance the fundamental branch of LO phonons (1LO). The PLM process undergoing liquid-phase-epitaxy mechanism is proven to recrystallize the damaged layer and reduce the lattice disorders, and consequently, the Frohlich coupling strength is enhanced, causing the increasing of intensity ratio of 2LO/1LO. However, as mentioned above, excessive laser power energy is expected to lead secondary damage to the irradiated surface region, which may weaken the electron-phonon interaction.

Except for the implanted sample, the PL transients only exhibits a stretching exponential decay behavior (only fitted by the second term of Equation 2), which is typical for PL dynamics governed by non-radiative recombination with saturation effect of traps. As discussed above, the DLE emission at 1.6 eV is mainly originated from zinc vacancies in which hole trapping prevails. Since ZnTe single crystal has a low deep-level trap density, the fast PL decay component is hardly pronounced as the traps saturate very quickly even under low excitation power. High dose oxygen implantation (10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>) is expected to generate high density traps over 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> based on the SRIM simulation and the resultant higher hole concentration. In this case, trap saturation effect does not occur for sample S0 under the same low excitation power. The fast initial decay with shorter lifetime (τ<sub>1</sub> &lt; 45 ps) dominates the PL decay with a reduced weight of slow decay component. It can be understood by assuming that non-radiative recombination proceeds via both native defects and implantation induced centers with similar carrier capture cross-sections.

Given the large electron capture cross section of oxygen states, the relaxation time (τ<sub>CI</sub>) from CB to IB is much lower than the lifetime τ<sub>CV</sub> and τ<sub>IV</sub>. The fast capture into the high density oxygen states, in conjunction with the reduced CB-VB recombination rates due to low hole concentration, leads to the observed dominant IB-related emission and the relatively low intensity of CB-VB transition. The physics mechanism behind the fast relaxation is the strong interaction of extended band states in conduction band and isoelectronic oxygen states in IB as described by band-anticrossing model. Another important feature in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(d)</xref> is that the IB-VB transitions have a longer lifetime compared to that of DLE (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

As expected, the high electron capture cross-section and the long carrier lifetime in IB states allows the photo-excited electrons undergoing multiple transitions from the VB to IB states, and subsequently, these electrons through sub-gap transitions are driven under a bias and collected by the electrodes, giving contribution to the observed sub-gap spectral response. Note that in such M-S-M configuration, owing to the absence of electron blocking layer, the majority of photo-excited carriers in IB states are extracted directly by the electrodes, contributing to the photocurrent. From Hall measurement, the Fermi level of the PLM-processed ZnTe:O is still below the energy level of IB states, causing the small occupancy factor and thus low probability of transition from IB to CB states.

Undergoing a liquid phase epitaxy mechanism, the PLM significantly reduced interstitial-vacancies defective pairs and suppressed the nanocrystallization induced by high dose implantation. The formation of an intermediate band located at 1.8 eV above valence band was confirmed by photoluminescence, absorption characteristic and photocurrent response, which is consistent with the prediction of band anti-crossing model. The carrier dynamics suggests that a relatively long lifetime of carriers in the intermediate-band electronic states is resulted from the localization nature of oxygen state and the reduction of hole concentration. By suppressing the fast recombination of electrons at IB and holes at VB, it facilitates the charge-separation process and thus improve the overall photocurrent and photovoltaic conversion efficiency. The most important is that, the reproducible capability of ion implantation and pulsed laser melting at selective area enable the realization of lateral junction of solar cells, in which directions of light absorption and charge separation are perpendicular each other and thus improve carrier collection and overall efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par17">The samples employed in this experiments were (001) oriented single crystal p-type ZnTe grown by chemical vapor transport method.
