The quantities of electronic waste (e-waste) produced are expected to reach 44.4 million metric tons over the next five years. Consequently, the global market for electronics recycling is expected to reach $65.8 billion by 2026. However, electronic waste management in developing countries is not appropriately handled, as only 17.4% has been collected and recycled. The inadequate electronic waste treatment causes significant environmental and health issues and a systematic depletion of natural resources in secondary material recycling and extracting valuable materials. Electronic waste contains numerous valuable materials that can be recovered and reused to create renewable energy technologies to overcome the shortage of raw materials and the adverse effects of using non-renewable energy resources. Several approaches were devoted to mitigate the impact of climate change. The cooperate social responsibilities supported integrating informal collection and recycling agencies into a well-structured management program. Moreover, the emission reductions resulting from recycling and proper management systems significantly impact climate change solutions. This emission reduction will create a channel in carbon market mechanisms by trading the CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions. This review provides an up-to-date overview and discussion of the different categories of electronic waste, the recycling methods, and the use of high recycled value-added (HAV) materials from various e-waste components in green renewable energy technologies.

Electronics are increasingly used in transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, and security (Nithya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2021</xref>). However, these electronic systems become electronic waste (e-waste) when the owner unintentionally disposes them as waste with no intention of reuse. In this regard, e-waste is valuable for achieving a future circular economy and sustainability. Each product has its own material composition that requires recycling strategy. E-waste is an important industry growing at a rate of about 2 million tons (Mt) annually, potentially reaching 74.7 Mt in 2030 (Nithya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2021</xref>). This growth is mainly due to economic and rapid technological advances that affect lifestyles and industry. As new devices with the latest features enter the market, consumers will dispose older devices, thus increasing waste rates (Kaliyavaradhan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2022</xref>). In terms of quantity, e-waste is one of the fastest-growing global waste streams and significantly affects toxicity (Chung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). This massive and increasing amount of electronic waste disposal will have a long-term impact on the planet due to landfill pollution and informal recycling protocols, such as manual sorting, disassembly, and open burning of waste without using safety precautions (Mohammadi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>). Various electrical and electronic devices (EEEs) contain various toxic substances and precious metals (Gurgul et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2018</xref>). The heavy metals and toxic substances in e-waste include lead, nickel, antimony, mercury, cobalt, thallium, cadmium, beryllium, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants, etc. The e-waste is considered a reservoir of precious and base metals such as silver, gold, copper, and palladium. It serves as a secondary resource for recovery at low operating costs (Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2017a</xref>). The valuable recycled metals from electronic waste constitute the essential backbone for a plethora of applications.</p><p id="Par3">Energy is another important factor in our daily life, where fossil fuels are the main source of energy production. The US Energy Information Agency states that fossil fuels accounted for approximately 79% of the total US primary energy production in 2020 (US EPA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2017</xref>). Maintaining today’s fossil fuel consumption rate will deplete petroleum and natural gas resources in the coming 35–70 years (US EPA, 2017). Moreover, greenhouse gases (GHG) and toxic pollutant emissions account for more than 70% of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions (IRENA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>). In 2015, the Paris agreement stated the long-term temperature goal of “<italic>holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change</italic>.”</p><p id="Par4">Consequently, by 2050, the contribution of renewable energy to the global primary supply needs to increase from 12 to 65% to meet the projected energy demand (Abbasi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>; Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017</xref>). The green climate fund, established in 2010, was devoted to helping developing countries to mitigate and comply with climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Developed countries pledged to allocate US $ 100 billion each year from 2020 to 2025 to support the most exposed and small island developing states in adaptation and mitigation efforts (COP 26 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021</xref>). However, the transition to renewable energy in the world is practically limited. For this purpose, the recovered valuable metallic elements from e-waste recycling, such as copper, gold, silver, can be used as excellent catalytic materials in a variety of energy conversion and storage applications, such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (Jothi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2018</xref>), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (Sengeni et al. 2020), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) (Li &amp; Kanan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2012</xref>), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) (Hazra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2019</xref>). Specifically, water-splitting (OER and HER) to generate green H<sub>2</sub> from water is particularly interesting due to its 120 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup> energy density and CO<sub>2</sub>-free combustion (Karthik et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) restricts firms from continuing the commitment to being socially responsible in contributing to communities and economic growth (Abbas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>). The environmental analysis emphasizes the efficient management of electronic waste initiated by firms to implement CSR in various schemes for collection and recycling systems. (Al Halbusi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2022</xref>; Mubeen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2022</xref>). The emergence of social media technology has provided a platform for business firms to interact and communicate with customers, suppliers, retailers, and other stakeholders. Social media marketing application typically facilitates information sharing, and individuals' content generation, where technological innovations have played an essential role in improving firm’s performance (Yu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2022</xref>). The efficient collection and recycling management systems will support by the creation of a channel in international carbon market mechanisms. The carbon market can help countries to achieve article 6 of Paris agreement and adopt more ambitious mitigation targets in the waste sector (Deng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Hence, this review discusses the e-waste market value, e-waste generation, type, and composition. In addition, the available opportunities for e-waste recycling and the categories of recovered value-added materials for energy conversion and storage are highlighted and discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Global e-waste management market</title><p id="Par7">By 2026, the global electronics recycling market will cost $65.8 billion, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7%. Metals, one of the segments, are projected to increase at a CAGR of 13.3% and reach $ 53.6 billion by 2026. The electronics recycling market grew to $7.5 billion in 2021. In China, the market size is expected to hit $15.3 billion by 2026, and the annual compound interest growth rate is expected to be 16.3%. Canada and Japan are expected to grow by 9% and 8.9%, respectively. While a CAGR of 12.5% is projected for Germany, other European markets are expected to reach $6.1 billion. Europe is expected to have the largest market share in waste recycling. This is due to the rapid growth and adoption of waste recycling solutions, software, systems, and platforms in a variety of industries, such as security, automotive, marketing, healthcare, retail, information technology, and telecommunications. The USA, Canada, Japan, China, and Europe will promote a 12% CAGR in the global consumer electronics segment. These regional markets have estimated a total of $14.5 billion in 2020 and will grow to $35.4 billion by 2026. China is one of the fastest-growing countries in this regional market cluster. The Asia Pacific market will reach $5.8 billion by 2026, while Latin America will grow at a 16.2% CAGR (Global Electronics Recycling Industry 2022).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>E-waste generation, type, and composition</title><p id="Par8">Every year, about 40 million metric tons (Mt) of electronic waste are generated worldwide, accounting for 5% of total solid waste (Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017b</xref>). Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the top countries based on the generation of e-waste around the world (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). The European Union’s telephones, televisions, and computers generate about 9 million tons of e-waste. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) reported that the electronic waste from mobile phones will increase 18-fold. In contrast, computer e-waste will increase about fivefold, and television e-waste will double in 2020. Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the annual forecast of e-waste and the future forecast per capita (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). In 2019, about 53.6 million tons of electronic and electrical waste were generated worldwide. However, only 17.4% of this waste is adequately recycled (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par9"> Different categories of electronic waste</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Projection of e-waste generation (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Leading countries in the generation of e-waste worldwide (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">E-waste includes all non-functional or obsolete electronic items. Based on the European Directives of WEEE 2012/19/EU and 2002/96/EC ((WEEE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>), E-waste can be classified into ten categories, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. These categories include information technology and communications equipment, large and small home appliances, consumer equipment, non-industrial electrical and electronic appliances, lighting devices, toys, sports equipment, relaxation, non-infected medical devices, control and monitoring units, and automated devices dispensers ((WEEE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>). About 10% are accessories, 14% are electronic equipment, 34% are communication equipment, and 42% are home appliances (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par11">Electronic waste composition</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>WEEE categories according to the EU directive on WEEE</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">The structural composition of e-waste is generally determined by the electronic device’s manufacturer, its model and type, its date of manufacturing, and its age. IT and communication system chips contain more precious metals than home appliances (Chancerel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>). A mobile phone, for example, involves more than 40 elements, including precious metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), and palladium (Pd), and base metals such as tin (Sn) and copper (Cu) (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2009</xref>). Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> describes the metal composition of various electrical devices and components (Gautam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2022</xref>). Due to the rapid development in electronic industries and high consumer demand, electrical and electronic equipment have a shorter lifetime in developed and developing countries markets, leading to tons of electronic waste. The waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) contain many valuable metals like gold and copper and hazardous materials like lead. Therefore, recycling the metallic and non-metallic fractions from waste PCBs using environmentally friendly and suitable sustainable resource utilization techniques is in high demand. The rapid growth in technology creates significant challenges in developing e-waste management policies. The reuse market, the recycling industry, economic conditions, and waste segregation programs all have an impact on the management system of electronic waste (Gautam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"

ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>). Recycling e-waste can be informal or formal to extract valuable metals. Informal recycling refers to open burning to recover economically valuable metals, such as copper, aluminum, gold, lead, mercury, cadmium, palladium, and platinum. In addition, several chemicals, such as cyanide, HNO<sub>3</sub>, HCl and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, are highly toxic when used informally.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Closed Loop supply chain of e-waste (Islam &amp; Huda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>) with permission from Elsevier</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Proposed system to enhance the collection system worldwide</title><p id="Par14">Improving e-waste management begins with establishing a proper collection system. Everyone can easily download mobile phone applications from the Google play store. Creating an application allows all stakeholders who benefit from it to collect more e-waste. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> depicts a description of a design application for e-waste collection. The application is classified into four categories based on the type of e-waste and the beneficiary customer. The first category includes smart electronics (laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc.) as well as places to sell old electronics. The second category is divided into two subcategories: large-size equipment and small-size equipment. The customer can submit a request on the application for large-size equipment, and the call center will respond for more information on how to receive the old equipment. The small-size equipment can easily be dropped off by the customer to the available locations. The third category is more specialized in collection agencies, private sectors, and governmental agencies. This category contains the locations and dates of auctions that assist recycling factories in collecting raw materials. The final category includes a list of electronic points for each device. This category consists of the points equivalent for each device to sell and the year in which the device was manufactured. The customer can only replace the device with points for locations agreed upon and found via the application. The points can be exchanged for money by adding them to the customer's card, used in any purchasing market.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Design application for the collection of e-waste</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recycling processes of different types of e-waste</title><p id="Par15">In Egypt, Twelve WEEE management firms have obtained environmental approval from the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) and an operational permit from Industrial Development Authority and are listed as a formal sector. Ten are based in the Cairo governorate, and two are located in the Alexandria governorate. Four WEEE management firms conduct in-depth dismantling, and two show complete recycling on the WEEE, in which mechanical and chemical processes are involved in the recycling process. The in-depth dismantling WEEE management firms mainly collect, dismantle, and sort extracted fractions for resalable in the local market. In contrast, other bits are exported abroad to China, Korea, the USA, Belgium, and Italy. Specialized WEEE refining carries forward shredding, smelting and refining mechanical and chemical processes on exported WEEE fractions (United Nations Development Programme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Egypt’s recycling and recovery are limited due to the lack of environmental policies integrated with specific laws governing the disposal and management of WEEE, the lack of precise databases and accurate mapping of the e-waste in Egypt, illegal incineration and dumping of hazardous e-waste with other non-hazardous/hazardous solid waste, releasing highly toxic emissions of furans, dioxins, and other gases that possess imminence risks on the environment and human health. Furthermore, the lack of technical expertise and equipment related to the recycling of e-waste (Abdelbasir et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>). Currently, recycling is more expensive than exporting e-waste or metal concentrate due to the lack of local integrated treatment facilities and economic factors. Only 15–20% of Egypt’s electronic waste is locally recycled, according to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). The rest will go directly into incinerators and landfills (United Nations Development Programme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2015</xref>). Improving the electronic waste management system in Egypt requires raising public awareness among the relevant stakeholders, establishing an e-waste database, formulating national strategies and legislation, and gaining technical expertise in various recycling. Furthermore, capacity building with the best environmental practices (BEP) and technology available (BAT) (Abdelbasir et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Recycling of e-waste involves three significant steps (Atia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>): (a) Dismantling: the main process in e-waste recycling that focuses on identifying valuable or hazardous components for special treatment, (b) Upgrading: using metallurgical/mechanical processing protocols to prepare the desirable materials for a refining process, and (c) Refining: in the final step, purifying/retreating the recovered materials using chemical/metallurgical processing protocols to be functional for their original use. Disassembly and mechanical processes are primarily employed to pre-treat the e-waste to improve the content of the desirable materials. Several researchers have thoroughly reviewed and investigated the mechanical recycling of electronic waste (Cui &amp; Forssberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>; Matsukami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2015</xref>). On the other hand, mechanical recycling is inefficient at recovering precious metals. Finally, pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes are used to dissolve or melt the recovered metals to remove any existing impurities. This step involves a number of chemical reactions (Cui &amp; Forssberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>). This review provides a comprehensive literature survey on the methods used to recycle lithium-ion batteries, precious metals from mobile phones, and copper recovery from computer-printed circuit boards to provide a detailed research status for future studies.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Hydrometallurgical recycling of precious metals from mobile phones PCBs</title><p id="Par18">The number of mobile phone subscriptions globally has exceeded the total population. In 2017, mobile phone subscriptions for the global population reached 1.04 per capita (Tan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2018</xref>). Due to technological developments, social–psychological reasons, and upgrades, the lifespan of a mobile phone may be less than two years (Wilson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2017</xref>). In 2017 alone, 800 million mobile phones were discarded in China (Guo &amp; Yan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>). The massive consumption and rapid obsolescence of mobile phones pose serious challenges to the management of used mobile phones (WMP). WMPs are rich in resources, and their metal content is much higher than natural ores (Zeng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2016</xref>). On average, each ton of WMP contained 0.15 kg of palladium, 0.347 kg of gold, 1 kg of antimony, 3.63 kg of silver, 6 kg of lead, 10 kg of tin, 15 kg of nickel, and 128 kg of copper (Valero Navazo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2014</xref>). Recycling elements from electrical and electronic waste equipment is more cost-effective than mining (He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">High-quality precious metals, for example, silver and gold, are extracted via hydrometallurgical processing. The procedure is usually performed using different reagents. Cyanide leaching was the main reagent used for precious metals. The reaction is selective and leads to stable dicyanoaurate or dicyanoargentate complexes (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2021</xref>).

It accounts for about 25–30% of the total metals used, which is much higher than copper ore, representing 20–40 fold (Xiu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2017</xref>). Several techniques for recovering and reusing copper from PCB waste have been proposed (Xiu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2017</xref>). Pyrometallurgy (Flandinet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2012</xref>), hydrometallurgy (Fogarasi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>), and mechanical methods (Guo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2011</xref>) are among the techniques proposed.

As a result, the global mining production of cobalt for LIBs fabrication has exceeded 140,000 metric tons per year [98]. Furthermore, cobalt is produced as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining, accounting for 98 % of total cobalt production. However, the current rise in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in an extreme shortage of cobalt supply, resulting in a 311% price increase from $12.01/lb (2016) to $37.43/lb (2018) (Raj et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2022</xref>). Industrially, various Lithium-ion-based metal oxides, such as Li Ni<sub>1–x–y</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>y</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM), are rapidly being used in electric vehicles to produce high-energy electrode material (&gt; 600 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup>) (Pender et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2020</xref>). LIBs must go through several processes before they can be reused or recycled due to their various compositions and complex structure. The LIBs must first be classified before they can be discharged or deactivated, disassembled, and separated. Then, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> (Baum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2022</xref>), LIBs can be recycled using pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, or a combination of methods. The direct process of removing cathode material for reuse or reprocessing requires disassembling the LIB to obtain usable battery material (Baum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2022</xref>). Heating is used in pyrometallurgy to convert the metal oxides used in battery materials into their metal compounds or metal counterparts (Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2021</xref>). After pretreatment, the battery materials are heated in a vacuum or inert atmosphere to prepare mixed metal alloys containing Co, Ni, Cu, Fe, and slag containing Li and Al, depending on the battery composition. Pyrometallurgical methods require simpler pretreatment protocols, such as shredding or crushing, to prepare batteries for recycling and require fewer different processes to recycle LIB of various compositions, shapes, and sizes.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical direct, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical recycling methods for recovering Li–ion battery active materials (Baum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2022</xref>).

The pretreated battery materials with previously removed Al and Cu current collectors are typically extracted with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and oxalic or citric acids. Metals are extracted into a solution and selectively precipitated as salts via pH control or extracted using organic solvents containing extractants such as dialkyl phosphates or phosphinate (Baum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">A LIB is typically made of an anode, a separator, a cathode, an electrolyte, an outer case, and sealing parts. Spent LIBs typically contain 5–20% cobalt (Co), 5–10% nickel (Ni), and 5–7% lithium (Li), which are higher than those found in natural ores, 5–10% other metals such as copper, aluminum, and iron. In addition, 15% organic compounds, 7% plastic, with slight variation depending on the manufacturer (Zheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2018</xref>). The recovered metals from spent LIBs, such as Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, have a significant economic impact (Zheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2018</xref>). LIB cathode materials are mostly Li intercalation oxides, such as LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, and Li Ni<sub>x</sub> Co<sub>y</sub> Mn <sub>1-x-y</sub> O<sub>2</sub> (Wang &amp; Sun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2015</xref>). Also, Li Ni<sub>x</sub> Co<sub>y</sub> Mn<sub>1-x-y</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has emerged as the most prominent LIB cathode material. This is due to its large discharge capacity, low cost, stable structure, and good cyclic performance (Wang &amp; Sun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2015</xref>). On the other hand, the anode (negative active material) contains graphite as an active material with a copper foil coating; an electrolyte is required for ion transfer. It acts as a medium through which ions are moved from one electrode to the other, converting chemical energy into electrical energy (J. Baum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2022</xref>). LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, or Li (SO<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> are the electrolytes used in LIBs (Ren YH, Wu BR, Yang CW, Wu F).

The annual global amount of generated e-waste is expected to increase by 2030, reaching 74.4 by 2030 (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). Landfilling, a technique used to get rid of the e-waste, generates vast amounts of methane that contributed to the global warming problem over 100 years by 21 times more than that of CO<sub>2</sub> (Pariatamby et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>). Landfilling is responsible for almost 14% of global methane greenhouse gas emissions (Das et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). Due to the rigorous environmental regulations, the traditional approaches used for e-waste disposals, such as exporting abroad, burning using incinerators or landfilling disposal, are no longer valid options (Das et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Accordingly, the precious elements in the e-waste and the rising demand for the materials, along with the complications of the presently attainable raw materials, make the extraction of the valuable metals recycled from the e-waste an attractive alternative both economically and environmentally in diverse energy conversion and storage technologies. The metals extracted from the e-waste can be used as a water-splitting catalyst to generate hydrogen under specific conditions. Sustainable recycling of e-waste addresses the shortage of raw materials and minimizes energy consumption during the production of the raw materials while handling environmental concerns associated with hazardous materials generated from electronic waste streams (Das et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). Energy consumption predominantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions since the recorded CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion in 2018 was 33.1 Gt in 2018 (Zedalis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2017</xref>). Therefore, replacing fossil fuels with an alternative clean energy source will be vital in lessening global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The following section of the review elaborates on the recovered metals from e-waste and their application in energy conversion and storage technologies.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par29">a Hydrogen production</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par30">Waste-to-Hydrogen is the process that emphasizes producing hydrogen from recycling waste materials. Recently, there has been high interest from both governments and industry sides for utilizing hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels due to its unique properties (Lui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2020</xref>). Hydrogen produces zero greenhouse gas emissions when combusted since it produces only water in the vapor phase, which could significantly enhance the main energy sector decarbonization problem. Nevertheless, the currently used methods for hydrogen production are around 96% depend on fossil fuels, while almost 0.04% comes from renewable energy sources. In addition, 96% of hydrogen obtained from natural gas, petroleum oil, and coal leads to an annual production of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 560 million tons, representing 1.7% of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Zedalis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2017</xref>). Thus, renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, is used to attain the advantages of using hydrogen as a clean, efficient, and versatile energy source. Hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting is an example of producing hydrogen from a green energy source. This method includes running electricity through water using an appropriate catalyst to produce hydrogen and oxygen.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Green technologies for green hydrogen production</title><p id="Par31">Water electrolysis is an efficient, promising, and simple technique for the production of pure hydrogen (Anantharaj et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>). Nonetheless, external power is required to recognize the water-splitting process, rendering the water-splitting process economically inefficient. Instead, capturing and storing renewable energy from the surrounding environment, for instance, wind, solar, tidal or thermal energy, can be used for the electrolysis that could eliminate or reduce the need to utilize the external power supply (Wang and Li and Kazunari Domen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2019a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2019b</xref>). Solar energy is an inexhaustible clean energy source that can significantly decrease the overall energy utilization required for water splitting (Haiqing et al. 2018).</p><p id="Par32">For instance, external energy consumption can be minimized using solar cells that directly absorb the sunlight and yield voltage as an alternative to external power supply. Moreover, sunlight can be used as a heating source to generate the power needed in the water-splitting process using thermoelectrical (TE) devices (Haiqing et al. 2018). On the other hand, the natural vast availability of tidal and wind energy that can be harvested by triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to generate electricity that in turn can efficiently decrease the need for external energy demand. Thus, hydrogen production via the water-splitting process can be driven using solar cells, photoelectrode, TE, TENG, along with other devices such as pyroelectric, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2020</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Water splitting driven by different green energy systems (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Electrocatalysts for water splitting</title><p id="Par33">Ni, Cu and Fe are the common elements recovered from the electronic board and have shown excellent electrocatalytic activity in several electrochemical reactions in the application of energy conversions. Particularly, water electrochemical splitting reactions outperformed all other approaches upon using the appropriate catalyst (Karthik et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022</xref>). Among the non-noble metal catalysts, Ni and Mo revealed a hydrogen evolution activity that is on par with the activities of the hydrogen evolution of noble metal catalysts. Those metals are also widely utilized in the electronics manufacturing industry and have been classified by the IUPAC as endangered (Karthik et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Hence, in order to obtain an industrial profit-oriented water-splitting process, they need catalysts that can be recycled from electronic waste.

According to the recent IUPAC conference, the elements are classified by researchers according to their usage and availability (Karthik et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022</xref>). They unveiled elements extensively used as raw materials in the fabrication of electronic devices.

Consequently, the nanomaterial recovery from any application of nanotechnology is essential to achieve sustainable waste management that maintains the supply of the continuous raw material demand. Energy storage applications such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries rely on nanomaterials. The used materials in the super capacitive application are expensive. For instant, the cost of cobalt oxide increased from 20 $/Kg in 1998 to 60 $/Kg in 2017 (Freitas &amp; Garcia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>). In electrical storage devices, metal oxides are used as they have a high capacitance value which makes them good candidates. Ruthenium oxide was the first material studied due to its high surface area and conductivity (Aboelazm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>), showing an excellent capacitance of 1340 F g<sup>−1</sup> that is very close to its optimum theoretical capacitance of 1400 F g<sup>−1</sup> (Hu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2004</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">Various transition metal sulfides, oxides, hydroxides, and their respective composites have been investigated as supercapacitor materials, such as CuO, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and NiO (Atef et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>; Nathan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2008</xref>). Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub> showed significant theoretical capacitance among all the investigated transition metal oxides (TMOs) exhibiting capacitances of 3560 F g<sup>−1</sup> and 1360 F g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, besides they have multivalence states (Gomaa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>). The ultra-layered Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst has a capacitance of 548 F g<sup>−1</sup> (Sumanta et al. 2011). Subsequently, recovering cost-effective nanomaterials as catalysts from e-waste management has made waste recycling an indispensable necessity. MnO<sub>2</sub> is a recognized excellent pseudocapacitive nanomaterial that can substitute expensive and toxic candidates, particularly RuO<sub>2</sub>. Despite the Mn high abundance in nature, it is crucial to prevent abusing the natural resources to develop the technologies. On the contrary, the best way to obtain MnO<sub>2</sub> is through the Mn recovery from waste materials.</p><p id="Par39">United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) reported that about 160,000 tons of batteries are generated, and the annual Mn recovery could reach up to 20,000 tons (María et al. 2013). Moreover, a great amount of Mn in waste batteries can be used as a supercapacitor electrode (Sayilgan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2009</xref>). Gam et al. reported the use of MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers recovered from Zn–C Batteries (Gomaa et al. 2014).

The same group used cyclic voltammetry conversion as an alternative electrochemical technique for porous MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers recovery using spent Zn–C batteries. The process includes thermal treatment of 900 °C powder by cyclic voltammetry for 1000 cycles at 50 mV s<sup>−1</sup> in the potential window—0.1—0.9 V.

Key events such as Brundtland Commission’s report, Kyoto Protocol, the Millennium Development Goals in 2000, and recently the Paris Climate Treaty in 2015 showed the significance of sustainable practices. Consequently, businesses have considered serious action inside and outside their companies regarding sustainability issues hence augmenting attention in associating the business responses to sustainability. Sustainability initiatives by companies are on the rise, as an evidence by recent reports. Companies have recently tried to identify numerous ways to move toward a sustainable management system, such as cost-reduction profits, waste minimization, and improved resource management to sustain the raw materials for the coming generation (Bhaskar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">In 2015, the United Nations members embraced the sustainable development agenda for 2030 agenda which contains 17 goals with 169 targets for achieving this plan for sustainable development strategy (Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017b</xref>). Firms worldwide are directed to align their business to meet a minimum of one of the recent sustainable design goals. The definition of sustainability is broad and challenging for establishments to comprehend and implement (Dao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2011</xref>). The accumulative consumption rates of electronic devices, low lifetime, little availability of repairing options, and high remote working consequences increase demands for vigorous practical infrastructure and digital renovation across the firm's models (Rautela et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2021</xref>). Electronic waste is anticipated to experience a sudden increase due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Rautela et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2021</xref>). The irregular disposal methods of electronic waste lead to several health and environmental hazards since it contains hazardous and toxic elements (Rautela et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2021</xref>). From an economic point of view, E-waste is considered an ‘urban mine’ as it includes several precious metals, such as Fe, Au, and Cu, that can be recovered and reused as secondary raw materials, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> (Sharma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Circular economy approaches in the management of electronic waste (Sharma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2021</xref>) with permission from Elsevier</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_2925_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">Globally, recycled e-waste was approximately $57 billion in 2019 (Forti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>).

Therefore, recycling e-waste materials significantly increases the sustainability of primary raw materials and reduces greenhouse gas emissions (Sustainable Development Goals 13). The total equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted only from discarded air conditioners and fridges to the atmosphere is 98 Mt, which was not handled according to an environmentally sound manner (Sustainable Development Goals 3, 11, 12, 13).

Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities emphasizing per-capita environmental impact. Goal 12: Responsible production and consumption that focuses on the life cycle assessment of each product and its impact on the environment, besides the waste prevention and reduction techniques for individual products (Sharma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">In contrast, a more precise sub-indicator must be performed to monitor the growth of the electronic waste such as firms’ models through which the producer preserves the responsibility of their products, enhancing the recovery rate (Morseletto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2020</xref>). Adapting these models could increase the amount of captured materials used in electronic applications while emerging a new relationship with the customers and increasing sustainability for the coming generations.</p><p id="Par46">Global energy consumption increases as a result of the worldwide increase in the population.

The current population relies on supplying the energy demand depending on fossil fuels, resulting in drastic climate problems (Acheampong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>). Consequently, it was a must to inspire clean energy to substitute fossil fuels. It was planned to supply 20% of the global energy demand from clean renewable energy resources in 2014 (Acheampong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>).

The end-of-life of these products has been in landfills and recycling centers, creating new challenges among stakeholders. Government entities and politicians are attempting to provide solutions for the hazardous components disposed off in landfills. Furthermore, scientists and international organizations are working to develop various processes for recycling valuable materials for use in renewable energy technologies. Electronic devices contain many valuable materials and, when appropriately extracted, can be more valuable than those present in the ore. Policymakers have begun implementing e-waste management policies that allow technology transfer to recover high-quality materials from different types of e-waste. This would help them to meet the sustainable development and Paris Agreement goals. This review described the various hydrometallurgical methods used to extract materials from printed circuit boards and lithium-ion batteries.

Technology development beyond research creates an enabling environment that includes education and awareness-raising. The appropriate and reliable mix of the materials extracted from electronic waste as an eco-design catalyst in different renewable energy technologies has emerged as a hot topic. As explained in the review, some researchers started by recovering copper from printed circuit boards and its use for supercapacitors and water-splitting techniques. However, further research is needed to recover other materials such as Cobalt, Iron, Manganese, and Lithium and use them in various renewable energy technologies. From the presented analysis, future directions may include:</p><p id="Par50">The use of precious metals, copper, and other materials extracted from electronic waste as catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, ammonia production, and green hydrogen production.</p><p id="Par51">The use of the extracted materials in renewable energy technologies, such as green biogas production, due to its high methane production efficiency.</p><p id="Par52">The use of recovered materials from e-waste for water treatment and desalination.
