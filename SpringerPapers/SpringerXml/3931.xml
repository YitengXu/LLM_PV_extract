The nanostructured PTB7 layer is prepared using a ternary solvent composed of chlorobenzene, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN). Adding DIO and 1-CN enhances the ordering of PTB7 chains and results in a nanostructured polymer surface. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction results reveal that the SqD of the nanostructured PTB7 and fullerene layers forms the BHJ with little intermixing between the polymer and the fullerene domains compared to the BHJ formed by the deposition of the blended PTB7 and fullerene solution (BSD). The OPV utilizing the SqD processed BHJ (SqD-OPV) exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.43%, which is similar to that when the BSD processed BHJ (BSD-OPV) is utilized. Furthermore, the SqD-OPV exhibits an excellent thermal stability. The SqD-OPV maintains its initial PCE even after thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 days, whereas the BSD-OPV maintains 78% of its initial efficiency under the same condition.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_9167.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is the most widely used photo-active layer system for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The BHJ is mostly formed by the blended solution deposition (BSD), where a BHJ is prepared by depositing a blended solution of electron donating polymer and electron accepting organic semiconductors. The fullerene derivatives have been used mainly as the electron accepting organic semiconductors. Nowadays, many efficient non-fullerene acceptors have been reported to achieve excellent solar cell performance in the BHJ OPV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The BSD process is effective in forming the heterojunction with a large surface area. However, delicate controls of the processing conditions (e.g., donor to acceptor ratio, amount of processing additives, types of solvents, processing temperature, and additional annealing process) are required to maximize the solar cell performance by inducing the nano-scale phase separation of the donor and the acceptor materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">An alternative method of forming the BHJ through sequential deposition (SqD) has recently been reported by several researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The SqD process is more flexible in finding an optimized condition because the system can be optimized by independently controlling the thickness of each layer. However, finding a method of enhancing the heterojunction area and a proper solution for the top-layer that does not dissolve the bottom-layer are required to achieve efficient SqD processed OPVs (SqD-OPV). Yang <italic>et al</italic>. claimed that the SqD-OPV based on P3HT/PCBM had the potential to show a better performance than a BSD processed OPV (BSD-OPV) because of a significant reduction in the bimolecular charge recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The Schwartz group found that the BHJ morphology formed by the SqD process was almost identical to that formed by the BSD process and could be controlled using tailored semi-orthogonal solvent blends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In terms of the BHJ morphology, pure polymer and fullerene domains and polymer and fullerene intermixture were reported to co-exist in the BHJ prepared by the BSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

However, as the BSD process does, the SqD-OPVs require an additional thermal annealing step to obtain a large heterojunction area because of the ineffective penetration of fullerenes into the polymer layer. The post thermal annealing process might form polymer and fullerene intermixtures.</p><p id="Par6">Therefore, it would be desirable for SqD-OPV that the crystalline and nanostructured polymer surface is preformed and utilized to form a large-area heterojunction with fullerene without an additional thermal annealing step. We chose the poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-thylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl] (PTB7) as the electron donating polymer because it showed an efficient solar cell performance when it was fabricated by the BSD process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we have developed a method of increasing the surface area of (PTB7) film by roughening the surface of the polymer in nanoscale using a ternary solvent containing two different polymer chain ordering agents (OA). The roughened surface of the PTB7 film prepared by the ternary solvent was utilized to construct a BHJ with fullerene without a thermal annealing step via the SqD process. The SqD-OPV showed superior solar cell performance compared to the SqD-OPV prepared by a single solvent. Furthermore, the SqD-OPV performance was comparable to that of the BSD-OPV. The thermal stability of SqD-OPV was also significantly superior to that of the BSD-OPV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussions</title><p id="Par8">The PTB7 bottom layer surface must first be roughened to construct a BHJ with a large heterojunction area through SqD. This was possible by enhancing the ordering of polymer chains because the amorphous polymer formed a smooth surface, whereas the crystalline polymer had a rough surface.</p><p id="Par9">A small amount of additive with a lower vapor pressure and a little solubility for the polymer was added to the host solvent to enhance the ordering of polymer chains. The low-vapor pressure additive would reduce the vapor pressure of the solvent and allow the polymer chains more time for ordering. In addition, the remaining additive would promote the polymer precipitation after the host solvent evaporation, thereby leading to the formation of ordered polymer domains. This would be more effective in the SqD process than in the BSD process. In the BSD process, bulky fullerenes that forms a single layer with polymer will hinder the polymer ordering during the film formation.</p><p id="Par10">In this study, we have developed a ternary solvent composed of chlorobenzene (CB), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) to enhance the ordering and roughness of the polymer bottom layer. CB was used as the main solvent for dissolving PTB7. DIO and 1-CN were used as polymer chain ordering agents (OA). DIO was chosen as one of the OAs for PTB7 because of its negligible vapor pressure and because PTB7 was insoluble in DIO. DIO has been used as a processing additive to fabricate the BHJ through the BSD process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Beaujuge <italic>et al</italic>. stated that favorable nano-scale morphologies could be formed from the solution containing a low vapor pressure additive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. 1-CN was utilized for the ternary solvent system to further enhance the ordering of the polymer chains. The planar π-conjugated structure of 1-CN was expected to assist the ordering of PTB7. In the cooling crystallization process, a high supersaturation usually results in the creation of a higher number of nucleates and a smaller size compared to low supersaturation. Similarly, in the evaporation-induced crystallization process, the evaporation from high to low supersaturation usually results in a larger number of crystals with a smaller size. 1-CN had a higher boiling point than CB and specific π–π interactions with the polymer main chain. Hence, PTB7 dissolved in the ternary solvent would form a higher saturation than that dissolved in the solvent containing only CB, leading to a larger number of nano-sized domains on the PTB7 film surface and resulting in an enhanced surface area.</p><p id="Par11">The binary solvent consisting of 95 vol% CB and 5 vol% of DIO was first prepared. The ternary solvents were then prepared by varying the ratio of the binary solvent to 1-CN. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the root mean square roughness (<italic>R</italic><sub>q</sub>) values of the films obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The <italic>R</italic><sub>q</sub> value of the PTB7 films increased with the increase of the 1-CN concentration and reached maximum (1.59 nm) at the binary solvent:1-CN ratio of 94 vol%:4 vol%. This value decreased after further increase in the 1-CN portion. It is thought that when the concentration of the 1-CN was further increased, the domains of PTB7 were formed at lower supersaturated state, and consequently the surface roughness of the film was reduced.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Root mean square roughness (<italic>R</italic><sub>q</sub>) values of the PTB7 films prepared by various ternary solvents.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>vol% of the binary solvent (95 vol% CB and 5 vol% DIO)</p></th><th><p>vol% of 1-CN</p></th><th><p><italic>R</italic><sub><italic>q</italic></sub> value</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>1.46</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>97</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1.17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>94</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>1.59</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>88</p></td><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>0.82</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>0.536</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>0.425</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a comparison of the topology and height profiles of the PTB7 films prepared by the single and ternary solvents denoted as PTB7(S) and PTB7 (T), respectively.

The PCBM was dissolved in the solvent consisting of 96 vol% dichloromethane (DCM) and 4 vol% diiodomethane (DIM) to prepare the PCBM solution. The DIM helped in the conformal coating of the PC<sub>70</sub>BM layer on the PTB7 bottom layer by reducing the vapor pressure of the solution. We investigated whether the PCBM solvent dissolved the PTB7 bottom layer by spin-coating the PCBM solvent onto the PTB7 layer. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the absorption intensity change for the PTB7 films before and after the PC<sub>70</sub>BM layer deposition. The black lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b) and (c)</xref> denote the absorption spectra of the as-prepared PTB7(S) and PTB7(T) films (film ‘PTB7’ in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>), respectively. All the films showed a similar absorption intensity, regardless of the solvent types. The similar absorption intensity indicated that the PTB7 film thicknesses were not affected by the addition of 1-CN or DIO. Subsequently, the PCBM solution was spin coated on the PTB7 bottom layer (film ‘PTB7/PCBM’ in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>). Comparing the absorption spectrum with PTB7, PTB7/PCBM showed an increased absorption (solid circle in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b) and (c)</xref>) at the wavelength corresponding to the PCBM absorption. The PCBM top-layer was selectively removed using diiodomethane (DIM), which was a good solvent for PC<sub>70</sub>BM, and a non-solvent for PTB7 (film ‘PTB7/[PC<sub>70</sub>BM]’ in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>) to investigate the change in the PTB7 bottom layer thickness after spin coating with the PCBM solution. The open circles in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b) and (c)</xref> represent the absorption spectrum of the corresponding PTB7 bottom layer after removal of the PCBM top layer. The absorption intensity of PTB7(S) decreased from 0.40 to 0.19 spectra as PTB7(S) became PTB7(S)/[PCBM] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>), indicating that ~52% of PTB7(S) was removed by the PCBM solution. The absorption spectrum of PTB(S) washed by the pure DCM solvent is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1(a</xref>) in Supporting Information. As shown, about 90% of PTB(S) was removed by the DCM solvent. This result contrasted with PTB7(T), which maintained 90.5% of its initial thickness. This difference was thought to be caused by the difference in the ordering of the polymer chains. The domains of the ordered PTB7 chains would prevent the PTB7 dissolution by blocking the DCM penetration. According to the absorption spectrum results, the ordered domain of PTB7 would not be easily removed by the PC<sub>70</sub>BM solvent and would maintain its morphology even after the SqD process. This expectation was confirmed by the glazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) results and will be discussed later.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Film preparation procedure by the SqD.

The <italic>R</italic><sub>q</sub> value of PTB7(s) was greatly enhanced from 0.69 nm to 7.55 nm after the PCBM removal from PTB7(S)/[PCBM]. However, the surface morphology of PTB7(T)/[PCBM] ((Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d)</xref>) indicated that the film morphology of PTB7(T) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>) was relatively well preserved even after the SqD process.</p><p id="Par16">These surface morphology changes were attributed to the partial dissolution of the less ordered PTB7 chains by the PC<sub>70</sub>BM solution during the SqD process. The dissolution amount would depend on the chain ordering of PTB7, which was coincidental with the absorption intensity difference between the PTB7 and PTB7/[PCBM] films in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. PTB7(S) was expected to have a lower polymer chain ordering. Hence, a large amount of PTB7 would be dissolved by the DCM (PCBM solvent), followed by the instant formation of the blended solution of PTB7 and PCBM. Furthermore, large PTB7 and PCBM domains would be formed during the DCM evaporation because of the low solubility of PTB7 in DCM. Meanwhile, a slight diffusion of PCBM into the PTB7(T) layer was expected for the PTB7(T)/PCBM film during the SqD process, which would lead to a further increase in the heterojunction area between PTB7(T) and PCBM. Consequently, the nanostructured PTB7(T) and PCBM layers formed a heterojunction with a large surface area. This result showed that the surface morphology of PTB7 prepared first had an important influence on the heterojunction morphology of the PTB7/PCBM film.</p><p id="Par17">The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) experiments were performed to obtain structural information, such as molecular orientation, intermolecular distances, and crystallite sizes.

A strong diffraction peak by the PCBM domain was still observed from the PCBM-removed PTB7(S)/PCBM film (PTB7(S)/[PCBM]) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d)</xref>), implying that a significant amount of the PCBM remained in the PTB7(S)/[PCBM] film. The AFM and GIXRD results indicated that PTB7(S) with a relatively low crystallinity was dissolved by the PCBM solvent. A solution containing a mixture of PTB7 and PCBM was then instantaneously formed. Thereafter, phase separation occurred, and the BHJ with a large domain was formed during the solvent evaporation. This BHJ formation process was similar with the BHJ formed by the BSD process utilizing the blended solution of PTB7 and PCBM. However, the AFM results showed that the size of the PTB7 and PCBM aggregations in PTB7(S)/PCBM was significantly bigger than that in PTB7:PCBM prepared through the BSD process because PTB7 had poor solubility for DCM.</p><p id="Par20">It was reported that the pure polymer and PCBM domains and the PTB7 and PCBM intermixture co-existed in the BHJ prepared through the BSD process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, the PTB7(S)/PCBM was expected to have these domain types.</p><p id="Par21">The DIM used for the selective removal of the PCBM was the non-solvent for PTB7. Thus, the DIM would not be able to completely penetrate into the polymer domains. As a result, a complete removal of the PCBM, which existed in the PTB7 and PCBM intermixture, would be difficult. These results indicated existence the intermixture that was formed in PTB7(S)/PCBM fabricated by the SqD process. Comparison of normalized absorption spectra of PTB7(S)/[PCBM] and PTB7(S) support that the PCBM is remained in the PTB7(S)/[PCBM] film (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1(b</xref>) in Supporting Information).

As expected from the AFM and GIXRD results, the SqD(T) exhibited an excellent solar cell performance with an open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) of 0.768 V, a short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>) of 14.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, a fill factor (<italic>FF</italic>) of 0.654, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.43%. The PCE of SqD(T) was significantly higher than SqD(S) (2.33%) and similar with that of the optimized BSD OPV (7.17%). The enhanced PCE of SqD(T) was mainly attributed to the higher <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> compared to that of SqD(S). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of those OPVs were coincidental with the <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>).

The surface morphology investigation using the AFM (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> in Supporting Information) revealed that the surface roughness of the PTB7 film was enhanced by processing with the binary solvent.
