The 2019 United Nations World Water Development Report provided a dramatic status of world water, however without questioning the main drivers of an imminent water crisis, that were unbounded, unequal, economic, and population growth, within the context of reducing resources in a finite world. Despite the report was a small step forward in awareness, still, it was not proposing satisfactory remedies. With business-as-usual, without acting on the drivers of water scarcity, regional water crises were inevitable in the next 3 decades, starting from Africa. Constrained by political, financial, and energy burdens, the technological improvements that have helped humanity to deal with the increased demand for water, food, and energy over the last 70 years, were likely not enough to avoid the water crisis. On top of forecast is the Covid19 pandemic. Coronavirus cases are (August 4, 2020) 18,446,065 and fatalities are 697,202 worldwide, and still growing. The containment measures enforced for Covid19 infection following the examples in the United Kingdom have already produced significant damage to the world economy. This will limit social expenditures in general, and the expenditures for the water issue in particular. The water crisis will consequently become worse in the next months, with consequences still difficult to predict. This will be true especially for Africa, where the main problem has always been poverty. There is the opportunity of significant health, food, and water crisis, especially in Africa. While the concepts of washing hands and social distancing that are difficult to apply haven’t produce so far major issues with the Covid19 outbreak in Africa, borders closure, restrictions on movement, and more poverty will translate in a lack of food and water potentially much more worrying than the virus spreading.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Water

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">During the last 70 years, the world has experienced unprecedented, dramatic growth, characterized by a sharply increasing population and economy, accompanied by a generally increasing life span and quality of life, all phased with the growing use of energy, food, and water (ourworldindata.org). Unbounded growth in a finite world of finite resources is however impossible, as there is the certainty that growth and resources will eventually collide (Boulding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1973</xref>). Before the Covid19 outbreak, water scarcity was more worrying than food shortages (Boretti and Rosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). The water crisis is indirectly related to energy and financial crises (Boretti and Rosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). The energy problem was also a growing concern. Situation at the local level, especially in Africa, were expected to be much worse than the global average (Boretti and Rosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">When the first draft of this paper was written, there were practically no Covid19 cases in Africa. Then, things have changed, there are now more Covid19 cases in Africa, but still nothing similar to what happened in Western Europe and other parts of the world (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ourworldindata.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://ourworldindata.org</ext-link>). This reduced direct effect of the pandemic makes even stronger the case, supported in this paper, that Covid19 will affect water scarcity in Africa through more complex global and local mechanisms related to freedom of movements, economy, poverty, and supply of good and services, than simply the increased use of water for sanitation because of the washing hands to prevent the spreading of the virus. In particular, the containment measures will impact more than the virus itself, also affecting water scarcity. The epidemiological models such as those promoted in the United Kingdom (Ferguson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>) to introduce lockdowns have been proven to be wrong (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020b</xref>). Wrong models in Western Europe cannot be correct in Africa. Additionally, global economic downturns will affect Africa.</p><p id="Par4">The United Kingdom has adopted harsher containment measures than other countries such as the Netherlands or Sweden based on the wrong models. They had more, rather than less, fatalities, as this is not the major issue (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>). Protection of the vulnerable for age or comorbidities, especially in the nurses’ homes, the most affected by the virus fatalities, seems to have made a difference in Western Europe (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">From a demographic perspective, the average age in Western Europe is much higher than Africa, same of life expectancy. Restrictions above certain levels to the healthy population, at least in Western Europe, have been counterproductive (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>). There has been no further benefiting from looking down large sectors of the healthy population or forcing people to wear masks while forgetting the protection of the sick for other morbidities or aged (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The lesson we learned so far, is that Covid19 is more infective and more lethal in countries where this pandemic has been used for political reasons, and also where there has been more focus on limiting the movements of the healthy population, rather than preventing the infection of the vulnerable (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>). The mortality of Covid19 has been mostly centered on those vulnerable for age or comorbidities (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>). Statistically (data from <ext-link xlink:href="http://ourwoldindata.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://ourwoldindata.org</ext-link>), the worst countries in the world for Covid19 infection fatalities are Belgium and the United Kingdom, and there are reasons for this (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020c</xref>). Africa should not follow their paths for what concerns containment measures, as the lockdowns can be counterproductive.</p><p id="Par7">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is an up-to-date statistic of Covid19 cases and fatalities (from <ext-link xlink:href="http://ourwoldindata.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://ourwoldindata.org</ext-link>). The daily confirmed new coronavirus cases are not a reliable parameter to compare nations, as the number of tests per 1000 people dramatically varies across countries. Without tests, there are no cases. With more tests, there are more cases for a similar intensity of the outbreak. The number of tests for Africa is mostly not even reported. The number of cases for Africa is generally less than in Western Europe, but without having uniform testing, this result is not reliable.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Covid19 pandemic around the world.

The test grows exponentially small amounts of DNA looking for “<italic>viral sequences</italic>” also amplifying contaminations. Looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, identification of a single pathogen is troublesome. The PCR only tells if the viral sequence is related to the family of coronaviruses. The PCR test also does not give the viral load. Having only a few viruses does not cause illness or likely spreading. Having many viruses causes sickness and significant spreading. Thus, the number of infections is not particularly indicative. From an epidemiological perspective, it would be better to understand who has antibodies from Covid19 infection, i.e. how many people are immune from reinfection, or at least have been infected already, but almost nobody has this number.</p><p id="Par9">The number of deaths per million is the most trustworthy indicator of the severity of the Covid19 outbreak so far (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref>). It has a delay versus the spreading of the virus. Africa has been so far the less affected continent of the world. The below graph needs to be coupled to the trajectories of Covid19 infection to understand which countries have “<italic>bent</italic>” the curve.</p><p id="Par10">While Belgium achieved a peak of daily fatalities above 25 per million (7-days rolling average) and the United Kingdom had a peak of daily fatalities of almost 15 per million (7-days rolling average), apart from South Africa and Swaziland that have growing cases now at above 4 and 1 daily fatalities per million (7-days rolling average), every other country of Africa are still below 0.5 daily fatalities per million (7-days rolling average).</p><p id="Par11">It may be argued that the fatalities of Africa are underrated, or that the fatalities of Western Europe are overrated, with many cases of default attribution to Covid19 of fatalities produced by other causes. However, for what is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, it seems that not having been used as a political weapon, Covid19 has produced so far much less direct fatalities in Africa than everywhere else, despite the medical background of Africa is certainly the worse on Earth.</p><p id="Par12">This is the background information from which to move to analyze the water-Covid19 nexus in Africa. The work aims to discuss Covid19 pandemic as a further driver of water scarcity in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Water-Covid19 nexus in Africa</title><p id="Par13">The major effect of Covid19 on water scarcity in Africa is not through the increased demand for sanitary uses of water, but the indirect effect on the economy, poverty, freedom of movement, inequality, and scarcity. Few works have discussed the water-Covid19 nexus in Africa from the specific point of view that washing hands and enforcing hygiene is more difficult where water is scarce, and thus more fatalities are expected for Africa because of the lack of water.</p><p id="Par14">Anim and Ofori-Asenso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>) notices as access to water are the key to infectious disease control and prevention. Thus, limited access creates a challenge for transmission control. Anim and Ofori-Asenso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>) concludes that inequalities in access to safe water can make spreading easier.</p><p id="Par15">Amuakwa-Mensah et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>) discusses the increased practice of hands washing in the wave of the Covid19 spreading.</p><p id="Par16">Haddout et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020a</xref>) discussed water scarcity in the slums, noticing that this may affect negatively hygiene.</p><p id="Par17">Haddout et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020b</xref>) discusses the insufficient water for washing likely to worsen the coronavirus outbreak in the poorest nations.</p><p id="Par18">From what has been measured so far, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, washing hands more or less easily had minimal impact on the spreading of the virus in Africa. The number of fatalities for African nations has been much less than those in other countries such as Belgium or the United Kingdom, where there is no water scarcity, and additionally, for those infected and in need of medical attention, the health system is generally much more funded and effective. Thus, Covid19 is not, or at least not only, a problem of washing hands.</p><p id="Par19">It is the arguing of this work than the Covid19 epidemic across the globe will do more damage in Africa indirectly, through the global recession, increased local poverty, lockdowns, practical access to food, water and health services, for the mechanisms proposed hereafter for what concerns water, that directly through the spreading of the virus, that could be exacerbated from not washing hands enough, but also depends on many other factors still far from being fully understood, at least in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Desalination in Africa</title><p id="Par20">The recent work (Takouleu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>) has finally pointed out as the major issue with water scarcity in Africa is primarily economical, as energy-intensive and expensive water desalination and purification, and distribution, could solve most of the water issues for Africa. Also the health system and the quality of services in general in Africa are an economical problem.</p><p id="Par21">In Saudi Arabia, there is no river or lake, and all the tap water is from desalination (smartwatermagazine.com <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). Desalination water has not only domestic uses, but it is also used for agriculture and farming with significant production (smartwatermagazine.com <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>) and industrial uses.</p><p id="Par22">Africa has many arid lands even close to the coast where desalination could help considerably, if only they could afford (Takouleu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>). Also, regions far from the coast could benefit if infrastructure could be affordable (Takouleu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>). This is a problem of availability of financial means first, and then the availability of energy next. Desalination is expensive and energy-intensive. The first problem of Africa since the nominal end of colonialism is financial independence. Poverty is the major issue of Africa (Patel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Many African countries are now understanding that water cannot be afforded without money.</p><p id="Par24">As written in Takouleu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>), “<italic>Several African countries are increasingly turning to non</italic>-<italic>conventional water resources such as desalination. This new policy in favour of desalination stems from the scarcity of surface and groundwater resources in some parts of the continent</italic>.” (Takouleu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>) properly concludes. “ <italic>it is not absolutely necessary to have access to the sea to desalinate water. Even so, the 35 African countries with a seafront are obviously the first concerned by the desalination option: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Tunisia</italic>.”</p><p id="Par25">Hence, it is important to realize the relevance of desalination, and water infrastructure, and the role of energy, wealth and financial independence, for the future of water in Africa. Every improvement of these criteria will results in improvement of water availability. Opposite, every decline. Covid19 may act as a declining factor for all the three criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Global growth in population, economy and energy demand</title><p id="Par26">The trend in global population, economy and energy demand is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> World total primary energy supply according to the IEA (International Energy Agency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>).

It is this dynamic of travel restrictions and consumer spending that has economists contemplating whether the Covid19 pandemic could lead to a global recession on the scale of the Great Depression (Duffin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par116">The effect of the previous epidemic such as SARS in Asia, or Ebola in West Africa, is not an indication for the costs of Covid19, being the problem in these outbreaks much more local. This time the issue is global, and this time it is also affecting Europe and the US, previously practically immune.</p><p id="Par117">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> presents in (a) the latest GDP per capita of China, the United States, and selected other countries. There is no sign of any sharp decline associated with the 2003 SARS and 2014 Ebola outbreaks. SARS first emerged in China’s Guangdong province before spreading to other countries. The virus infected about 8000 people, claimed almost 800 lives worldwide and only reduced by 0.5–1% of China’s growth in 2003, according to various estimates (Feuer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). The effect on the global economy was minimal. Regarding Ebola, (US CDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2016</xref>), as of February 28, 2016, there were 28,639 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of Ebola and 11,316 deaths from Ebola during the 2014 epidemic in West Africa. In comparison, there were 2427 reported cases and 1597 deaths in all other known cases and outbreaks of Ebola combined. According to the 2014 projections, an estimated $2.2 billion was lost in 2015 in the gross domestic product (GDP) of the three countries most affected. While this may certainly have been relevant to the economies of the three countries, it is irrelevant to the global GDP.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> The latest GDP per capita of China, US, and selected other countries.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, over the last 50 years, the global population has more than doubled. The land available per person to grow food has reduced. Feeding of the rapidly growing population with shrinking land resources has been made possible mostly by increasing the yield output with improvements of water use and farming practices, the use of higher-yielding crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ourworldindata.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://ourworldindata.org</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par120">Feeding of a rapidly growing population in Africa with a shrinking local and global economy and borders restrictions is impossible.</p><p id="Par121">According to World Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>), due to Covid19, Sub-Saharan Africa will experience the first economic crisis in the last 25 years. Forecast is to fall from + 2.4% in 2019 to − 2.1 to − 5.1% in 2020. They mention as drivers trade and value chain disruption, reduced foreign financing from remittances, tourism, foreign direct investment, foreign aid, capital flight; direct impacts on health systems, disruptions from containment measures, and disruption from the public response. The crisis has the potential to spark a food security crisis, with agricultural production contracting 2.6–7% if there are trade blockages. Food imports would decline substantially by 13–25% due to higher transaction costs and reduced domestic demand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Climate change and water scarcity</title><p id="Par122">Climate change is also one of the drivers of the water crisis (United Nations Water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>). Climate change is altering the global water cycle and this is one of the reasons scarcity will increase by 2050 (United Nations Water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>). However, the same as Covid19, the way to address climate change is anything but clear.</p><p id="Par123">The anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission is one of the drivers of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and not only a direct, but also an indirect driver (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020a</xref>). The net balance of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is the result of land emission, ocean emission, and anthropogenic emissions, plus land sequestration, and ocean sequestration (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). The direct anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission to the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is relatively small (Salby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2012</xref>). The ocean surface temperature is the primary driver of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission is directly responsible for the increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and indirectly through the warming temperature.</p><p id="Par124">There are however other anthropogenic and natural forcings. Warming may also result from other causes, like changes in solar activity (Solanki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2004</xref>; Usoskin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2003</xref>; Solanki and Krivova <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2003</xref>), or changes in the land use (Pielke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>; Pielke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>) or the effect of other pollutants.</p><p id="Par125">Even only focusing on the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, if the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduces, the other harmful anthropogenic drivers of global warming remain as changes in land use, and other pollutants also disrupt the natural balances. The excess CO<sub>2</sub> concentration will continue to affect the climate for a very long time (Frölicher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>; Knutti and Rogelj <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). As shown in Boretti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020a</xref>), the drastic reduction in fossil fuel consumption cause Covid19 restrictions has not produced any change in the trend of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> measured in Mauna Loa over this year. This means that climate change by 2050 will be marginally affected by the transition to renewable energy no matter how fast this could be.</p><p id="Par126">As discussed in “<italic>Planets of humans</italic>” (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3dZk11vI-7czE" ext-link-type="uri">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk11vI-7czE</ext-link>), climate change is not only due to the combustion of fossil fuels, and humans are destroying their planet following many different mechanisms, with some of the remedies worse than the sickness.</p><p id="Par127">As discussed in Boretti et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>), replacement of conventional power plants with renewable energy is expensive, and at least in some cases, such as Saudi Arabia, not providing clear advantages, also from the point of view of the environment. A combined-cycle gas turbine plant such as the 2014 Qurayyah power station in Abqaiq, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, of 4000 MW nominal power, had a cost of 2.85 billion US$. It burns natural gas and oil, with a fuel energy conversion efficiency of 52% (<ext-link xlink:href="http://Wikipeen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurayyah_IPP" ext-link-type="uri">http://Wikipeen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurayyah_IPP</ext-link>). The 4000 MW are always available when needed and the load is decided by the operator. The lifespan of gas-fired power plants is 40 years. A contemporary solar photovoltaic plant, Topaz (<ext-link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_Solar_Farm" ext-link-type="uri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_Solar_Farm</ext-link>), in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States, had a cost of 2.5 billion US$ for 550 MW nominal power. While it does not burn any fuel, it only produces energy during daylight, depending on the availability of the resource. The capacity factor is the ratio of actual generating power to nominal generating power, which is 26.6%. The load is controlled by the variable solar energy source. Fossil fuel energy, and natural resources for the raw materials, are however needed to build the solar PV plant. The life span is not expected to exceed 20 years. The site area is 19 km<sup>2</sup>. Without energy storage by batteries, even 32 plants such as Topaz do not work the same as Qurayyah. Thus, battery energy storage is needed. The world’s largest battery, the 2017 Hornsdale Power Reserve in Jamestown, South Australia, Australia had a cost of $90 million for only 100 MW of nominal power, and 140 MWh nominal energy (<ext-link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve" ext-link-type="uri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve</ext-link>). This battery is never charged or discharged at the nominal power and only discharged at a small fraction of the nominal storable energy. The lifespan is unknown. To store 4000 MW for 12 h (length of day and night is 12 h on average), there is a need of at least 343 batteries same of Hornsdale, with this requirement that may dramatically increase if we only charge and discharge the battery at a fraction of the nominal capacity to improve the life span. Fossil fuel energy, and natural resources for the raw materials, are needed again to build the battery energy storage plant. A battery is not expected to last 40 years, especially in the harsh environment of Saudi Arabia, that is also weighting negatively on the efficiency.</p><p id="Par128">Factoring the likely reduced life span of the PV and battery energy storage facilities versus the combined cycle gas turbine plant, production of the same energy with renewables is even worse than with fossil fuels. The 64 solar PV plants such as Topaz, plus the 686 Li-Ion batteries such as Hornsdale, that are needed to replace the already existing Qurayyah, do not seem a real advantage for the economy and the environment (Boretti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Water crisis without Covid19</title><p id="Par129">With business-as-usual (without Covid19) the number of people that would have suffer from clean water scarcity by 2050 was larger than the estimate in United Nations Water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>), as the impacts of the drivers of water shortage, excessive population, and economic growth, plus the effect of inequality and accessibility, and the role of reduction and pollution of the aquifers, was there underestimated. This scarcity was expected to be more severe because of the interactions between water, food, energy and economy, and population, with a likely domino effect triggered by one scarcity to the other, in an unstable system (Boretti and Rosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). Governance crises could have also contributed to worsening conditions (Boretti and Rosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par130">By 2050, most places are expected to become short of water before they become short of food. Water scarcity is expected to be much more severe at the regional level, especially where there is already scarcity, and the population is growing more, prompting even larger migrations than those already occurring. Africa is the continent where water scarcity is expected before. There is a clear need to manage demography and economy and limit pollution, while better managing and preserving the resources. However, political and economic burdens prevent concrete action.</p><p id="Par131">The unregulated growth of the economy and the population of before Covid19 was expected to continue until the first scarcity or other environmental issues could have badly collide with, then likely translating in the decline of the economy first, and then the population.</p><p id="Par132">(United Nations Water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>) was a step forward in awareness of water problems but it did not propose any remedies. While United Nations Water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>) was promoting nature-inspired solutions such as dry toilets, an utterly trivial issue in the imminent world water scarcity, United Nations Water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>) was marginally better, promoting community-based action to address the root causes of leaving people behind concerning water and sanitation. But vague political slogans do nothing to make the world better. Action is needed on the drivers of water scarcity. Without it, the water crisis is inevitable. Technological changes may certainly help, as it has been often the case in recent human history, but this also requires economic and energetic support, that is difficult to be forecasted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par133">With business modified because of Covid19, a water crisis especially in Africa may occur much earlier. Reduced availability of energy, similar to an economic downturn, global and local recession, crisis of global governance, restrictions, in the context of a growing population and growing demand for food and water, will have a drastic impact on global life quality, life expectancy, and net growth rate, and Africa will be the continent to pay most.</p><p id="Par134">The drivers of the water-food-energy nexus are politics, economy, and demography, and they are all strongly related to each other, with one negative factor potentially damaging every other aspect in a world of growing instability.</p><p id="Par135">The Covid19 infection has dramatically changed the time frame of an imminent water (and food and health) crisis for Africa. Because of the prolonged lockdown measures and the damage to the economy, plus the lack of any attention to other priorities such as assuring that water and food are available to people in many parts of the world, it is predictable that a sharp decline of living conditions will occur in many developing countries, and especially in Africa, with more reasons and even fewer opportunities to migrate, and less local and foreign help to mitigate.</p><p id="Par136">Covid19 does not affect clean water access in Africa only through the economic mechanism, despite this is the dominant factor. Covid-19 affects water access in many other ways. For example, physical distancing and curfews mean that people cannot leave their house to access food and water, and also the means to purchase food and water. Many poor people commonly do not even have piped utility water.</p><p id="Par137">Depending on how the Covid19 pandemic will evolve, a water crisis will occur sooner or later and will affect Africa before every other continent. Everything will depend on the way the Covid19 pandemic, that is primarily a political issue, will evolve. Poverty will dramatically increase because Covid19.</p><p id="Par138">Covid19 is already driving sub-Saharan Africa toward the first recession in 25 years and this will further add to restrictions limiting the capacity of individuals to seek for water and food, reduced foreign help and local expenditure to help with water scarcity and other issues, and will make the debt of these countries worse than ever.</p><p id="Par139">The issues of Africa, not limited to food and water and health, and Covid19, will only be solved through elimination of poverty and self-determination, GDP growth, and more general growth of know-how, transparency, democracy, and improvements of every other more general societal criterion, within a stable population. Only in this case, there is the opportunity to address environmental and societal issues and solve the water crisis driven by poverty and uncontrolled population growth. With population growth, plus Covid19 economic recession, limited migration, and no international help, the water crisis in Africa will be major problem.</p><p id="Par140">The growing influence of corporations and investment funds and banks of the rich countries on global governance is going to further expand through Covid19. The relationship between the International Monetary Fund and the countries of Africa are examples of a cure that make the patient worse rather than better. From world debt to climate change to Covid19 to the water crisis, there is the impression that things are getting worse rather than better, with conflict of interest in global governance being the open secret that nobody speaks of.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author wishes to thank Thomas Connolly for the comments and suggestions provided.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>The author collected the data and wrote the manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no funding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="Par141">The author declares no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Human and animal rights</title><p id="Par142">Compliance with standards of research involving animals or humans as subjects is not needed for this work.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adam</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Special report: The simulations driving the world’s response to COVID-19 how epidemiologists rushed to model the coronavirus pandemic</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2020</year><volume>580</volume><fpage>316</fpage><lpage>318</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/d41586-020-01003-6</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Amuakwa-Mensah, F., Klege, R.
