So, it is not surprising that the carbon and water cycles are of special importance for mankind. Carbon and water in the form of food and beverage have two very different functions: they supply humans with energy and in addition they are the basic building blocks of the body. Stable, closed loops of water and carbon on our planet guaranteed our survival since the beginning of mankind.</p><p id="Par3">In the modern world, industrial processes, and especially the conventional methods of energy production, require a large amount of carbon and water and destroy the natural cycles. To restore the stable cycles, we need a different energy system.</p><p id="Par4">This chapter will introduce you to the extraordinary magnitude of the world energy problem and explain its link to the anthropogenic climate change, which turns out to be a game changer for the future of our human society. The restoration of the carbon and water cycles will be essential for our survival. New concepts and methods to preserve and provide freshwater and to reverse desertification and climate change are essential to fight drought and hunger of future generations. Seawater desalination and pyrolysis may be key technologies to achieve that.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>The Challenge of the World Energy Supply</title><sec><p id="Par5">Many people discuss solutions to the energy problem, but often they completely underestimate the order of magnitude of the problem and solutions are offered that nicely work at small scale but not at global scale. The average global energy usage per second is about 18,000 GW, which corresponds to the electrical output of about 18,000 nuclear power plants (see Box <xref rid="FPar1" ref-type="">2.1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><p id="Par6">The energy consumption per capita is very different for different countries, e.g. it is 9.9 kW/person in the US, 5.5 kW/person in Germany, and 0.9 kW/person in Africa.

As population increases and in addition also energy consumption per capita increases, energy needs will increase rapidly in future, especially in developing countries where the consumption per capita is very low today. Neglecting this rising energy need per person, and just taking the population rise into account, an increase to 25,000 GW until 2050 is estimated. The claim, that the energy consumption of the western world stays basically constant since decades is partially misleading, as a large fraction of the industrial production of goods for Western countries has been moved to eastern countries, especially to China. To account for the total energy footprint of a society, the energy footprint of imported goods must be assigned to the consumer and not to the producer to get the picture right.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par7">There are three basic types of energy production: nuclear, fossil and renewable. An energy transition must consider not only the additional 7000 GW that must be installed in the next 35 years to cope with the energy increase of the rising world population, but also a large fraction of the existing world infrastructure of 18,000 GW must be replaced in view of the decarbonisation of the power plants. Together, this leads to an enormous rate of more than 1 GW of newly constructed power generation facilities for every day in the next 35 years and beyond. <bold>This is an unprecedented challenge not only in volume but also in speed</bold>. The fundamental limitations—beyond any monetary aspects—will be shortage in basic materials and—especially for nuclear energy—limits in qualified manpower and safety aspects, especially in developing and unstable countries. This leads to the following general conclusion:</p></sec><sec><p id="Par8"><bold>The bulk of future power plants must be technically simple and inherently safe</bold>!</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Box 2.1: The World Energy Usage in Numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]</title><p id="Par9"><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/430174_1_En_2_Figa_HTML.gif"/></p><p id="Par10">The average primary world energy usage per second in 2014 was approximately 18,000 GW. 1 GW corresponds approximately to the electrical power of 1 nuclear power station. The renewable contribution of 14% is dominated by the burning of biofuel. The large majority (81%) of the world energy consumption is powered by fossil fuels.</p><p id="Par11">The about 440 existing nuclear power stations count with about 5% to the primary energy in this diagram. However, the total electrical output from these thermo-nuclear reactors is only about 280 GW, which is a fraction of 1.5% of the total 18,000 GW. The 5% number that is usually quoted includes the waste heat production of the nuclear power plants.</p><p id="Par12">The comparison of different energy sources has large ambiguities, as the total energy efficiencies depend strongly on the type of energy carrier and of the application. If nuclear energy or coal is used to produce electric power, the efficiency is 30–50%. If electrical power is used to produce synthetic fuel for a combustion vehicle, the overall efficiency is very low. However, if electricity from a wind power station is used to charge the battery of an electric vehicle, the overall efficiency is about 80% and much higher than in the examples above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The lower panel shows that the main consumers of energy are industry, transport, and residential. The rest is agriculture, public services, etc. About 10% is lost during transport or conversion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Nuclear Energy</title><p id="Par14">Nuclear power plants have been preached to be the prime future option of the industrialized countries since the 1950s, but after 65 years of extensive governmental support, nuclear power still covers only about 11% of the global electricity consumption, which is as little as 5% of the total global energy demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is a long-lasting debate about the pros and cons of nuclear energy, and most individuals in the field have a strong and fixed opinion with well-defined arguments and counter-arguments that cover the usual spectrum of the debates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this sense, the reader is invited to skip the following three paragraphs that present the arguments of the author and that are not generally accepted by the nuclear scientific community. Nevertheless, the arguments are scientifically correct.</p><p id="Par15">Even if all technical issues would be solved in future, the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear power plants will always be subject to terrorism and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A significant contribution to the global energy problem requires on the order of ten thousand nuclear power plants in all regions of the world, which will be difficult or impossible to control, especially in times of rebellion or war. Recently, an old idea was brought up again by nuclear industry and is discussed by the European Parliament and elsewhere: To build small nuclear reactors in assembly line production in large numbers to make them cheaper. Trucks could ship them to the final user as one piece. The radioactive inventory would be closed in a hermetic containment (except for the unavoidable emission of radioactive gases) and the whole reactor would be recycled when the fuel is used up. This attracting idea is a nightmare for people concerned about terrorism and proliferation, as <bold>any nuclear reactor can be converted into a machine that breeds plutonium</bold> and other fuels for nuclear weapons, and its inventory can also always be used to produce dirty nuclear bombs. Some years ago, another old idea was promoted again, to move from uranium to thorium as primary fuel for nuclear reactors. It was claimed that a thorium reactor has several advantages, one of them is that there is no breeding of plutonium in the regular operation mode of these reactors. Unfortunately, today we know that the breeding of nuclear material for atomic weapons is even easier in certain thorium fuelled reactors than in uranium reactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. From the author’s perspective, the following sentence is valid:</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Nuclear power has always produced more problems than it has solved</bold>.</p><p id="Par17">Many people believe that nuclear <bold>fusion</bold> reactors are the future of energy production, as in principle, a nuclear fusion reactor is a compact device that delivers a huge amount of power from nearly unlimited fuel, which is—depending on the technology—usually deuterium and lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are two technologies feasible. The first technology uses magnetic confinement. It requires cold superconducting magnets in the vicinity of the hot fusion plasma where the energy production takes place. With the advances of modern technology, it is likely that a fusion reactor will be made operational in the coming decades. However, the technological overhead of this type of reactor is so immense, that it is very unlikely that such a reactor will ever become economically competitive, especially as the special materials and expertise will not be available for the fast implementation of these devices in numerous (i.e. several thousand) copies. Due to basic physics limitation, such fusion reactors with magnetic confinement cannot be miniaturised in future.</p><p id="Par18">The second fusion technology uses inertial fusion, and today a promising technology uses a combination of inertial and magnetic confinement. This technology is based on modern laser technology. If it works, it is not unlikely that it can be miniaturized in future due to the immense technical progress of lasers in the pico and femto second regime. The concept of inertial fusion can be compared with the way you make fire with a match: To light the head of a match, there has to be a small hot spot that is generated when the head is struck. Once the temperature at this spot is larger than the ignition temperature of chemical compound (e.g. sulphur), the whole head burns. A priori from the technological point of view a commercial application of inertial fusion appears much more simple compared to the magnetic devices. The danger of this technological development is that the step from inertial fusion towards a new H-bomb technology is small. Once realized, no proliferation treaty will be able to stop the technology from spreading, as it requires no fissionable nuclides to produce such a bomb. Therefore, it is not surprising that today inertial fusion is a domain of military research and mankind will be better off without it: <bold>do not foster a technology that creates more problems than it solves</bold>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Sun, Our Nuclear Reactor</title><p id="Par19">Fortunately, there is a nuclear reactor in the vicinity of our planet that produces more than enough energy to keep our human business running as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>. The sun obtains its energy from a nuclear fusion reaction in its core where hydrogen is fused into helium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As in every nuclear reactor, the nuclear reactions produce a large amount of lethal, ionizing radiation. At a distance of 150,000,000 km we are safe, fortunately. Most of the solar nuclear radiation is re-absorbed in the sun. The only carcinogenic radiation that arrives at the surface of the earth is a low level of cosmic radiation that is part of the cause for genetic mutations in life on earth and keeps Darwinian evolution running. In addition, especially at places where the ozone layer of the earth’s atmosphere is destroyed, UV radiation arrives at toxic levels and produces skin cancer.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 2.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The highly radioactive sun is the fusion reactor of our choice. At a safety distance of 150,000,000 km its radiation is still so intense that this single reactor is enough to satisfy all energy needs of human civilization.

Solar radiation arrives with a power density of 1.36 GW/km<sup>2</sup> at our atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Part of it is reflected, but most of it is absorbed by the earth and re-emitted from gases in our warm atmosphere into the cold universe. The energy need of our human society of 16,000 GW is modest compared to the total solar irradiation that arrives on earth, which is 170 million GW. This irradiation is the basic source of almost all kinds of renewable energy. Not only energy from solar panels, but also energy from wind, water and biomass originates from the sun.</p><p id="Par21">Also the moon contributes to our spectrum of renewable energies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is responsible for part of the geothermal heat and part of the maritime energies as tidal forces in the interior of the earth heat up our planet and tidal forces in the oceans keep the oceans moving.

In this respect, our energy supply is save for the next 4.5 billion years, but after that we should think about moving to another planet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The Era of Fossil Fuels</title><p id="Par23">Since the beginning of the industrial age, fossil carbon has been used extensively as energy source for industrial processes, for mobility and for heating purposes. Already in the early days of industrialization, the availability of wood and other biomass was insufficient to cover the rising energy needs. Therefore, an industry has been developed to mine coal and lignite and later also oil and natural gas. Today about 80% of the total primary energy is generated by the combustion of fossil carbon.</p><p id="Par24">But carbon is not only an energy carrier in our modern world; it is also a basic building block in a majority of synthetic industrial products. Almost all gadgets of modern technology contain plastics; all organic chemistry is based on carbon, including drug and certain food production. Huge amounts of hydrocarbons are used to cover our roads with asphalt. After usage, a large fraction of these carbon products will appear as pollution in the environment and in the oceans, and sooner or later they will rot or be combusted and thus reappear as CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</p><p id="Par25">Basically all our carbon products (food, fuel, plastics, asphalt, …) originate from photosynthesis in plants. The green parts of plants make use of solar energy to crack CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O and to construct various new products from carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Prehistoric photosynthesis has generated large deposits of fossil carbon. These biological processes reduced the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and generated an atmosphere with a large content of oxygen (21%), which was not available in the early days of our planet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is assumed that formation of coal at large scale stopped after the biological appearance of certain lignicolous fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which were able to decompose wood by cracking carbohydrates and lignin at the end of the Carboniferous, 300 million years ago. However, recent studies claim that this is not the main reason for the peak of coal production in the Carboniferous, but that instead a unique combination of climate and tectonics during Pangea formation was the reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The large concentration of O<sub>2</sub> together with the low concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> and CO in the ambient air were prerequisites for the genesis of animals, as they make use of the combustion of organic material (called cell respiration) as energy source for living. It is not surprising that CO<sub>2</sub> and CO are lethal gases, as respiration requires a large gradient of partial pressures between O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. A CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 8% leads to unconsciousness and death within less than an hour, and the limits for CO are even much smaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Due to the production of fossil deposits over hundreds of millions of years, CO<sub>2</sub> has been reduced in our atmosphere to be below 0.03% long before the anatomically modern man, the homo sapiens developed about 200,000 years ago in Africa. Oxygen in combination with a low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is the chemical prerequisite for a concentrated basal energy rate in biology. One of the organs with large energy expenditure is the brain of mammals. In this sense, the low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in our atmosphere was a prerequisite for the high-performance brain that gifted humankind with unique intelligence, and with the abilities of fast learning and the usage of tools, language and fire.</p><p id="Par27">Humans used a 100% renewable energy system for 200,000 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], including heating (biomass), mobility (sailing boats, horse-drawn carriage, camels, carrier pigeons, …), machines driven by humans or animals (e.g. oxen in a flour mill) and machines driven by water or wind (wind and water mills) until about 1850 AD during the industrial revolution: At that time man started the usage of coal for running steam engines at large scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Greenhouse gases are gases that are transparent for visible light, but absorb infrared radiation, just like the glass roof of a greenhouse does. The greenhouse effect is easy to understand (see Box <xref rid="FPar2" ref-type="">2.2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]: The atmosphere is transparent for visible sunlight; otherwise we would not see the sun during the day. The energy of the sunlight heats up the surface of the earth. If the atmosphere would be transparent for infrared radiation, the earth surface would emit the radiation back to the cold outer space and cool down drastically, just like the first men on the moon experienced it: The temperature during day/night changes by about ±150 °C with an average surface temperature as cold as about −55 °C (depending on the position), even though the moon has the same average distance to the sun as the earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Because there is a certain percentage of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, the infrared heat radiation cannot easily escape to the outer space as it is reabsorbed by the greenhouse gas. This absorbed radiation energy heats up the molecules of the greenhouse gas and according to the laws of thermodynamics the heat is transferred to the neighbouring molecules (nitrogen, oxygen,…) of the surrounding air in a second step. Heat radiation is re-emitted isotropically with longer wavelength to either the outer space or back to the earth surface. The fraction of backscattered radiation leads to a significant temperature increase of the lower atmosphere and of our planet’s surface.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par29">A major greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is water vapour. Anybody who likes to sleep outside in nature knows that usually a cloudy night is much warmer than a night with a clear sky. But why is CO<sub>2</sub> relevant, even though there is much more H<sub>2</sub>O than CO<sub>2</sub> in the air? The reason is that infrared radiation has a broad spectral distribution, and CO<sub>2</sub> is able to block some of those wavelengths which H<sub>2</sub>O cannot absorb. The absorption spectrum can be compared with a water dam which is disrupted at a certain position: The water level in the dam does not depend on how high the dam is, but how well the hole is closed where the water can escape. In this sense, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is the lever to control the leakage of infrared radiation from our planet.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par30">Even though the greenhouse effect is basic physics and any student who denies it will fail his or her examination, the detailed predictions of the effects of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions required hard and careful work of thousands of scientists.

This way, effectively only a small fraction of the thermal radiation makes it through the whole atmosphere and is emitted to the cold universe (blue area in the upper panel). The gases that reabsorb the thermal radiation are called greenhouse gases, as they act like the glass roof of a greenhouse that lets the sunshine in but blocks the thermal losses.

In the following, I will try to explain the main conclusions that a person with scientific background can discover in these curves:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par44">The global temperatures show some “rhythmic” changes over the last 800,000 years. These changes correspond to the well-known ice ages with warm periods in between.

Is this an internal “clock” of our planet or is the rhythm coming from outside? Looking at the planetary motion (curves a, b, c), it is obvious that there is a correlation between the planetary parameters and the global temperature. Whenever the precession (c) starts to oscillate with increasing amplitude, the ice ages come to an end and temperatures (e, f, g) increase. The so-called Milankovitch cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] cause a change of the intensity and direction of the solar irradiation, due to the change of the distance between sun and earth and due to precession of the rotating planet earth. Obviously, the change of solar irradiation triggers the rhythm of the global temperature.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">The most important observation is the following: The planetary motions are rather smooth and time-symmetric: There is no systematic difference in the curve if you read it forward or backward in time. However, all the climate curves are not symmetric in time: All the curves have a tendency for a steep rise and a smooth fall. This is true for the main peaks and for most of the intermediate peaks. If the sun is really the driving force of the climate, you normally would expect to have some kind of proportionality between the cause and the effect. What is happening here?

The synchronicity with the solar forcing of the Milankovitch cycles leaves only one explanation: The global temperature rise is triggered by increased solar radiation, but it is not proportional to the solar forcing. Instead, temperature rises very fast due to internal mechanisms of our planet, according to the plot with a speed of about 1 °C in less than 1000 years. Once it reaches its maximum it falls slowly over 50,000 years back to the next ice age.

To the opinion of the author this judicial argument is wrong. Instead, the owners of fossil fuels have to realize that fossil resources are harmful and have no value in the human community anymore. Today, fossils are recognized as toxic and dangerous substances. The fact that a significant fraction of the known and easy to haul fuels has to stay in ground means indirectly that globally it does not make sense and it is even counterproductive to look for additional (and expensive) fossil resources (e.g. in arctic regions) or to impose novel methods (like fracking) to increase the amount of disposable fossil fuels. The devaluation is not restricted to the fossil fuels themselves, but also to the infrastructure that is related to it.

Secondly, also here the scale argument is the show stopper: Today’s emissions are about 100 Megatons of the toxic CO<sub>2</sub> gas every day. The mass and volume of liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is 3–4 times larger than the corresponding coal that has been burned.

The saturation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean depends on temperature: if the ocean gets warmer, it releases a surplus of CO<sub>2</sub> back to the atmosphere. This way a positive feedback mechanism starts to work that may lead to an unstoppable cycle of 1: release of CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean, 2: increase of the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere, 3: heating of the ocean due to global warming and again 1: …, and so on.</p><p id="Par77">Carbon is of immense importance for our human life as our food consists chemically mainly of carbon and water (C, O, and H). Food is needed to generate the building blocks of our bodies and it gives us energy for living. Therefore, priority 1 for the usage of biomass must be food production. Priority 2 should be the usage of carbon as building block in industry as organic chemistry will have to replace fossil resources by biomass in a sustainable future.

The second most important option is to use biomass as building block for industry, because for many applications carbon is needed as raw material (e.g. for all plastic products).

The syngas can be used to produce hydrogen, synthetic natural gas (SNG), other synthetic fuels, or it is used in situ to keep the pyrolysis process running.</p><p id="Par89">Pyrolysis is one of the oldest human crafts. Historically, and still today, charcoal is used as energy carrier for cooking, especially for barbecues, but also for industrial production.

The pressure is an osmotic phenomenon of the ion-rich cell content compared to an environment of water with lower salt concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. When plants and animals started to populate the land, the osmotic pressure had to be large enough to carry the much larger weight of the beings on land.

Pressures up to 4 MPa are present in plant cells, which is 20 times the pressure of a car tire. Without regular drinking of freshwater, humans start to suffer of dehydration.

Finally, rain, snow or hail are produced. Precipitation, melting snow and glaciers, water-sucking soil, wells, rivers and lakes are the natural freshwater suppliers for all living beings.

Two examples will be mentioned here, which might have their niche in feeding the world of the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Controlled Environment Agriculture</title><p id="Par132">The most extreme example is the Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) where crops are grown in containers or even high-raised “farmscrapers” with artificial light and air conditioning and controlled irrigation in closed loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. This technology, originally developed for space stations, uses 99% less water than open field agriculture. The energy for the operation of the CEA has to come from outside, e.g. from solar collectors. Currently, this technology is rather expensive, but there seems to be a large cost saving potential for the future, once the strict requirements for space stations are released and economical aspects are included in the design. One big advantage of this approach is the almost complete recycling of water and soil, and the fact that fertilizers can be applied very efficiently without losses, and—due to protective barriers—there is no need of pesticides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Seawater Greenhouse</title><p id="Par133">A technology that pays off in certain regions already today is the seawater greenhouse, which exploits the power of wind and sun to desalinate seawater and to generate fresh and humid air in a greenhouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. This concept seems to be well suited for agriculture, as the technology is simple in installation and maintenance. It provides food, and, in addition, freshwater, salt and minerals from the sea.</p><p id="Par134">The working principle is as follows (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">2.9</xref>): Seawater is evaporated at the permeable front wall of the greenhouse and generates cooled humidified air inside the greenhouse. Fans at the rear side of the house draw the air through when there is insufficient wind. The roof is transparent for visible light to allow plants to grow, but it is absorptive for infrared and heats up a stream of seawater, which is evaporated and generates saturated vapour. This vapour precipitates at a condenser that is cooled by seawater and thus produces freshwater for irrigation. A stream of humid air leaves the greenhouse and enables the growth of less demanding plants in the downstream outside area of the greenhouse.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 2.9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The seawater greenhouse uses seawater for agriculture in drylands. The seawater evaporates in a porous wall where air is blown through by natural wind (Phase I). The cooled and humidified air is ideal for growing crops. In phase II a housing is added with a roof which is transparent for light but may contain additional seawater pipes where water is evaporated to increase humidity and to cool the roof. A condenser wall on the opposite side of the air inlet is cooled by seawater and produces fresh water for irrigation by condensing the humid air. Fans can be added that blow the air through the greenhouse to support or replace the natural wind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430174_1_En_2_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par135">The Sahara Forest Project takes up this idea and proposes to apply it at large scale in North Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Solar power towers are proposed to provide the power for running the greenhouses and the waste heat of the steam turbines can be used to support the evaporation of the seawater.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Reversing Desertification and Soil Degeneration</title><p id="Par136">Not all drylands can be covered with greenhouses and not all of them are in the vicinity of the sea. But seawater pipelines can be used to bring water to remote areas and CSP desalination plants at large scale can be used to produce freshwater for open field agriculture. Keys to a high yield are: the correct method of irrigation, the selection of a suitable crop, and the improvement of the soil.</p><p id="Par137">A suited plant for dry and hot areas is for example Jatropha Curcas, a plant that is drought resistant, that grows fast if there is water and sunlight available, and that produces nuts with a high level of oil that can easily be converted to biodiesel. The remaining biomass of the plant can be converted to charcoal by pyrolysis. As mentioned above, the Indians in the Amazon basin used charcoal to produce terra preta, a soil that made the otherwise poor ground fertile. As the plant is poisonous, it is not eaten by wildlife and can be used as fence. One can imagine, that after a few generations of Jatropha Curcas and the usage of the corresponding charcoal, the soil is fertile enough to carry other, more demanding types of crops. This way the controlled farming of Jatropha Curcas could be a profitable way of moving the zone of desertification backwards step by step. How well this works at large scale has to be studied. Most important is to involve of the local population and to carefully study the effect that the new vegetation has on the native ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. There are more than enough examples, where overdrawn financial expectations and the exploitation of the local farmers produce more damage than output.</p><p id="Par138">The combination of irrigation, soil regeneration and the above mentioned controlled nomadic grazing by large herds are examples of ideas how to reverse the expansion of drylands on our planet: The soil would gain an increased ability to soak and store water from rain periods, the enhanced vegetation increases the humidity of the local climate and the dung of the herds in combination with the absorptive capacity of charcoal will revive the microorganisms and the flora of the area.</p><p id="Par139">Unfortunately, the progressive climate change will counteract these and other efforts, due to the increasing probability of extreme weather conditions like heavy rainfalls, floods, heat waves and droughts. This last statement should not discourage us, but it emphasises the time pressure for the transformation of our society.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par140">According to the best knowledge of science, mankind is currently entering an era of <bold>climate change</bold> which is triggered by the extensive use of fossil fuels and which will be hard to stop. In accordance with the Paris Agreement, the immediate and earnest reduction of the usage of fossil fuels has to be pursued with high priority and most of the still existing fossil inventory has to stay in ground, losing its economic value.</p><p id="Par141">Due to the nexus of population rise, energy usage, climate change and water scarcity, an uncontrolled development of the human societies might end up in drought, starvation, epidemics, migration and wars, unless mankind finds a way to solve its global problems, above all the energy problem.</p><p id="Par142">While there are many technologies available to attack the energy problem, the author concludes that only renewables will be able to solve the global energy crisis at large scale:</p><p id="Par143"><bold>Renewable energies are simple and safe, while other energy technologies produce more problems than they solve if they are implemented at global scales</bold>.</p><p id="Par144"><bold>Carbon</bold> is one of the main building blocks of all living on earth and also of modern industry. The natural global cycle of carbon in the form of organic matter in the biosphere, of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, and of carbonic acid in the oceans has been disturbed by the extensive usage of fossil fuels in the last century. This disturbance has to be stopped not only by stopping the usage of fossil fuel, but also by developing a sustainable chemical industry based on renewables, by using wood and other biological materials in the building sector and by reforestation and a more sustainable agriculture. <bold>Pyrolysis</bold> is a way to produce biogas, charcoal and chemical resources from faeces, bio-waste and plastics scrap. Charcoal products can be used as organic fertilizer and additive for a future agriculture. When charcoal is brought out on fields and drylands on a global scale, this so-called “<bold>black carbon sequestration</bold>” will reduce the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and will be a safe and inexpensive way to reverse climate change on the long term.</p><p id="Par145">The <bold>natural cycle of water</bold>, the second main building block of all living on earth, is also heavily disturbed today by extensive water usage in modern industry and modern intensive agriculture on the one hand, and by the anthropogenic climate change, deforestation and desertification on the other hand. The usage of water has to be rethought, especially in agriculture, in order to be able to feed a future world of 10 billion people. Several ideas are listed to attack the water problem. One of them is the energy-costly <bold>desalination of seawater</bold> at large scale, which emphasises the nexus of energy, water and nutrition.
