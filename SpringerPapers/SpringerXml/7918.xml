Herein, inspired by the structure and function of photoreceptors in retinas, we develop artificial photoreceptors based on gold nanoparticle-decorated titania nanowire arrays, for restoration of visual responses in the blind mice with degenerated photoreceptors. Green, blue and near UV light responses in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are restored with a spatial resolution better than 100 µm. ON responses in RGCs are blocked by glutamatergic antagonists, suggesting functional preservation of the remaining retinal circuits. Moreover, neurons in the primary visual cortex respond to light after subretinal implant of nanowire arrays. Improvement in pupillary light reflex suggests the behavioral recovery of light sensitivity. Our study will shed light on the development of a new generation of optoelectronic toolkits for subretinal prosthetic devices.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">The restoration of light response using retinal prosthesis could be a way to restore vision following retinal degenerative disease.

Light entering an eye passes through the transparent retina and is mostly captured by the visual pigment-containing photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration lead to irreversible damage or even loss of photoreceptors, which can result in serious impairment of vision and eventually blindness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The state-of-art retinal prosthesis devices require the use of a subretinally placed photodiode array detecting near-infrared signals from a video capturing camera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recently, developing light-responsive materials as artificial photoreceptors for interfacing with blind retinas has emerged as a promising alternative for retinal prosthesis, with several exciting preliminary demonstrations using metal electrode arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, cadmium sulfide-carbon nanotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, semiconductor silicon photodiodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or conducting polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, these photoresponsive devices require additional microelectronic processing for signal generation, transduction and processing, posting limitations for in vivo applications. Breaking this bottleneck requires capabilities for engineering large interaction surfaces/interfaces between retinal cells and semiconductor micro/nanostructures. Recently, subretinal implantation of photovoltaic polymers restores light sensitivity in blind rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, spatiotemporal characterizations of retinal responses are not clear.</p><p id="Par4">Among the potential candidates of photoresponsive materials targeting the goal of artificial photoreceptors, the ordered, oriented one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanowire (NW) arrays exhibit high surface areas, large charge transport mobility, excellent biocompatibility and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Distinctive from previous reports of photoresponsive materials/structures, the high orientation and anisotropy of 1D NW arrays are analogous to the morphology and architecture of photoreceptors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), and thereby enable efficient photoabsorption and charge separation that are similar in photoconversion devices such as solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> or photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The oriented semiconductor NW arrays are capable of generating photocurrent upon light illumination to depolarize neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, as no trans-ocular cables or power supplies are needed, a high and uniform areal density of photoresponsive units is expected for optimized spatial resolution. More uniquely, the surface roughness of oriented NW arrays may further enhance interfacing efficiency with innate retinal circuits including bipolar cells, which is crucial for the artificial retinal prosthesis towards visual function restoration.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Retina-nanowire interfaces. <bold>a</bold> Illustration of an eye. <bold>b</bold> Comparison of a retina and NW arrays-interfaced blind retina that lacks photoreceptors.

The obtained Au-TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays had a perpendicular orientation to the underlying substrate, and the average NW diameter and length were ~100 nm and ~2 μm, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>), similar to those of pristine TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays before deposition of Au nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). The density of NWs was ~10 per μm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to ~10<sup>9</sup> NW arrays per cm<sup>2</sup>. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Au-TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays displayed characteristic reflection peaks of a rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> crystalline structure (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, JCPDS No. 21-1276) and a face-center-cubic Au structure (JCPDS No. 04-0784) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

The typical substrate size was ~1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Compared to the dark state without light, when the Au–TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays were illuminated by different light wavelengths, a clear increase of photocurrent was recorded almost instantaneously, while the shutoff of light led to the drop of photocurrent to the original dark state. The summarized photocurrent response of different light wavelengths show the average magnitudes of photocurrent change were ~1450, 108, and 87 pA, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Light responses and spatial resolution</title><p id="Par9">Mice are naturally sensitive to both near UV and visible light.

In addition, to evaluate the light sensitivity of the NW arrays-interfaced blind retina, the spike activities of RGCs in response to light with different intensities were measured (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). The intensity-dependent responses to near UV light were similar or close to those in wild-type mice. The fractions of light responsive RGCs in wild-type mouse retinas were similar for different intensities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, black curve). In the NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retinas, the fraction of light responsive RGCs were 78%, 47%, 36% and 42% at 133, 66.5, 33.2, and 16.6 μW mm<sup>–2</sup>, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, red curve). In addition, RGCs in wild-type mice responded to majority of light pulses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, black curve). For the NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retinas, we also showed that the threshold to induce light response was ~0.5 μW mm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref><bold>)</bold>, that was 25 lux, which was out of the intensity range of rods (≤0.1 lux). The percentages of pulses that initiated spike activities in RGCs were similar to those of wild-type retinas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, red curve). The number of spikes for different light intensities, as well as the spike waveforms were also similar (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7b, g</xref>). Due to the absence of photoreceptors and therefore sign-preserving and sign-inverting synapses between the photoreceptors and the bipolar cells, only ON responses were recorded in the NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retinas. The latency of RGCs in NW arrays-interfaced blind retina was similar to those in wild-type retina at different UV light intensities (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7d</xref>). The latencies for green and blue light in NW arrays-interfaced blind retina were much larger than those in wild-type retina, most likely due to the fact that the photocurrent induced by green and blue light was smaller than that by UV light.</p><p id="Par11">The sensitivity of different light wavelengths was then investigated. In wild-type mice, RGCs responded to near UV, blue, and green light (with intensities of 133, 691 and 470 μW mm<sup>–2</sup>, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, top panel). Without the NW arrays, retinas of blind mice did not respond to either UV, blue or green light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, middle panel), confirming the blindness of these mice. The representative spiking activities of RGCs in response to near UV, blue and green light were shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, bottom panel. For each RGC, at least three light pulses were presented, with approximately 1 min interval between each pulse. The average number of elicited spikes was 11 for near UV, 4 for blue and 6 for green light. Light-responsive RGCs responded to 84% near UV light pulses, 57% blue light pulses and 86% green light pulses, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>). Moreover, time evolution of RGC responses were measured (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), indicating that the interface between NW arrays and retinal cells was purely physical contact and did not evolve over time.</p><p id="Par12">In order to examine the anatomical and functional On- and Off-features of RGCs in NW arrays-interfaced blind retina and wild-type retina, we recorded the light responses of RGCs with micropipette filled with internal solutions containing Lucifer Yellow, and then conducted immunostaining of these recorded RGCs to examine the distribution of their dendritic arbors in On and Off layers (labeled by ChAT). We first investigated whether light-sensitive Lucifer Yellow in the pipette affected the light responses in the RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The percentage of responsive RGCs was similar with or without Lucifer Yellow in the pipette (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9d</xref>). In the NW arrays-interfaced blind retina, dendrites of some RGCs were located in both On and Off layers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, top panel). These RGCs exhibited On responses. Some other RGCs had their dendrites distributed in On layer, and exhibited On responses as well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, bottom panel). These results indicated that RGCs responded to the onset of light by photocurrent from the NW arrays, despite the fact that they received input from both On-center and Off-center bipolar cells. We further examined the light responsive patterns of RGCs in both NW arrays-interfaced blind retina and wild-type retina. It turns out that the ~30% of the RGCs in NW arrays-interfaced blind retina sustained On responses to light stimulation, whereas the rest RGCs showed transient On responses (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7e</xref>). This ratio of transient On to sustained On response was similar to that of wild-type RGCs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Anatomical and functional On- and Off- features of RGCs in NW arrays-interfaced blind retina. <bold>a</bold> Confocal images showing the distribution of dendritic arbors of two example RGCs (cell 1 and 2, left) and their corresponding near UV light responses (right, 133 μW mm<sup>–2</sup>).

The light responses from RGCs disappeared 4 min after the application of drugs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, left and middle columns). After washing off the drugs, the light responses were restored (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, right columns<bold>)</bold>. Light responses of all the RGCs were blocked by the drugs, indicating that light responses in RGCs originate mostly from activation of bipolar cells instead of RGCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7h</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">The spatial resolution of light response in the NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retinas was further investigated. The photocurrents induced by light spots were measured with different sizes and different distances from the center of the spot (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9a, b</xref>). Near UV and green light spots with different diameters were presented to the RGC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). For blind mouse retinas, the minimum size of light spots to trigger RGC response was 45 µm. When the diameter of near UV light spot was smaller than 100 µm, 44% of RGCs exhibited clear responses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The percentages of RGCs that responded to near UV light spots with diameters of 100–200 µm, 200–300 µm, and 300–600 µm were 79%, 84%, and 96%, respectively. Meanwhile, for green and blue light spots with diameters of 200–300 µm, 31% and 22% of RGCs exhibited light responses, respectively; for green and blue light spots with diameters of 300–600 µm, 36% of RGCs exhibited light responses. In Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9b</xref>, the photocurrent increased significantly when the size of the light spots increased from 200 µm to 300–600 µm, which can lead to the increased percentage of responsive RGCs for the light spots of 300–600 µm. For wild-type mouse retinas, RGCs exhibited a typical center-surround light response pattern for both near UV and green light (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9c</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Responses of RGCs to light spots of different sizes in NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retinas. <bold>a</bold> Left column: near UV light spots with different sizes.

Several possible mechanisms including photovoltaic and photothermal stimulations have been investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Although it was recently reported that the photothermal effect by direct infrared neural stimulation is an alternative for retina prosthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, it requires the use of photoabsorbers in close proximity of the target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The Au nanoparticles synthesized in our work have diameters of ~10 nm and are strongly bound to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowire surfaces. Although the photo-thermal conversion efficiency of small Au nanoparticles is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, according to theoretical calculations, the temperature increase at the surface of Au nanoparticles in water is substantially lower for Au nanoparticles with diameters of 10 nm than those with diameters of 50 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, the photothermal stimulation of RGCs from our 10-nm-diameter Au nanoparticles should be minor. Instead, the Au nanoparticles in our work enable efficient charge injection into TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires upon photo-illumination. From our experimental data, it is clear that the RGC responses are closely correlated to the photocurrent stimulation of the Au-TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowire systems. In addition, the major responses from the UV regime confirm the photovoltaic contribution of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires for RGC stimulation. Thus, the mechanism reported in this work is mainly attributed to photovoltaic stimulation.</p><p id="Par21">It is noted that the estimated receptive field was ~300 µm using 45 μm light spot. However, there was an increase in responsive percentage of RGCs when the size of the stimulation light spot was increased from 100 µm to 600 µm. The reason for the increase in RGC response for larger light spot is due to the increased photovoltaic current induced by larger light spot (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9a, b</xref>). On the other hand, photocurrent induced by 45 μm light spot that was 300 µm away was too small to induce RGC responses.</p><p id="Par22">Compared to other materials, the 1D oriented NW arrays mimic the morphology of rod and cone photoreceptors, and offer several distinctive features. First, the unique 1D anisotropic morphology of NW arrays provides an efficient photo-to-electric conversion modality, similar to the NW arrays-based photovoltaic devices. The nanoscale length of the NW radial dimension allows for fast separation of photogenerated carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the micron-scale length of the NW axial dimension can efficiently absorb incident light with excellent photoabsorption coefficients, with a thickness much smaller than normal photoreceptor cell layers. As shown in the pupillary light reflex experiment, the sensitivity of blind mice implanted with NW arrays was similar to that in wild-type mice.</p><p id="Par23">Second, the vertically oriented NW arrays are densely and uniformly grown over the surface, which resemble photoreceptor rods and cones in the outer retina layer. The space between neighboring NW arrays is on the order of hundreds of nanometers, and no electrodes or power supplies are needed, thus allowing for a much higher spatial density (~10 NW arrays per μm<sup>2</sup>) of active stimulation elements than most of the previously reported photoresponsive surface. The calcium imaging experiments in our work demonstrate that adjacent neurons can be activated simultaneously by NW arrays. In addition, as shown in our work, the feature size of light response can be as small as ~50 and ~300 μm for near UV and green light, respectively. Further increase in the sensitivity of individual NW arrays may continue to improve the spatial resolution.</p><p id="Par24">Third, the rough morphologies of the vertically oriented NW arrays are beneficial for direct interfacing with cultured neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, retinal tissues or in vivo subretinal implant into live mice, with good biocompatibility and photo/chemical stability for over 8 weeks. The interface between the vertically oriented NW arrays and retinal cells/tissues leads to efficient light information processing. Our in vivo experiments have suggested the possibility of using NW arrays for chronic implant.</p><p id="Par25">Fourth, although NW arrays used in present work have not been capable for color vision, further development of multiple nanowire types with different spectral responses may be a potentially feasible strategy to realize such a scenario in the near future. For example, color vision can become possible if 1) type A nanowire is sensitive to red color and type B nanowire is sensitive to green color; 2) type A nanowire induces smaller firing rate and type B nanowire induces larger firing rate in RGC; 3) after training, the visual cortex can rewire to recognize the difference in RGC activities, and hence differentiate red color from green color.</p><p id="Par26">In summary, we demonstrated a vertically oriented Au–TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays as artificial photoreceptors, which absorbs light and generates photovoltage, and consequently triggers spiking activities in the interfaced neurons and restore light responses in the photoreceptor-degenerated retina. The spatial resolution is approaching or comparable to ~50 μm, and the size of receptive field is comparable to that in wild-type mice. The light-response inhibition by glutamatergic antagonists suggests the NW arrays-interfaced retinas were capable of processing visual information through innate retinal circuits. Moreover, functional and behavioral restoration of light sensitivity has been demonstrated with subretinal implant of the Au–TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays in blind mice, suggesting the possibility for using NW arrays as prosthetic devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub> and Au–TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowire arrays</title><p id="Par27">TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays were vertically grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (Wuhan Ge-Ao Ltd., China) or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates by a hydrothermal method, in which tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was used for the Ti precursor. In a typical synthesis, 0.1 g of Ti foil and 18 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution were put into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a total volume of 25 mL. The PDMS elastomer was then immersed into the solution after ultrasonic cleaning for 30 min in a 1:1:1 (v/v/v) mixture of acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 12 h in an electric oven. For the Au-TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays synthesis, after the fabrication of TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays, Au nanoparticles were deposited on TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays by a solution reduction approach. Briefly, an FTO substrate with TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays was soaked into 0.01 M HAuCl<sub>4</sub> (with pH tuned to 4.5 by adding 0.2 M NaOH) for 2 h. The sample was then thoroughly washed by DI water, dried in air and annealed in air at 300 °C for 2 h. For in vivo implantation and measurement, after nanowire synthesis, the side of FTO substrate grown with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires was pre-covered with a thin layer of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and incubated at 85 °C for 5 min. Then, the FTO substrates were etched in a hydrogen fluoride solution (20%) for ~9 h to reduce the thickness of FTO substrates to below 100 μm, followed by removal of PMMA in aceton.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Photoelectric measurement</title><p id="Par28">The photoelectric measurement was carried out using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with a 3-electrode system, in which the Au–TiO<sub>2</sub> NW arrays photoanode, a coiled Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
