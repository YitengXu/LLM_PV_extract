In this study, the substrate effect on the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2D Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayers was investigated using first principles calculations. The isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer shows large variation in HER activity depending on hydrogen coverage: it has relatively low activity at low hydrogen coverage but high activity at high hydrogen coverage. Among Ag, Au, Cu, and graphene substrates, the HER activity is improved on the Ag and Cu substrates especially at low hydrogen coverage, while the effects of the Au and graphene substrates on the HER activity are insignificant. The improvement is caused by the charge redistribution in the Mo<sub>2</sub>C layer on the substrate, and therefore the HER activity becomes high for any hydrogen coverage on the Ag and Cu substrates. Our results suggest that, in two-dimensional electrocatalysis, the substrate has a degree of freedom to tune the catalytic activity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chungbuk National University Korea National University Development Project (2020)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>6075</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>31</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_9935.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">There are various clean and renewable energy resources that are alternatives to fossil fuels, such as solar, wind, tide, and biomass energy. However, they suffer from intermittent availability, and thus, efficient energy conversion and storage systems are necessary for these alternatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Hydrogen has been considered a promising candidate for energy storage. It is clean and renewable with an energy storage density much higher than that of batteries, which makes it suitable for application in large-scale production facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water involves proton reduction and concomitant evolution of hydrogen molecule; it is an endothermic reaction with an additional kinetic energy barrier in intermediate processes. In this regard, catalysis to lower the kinetic energy barrier is crucial for efficient hydrogen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although noble metals like Pt and Pd show high catalytic performance, they cannot be used in large-scale industrial applications owing to their scarcity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, the development of low-cost and high-performance HER electrocatalysts has emerged an urgent issue for renewable and clean energy. In addition, HER is important for a variety of electrochemical processes either than energy storage, such as hydrogen fuel cells, electrodeposition, and the corrosion of metals in acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as potential HER catalysts owing to their large surface areas and earth-abundant elements. To date, several 2D systems, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have been studied for HER electrocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and the results showed that the HER performance can be improved by intrinsic defects, doping, surface functionalization, strain engineering, phase regulation, and grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recently, the 2D transitional-metal carbide/nitride monolayer (MXene) such as Mo<sub>2</sub>C was experimentally discovered as a new type of 2D material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The chemical formula of MXene is M<sub>n+1</sub>X<sub>n</sub>, where M is a transition metal and X is C or N. In contrast to TMDs, MXene is intrinsically a metal in the 1<italic>T</italic> and 2<italic>H</italic> phases and has a high density of states near the Fermi level. These features are a prerequisite for excellent HER activity, and several theoretical and experimental studies for the electrocatalytic properties of MXene have been performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. For example, the basal planes of Mo<sub>2</sub>C can be catalytically activated by functionalization with –O, –H, –OH, and –F groups in contrast to 2<italic>H</italic>-MoS<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Among these functional groups, the highest HER performance was observed for the samples functionalized with the –O group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The catalytic activity of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C 2<italic>H</italic> phase can be enhanced by Co doping owing to the increase in the density of states at the Fermi level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and Mo<sub>2</sub>C co-doped with N and S also shows a high HER performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Despite all the efforts such as surface functionalization and doping, more theoretical understandings of the HER processes and guides to improve the HER activity are still required to apply the 2D Mo<sub>2</sub>C to the electrocatalytic applications.</p><p id="Par4">2D materials in electrocatalytic cells are placed on a metal substrate, which acts as an electrode. Because 2D systems are atomically thin unlike bulk materials, the substrate inevitably affects their surface chemistry. The effect may be considered insignificant because the catalytic reactions occur directly on the 2D materials, not on the substrate. However, this is not true: one famous counterintuitive example is the strong modification of chemical reactions in ultrathin oxide films on metal substrates, where the electron tunneling from the substrate plays a crucial role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As such, it may be possible to optimize HER activity using substrates. Although there have been significant studies on chemically modifying MXenes and their HER electrocatalytic properties, the substrate effect on these materials is not yet understood. In this study, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the substrate effect on the HER activity of MXene. Here, we focus on Mo<sub>2</sub>C as a typical example of MXene and consider several metal substrates such as Ag, Au, Cu, and graphene. Based on the Sabatier principle, we estimated the catalytic HER activity using the calculated reaction free energy for hydrogen adsorption. Our results showed that the HER activity of the isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer is higher than those of the isolated Ag and Au metal catalysts, but is comparable to that of the Cu catalyst. While the substrate effects of the Au and graphene were not significant, the HER activities of Mo<sub>2</sub>C on the Ag and Cu substrates were improved to be better than that of Cu. These improvements are caused by the modification of the effective charge of Mo atoms and consequent reduction of the Coulomb attraction between Mo<sub>2</sub>C and hydrogen. The results suggest that the substrate can be used for fine-tuning HER activity in two-dimensional electrocatalysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par5">It is well known that the catalytic activity of a material is strongly correlated with the reactant–material bond strength: a volcano-shaped graph is formed when the activity is plotted with the bond strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This is explained by the Sabatier principle, which states that catalytic activity is high when the bond strength is neither too strong nor too weak. If the bond strength is too weak, the surface cannot activate the catalytic reaction. If the bond strength is too strong, the product fails to dissociate; the optimal bond strength balances the two extremes. HER also involves complicate processes, and several factors such as reaction path and solvation could affect the HER activity. Based on the Sabatier principle, however, the HER activity can be simply quantified by the reaction free energy in hydrogen adsorption (<italic>ΔG</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, as defined in Method. Previous experiments have shown that an electrocatalyst with a <italic>ΔG</italic> close to the optimal value exhibits a high exchange current density, which is a measure of the electrocatalytic activity, and the exchange current density exponentially decreases as <italic>ΔG</italic> deviates from the optimal value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. <italic>ΔG</italic> has been a reasonable descriptor of the HER activity for a wide variety of metals and alloys and has been applied in the design of highly efficient catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Parsons suggested that the optimum value was approximately <italic>ΔG</italic> = 0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Recent theoretical and experimental results have reported that the optimal <italic>ΔG</italic> (approximately − 0.4 eV) is slightly smaller than zero in alkaline electrolytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Before we discuss the Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayers, we consider the HER activity of metal substrates such as Ag, Au, Cu, Pt, and graphene. For the substrates, only the (001) surface was considered. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a shows the <italic>ΔG</italic> of the metal substrates with respect to the coverage of the hydrogen absorbed on the surfaces. The coverage is defined as the ratio of the number of absorbed H atoms to the total number of possible absorption sites. The Pt substrate had the smallest <italic>ΔG</italic> for each H coverage, and the <italic>ΔG</italic> for each H coverage increased in the order of Cu, Ag, Au, and graphene. The ranges of the <italic>ΔG</italic> were from − 0.37 to − 0.02 eV, from 0.14 to 0.30 eV, from 0.41 to 0.53 eV, from 0.50 to 0.97 eV, and from 0.89 to 1.53 eV, for Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and graphene, respectively. These results are in good agreement with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In the graphene substrate, <italic>ΔG</italic> abruptly decreases to − 0.79 and − 0.54 eV at the two high coverages of 0.75 and 1.0, respectively. This is related to the qualitative change in the C π-bonding network accompanied by the metal-to-insulator transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In this regard, we distinguish the two results (open violate circle) from the others in low coverages in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, because an insulator cannot be an electrocatalyst. Although the <italic>ΔG</italic> of both Pt and Cu were close to zero, the experiments clearly show that Pt is the better HER catalyst compared to Cu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The results indicate that the optimal <italic>ΔG</italic> is close to, but smaller than zero. Therefore, in the following, we set the optimal value to the average <italic>ΔG</italic> of Pt (<italic>− </italic>0.18 eV), which is represented by the horizontal lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b. This indicates as the <italic>ΔG</italic> approaches the optimal value, the catalysis of HER activity increases.</p><p id="Par7">Next, we consider the HER activity, i.e., <italic>ΔG</italic>, of Mo<sub>2</sub>C. To date, many studies have considered the Mo<sub>2</sub>C 1<italic>T</italic> phase, despite it being less stable than the 2<italic>H</italic> phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Here, we focused on the 2<italic>H</italic> phase. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Mo<sub>2</sub>C has three absorption sites for hydrogen atoms, such as the top of a hexagonal center (TH), a C atom (TC), and a Mo atom (TM) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). We placed a H atom on each site and optimized the atomic structures. The H atom is the most stable at the TH site. The TC site is metastable, and its energy is higher by 0.20 eV than that of the TH site. The TM site is unstable, and the H atom moves to the stable TH site during ionic relaxation. In high H coverages, the TH sites of H atoms also have lower energies than the other sites. In this regard, we calculated the <italic>ΔG</italic> of the TH sites, and the results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b. For the isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer, <italic>ΔG</italic> varies from − 0.71 eV for low hydrogen coverage (0.0625) to − 0.37 eV for full hydrogen coverage (1.0). To check the calculational accuracy in our systems, we have also compared the PBE functional results with the RPBE functional ones, and as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, the two results are in good agreement within 0.03 eV. In this regard, we conclude that, in the systems that we considered, the PBE functional also provides reasonable results with the same accuracy level of the RPBE functional.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Atomic structures of (<bold>a</bold>) Mo<sub>2</sub>C and (<bold>b</bold>) Mo<sub>2</sub>C on a metal substrate.

Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows the atomic structure of Mo<sub>2</sub>C on a substrate: the Mo<sub>2</sub>C was placed on the (001) surface of the substrate. There was no strong bonding between the Mo<sub>2</sub>C and substrates, but a heterostructure was formed by a weak dispersive interaction. The atomic structures indicated that the physical properties of Mo<sub>2</sub>C were not significantly altered by the substrates. Using these structures, we calculated the <italic>ΔG</italic> of Mo<sub>2</sub>C on Cu, Ag, Au, and graphene substrates, and the results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b. The <italic>ΔG</italic> values for all cases are distributed in the range from − 0.74 to − 0.35 eV, which is similar to the range of the isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C case (− 0.71 ~ − 0.37 eV). These results indicate that Mo<sub>2</sub>C is dominant in determining <italic>ΔG</italic> because the H atoms directly bond to Mo<sub>2</sub>C, and the substrate effects are secondary. However, there are some <italic>ΔG</italic> differences that are attributable to the substrate. On the Cu and Ag substrates, the variation of <italic>ΔG</italic> was significantly reduced: while the <italic>ΔG</italic> for high coverages is similar to that of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer, the <italic>ΔG</italic> for low coverage increases from that of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer. This <italic>ΔG</italic> change results in the high HER activity for all H coverages. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the overall HER activity becomes better than that observed in the isolated Cu substrates, as the <italic>ΔG</italic> approaches the optimal value. Thus, the HER activity of 2D Mo<sub>2</sub>C can be adjusted by the substrate. For Mo<sub>2</sub>C on Au and graphene substrates, on the other hand, the changes in <italic>ΔG</italic> with H coverage are similar to those of the isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer, which implies that the effects of the two substrates are negligible. Previous work suggested that HER activity can be improved in small Mo<sub>2</sub>C clusters on clean/nitrogen-doped graphene substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Note that our results have only considered the pure 2D Mo<sub>2</sub>C fully covered on clean graphene surfaces, and in different structures such as the small Mo<sub>2</sub>C clusters in the previous work the substrate effect could be significant. We also considered the two Mo<sub>2</sub>C layers on the Ag substrate. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, the <italic>ΔG</italic> (red open triangle) decreases from <italic>ΔG</italic> of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C monolayer on the Ag substrate and approaches toward <italic>ΔG</italic> of the isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C. As one may expected, this is because the substrate effect is reduced, when more Mo<sub>2</sub>C layers are stacked on the substrate.</p><p id="Par10">While we have focused on the Mo<sub>2</sub>C 2<italic>H</italic> phase until now, the substrate can also tune the HER activity of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C 1<italic>T</italic> phase. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, <italic>ΔG</italic> of 1<italic>T</italic> Mo<sub>2</sub>C varies from − 0.53 eV (at the coverage 0.125) to − 0.41 eV (at the full coverage 1.0). On the Ag substrate, i.e., 1<italic>T</italic> Mo<sub>2</sub>C on the Ag substrate, <italic>ΔG</italic> is changed to the range from − 0.46 eV (at the coverage 0.5) to − 0.35 eV (at the low coverage 0.0625). Similar to the 2<italic>H</italic> Mo<sub>2</sub>C, the HER activity of 1<italic>T</italic> Mo<sub>2</sub>C can be also improved on the Ag substrate.</p><p id="Par11">The increase in <italic>ΔG</italic> for low H coverage on the Cu and Ag substrates indicates the weakening of the bond strength between Mo<sub>2</sub>C and H. To understand the change in the bond strength, we performed Bader charge analysis, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In the Mo<sub>2</sub>C without a substrate, some of the six valence electrons in the Mo atom are transferred to the C atoms, resulting in positively charged Mo ions and negatively charged C ions. Bader charge analysis shows quantitative changes in the valence electrons: each Mo atom in Mo<sub>2</sub>C has 5.434 valence electrons, which implies that the Mo atom loses 0.566 electrons and thus the effective charge of the Mo ion becomes + 0.566. When an H atom is absorbed in the TH site of Mo<sub>2</sub>C, it forms bonds with the three nearest neighboring Mo atoms.

For the Mo<sub>2</sub>C on the Ag and Cu substrates, the valence electrons in the Mo atoms increased to 5.502 and 5.492, respectively, compared to the isolate Mo<sub>2</sub>C (5.434). This indicated that the Ag and Cu substrates donate electrons to the Mo<sub>2</sub>C layer, and as a result the effective charge of the Mo atoms is reduced to + 0.498 and + 0.508 on the Ag and Cu substrates, respectively. This reduction also affects the effective charge of the Mo atoms after H absorption, and as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the effective charges of the nearest neighboring Mo atoms became + 0.605 and + 0.604 on the Ag and Cu substrates, respectively, which is smaller than that of the isolated Mo<sub>2</sub>C (+ 0.658). On the other hand, the effective charge of the absorbed H atom (~ − 0.45) remains nearly the same for the different substrates (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
