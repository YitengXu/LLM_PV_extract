In this regard, polysulfide-air redox flow batteries demonstrated great potential. However, the crossover of polysulfide is one significant challenge. Here, we report a stable and cost-effective alkaline-based hybrid polysulfide-air redox flow battery where a dual-membrane-structured flow cell design mitigates the sulfur crossover issue. Moreover, combining manganese/carbon catalysed air electrodes with sulfidised Ni foam polysulfide electrodes, the redox flow battery achieves a maximum power density of 5.8 mW cm<sup>â2</sup> at 50% state of charge and 55âÂ°C. An average round-trip energy efficiency of 40% is also achieved over 80 cycles at 1 mA cm<sup>â2</sup>. Based on the performance reported, techno-economic analyses suggested that energy and power costs of about 2.5 US$/kWh and 1600 US$/kW, respectively, has be achieved for this type of alkaline polysulfide-air redox flow battery, with significant scope for further reduction.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Polysulfide-air redox flow batteries are an appealing energy storage technology but suffer from polysulfide crossover and the use of costly catalysts.

Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have received great attention for medium- to large-scale energy storage applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Compared to conventional rechargeable batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, RFBs provide a number of unique benefits, such as modularity, independence of power and energy, tolerance of deep charge and discharge and enhanced safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A large number of RFB systems have been proposed and demonstrated in recent years, of which the most-developed system today is the all-vanadium RFB (VRFB). However, the current cost of VRFBs ($400â500/kWh) remains too high for widespread commercial adoption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Amongst various redox chemistries, the polysulfide redox couple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> has attracted great attention due to its low cost, environmentally benign nature and high energy density owing to the high aqueous solubility of polysulfide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For these reasons, the organic-solvent-based polysulfide chemistry has been widely looked into in lithium-sulfur batteries and sodium-sulfur batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the aqueous polysulfide redox couple has been adopted in a number of RFB systems, including polysulfide-bromine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, polysulphide-iodide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, polysulphide-ferrocyanide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and polysulfide-air (PSA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Among these, the PSA system has the lowest chemical cost of storage due to its use of the inexpensive oxygen redox couple.</p><p id="Par4">Analysis of the prior art<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> demonstrates the development in 2011 of an all-alkaline PSA RFB system with alkaline-based oxygen(air) redox couple and a polysulfide redox couple, separated by an anion-exchange membrane (AEM). During the discharge process, shorter-chain-length polysulfides are oxidised into longer-chain-length polysulfides in the anolyte while O<sub>2</sub> is reduced to OH<sup>â</sup> in the catholyte, and vice versa.

The reaction mechanisms of PSOR/PSRR are still not fully understood due to the complex chemistry of aqueous polysulfide solutions. It is commonly believed that polysulfide ions with a chain length between 2 and 5 (S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub><sup>2â</sup>, <italic>x</italic>â=â2â5) exist in large quantities within alkaline polysulfide solutions in addition to bisulfide ions (HS<sup>â</sup>), hydroxide ions (OH<sup>â</sup>) and alkali-metal cations (e.g., Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These varieties of sulfur species are in dynamic equilibria with each other within aqueous polysulfide solutions.

While the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte must be alkaline to supress hydrogen sulphide formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the air electrolyte can be alkaline or acidic in PSA systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The use of an acidic air electrolyte however requires expensive platinum-group metal (PGM) catalysts and prevents the use of polymer-based cation-exchange membranes (CEM) due to the neutralisation of two electrolytes in the long-term. In contrast, the use of an alkaline air electrolyte does not suffer from the neutralisation problem and also enables the use of non-precious metals and metal oxides as the air electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, at the cost of a lower open-circuit voltage (OCV) (0.88âV vs 1.705âV for acidic-catholyte-based system).</p><p id="Par7">Another key challenge of polysulfide-based RFBs is the crossover of polysulfides through membranes which leads to self-discharge and rapid capacity decay.

The concentration of polysulfide was determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements after each given time. When testing a single-membrane structure, two commercially available IEMs were used, namely Nafion 117 CEM and FAA-3-PK-130 AEM, which are also the IEMs used in the actual PSA RFBs. The UV-Vis absorbance was first calibrated to the concentration of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> solution, the calibration spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>, which shows that dilute polysulfide solutions have two characteristic absorption peaks, at around 304ânm and 369ânm.

Therefore the 369ânm peak was used to determine the amount of permeated polysulfide ions. However, unlike single-solute solutions, of which the UV-Vis absorbance is generally acknowledged to be proportional to its concentration, the composition of aqueous polysulfide solutions is complex with various polysulfide ions in dynamic equilibria with each other, and the concentration distribution of various polysulfide ions is affected by a number of factors such as concentration, pH and temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

However, concerns of high charge transfer/mass transport losses for the OER arises due to the limited capacity and conductivity of OH<sup>â</sup> of the CEM, especially under high operating current densities. To confirm these speculations, a single-cell alkaline PSA RFB with either Nafion 117 CEM or FAA-3-PK-130 AEM was assembled and tested in this study. To test the polysulfide crossover through the dual-membrane structure, a dual-membrane RFB was assembled in the glovebox, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. Three peristaltic pumps were used to circulate 50âmL 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/1 M NaOH solution to the anode side, 50âmL 1âM NaOH solution to the intermediate plate, and environmental argon to the cathode side respectively to mimic the real PSA RFB operating conditions. All pumping speeds were set to 50âmLâmin<sup>â1</sup>. Every 25h, polysulfide concentration in the intermediate solution was examined using UV-vis analysis, denoted as Dual-mid. At the same time, the cathode side was flushed with 50âmL of 1âM NaOH for 2âmin, and the polysulfide crossover amount on the cathode side was determined by examining the polysulfide concentration of this flushed solution, denoted as Dual-air. The increase in the total amount of polysulfide in the permeate solution normalised by area with time is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, and the polysulfide flux through the dual-membrane structure is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. The amount of polysulfide crossover in the intermediate solution of the dual-membrane structure is identical to that in permeate solution of the single-CEM structure, suggesting the crossover experiments using different setup (H-cell vs RFB) are comparable and both are valid. On the other hand, the polysulfide crossover rate through the dual-membrane structure is much lower than that of single-CEM; the calculated flux (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) is 4% of the CEM and 0.1% of the AEM. This suggests that the dual-membrane structure is effective in blocking polysulfide crossover, and that the AEM can be used to block small concentrations of polysulfide ions.</p><p id="Par17">The effectiveness of the dual-membrane structure was further examined in actual PSA RFB operation. The photographic pictures of the setup are shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>.

High charging potential would severely damage the FAA-3-PK-130 AEM, hence an upper cutoff voltage of 1.4âV was set.

This agrees well with the result of polysulfide diffusivity determination experiment, which shows that polysulfide ions can diffuse 4.6 times faster than in CEM. This was also confirmed by visual observation of the experimental setup (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), where a considerable amount of orange-coloured solution was found at the outlet of the air-side half-cell after a few cycles.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Charge and discharge cycling of the alkaline PSA RFB.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Experimental setup of single-membrane-structured PSA RFB. <bold>b</bold> Experimental setup of dual-membrane-structured PSA RFB. <bold>c</bold> Voltage profile of the PSA RFB with FAA-3-PK-130 AEM over 10 cycles. <bold>d</bold> Voltage profile of the PSA RFB with Nafion 117 CEM over 20 cycles. <bold>e</bold> Voltage profile of the PSA RFB with both FAA-3-PK-130 AEM and Nafion 117 CEM over 80 cycles. <bold>f</bold> Voltage efficiencies against cycle number of the PSA RFBs with either single or dual membranes. <bold>g</bold> Coulombic efficiencies against cycle number of the PSA RFBs with either single or dual membranes.

On the other hand, no yellow/orange-coloured solution was observed at the air-side half-cell during the electrochemical measurements of the single-CEM-based PSA RFB.

The two membranes were separated by an insulating porous interlayer frame, wherein 1âM NaOH solution was circulated. During the operation of this dual-membrane-structured PSA RFB, the CEM would allow Na<sup>+</sup> to pass through but stop the sulfur species (e.g., HS<sup>â</sup> and S<sub>x</sub><sup>2â</sup>), so that the sulfur species remained within the polysulfide electrolyte. The AEM allows the OH<sup>â</sup> ions to pass through and participate in the OER/ORR reactions on the air-side half-cell. For the minor amount of polysulfide that crosses through the Nafion, this would be flushed away and diluted by the circulating intermediate solution, thereby reducing the amount of polysulfide that can reach the air-electrode-side.</p><p id="Par20">As demonstrated in the cycling curves of the dual-membrane PSA RFB in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, the dual-membrane cell structure was successful in mitigating the crossover of polysulfide ions towards the airside half-cell. It also prevented high charging overpotentials of the CEM-based single-membrane PSA RFB, as demonstrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>. As a result, the dual-membrane-structured PSA RFB exhibited both higher voltage efficiency and high energy efficiencies, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4fâh</xref>. In addition, the dual-membrane-structured PSA RFB showed a similar average discharging voltage to the single-CEM-based PSA RFB, where in both setups a Nafion 117 CEM was placed by the anode compartment. This indicates that the observed higher average discharging voltage for the single-CEM-based and dual-membrane-structured PSA RFBs compared to the single-AEM-based PSA RFB is related to the use of Nafion 117 CEM instead of FAA-3-PK-130 AEM. The performance of the dual-membrane-structured alkaline PSA RFB is presented in more detail in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Performance of the dual-membrane-structured PSA RFB</title><p id="Par21">Although operating temperatures up to 55âÂ°C have been reported for aqueous polysulfide-based RFBs in the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, it is worth noting that higher operating temperatures will not only improve the kinetics of PSOR/PSRR and OER/ORR but will also accelate the side reactions that lead to the formation of oxysulfur anions within the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte and hence capacity degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, electrochemical measurements of this alkaline PSA RFB were mainly conducted at 25âÂ°C Â± 0.2âÂ°C in this study as before. Since fresh air was continuously supplied to the air-side half-cell with a mass flow controller, and the pH change of the NaOH intermediate solution can be neglected because of the large tank size used relative to the polysulfide electrolyte, the state-of-charge (SOC) of this alkaline PSA RFB entirely depends on the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte. Previous studies showed that confining the nominal composition of the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte between disulphide (S<sub>2</sub><sup>2â</sup>) and tetrasulfide (S<sub>4</sub><sup>2â</sup>) was important in maintaining the stability of aqueous polysulfide electrolytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, in this work, the 0% SOC and 100% SOC of the PSA RFB were set as equivalent to the nominal anolyte composition of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, respectively.</p><p id="Par22">Upon assembly, the alkaline PSA RFB exhibited an OCV of ~0.81âV. EIS measurement of the full cell showed only one depressed semi-circle (correlating to the overall charge transfer process within the PSA RFB), with an intercept on the Z<sub>real</sub> axis of 2.16âÎ©âcm<sup>2</sup> as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>, which is attributed to the overall ohmic resistance of the full cell including the ohmic resistance of cell components and the contact resistance. It is difficult to distinguish the charge transfer process of PSOR/PSRR and OER/ORR by the EIS method. However, by inserting a Hg|HgO reference electrode into the intermediate NaOH solution (shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), we are able to decouple and monitor the half-cell potentials of the PSA RFB alongside the electrochemical measurements. Under small current densities (&lt;10âmAâcm<sup>â2</sup>), where mass transport does not play an important role in the battery performance, the overpotential of each half-cell represents the combination of activation losses and charge transfer losses. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows the overpotential of the air-side and polysulfide-side half-cells during the polarisation curve measurement of the alkaline PSA RFB at 50% SOC and 25âÂ°C. The overpotential of the half-cell reactions follows the trend of: OER&gt;ORR&gt;PSRR&gt;PSOR. On the polysulfide side, the larger overpotential of PSRR compared to PSOR at the same current density is in accordance with the findings of previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Overall, the air-side half-cell showed higher overpotentials compared to the polysulfide-side across all current densities and under all temperatures amongst the polarisation curve measurements. Therefore, it is safe to say that the air-side reaction is the rate-limiting step of the overall battery reaction, highlighting that the development of a better reversible air-electrode is an important future objective.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Polarisation curve measurement and cycling performance of the alkaline PSA RFB with dual membranes.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Polarisation curve and power density curve at 25âÂ°C and various SOc. <bold>b</bold> Polarisation curve and power density curve at 50% SOC and various temperatures. <bold>c</bold> Measured half-cell overpotentials against current density at 25âÂ°C and 50% SOc. <bold>d</bold> measured polysulfide-side half-cell potential profile against capacity. <bold>e</bold> Measured air-side half-cell potential profile against capacity. <bold>f</bold> Round-trip energy efficiency against current density.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2022_30044_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">To investigate the effect of temperature and SOC dependence on the battery peak power density, polarisation curve measurements were conducted at various operating temperatures and SOCs, as demonstrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>.

Since the SOC of the battery is solely determined by the composition of the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte, and given a fixed overall sulfur concentration, the rate of PSOR increases with the average chain length of polysulfide ions. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> shows the polarisation curves and power density curves of the alkaline PSA RFB at 50% SOC and in the temperature range of 25â55âÂ°C.

A slightly lower OCV of 0.745âV was observed due to the use of a less concentrated polysulfide electrolyte. To exclude the effect of polysulfide oxidation by atmospheric air (as this was not a sealed system), the polysulfide electrolyte was replenished every 10 cycles. The full cycling voltage profile of dual-membrane structured alkaline PSA RFB is shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>.</p><p id="Par25">The voltage profile of the full-cell and both half-cells for this alkaline PSA RFB over 80 cycles are presented in Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>. The charging voltage reached the cutoff voltage of 1.4âV at the 80th cycle and cycling was stopped. Based on the voltage profile, the average discharge and charge potentials of the full-cell and both half-cells during the 1st and 80th cycle are summarised in Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. The average potential difference between the charge and discharge processes of the air-side reaction (0.322âV during the 1st cycle and 0.634âV during the 80th cycle) was much higher than that of the polysulfide-side reaction (0.183âV during the 1st cycle and 0.236âV during the 80th cycle). This confirmed that the air side is the performance limiting side of this alkaline PSA RFB. Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> also shows that, over 80 cycles, the average discharge voltage of the full-cell decreased from 0.487âV to 0.327âV (0.16âV in difference) and the average charge voltage of the full-cell increased from 0.992âV to 1.305âV (0.313âV in difference). This indicates that the deterioration of the alkaline PSA RFBâs energy efficiency was mainly associated with the charging process. In addition, the charging potential of the air side increased from 0.410âV to 0.688âV, which accounted for 89% of the full-cell potential increase (from 0.992âV to 1.305âV) in the charging process. To conclude, the degradation of this alkaline PSA RFB was mainly attributed to the catalytic activity loss of the air electrode towards OER, which is likely due to the dissolution of MnO<sub>2</sub>. The MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>â</sup>/MnO<sub>2</sub> redox couple has been investigated in both acidic and alkaline conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Its standard potential in the alkaline conditions is 0.56âV vs. SHE, which is close to the half-cell voltage of air electrode during charge. Therefore, the oxidation of MnO<sub>2</sub> to highly dissolvable MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>â</sup> is deduced to be the parasitic reaction that causes the air electrode degradation. The detailed mechanism of air electrode degradation is the focus of future work.</p><p id="Par26">The upper or the lower cutoff voltages were not reached during battery cycling until the 80th cycle, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>. Hence, the capacity and the coulombic efficiency of this alkaline PSA RFB were both maintained at 100% throughout the 79 cycles, and were 98% for the last cycle. Therefore, the round-trip energy efficiency of this alkaline PSA RFB was calculated to be the multiplication of its voltage efficiency and coulombic efficiency. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref> presents the round-trip energy efficiencies of this alkaline PSA RFB as a function of the cycle number. The repeating pattern on the efficiency figure is attributed to replenishing the polysulfide anolyte every 10 cycles to eliminate the effect of polysulfide oxidation by leaked air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

These differences are small compared with the total impedance which is over 60âÎ©âcm<sup>2</sup>. The polarisation and degradation of the first 10 cycles of different membrane combinations are also similar. This suggests that changing the membranes had little influence on the performance of the dual-membrane PSA RFB.

For each polarisation measurement, a constant current was applied to the flow battery for 1âmin where the steady-state potential at the end of the measurement was recorded, after which the battery was charged back to the original SOC under the same current density before proceeding to the next polarisation measurement at a higher current density. Potentiostatic EIS of the full cells was measured at OCV at 100 SOC.
