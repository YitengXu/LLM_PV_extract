These Cu/CuO-NPs are highly stable and used in the degradation of organic dyes like methylene blue and reduction of organic compounds such as phenols. They are also used as antibacterial, antioxidant and antifungal agent due to their cytotoxicity. They are also examined for agricultural crops growth and productivity. Cu-NPs increased the root and shoot growth of mung bean. In wheat plants, these particles reduced shoot growth; and enhanced the grain yield and stress tolerance through starch degradation. Similarly, CuO-NPs treated seedlings have shown reduced chlorophyll, carotenoid and sugar content, whereas proline and anthocyanins were increased in <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> seedlings. Overall, this review presents the recent understanding of plant-mediated Cu and CuO-NPs fabrication and their application in biomedicine, environmental remediation and agricultural practices. A comparison of the traditional/conventional method of fabrication of NPs with those of green protocols has also been made. Some misconception of copper chemistry has also been critically discussed in terms of oxidation and reduction reactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cu/CuO NPs</kwd><kwd>Biogenic synthesis</kwd><kwd>Biomedical</kwd><kwd>Crop growth</kwd><kwd>Applications</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40824_2020_Article_188.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomaterials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par13">Recent advancement in nanotechnology has accelerated our interest in designing nano sized particles of desired shape and size. Since their property changes with morphology they have been used in various areas of medicine, agriculture and environmental remediation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The ‘green synthesis’ of nanoparticles (NPs) using plant is advantageous over chemical, physical and or microbial synthesis as it removes the complicated protocol; and can also meet the large-scale production requirement. Further, the deliberate synthesis of NPs by chemical/physical methods require fairly large amount of toxic chemicals which also leave undesirable materials that pollute the environment. Disposal of such by products is also hazardous to human beings. Besides the use of expensive chemicals, the NPs thus fabricated are not capped/coated, and therefore they are not protected and are relatively less stable than those produced by plant-based materials. In order to protect these nanomaterials (NMs) they are coated with polyethylene glycol like polymers. Methods using lower and higher plant materials and their products; fungi and sometimes microorganisms for NPs fabrication are eco-friendly (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since these materials are easily available and do not require organic solvent as reaction medium, they are easy to handle and economical. In major cases the NMs thus synthesized are capped by biomolecules like phenols, tannin, flavonoids and ascorbate present in the plant materials. They enhance stability of NPs and also prevent their interaction with atmospheric oxygen. These NMs are thus not oxidized and can be kept for long period of time without undergoing any change in their properties. Green synthetic methods make use of many waste materials like banana peels, lemon rind, dried leaves of medicinal plants and algae etc. The precursor even in crude form may react with these materials to produce NPs. The noble metal NPs for example silver, gold, platinum and their alloys have been frequently biosynthesized by various workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Among the coinage metal NPs, copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) are of great interest due to their low cost, easy availability and high electrical conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Borkow and Gabbay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have reported that the copper ions are used as pesticides, fungicides and fertilizers. Copper oxide (CuO) is also a cheaper material in comparison to silver/gold and can easily be mixed with polymers due to their stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recently, Din et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] have discussed the synthesis and characterization of cupric-oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) together with their application as antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal agent.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. UV-Vis study has confirmed the reduction of copper acetate to Cu-NPs. The maximum absorption was recorded at 384 nm which confirmed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the NPs. Their FTIR spectrum indicated the presence of proteins, acids, flavonoids, polyphenols, carboxylic acid and alkaloids which reduced the copper ions into Cu-NPs.</p><p id="Par17">Cu-NPs of 50–250 nm diameters have been fabricated from <italic>Magnolia kobus</italic> leaf extract at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Most of these NPs were spherical in shape and their formation was confirmed from UV-Vis spectrum exhibiting a peak at 560 nm. As the concentration of Cu-NPs increases the intensity of absorption peak measured at 560 nm also increases. It has also been observed that with increase in temperature yield of the Cu-NPs increases. However, complete conversion was achieved at about 90–95 °C. It was observed that when concentration of <italic>Magnolia</italic> leaf extract was increased up to 20%, smaller and spherical NPs were formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is suggested that organic molecules/metabolites acting as capping agents also cause aggregation of NPs but it takes long time. Energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra showed signals for copper along with oxygen and carbon. Signals for other elements may not be due to biomolecules adhering to the surface of Cu-NPs but they may be due to impurity present in the colloidal mixture of NPs and leaf extract. It has been noted that chemically fabricated NPs were air oxidized while those synthesized by <italic>Magnolia</italic> leaf extract were stable for more than 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is because the biomolecules acting as capping agent protect the Cu-NPs from oxidation by air.</p><p id="Par18">Kulkarni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have examined the fabrication of Cu-NPs from copper sulfate and <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp. leaf extract at room temperature. A slight change in pH of the copper sulfate solution from 2.16 to 2.83 was observed when leaf extract at pH 6.96 was added followed by a change in colour of the resulting mixture which showed absorption at 572 nm in its Uv-Vis spectrum. FTIR spectrum of the Cu-NPs showed the presence of phenol, amine, amino acid and flavonoids. It has been suggested that the biomolecules present in the eucalyptus leaf extract act both as reducing and capping agent. The NPs were highly crystalline with face centred cubic (FCC) structure. Their average size was found to be 38.62 nm. It is worth observing that the concentration and pH of the reducing agent is mainly responsible for the production of NPs.</p><p id="Par19">Biosynthesis of Cu-NPs from leaf broth of <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> and the influence of concentration of precursor salt, concentration of leaf broth, temperature and pH of the medium were reported on the conversion rate of Cu-NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] which are similar to those found above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Ultrasmall Cu-NPsof 2.90 ± 0.64 nm diameter have been synthesized from lemongrass tea by one pot method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although, colour of the mixture containing both the Cu-NPs and lemongrass was yellow it did not exhibit any absorption in the UV-Vis region (350-950 nm). It has been ascribed to extremely small size of Cu-NPs which are devoid of surface plasmon resonance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is strange and unusual for NPs to exhibit colour but no absorption. Generally, a sharp peak is observed in 560 to 570 nm region for Cu-NPs if they are larger than 5 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Their IR spectra showed the presence of polyphenols, proteins and carbohydrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] as reducing agents. SEM and TEM images showed the presence of finely divided and dispersed Cu-NPs. However, they were not found to be oxidized either to cuprous oxide or cupric oxide which is quite obvious because in presence of reducing agents oxidation cannot occur. It has been observed that polyethyleneglycol or polyvinyl pyr olidone can also prevent the NPs from oxidation and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Cu-NPs synthesized using aqueous leaf extract of henna (<italic>Lawsonia inermis</italic>) showed an absorption peak at 570 nm which is the signature peak of CuO-NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Blue copper sulfate absorbs at 810 nm but Cu-NPs are reddish brown if all copper ions have been reduced to NPs. It has been reported that Cu-NPs are surrounded by a thin film of copper oxide (CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O) which is characterized by absorption at 800 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It may be due to the presence of already oxidized copper sulfate present as impurity because in solution it cannot be oxidized unless it is heated in open at about 900 °C. Cu-NPs are efficiently formed at pH 11. Perhaps reduction of copper ions is facilitated in highly alkaline medium as the lawsones are stabilized at higher pH. Electrical conductivity of calcined Cu-NPs was enhanced because all particles come closer as a result of which the mobility of electrons increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Authors have found that the absorption of Cu-NPsat 570 nm was lost and a new peak appeared at 285 nm when Cu-NPs were calcined. It is highly improbable for a calcined material to absorb in UV region of spectrum. It may be quite likely that the spectrum was not carefully run otherwise any transition metal or its oxide will not show any absorption in UV range. Their interpretation of electronic transition from inner to the outermost shell of copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] is highly unlikely because such situation occurs only when copper ion forms a coordination compound with a very strong ligand and forces one of the 3d<sup>9</sup> electrons to be transferred to the outer 4d orbital. Since there are no copper ions this peak at 284 nm is most likely to be due to some impurity. SEM and EDAX showed agglomerated spherical Cu-NPs. The suggestion that Cu-NPs are oxidized to CuO on exposure to air is author’s lack of knowledge of copper chemistry. If the Cu-NPs are exposed to air they will form CuSO<sub>4</sub> which is evidenced by a distinct blue colour on its surface but it is not oxidized to copper oxides.</p><p id="Par22">Biogenic synthesis and characterization of Cu-NPs from <italic>Citrus medica</italic> juice has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. UV-Vis spectrum showed absorption peak at 631 nm which has been taken as an evidence for the formation of Cu-NPs. Since the reduction reaction was carried out in an aluminum vessel instead of a glass vessel some fraction of aluminum would have dissolved in the citron juice. Blue CuSO<sub>4</sub> solution turned reddish brown due to formation of Cu<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> after the addition of citron juice, followed by deposition of shiny brown precipitate on the wall of aluminum vessel. It is suggested that a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compound in aqueous medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] according to the following reaction.

It has been shown from TEM images and size distribution studies that Cu-NPs are of 20–110 nm diameter. However, particles with 40 nm diameter are in abundance with FCC structure. Catalytic activity of Cu-NPs for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol has been studied in presence NaBH<sub>4</sub>. The reduction of nitrophenol to aminophenol was ascertained from a change in colour from light yellow to deep yellow followed by shift of absorption from 317 to 403 nm due to the formation of nitrophenolate ions. When Cu-NPs were added, the solution became colourless after 580 s with the appearance of a new peak at 300 nm, as a result of the formation of 4-amino phenol.</p><p id="Par25">Fabrication of Cu-NPs of 15–20 nm from aqueous peel extract of <italic>Punica granatum</italic> has been achieved which also acts as reducing as well as capping agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Since the mixture containing extract and CuSO<sub>4</sub> was heated at 80 °C, the enzymes would have certainly denatured and therefore the absorption in the above region may be only due to other stable phytochemicals present in the extract.</p><p id="Par26">Activated carbon microfibers (ACF) coated with copper and stabilized with sodium dodecyl sulphate have been used as carrier for copper transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It was calcined at 350 °C to CuO-ACF and finally reduced in a current of hydrogen to generate Cu-ACF carbon nanofibers (CNF). They were then grown on Cu-ACF to produce Cu-CNF/ACF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The <italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> plant treated with Cu-CNF grew well relative to the untreated plant. Shoots of the plant showed the presence of Cu-CNF. Presence of copper and carbon fibers was seen in the shoot of plant. It is supposed to be translocated via xylem of the plant. This material is a source of transport of copper as a micronutrient. Cu-NP released is thought to be converted to Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions and Cu-CNF is considered as growth stimulant to plants.

A mixture of CuCl<sub>2</sub> and gum in aqueous solution was made alkaline and heated at 75 °C with continuous stirring. Blue copper chloride turned black after 1 h which was separated as black powder. CuO-NPs were deposited on the surface of gum karaya perhaps due to their affinity for gum. XRD analysis showed the presence of crystalline CuO-NPs scattered all over the gum matrix which is identical to those reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. FTIR spectrum showed peaks in the lower region of the spectrum corresponding to Cu-O stretching frequency. It is difficult to distinguish between Cu-O of cupric oxide and those of cuprous oxide as the NPs may be a mixture of both the CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O. Since the gum used in this work is a naturally occurring bio-polymer it contains sugars and amino acids which act as reducing as well as capping agent for CuO-NPs. Also they remain adhered to the surface of the gum matrix through electrostatic force. Abboud et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] have reported the fabrication of CuO-NPs from <italic>Bifurcaria bifurcate</italic> (brown alga) purely in aqueous medium. Formation of NPs was ascertained from a change in colour from dark blue →colourless→deep red→black. It was a slow process but on heating at 100 °C the reduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to CuO-NPs was facilitated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. UV-Vis spectrum of CuO-NPs exhibited peaks at 260 and 650 nm. The former was assigned to cuprous oxide NPs and the latter has been attributed to cupric oxide NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Terpenoids present in the algal extract are responsible for the reduction ofCu<sup>2+</sup>to CuO-NPs. However, the peak observed at 260 nm in the UV-region cannot be assigned to the presence of cuprous oxide NPs because metal oxides (owing to their colour) can absorb only in the visible region of the spectrum. The colour of the colloidal mixture is neither purely black nor reddish. It is reddish black owing to the presence of both the cuprous and cupric oxide NPs which is also supported by uneven distribution and two crystalline phases corresponding to mono-clinic cupric oxide (CuO) and cubic cuprous oxide Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. There were two types of NPs identified from TEM images. Spherical ones were in abundance along with some elongated CuO-NPs ranging between 5 and 45 nm diameters.

CuO-NPs obtained from <italic>Ruellia tuberosa</italic> aqueous extract were characterized by UV-Vis, FTIR, TEM, FE-SEM, EDAX and DLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In this experiment, the aqueous copper sulphate solution was added to the leaf extract showing a pale yellow to brownish black colour which had indicated the formation of CuO-NPs Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The absorption peak at 327 nm was confirmed by SPR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and also the formation of CuO nanorods of ~ 83.23 nm. Further, the FTIR studies have shown the characteristic peaks at 452 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, 612 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, 794 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, 893 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, 1120 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, 1652 cm<sup>− 1</sup> and 3184 cm<sup>− 1</sup> in 500–4000 cm<sup>− 1</sup> range (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

Strong bands at 1120 cm<sup>− 1</sup>exhibited the presence of C − O stretch due to alcohols and esters. The peak at 893.62 cm<sup>− 1</sup> has been assigned to C − H bending due to aromatic groups. Strong peaks at 452 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, 612 cm<sup>− 1</sup> and 794 cm<sup>− 1</sup> revealed the presence of Cu − O vibrations in the fabricated CuO-NPs. Vasantharaj et al.

They were obtained in good yield as brownish black powder and identified from a peak between 220 and 225 nm in UV-Vis spectrum. Presence of phenol, amine and proteins has been suggested on the basis of IR spectral peaks. Spherical CuO-NPs of 48 ± 4 nm appear to be in pure state as the EDX showed sharp signals only for copper and oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].

NPs were oval shaped and pure as evidenced from EDX. They were more stable than the engineered NPs. However, hydrodynamic diameter of plant mediated CuO-NPs increased from 212 ± 47 to 634 ± 40 nm, whereas the particle size of engineered NPs increased up to 1037 ± 171 nm after 72 h. This property of increasing the hydrodynamic diameter may be used to control the size of CuO-NPs in aqueous medium. Perhaps the green synthesized NPs are capped by the phytochemicals present in the leaf extract and are therefore less aggregated. It has been noted that the rate of release of copper ions from engineered CuO-NP is much faster than plant synthesized NPs for identical concentration. It has been ascribed to stability and capping of plant synthesized CuO-NPs. It can be more effective and lasting if used in crop protection against pest and microbes as it is antibacterial in nature. Copper ion release is dependent on time, concentration and temperature to some extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">CuO-NPs and dissolved copper generally accumulate over the organisms exposed to them. Effect of NPs and free copper ions on <italic>Elodea nuttallii</italic> has been studied by Regier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. CuO-NPs with large hydrodynamic size (1059 ± 88 nm) very quickly agglomerate and did not change even when irradiated with UV light. Uptake of CuO-NPs in suspension by <italic>E. nuttallii</italic> is less than the dissolved copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].

It has been argued that copper is solubilized from CuO-NPs due to acid exuded from growing shoots. However, copper ions would be available only if reduction of CuO-NPs occurs followed by its oxidation.

It is surprising that the authors have said that CuO-NPs are formed by the phytochemicals and pure NPs are obtained after heating at 400 °C. A metal complex can be formed by a metal ion only. Free metal in atomic state cannot form a complex. A chelate with phenol cannot be formed as it is a monodentate ligand and cannot form a ring. By heating copper nitrate at 400 °C, CuO-NPs cannot be obtained because oxidation of copper to CuO can occur only at 900 °C. CuO-NPs were already formed by the leaf extract, and there were no complex whatsoever. Such hypothesis is baseless. Heating at 400 °C will cause burning of any organic matter left in excess and shall leave soot or carbon as impurity.

As the Cu<sub>2</sub>O is deep red it could have been easily noticed. Distinction between Cu<sub>2</sub>O and CuO can hardly be made on the basis of Cu-O stretching frequencies as they are very closely spaced.

Biofabrication of Pd/CuO-NPs from <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic> seed extract and their application as catalyst has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The Pd/CuO-NPs were highly stable because no change was observed even when it was left for 30 days. Antioxidants like epicatechin, catechin and their derivatives in cocoa seed extract act as strong reducing as well as capping agent. Pd has face centered cubic structure mixed with CuO-NPs of about 40 nm. Agglomeration is prevented due to capping of Pd/CuO-NPs. Presence of oxygen in EDS spectrum has been ascribed to oxidation of Cu NPs to CuO-NPs. When Pd/CuO does not contain free copper ions what is the need of oxygen for oxidation of CuO-NPs. However, oxidation of metallic copper in presence of water can take several hours nevertheless it would give CuSO<sub>4</sub> with a characteristic blue colour. However, authors assumption needs verification. The mechanism proposed for the formation of metal NPs and their nucleation is not convincing.

However, higher Cu concentration reduced the number of grains/spike and overall 1000 grain weight. Copper and iron NPs together at 25 ppm concentration have better effect on production and yield of wheat than copper or iron alone. Cu-NPs increased the grain yield and stress tolerance in wheat plant through starch degradation. Sugar content and SOD activity was enhanced in seeds treated with copper and iron NPs.

Plant biomass, total chlorophyll content and root elongation invariably decreased while an increase in anthocyanin, lipid peroxidation and proline were observed. Lignin was also found to be deposited in root. CuO-NPs treated seedlings also showed an increase in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in leaves and roots which is directly proportional to its concentration. As a consequence of oxidative stress, the main root growth was inhibited but lateral root formation was initiated. This is mainly due to metabolic imbalance and as a response to resistance caused by CuO-NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>].

Green synthesized NPs of desired shape, size and stability can enhance their overall qualities for future applications. It appears that all plant species contain some type of phytochemicals which reduce the metal salts and metal oxides into their NPs. Cu and CuO-NPshave shown great promise as biocide and mild antibacterial agent. Even though, biofabrication of metal NPs from plants and microbes do not leave toxic residues in environment, their safe disposal is necessary. Further, it is also essential to utilize the fabricated Cu and CuO-NPs as biomedicine, environmental remediation and agricultural practices.
