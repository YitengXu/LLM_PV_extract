id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par13">Carbon neutrality means having net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. Current issues on climate change and global warming have been an ongoing concern for the world, environmental issues will strongly affect us if we do not start taking them seriously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In order to reduce carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, it is an urgency to develop clean and sustainable fuels from renewable energy resources such as wind and solar power, geothermal, and biomass energy to replace traditional fossil fuels. In this respect, hydrogen fuel, with high gravimetric energy density (140 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>) and only generates water as a byproduct without any environmental concern, has been hailed as the unrivaled clean energy carrier to reduce conventional fossil fuels consumption and relieve aggravating environmental problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced through steam reforming of fossil fuels under harsh conditions, which are restrained by the complex operation and emission of carbon dioxide. Electrochemical water splitting is an effective and clean method to produce high-purity hydrogen by using renewable energy, which has ignited new interests in the past decades. During the water electrolysis process, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) operates at the anode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Theoretically, it only needs the voltage of 1.23 V to drive the water electrolysers to obtain hydrogen production. However, it usually needs a much larger voltage of 1.8–2.0 V in the practical electrolysis process, due to the overpotentials on both cathode and anode. Therefore, various kinds of electrocatalysts have been developed to reduce the overpotentials for both HER and OER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Electrochemical water electrolysis can be classified into three main types based on the type of electrolytes and operating conditions: alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. AWE operates at the high concentrations of alkaline solutions and employs diaphragm (such as asbestos, polyethersulfone (PES), microporous polymer membrane, glass reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) compounds et al<italic>.</italic>) to separate the produced gases from the cathode and anode, which suffers from low operating pressure, sluggish anion transport kinetics and limited current density. SOE operates at high pressure and high temperature of 500–850°C, but is plagued by unsatisfactory catalyst durability and membrane degradation. PEM electrolysis is considered a splendid method for high-purity hydrogen production in the future industrial application, due to its high current density, greater energy efficiency, smaller gas crossover, wider operating temperatures (20–80°C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], smaller mass-volume characteristic, more importantly, the specialty of adaptive to renewable energy volatility. In the past decades, significant progress has been made in PEM electrolysis technology. For example, a high cell electrolysis efficiency of 94.4% and a very low cell voltage of 1.567 V were obtained by Marshall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to reach the current density of 1 A cm<sup>−2</sup>. A stable voltage for over 5000 h during 2 A cm<sup>−2</sup> and a peak operating current density of 20 A cm<sup>−2</sup> has been acquired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Despite the many advantages and bright prospects of PEM electrolysers, the practical industrial application of this technology is plagued by the prohibitively exorbitant cost and extreme degradation of electrocatalysts under an acidic environment, especially for OER catalysts that simultaneously experience the acidic and strongly oxidative environments. To address these problems, great research efforts have been directed towards reducing the usage of noble metals and exploiting noble-metal-free catalysts, improving the intrinsic catalytic performance and the durability of catalysts in the acidic electrolyte. To date, the materials for acidic HER are mainly Pt-based material, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and transition metal phosphides (TMPs). The most popular acidic OER electrocatalysts are focused on precious Ir and Ru-based materials, perovskites, and nonprecious metal oxides. At present, the electrocatalytic performance and stability for both HER and OER have made significant progress, stimulating the development of PEM water electrolysis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustration of (<bold>a</bold>) alkaline water electrolysis, (<bold>b</bold>) solid oxide electrolysis, and (<bold>c</bold>) proton exchange membrane water electrolysis</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43979_2022_22_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">Here, we provide recent progress of the PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production.

Then, we introduce other key materials for PEM water electrolysis, such as membrane electrode assembly (MEA), current collector, and bipolar plate. Finally, we propose the current challenges and perspectives on the development of PEM water electrolysis technology for application in future hydrogen production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Water electrolysis technologies</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE)</title><p id="Par16">AWE is a well-established technology for hydrogen production and this phenomenon was first found by Troostwijk and Diemann in 1789 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. AWE usually operates at lower temperatures between 30–90°C and uses alkaline KOH/NaOH aqueous solution with a typical concentration of 20–30% as the electrolyte. In alkaline electrolysers, the diaphragm and porous nickel-based materials are usually used as asbestos and electrode. Alkaline electrolysis is a mature process, which only needs low investment and operation costs. However, the AWE usually exhibits a low operating current density of 200–400 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> and an energy efficiency of approximately 62–82% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, the pressure between the anode and cathode sides needs to keep balanced, avoiding the hydrogen or oxygen generated by the electrolysis penetrating the diaphragm to the other side and resulting in the explosion risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Solid oxide electrolysis (SOE)</title><p id="Par17">SOE has received an enormous amount of attention because of its high efficiency and environmental friendliness, the needed electrical power could be provided by sustainable energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, SOE works at high temperatures (500–850°C) and pressure, water is in the form of steam during the SOE process. The most commonly used electrolyte material is yttria-stabilized zirconia, the conventional high-temperature oxygen-ion conductor. However, the high temperatures result in the fast deterioration of catalytic performance, and achieving the long-term operation of SOE is a challenge. Meanwhile, the produced hydrogen can form a mixture with steam and needs an additional procedure to acquire high purity hydrogen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM)</title><p id="Par18">PEM electrolysis has been known for over sixty years and was developed by General Electric, where a solid sulfonated polystyrene membrane is used as the electrolyte. This technology is also named polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis. The proton exchange membrane acts as both the gas separator and the electrolyte. In the electrolysis process, only deionized water is injected into the cell without any electrolytic additives. There are a variety of advantages of PEM electrolysis, such as high current density, greater energy efficiency, low gas permeability, wider operating temperatures (20–80°C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], easy handling and maintenance. However, the popular electrocatalysts for PEM electrolysis are precious metals (Pt, Ir, Ru), the exorbitant cost of these precious metal makes PEM electrolysis a relatively higher investment than alkaline electrolysis. In this regard, researchers have paid tremendous efforts for reducing the cost and improving the intrinsic activity of PEM electrocatalysts.

Presently, platinum (Pt) and Pt-based materials are recognized as the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the cathode side in PEM electrolysers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which exhibit decent electrochemical activity for the HER in acidic electrolytes. However, the large-scale deployment of these catalysts is constrained by the high cost and limited reserves. For this, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring various methods to reduce Pt mass loading and exploit other Pt-free electrocatalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Lim and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] prepared a Pt@N-containing carbon core–shell catalyst on carbon nanofibers (Pt@CS/CNF), which exhibited excellent catalytic activity and durability. They found that the graphitic N and pyridinic N on the carbon shell could not only offer additional catalytic active sites for HER, but also impede the active Pt core from dissolution and agglomeration, improving the stability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a-d). Zhong and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] adopted an ultralow-temperature solution method to prepare a single atom Pt anchored on carbon nanotubes (SA-Pt-CNTs), which reduced Pt usage and improved the intrinsic HER activity in acidic media, a low overpotential of only 41 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) demonstrates Pt atoms were atomically dispersed. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated the high electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the interaction between CNTs and Pt atoms, which leads to the downshift of the d-band center and facilitates the H desorption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e-g). Xu et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] rationally designed atomically dispersed Pt anchored on amorphous MoO<sub>x</sub> (Pt-SA/α-MoO<sub>x</sub>), which unfolded a low overpotential of 19 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> and excellent mass activity of 52.0 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>−1</sup> at the overpotential of 50 mV in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Additionally, it also exhibited a low Tafel slope of 123 mV dec<sup>−1</sup> and long-time durability. DFT results revealed that the remarkable performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between unsaturated Pt atoms and amorphous MoO<sub>x</sub>, which are beneficial for atomic hydrogen adsorption.

DFT calculations suggested the decent electrocatalytic activity attributed to the V and Se vacancies, which are beneficial for the phase transition from the 2H phase to the 1T phase and forming the intermediates in HER.

The major functions are electric conduction between the electrode and the bipolar plate, as well as transport of liquid/gas from the reaction site with as low as activation, thermal, ohmic, and fluidic losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. The current collector should have energetic corrosion resistance and super electrical conductivity because of the strong acidic media and strongly oxidative environments. Additionally, the pore size and structure of the current collector are important, because the produced gases in the PEM water electrolysis process should be effectively expelled and water must be reaching the catalytic sites of the electrode surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. The porous titanium plates are the most used current collectors for both sides of MEA due to their decent conductivity, excellent mechanical stability, and corrosion resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Bipolar plate</title><p id="Par39">Bipolar plate is an essential component in the PEM electrolyser stack, reducing the cost of bipolar plates is the key to controlling the cost of electrolysers. In the harsh working environment of the anode of the PEM electrolytic cell, if the bipolar plate is corroded, it will lead to the leaching of metal ions, thereby contaminating the PEM system. Therefore, the commonly used bipolar plate protection measure is to prepare a layer of anti-corrosion coating on the surface. The bipolar plates play multifunctional roles, such as separators, conduct heat and current between single cells in a stack, heat and water management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Thus, the bipolar plate must have excellent strength, high thermal conductivity, low permeability, and high shock durability. Graphite has been previously used as a bipolar plate due to its excellent electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, there are many problems including the high corrosion rates, depressed mechanical strength, and exorbitant cost. Currently, the most commonly used bipolar plates are titanium and coated stainless steel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. But there are still some challenges, such as hydrogen embrittlement, passivation, and corrosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Therefore, exploiting cost-effective and stable bipolar plates is still under challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions and prospects</title><p id="Par40">In summary, hydrogen is considered as an environmentally benign alternative to traditional fossil fuels due to its high energy density and carbon-free pollution. AWE, SOE, and PEM water electrolysis are the main electrolysis technologies for hydrogen production. PEM water electrolysis is hailed as the most desired technology for high purity hydrogen production and self-consistent with volatility of renewable energies. From the thorough overview of the recent development of acidic HER and OER electrocatalysts for water splitting, there still exist many obstacles to exploiting and studying high-efficiency electrocatalysts. These are summarized as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par41">Pt and Pt-based catalysts are still the most popular materials for acidic HER. Numerous studies have made great processes in improving the activity and stability by using nonprecious metals, but the performance still fails to meet the requirement of practical electrolysers. In order to optimize the catalytic performance, compositional modulation, downsizing, and tailoring the electronic structure are effective strategies to increase the intrinsic activity and density of catalytically active sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">OER catalyst for PEM is mainly focused on IrO<sub>2</sub> with high stability. However, the relatively low activity and the exorbitant cost severely restrain the practical applications. Compared with IrO<sub>2</sub>, although Ru-based catalysts exhibited high activity and low price, the over-oxidation in acidic electrolytes resulted in poor stability. More attention needs to be paid to optimizing the activity of IrO<sub>2</sub> and improving the stability of Ru-based catalysts.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">The catalytic processes in PEM electrolyser, especially for acidic OER, still have no well-established reaction mechanism. To discover the reaction mechanism on catalytic sites and monitor the dynamic evolution of the catalyst during the reaction process, advanced operando/in situ technologies are needed. For example, operando XAFS, Raman, XRD, and FTIR spectra, could explore the morphology, composition, and crystal structure change, as well as identification of real active sites, during the long-term electrolysis. In addition, the theoretical calculation is a critical tool to investigate the reaction pathways and unravel the catalysis mechanism.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">The remarkable catalyst for industrial application needs higher current densities while maintaining a low operating voltage. Such commercial PEM water electrolysis requires a long operation time at high current densities of 2–3 A cm<sup>−2</sup> for high energy conversion efficiency. However, such higher current densities usually need relatively high operating voltage, most catalysts are unstable during the OER process in acidic media. Much more effort should be devoted to exploring the functional links between stability and activity.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Authors' information</title><p id="Par45">Tongzhou Wang is a Ph.D. student in the group of Prof. Lifang Jiao at Nankai University, China.
