New patterns in supply and demand, compounded by changing trends in international energy development, were presenting China with opportunities to develop and drive a new energy era.</p><p id="Par3">In December 2016, the Chinese government published its Energy Production and Consumption Revolution Strategy (2016–30), which set out the specific actions needed to promote the energy revolution that President Xi had referred to. In October 2017, the report of the 19th CPC National Congress noted that:<disp-quote><p id="Par4">Socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era. China’s economy is transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development.</p><p id="Par5">China must put quality first and prioritise performance; and China should make supply-side structural reform its main task and work hard to achieve better quality, higher efficiency, and more robust drivers of economic growth.</p><p id="Par6">The new era provides a new background and poses new requirements for China to deepen its study of the energy revolution. Global practices show that all countries have undergone an energy transition in the course of their development, albeit along different paths. From the perspective of the global energy system as a whole, the current energy transition towards a greener and more sustainable energy system is significantly different from the energy transitions of the past.</p><p id="Par7">China needs to learn from other countries’ practices in promoting energy transition. It must keep up with the latest trends in global energy transitions, take account of the needs of economic, social and environmental development in China, vigorously develop energy technologies, and conduct an in-depth study on how to achieve China’s energy revolution.</p></disp-quote></p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Global Energy Transitions: Historical Experience and the Latest Trends</title><p id="Par8">The energy system is comprehensive in scope, integrating energy production, conversion, transmission, consumption and management into a single system.</p><p id="Par9">Energy transition is a long-term structural change to the energy system, where entirely new components arise or old patterns fundamentally change. The energy system is in a constant state of evolution. For example, China’s and India’s energy systems have been organised to date around low-cost energy; France’s transition to nuclear power in the 1970s was driven by the desire for security after the oil price shocks of that decade; and Germany’s energy transition in the 2010s was propelled by the desire for clean energy. Transition also occurs when new end uses require new forms of energy. For example, the development of electric vehicles changes the transport industry’s demand for oil into the need for electric power.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Energy Demand Changes with Economic Development</title><p id="Par10">Countries generally go through an energy transition as they develop. Energy demand can be divided into three broad categories (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the first category, countries with an income per person of less than $5,000 in purchase power parity (PPP) have less economic development and therefore low energy consumption. Second, countries with an income per person of between $5,000 and $15,000: as these countries industrialise, energy demand growth accelerates due to the high energy intensity of industrialisation, urbanisation and large-scale infrastructure construction. And third, countries with an income per person of more than $15,000: once these countries have industrialised, the growth rate of energy demand starts to slow down.

</p><p id="Par12">The USA and Canada are typical examples of high-income countries with high energy consumption. As Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows, the USA and Canada rapidly increased their energy consumption per person between 1960 and the late 1980s, during which time income per capita doubled. This rapid increase in energy consumption was the outcome of fast growth in energy-intensive industries and high domestic energy consumption. Energy consumption in the transport sector was high due to both countries’ low population densities. Since the late 1980s, incomes continued to grow, albeit more slowly, while energy consumption was relatively flat.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy transition paths of various countries.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> Data are from 1960 to 2015; note the log scale on the X axis. <italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics based on IEA data</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Japan and major European countries experienced a slower increase in energy consumption than the USA and Canada. These countries have reached similar levels of income per capita as the USA and Canada, but with around half the level of energy consumption per person. In addition to having more light industry and less transport demands, these economies generally focus more on energy efficiency, often driven by policy. Spain and Italy have lower energy use per person than other developed economies. This is because they are more service-oriented, with fewer energy-intensive industries and a Mediterranean climate that reduces the need for heating and cooling relative to other countries.
</p><p id="Par14">The data for Australia, South Korea and Sweden show how countries with energy-intensive industries can have higher energy consumption. These three countries form a cluster between the USA and Canada, which have high energy consumption, and Japan and major European countries, which have lower energy consumption, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. This is because although Australia, South Korea and Sweden have large energy-intensive industries, they are more energy efficient than the USA and Canada. Australia has built an energy-intensive industrial system on its extensive natural resources, primarily non-ferrous metals, iron and steel, mining and chemicals. It also has a high transport energy use per person due to its low population density and large size. South Korea is an example of a country that has increased GDP per capita through high-value industrialisation, despite not having domestic energy resources. Sweden is somewhat unique as its energy use is increased by a large pulp and paper industry, which is very energy intensive, and a very high level of energy use in buildings for heating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous Global Transitions in Energy Supply</title><p id="Par15">The global energy system undergoes transitions. There have been three global energy transitions since 1800 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The first was the rise of coal to fuel the Industrial Revolution; the second was the use of oil for mass transport; and the third was the rise of gas, hydropower and nuclear power in electrification. In recent years, a fourth energy transition has begun with the use of renewables to provide clean and sustainable energy.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>There have been four global transitions in energy supply since 1800.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics based on data in energy transitions: Global and National Perspectives by Vaclav Smil (2017)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">History shows that rising societal demand for energy and advances in technology can lead to global energy transitions. For example, energy supply shifted from traditional biofuels to coal in the 19th century to fuel industrialisation in the UK and other countries in Europe. After the oil price shocks in the 1970s, many countries needed to secure energy supply, stimulating the transition from oil to gas and nuclear power in electricity. Since the beginning of this century, demand for clean energy is also driving an energy transition. Transitions also occur when significant improvements are made in energy technologies or when new energy carriers offer the flexibility of providing a range of increasingly sophisticated services and end uses, as electricity does for buildings and industry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Energy Technologies are Undergoing Significant Change</title><p id="Par17">New energy and information technologies are developing rapidly and having a significant impact on energy production and consumption.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>The Cost of Clean Energy Technologies is Declining Rapidly</title><p id="Par18">Since the early 2010s, the cost of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar have fallen by more than half. Lithium-ion batteries, which have the potential for use in the transport and power sectors, have also seen similar cost reductions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The cost of many clean energy technologies is declining rapidly.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> Cost does not include subsidies. *The calculated cost of solar energy is based on utility-scale monocrystalline silicon solar panels. <italic>Source</italic> The cost data of wind and solar energy are from Lazard (2016), while the **cost data of batteries are from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (2017)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>New Information and Communications Technologies (Digitalisation) are Increasingly Being Used in the Energy System, with Several Important Implications</title><p id="Par19">To begin with, digitalisation increases the demand-response potential for electricity. According to International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts, digitalisation could increase global electricity demand-response potential from 3,900 terrawatt-hours (TWh) in 2015 to 6,900 TWh in 2040, up 77%. This level of demand-response can free up some 185 GW of generating capacity and reduce the need for investment in new generation, transmission and distribution on a cumulative basis by $270 billion (calculated in 2016 $).</p><p id="Par20">Second, digitalisation has improved the flexibility of the power system to integrate renewable energy. For example, the IEA estimates that digitalisation and demand-side response technologies can limit total wind and solar power curtailment to less than 1.6%. By 2040, total wind and solar curtailment will be 79% lower than in 2015. This will enable the global power system to accommodate 67 TWh of new renewable energy annually by around 2040 and avoid about 30 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year.</p><p id="Par21">Third, digitalisation can help improve electrification in the transport sector. Smart charging of electric vehicles can greatly reduce the demand for power generation. With the added flexibility that smart charging provides to power grids, investment in grids can be reduced by $100 to $280 billion by 2040 (in 2016 $).</p><p id="Par22">Fourth, digitalisation may affect the energy use and consumption patterns of manufacturing. Industry 4.0—the trend towards greater use of automation and data exchange—will have a significant impact on energy demand. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the adoption of 3D printing in US commercial aircraft manufacturing can reduce energy use in production and in flight, thanks to the use of more lightweight components.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Industry 4.0 will have a significant impact on energy demand.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> The data above are based solely on the adoption of 3D printing in US commercial aircraft manufacturing. <italic>Source</italic> Huang et al.

Before 1985, the energy systems of the G7 countries experienced significant changes as a result of oil price fluctuations, the discovery of new oil and gas reserves, the emergence of new energy carrier networks and the development of new technologies like nuclear power. However, the global energy system has been relatively stable over the past 30 years, with little change in the energy mix of the G7 countries (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Over the next 30 years, digitalisation, new technologies, decarbonisation, more stringent environmental requirements and new forms of economic activity are expected to transform the energy system.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Changes in the energy systems of G7 countries.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> Information on the energy mix change metric can be found in Special report 3 on the technology revolution. <italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Clean and Low-Carbon Energy are Driving the New Global Energy Transition</title><p id="Par24">The unprecedented attention paid by countries to climate change and environmental protection, along with increasing consumer demand for cleaner energy services, is driving the global transition to clean and low-carbon energy.</p><p id="Par25">Compared with previous drivers of energy transition, climate change is a global concern, the solution to which requires the engagement of all countries. Both energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are now declining. There is a sign that energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been decoupling from economic growth increasingly rapidly since 2010. The Paris Agreement of 2015 shows that the world is paying more attention to climate change and strengthening its efforts to disconnect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from economic growth. In this respect, the European Union is in a leading position, with GDP increasing by 50% between 1990 and 2015 and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions dropping by more than 20% over the same period. The USA and Japan have also remained generally stable in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), but the USA’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and President Trump’s new energy policies bring some uncertainties.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are declining globally.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> GDP data are calculated in 2010 $; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions refer only to energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. <italic>Source</italic> IEA (2017) and World Bank (2017)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Significantly More Electrification Characterises the New Global Energy Transition</title><p id="Par26">To achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, more electrification is required to decarbonise the global economy. This process is accelerating in the major economies, especially in transport.

Electric vehicles remain an important area of growth, despite their current small market share (except in some Nordic countries).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrification in the transport sector is accelerating.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> BEV = battery electric vehicles; PHEV = plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. <italic>Source</italic> IEA, Global EV Outlook (2017)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">Economic restructuring is also driving electrification. As developing countries like China move towards a service-oriented economy, and consumers are keen to get cleaner and more flexible types of energy, such as gas and electricity, electrification continues to increase. During the current energy transition, this trend has become more and more obvious—emerging economies such as China and Brazil have achieved higher levels of electrification at a lower level of per capita income—and is expected to continue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrification increases with income.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> Data for all countries except China are from 1960–2015; data for China are from 1971–2015. <italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics, based on IEA data</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Policy Plays a More Important Role in This Energy Transition</title><p id="Par28">While policy has been a key driver of previous energy transitions, the scope of the policy challenge this time is vast. This is because the goal of the new transition is to promote the development of clean and renewable energy. To level the playing field, the negative environmental effects of fossil fuels, such as air pollution and carbon emissions, compared to the positive environmental effects of clean energy, must be reflected in economic decisions. Policy interventions are needed to rectify the economic distortions caused by such market failures. In addition, the introductory and growth periods of new energy need support policies. Due to the complexity of the energy system, the energy transition must use market forces to promote innovation and find effective and flexible ways to deliver desired goals. Many governments have realised this and are taking measures to ensure market failures are corrected. Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the countries that have implemented, are about to implement, or are considering implementing carbon pricing (in the form of a carbon tax or emissions trading system).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Carbon pricing is accelerating globally.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> World Bank, State and Trends of Carbon Pricing (2017)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Developing and Emerging Economies Can Leapfrog Ahead</title><p id="Par29">International experience shows that while there is a general route for countries to follow in energy transition as they develop, the path that a country takes can vary significantly, depending on its economic structure, improvements in energy efficiency, consumption patterns, population density and climate, among other things.</p><p id="Par30">Countries such as China, Brazil and Malaysia are at a crossroads. Their path to energy transition may diverge from international experience. These countries need to choose between the energy development paths available to them: whether to have a level of energy consumption per person similar to that of the USA (high), South Korea (medium) or Spain (low) as income per capita increases. Alternatively, they can use policy to leapfrog historical patterns of energy system development to achieve high income per capita and lower and cleaner energy consumption.</p><p id="Par31">By leveraging advanced technologies and learning from, then adapting, the policies and institutional frameworks of other countries, developing and emerging economies can achieve lower energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per capita earlier than high-income countries (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Developing and emerging economies have the potential to provide advanced energy services without the negative environmental impact that advanced economies have had, and they can exploit their late-mover advantage in the growing global market for energy services.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Low- and middle-income countries can leapfrog the historical patterns of energy consumption of high-income countries.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> PPP = purchasing power parity. <italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics, based on World Bank and WRI data</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>From Quantity to Quality: The Goal and Approach of China’s Energy Revolution</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>The Goal of China’s Energy Revolution</title><p id="Par32">In 2015, China’s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–20) proposed to empower low-carbon cyclic development by promoting an energy revolution, accelerating energy technology innovation, and setting up a clean, low-carbon, secure and efficient energy system. In 2017, the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China noted that China’s economy has moved from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-quality development. China, it said, must focus on improving the supply system and strengthening the economy in terms of quality. Quality energy is an important part of the supply system and a key objective of the energy revolution.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>What is a High-Quality Energy System?</title><p id="Par33">Based on the 13th Five-Year Plan, the report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC and development strategies such as Made in China 2025 state that China’s high-quality energy system should feature the following three characteristics:</p><p id="Par34">First, it should be clean and low carbon. A clean energy system is one in which the entire energy life cycle—from production and conversion to transmission and consumption—achieves the lowest possible levels of pollution and emissions. Low carbon is a key part of this. CO<sub>2</sub> itself is not a polluting gas, but it has significant impacts on the environment. Moreover, the Chinese government has made a solemn commitment to the international community, as part of its nationally determined contributions, to reduce global carbon emissions. The energy system is the largest carbon emitter, so low carbon is undoubtedly an important characteristic of a high-quality energy system.</p><p id="Par35">Second, it should be efficiently priced and affordable. Affordability means that the price of energy should be competitive internationally to allow manufacturing to compete with global manufacturing powers like the USA, Japan and Germany. China is now in an important period of making itself a manufacturing power. Energy cost is a key element of the real economic cost, so a high-quality energy system should be able to supply energy at a competitive price. Efficiency means that existing technologies should be leveraged in energy production, conversion, transmission and consumption to save energy and improve efficiency.</p><p id="Par36">Third, it should be secure and reliable. Secure means that energy sources are diverse and that they ensure a stable supply for economic development, even during natural disasters or times of geopolitical change. Reliable means that as the amount of renewable energy increases, the energy system has the flexibility to adapt and maintain a sustainable and stable energy supply for the national economy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Three Characteristics of the Energy Revolution</title><p id="Par37"><bold>(1) Clean and low carbon</bold></p><p id="Par38">According to research by the Institute of Resources and Environmental Policy of the Development Research Center of the State Council, total emissions of major air pollutants in China are likely to peak during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–20), after which the country’s energy system will be much cleaner. Total inhalable particulate matter (PM10) emissions have been declining since the 1990s. Sulphur dioxide emissions reached their highest point in 2006, and have since declined steadily. Nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions dropped for the first time (in 2012) since reliable databases were established and are expected to flatten, then fall. The research initially concludes, therefore, that air pollutant emissions have reached a turning point. Combined emissions of major water pollutants are estimated to peak in 2016–20, then flatten, flowed by a gradual decline.</p><p id="Par39">In terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, more effort is needed to achieve a turning point by 2030. According to the Energy Production and Consumption Revolution Strategy (2016–30), by 2020, China’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP will decrease by 18% compared to 2015, and by 2030 they will drop by 60–65% compared to 2005. The findings of this report show that to achieve the goal of carbon intensity reduction, additional policies and measures—including carbon pricing and subsidies for non-fossil energy sources—need to be gradually introduced to achieve tangible results.</p><p id="Par40">In terms of the energy mix, the share of clean energy should increase significantly. According to the Energy Production and Consumption Revolution Strategy (2016–30), the share of non-fossil energy in China will be 15% by 2020, increasing to about 20% by 2030. In the Recommended scenario of this report, in which the energy revolution is strongly promoted, the share of non-fossil energy is expected to reach 15.7% by 2020, 22.5% by 2030, and more than 40% by 2050.</p><p id="Par41"><bold>(2) Affordable and efficient</bold></p><p id="Par42">According to the above-mentioned strategy, energy consumption per unit of GDP is expected to drop by 15% by 2020 (compared to 2015), reach the current world average by 2030 (based on current prices), and achieve stability by 2050.</p><p id="Par43">In the Recommended scenario of this report, energy consumption per unit of GDP will be 19.7% lower in 2020 than in 2015. This exceeds the 15% reduction target of the Energy Production and Consumption Revolution Strategy (2016–30). Energy intensity in 2030 will be 35.1% lower than in 2020, and 54.1% lower in 2050 than in 2030 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution pathways of China’s energy consumption per unit of GDP in two scenarios.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Findings of the DRC research team</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">Energy cost per unit of GDP, which reflects the quantity and price of energy consumed to produce a unit of GDP, needs to be reduced significantly. Energy consumption per unit of GDP is an indicator of energy consumption efficiency but does not take price into consideration. In fact, energy price has an obvious impact on economic and social development. On the one hand, the price of energy can incentivise the whole economy and society to save energy. On the other hand, it constitutes a major cost to the real economy. To sharpen China’s international competitive edge, energy cost per unit of GDP should be significantly lower.</p><p id="Par45">Historical statistics show that China’s energy cost per unit of GDP has followed an inverse U-shape path. It increased rapidly from 0.1 in 1990 to 0.18 in 2005, up by 80%. It then peaked around 2005 and decreased to 0.12 in 2012.</p><p id="Par46">The current energy cost per unit of GDP in China is comparable to that of South Korea, but notably higher than the USA and Japan. South Korea’s energy cost per unit of GDP in 2011 was 0.18, slightly higher than China’s. But the figure in Japan is only 0.09 and 0.08 in the USA, about 66% lower than in China.

Externally, China should seize the opportunities of economic globalisation and diversify its international energy supply sources, by increasing imports of oil and gas from regions other than the Middle East to spread risk and secure supply.</p><p id="Par49">The reliability of the energy system should be improved.

Analysis of energy transitions in G20 countries since the 1970s shows that the drivers of energy transition include four pillars and international cooperation. Often several drivers must be in place before transition can develop momentum. Individually, these drivers are insufficient to start the process of systemic change. The G20 energy transitions were driven mainly by economic growth, energy security concerns, new market incentives or price shocks, with new technology playing a supporting role. They occurred primarily in the upstream and midstream sectors, with the energy mix remaining relatively constant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>).<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The drivers behind energy revolution: four pillars and international cooperation.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par56"><bold>Supply</bold></p><p id="Par57">Historically, the abundance or scarcity of local energy resources is a fundamental driver of transition. The greatest transitions occur at the extremes, either when resources are plentiful or extremely scarce. In the current transition, technology is making unconventional and renewable energy resources increasingly available and competitive, and doing so in geographies that do not have access to conventional resources.</p><p id="Par58"><bold>Demand</bold></p><p id="Par59">Rapid economic growth is usually accompanied by a change in industrial structure, often to higher added-value economic activities that favour a new energy mix based on natural gas and renewable electricity. Furthermore, consumers tend to choose cleaner and more flexible fuels as their income rises. This is a major trigger of energy transition, especially when accompanied by new low-cost supplies of energy. Energy security is also an important driver. For example, the oil crisis of the 1970s and the shutting down of Japan’s fleet of nuclear power plants following the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear accident in 2011 increased people’s awareness of the need for energy security, resulting in significant energy transition events.</p><p id="Par60"><bold>Technology</bold></p><p id="Par61">Many energy technologies like nuclear power require vast investment in research and development. Once deployed, such technologies can transform the energy system through scale effects. International experience shows that government deployment of capital-intensive technologies is a common way to deliver energy system requirements such as supply security. Technologies that can plug and play into existing networks tend to be more successful than those requiring new networks to be built, thereby contributing more to the energy transition.</p><p id="Par62"><bold>Markets</bold></p><p id="Par63">Markets have an important role to play. They can accelerate the process of innovation and adoption of new technologies through liberalisation and reform. Governments also have an important role to play. They can ensure markets operate efficiently through pricing externalities and regulatory oversight. Policies and institutions that increase the efficiency of markets like market liberalisation and reform can help the energy transition progress faster.</p><p id="Par64"><bold>International cooperation</bold></p><p id="Par65">An increase in a country’s participation in global energy trade can also trigger an energy revolution. For example, new gas pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure could increase trade in natural gas. New technologies and infrastructure can deepen international cooperation and have a transformational impact on future development. For example, extra high voltage power transmission enables long-distance power trade between countries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Accelerating the Energy Transition Requires Four Intensifiers</title><p id="Par66">Once the drivers for transition are in place, positive feedback loops (intensifiers) can accelerate transition or increase its scale. Our review of historical transitions concludes that while the four pillars and one cooperation can provide the necessary conditions for a transition and the momentum for change, these drivers only cause real transition when reinforced by positive feedback (intensifiers). Policymakers can often directly influence these intensifiers and should use them to control the speed and scale of transition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>).<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The four intensifiers for transition act together.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO15"/></fig></p><p id="Par67"><bold>Preferences cause society to act</bold></p><p id="Par68">Transition can be accelerated and intensified if people’s preferences are influenced by the belief that energy transition is good. The reason is simple: when some people think something is good or bad, they can influence or persuade others, which can cause their preferences to spread. This creates a positive feedback loop, which makes the next action easier. Value preferences about what society should or should not be doing have been powerful forces in past energy transitions. For example, Japan and France’s embrace of nuclear power was a signifier of a technologically advanced society, whereas Germany’s anti-nuclear movement saw the same technology as an environmental threat.</p><p id="Par69"><bold>Expectations cause consumers to act</bold></p><p id="Par70">Expectations are also an intensifier: as more and more people expect transition to happen, they will act as if it is already happening. As with preferences, when people expect the world to change they will act accordingly and convince others that it will change. This creates a positive feedback loop. An expectation describes what is likely to happen, while a preference is a view about what ought to happen. For example, a person can expect something to happen even if he or she has no preference for it. Consumer expectations were important in past energy transitions, as it is consumers who select and purchase the products they expect to serve them best in the future. For example, consumers in the present transition may purchase an electric vehicle in expectation of future climate policies and legislation.</p><p id="Par71"><bold>Private economics cause businesses to act</bold></p><p id="Par72">Energy transition may improve the private economics of businesses through positive spillover effects, which encourage further action. Businesses will act if it creates value for them, or if the benefits from energy transition are greater than the cost. When businesses take action this can change the private value of future action via externalities, positive spillovers or complementary goods. For example, the cost of wind power decreased as deployment increased due to the positive spillover of learning effects. Because action now increases the net private value of future action, this encourages future action, which then further increases the net private value of future action, creating a positive feedback loop.</p><p id="Par73"><bold>Public good causes government to act</bold></p><p id="Par74">Government tends to act if the economics or the politics of the transition improve.</p><p id="Par75">If energy transition generates value for society, it will win the public’s backing, and in turn it can generate national political support or directly drive policy action. International political support can also modify national political support. For example, the Paris Agreement and the International Energy Agency have affected national political support for climate action and energy security respectively.</p><p id="Par76">During energy transition, there is a strong positive feedback loop between private economics and the public good. As Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref> shows, private economics and the public good are closely interrelated. If private actions by businesses can have positive externalities, such as reducing carbon emissions, or negative externalities, such as pollution, then government action will increase net private value, thereby creating an additional feedback loop between public and private action in a virtuous and reinforcing cycle.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Private economics and the public good have strong positive feedback loops between them.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Vivid Economics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig16_HTML.png" id="MO16"/></fig></p><p id="Par77">The four intensifiers of the transition come together to accelerate and scale change. As Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref> shows, social preferences, consumer expectations, the private economics of businesses and the public good all contain positive feedback loops that can intensify the motivation to act. Furthermore, these all work together so that if, for example, social preferences are causing people to act in a way (such as demanding low-carbon energy and related products and services) that makes a particular investment more valuable, then businesses will act. This, in turn, may create political conditions and support for government actions intended to promote energy transition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Policy Plays a Crucial Role in Effectively Leveraging the Drivers and Intensifiers of Energy Transition</title><p id="Par78">Compared with previous transitions, the current energy transition is more complex and has stronger externalities. For example, in the current transition the increasing complexity of a diverse and decentralised power sector requires system-wide change to drive down the cost of renewables and integrate them effectively into the power grid. The need for change affects the entire power value chain—flexible low-carbon generation, dispatch, balancing and ancillary services, transmission and distribution networks, and consumer participation in retail markets through mechanisms such as demand-response to prices—and the incentives to support a more flexible and complex system.</p><p id="Par79">In this case, policy plays a crucial role in supporting the drivers of transition. For example, policies help shift energy demand to cleaner and more efficient end uses, support a cleaner energy mix, develop efficient market mechanisms, stimulate innovation in clean and efficient technologies, and support national energy transition by leveraging international energy cooperation and governance.</p><p id="Par80">Policies accelerate transition by giving the intensifiers momentum. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>, given the policy-directed nature of the current transition, government must take action to address environmental market failures, encourage change in consumer behaviour (and in broader society) and prompt businesses to invest in new low-carbon technologies. For example, subsidies or other policy tools could be offered to improve businesses’ risk-return structure.<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Policy plays a crucial role in driving energy transition.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Shell International</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig17_HTML.png" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par81">In short, policy plays a crucial role in energy transition. Perhaps a more important role for policy than giving the intensifiers momentum is keeping the rate and scale of change in social preferences, consumer expectations, private economics and the public good in sync as energy transition happens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Adopt Multiple Measures: A Roadmap for China’s Energy Revolution</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Continuously Improve Energy Consumption Efficiency by Saving First</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Optimise China’s Industrial Structure by Reducing the Proportion of Energy-Intensive Industries</title><p id="Par82">As China’s economic development enters the later stages of industrialisation, there is a drive to upgrade the country’s industrial structure, which, together with guiding policies, may lead to cleaner and more environmentally friendly industries.</p><p id="Par83">It can be seen from the demand structure of investment, consumption and export that the share of investment in economic growth gradually declines as the share of consumption steadily grows. In this way, China is undergoing a shift from production-driven to consumption-driven economic growth, leading to accelerated industrial restructuring.</p><p id="Par84">Moreover, there is great potential for adjusting the energy consumption mix.</p><p id="Par85">First, with mechanisation at saturation point, agricultural modernisation will shift focus to biotechnology and digitalisation, which is expected to further reduce the energy consumption per unit of added value (Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>).<fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Forecast of China’s end-use energy consumption in agriculture.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Findings of the DRC research team</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p id="Par86">Second, optimisation of the country’s industrial structure and changes to production processes will significantly improve the efficiency of industrial energy consumption. Starting with the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–20), the amount of energy-intensive products—such as steel, cement, glass, aluminium and synthetic ammonia—has begun to peak and may drop.</p><p id="Par87">Third, energy consumption in buildings is expected to grow steadily. Based on the experience of developed countries, China’s urban residential floor space per person is likely to peak at about 40 square metres and public floor space per person at about 20 square metres. Estimates based on future population trends show that the floor space peak in China should remain at about 90 billion square metres.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> To ensure steady and sustainable development of the real estate industry, the peak should occur around 2040. However, with the development of energy-efficient buildings, energy consumption per unit of building area will be significantly reduced, even though the total energy consumption of buildings in China is expected to increase steadily.</p><p id="Par89">Fourth, energy consumption in the service sector is expected to continue to grow as it scales up, but will be constrained by the total stock of commercial floor space. Based on forecasts of added value in the service sector and commercial floor area, end-use energy consumption will increase to 350 Mt of coal equivalent (Mtce) by 2035 and 470 Mtce by 2050.</p><p id="Par90">Fifth, residential end-use energy consumption will continue to grow, but could remain significantly lower than that in developed countries. With people’s living standards improving, household energy consumption is expected to reach 520 Mtce by 2035 and 660 Mtce by 2050.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Use New Technologies, Processes and Products to Save Energy</title><p id="Par91">Efforts should be made to promote the development of green and low-carbon buildings. In China, energy consumption in buildings accounts for nearly half of the country’s total energy consumption, far higher than that of developed economies.</p><p id="Par92">Government ministries and agencies introduced a series of plans, including the 12th Five-Year Plan for Developing Green Buildings and Eco-Cities (2012–17). However, further improvements in green building systems and standards and increased R&amp;D of green building technologies and life cycle management of green buildings are required. Technology innovation in green buildings is currently focused on lighting and heating. Energy-efficient lighting is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings in almost all countries. The Roadmap for the Phase-out of Incandescent Lamps in China, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), banned the import and sale of incandescent lamps of 15 W or more from October 2016. If all existing incandescent lamps are replaced with energy-efficient lamps, 48,000 GWh of power would be saved annually, equivalent to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 48 Mt. It is estimated that China’s cumulative newly built urban residential areas will exceed 5 billion square metres by 2020, and that the newly added energy consumption from heating in north China (the coldest part of the country) will be about 125 Mtce. If heating from renewable sources is deployed in all these new residential areas, the resulting reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would be 375 Mt.</p><p id="Par93">Centralised coal-fired power generation and coal-fired combined heat and power (CHP) should be increased to save energy and reduce emissions. Currently, centralised coal-fired power generation at large power plants accounts for only 48% of total coal consumption in China, compared to 99% in the USA. The extremely large number of distributed, small-scale coal-fired facilities in China, which do not have the capability to treat pollutants, offers great potential for energy saving and emissions reduction. China needs to take several measures to significantly shift coal use from small-scale to large-scale centralised generation. This will reduce pollutant emissions from coal combustion and improve the heat to electricity conversion efficiency of coal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Introduce Carbon Pricing to Improve Energy Consumption Efficiency</title><p id="Par94">Carbon pricing can have a significant energy saving effect as it increases the cost of fossil fuels and causes a shift in the energy mix towards lower-carbon fuels. The increase in the price of energy will also drive energy efficiency and reduce total energy consumption—as the carbon price goes up, total energy consumption will decrease. In the policy scenarios of $30 per tonne CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e), $60/tCO<sub>2</sub>e and $90/tCO<sub>2</sub>e, total energy consumption will be 7.4%, 14.0% and 19.4% lower respectively than in the zero-carbon-tax scenario. Furthermore, the effects of carbon pricing policy will become significant over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Enable Cleaner Energy Consumption by Using Less Scattered Coal and by Increasing Electrification</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Substitute Electricity and Gas for Scattered Coal</title><p id="Par95">In 2015, China’s scattered coal consumption reached 617 million tonnes (Mt), mainly used in coal mining (120 Mt), household heating (93 Mt) and chemical production (90 Mt). A further 260 Mt of scattered coal was used by light industries—food, textiles, equipment manufacturing and services.</p><p id="Par96">To replace scattered coal in residential heating, China will encourage central heating (gas-fired boilers, geothermal heating and waste heat recovery) and increasingly substitute electricity and gas for scattered coal (such as wall-mounted gas-fired heaters) in areas where central heating is not possible. The measures for substituting electricity and gas for scattered coal in the industrial and commercial sectors include replacing small coal-fired boilers with gas-fired boilers or installing waste heat recovery or other intensive heating methods.

From the progress of ongoing pilot programmes, the following challenges were observed.</p><p id="Par190">First, the failure to achieve market-based electricity pricing is preventing the carbon trading market from working effectively. China hasn’t yet established a new mechanism that enables the market to determine electricity prices. Electricity price control limits the power sector’s potential to tap low-cost emissions reduction.</p><p id="Par191">Second, current regulations on carbon emissions are not sufficiently advanced to support the creation of an effective carbon trading market, as there are no uniform standards yet on assessment and approval, trading and settlement, and their effective supervision is not possible.</p><p id="Par192">Third, the regional carbon trading mechanisms are immature. Domestic products are isolated from the international carbon trading market. It is still under discussion whether China’s future national carbon trading market should choose centralised trading at a single exchange or decentralised trading at several exchanges.</p><p id="Par193">Fourth, the liquidity of the carbon trading market needs further improvement. Pilot carbon trading markets experience the same problem of poor liquidity, with both low volume and low turnover.</p><p id="Par194">To overcome these challenges, efforts need to be made to:</p><sec id="Sec57"><title>Improve the System of Laws and Regulations to Increase Regulatory Capacity</title><p id="Par195">Relevant legislative procedures should be strictly implemented and the legal system for carbon trading improved. In particular, the system design for the national carbon trading market should be based on experience from pilot schemes. The rights and obligations of carbon emission allowance trading participants, trading methods and rules, dispute resolution mechanisms, type and extent of penalties for violations, and legal authorisation from jurisdictions should be clarified—based on the Measures for the Administration of National Carbon Emission Trading issued by the NDRC.</p><p id="Par196">Moreover, a regulatory mechanism for a carbon emission allowance trading market should be established and a dedicated regulatory authority set up to supervise market operations and participants. The building of a comprehensive risk control system for the carbon trading market should be explored to prevent illegal operations and maintain a well-functioning carbon trading market. A legal supervisory system covering various parties—including the government, service providers, trading platforms and businesses—should be developed. While fulfilling its regulatory role, the government should avoid controlling and commanding the market directly. Rather, it should focus on macro-policy planning and supervision and leave the market to play its intended leading role.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec58"><title>Coordinating the Cap and Quota Structure Correctly</title><p id="Par198">The initial allocation of carbon trading quotas is a core function of a carbon trading market. The regional quota cap should be determined by a combination of factors, including greenhouse gas emissions, economic growth, industrial structure, energy structure, and inclusion of the businesses that fall within the emissions trading scheme. Some quotas should be reserved for auction, held in reserve to regulate the market if needed, and for major projects.</p><p id="Par199">First, the cap should take into account economic growth, technological progress and emissions reduction targets, and follow the principles of “rigid cap, flexible structure, tight stock and optimal increment” in the functioning and evolution of the carbon trading market. Given economic volatility and the uncertainty of technological progress, an adjustment mechanism should be designed to deal with these uncertainties.</p><p id="Par200">Second, industries vary in their emissions reduction costs, emissions reduction potential, competitiveness and carbon leakage effects, which should be taken into account when designing industry-specific emissions control coefficients.</p><p id="Par201">Third, the design of a 3–5-year trading cycle, early determination of cap and adjustment measures, and a quota-relevant reserve system, are necessary to meet long-term market expectations and businesses’ inter-temporal quota management needs and hence reduce compliance costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec59"><title>Establish a Unified Trading Platform and Pricing Mechanism</title><p id="Par202">A unified carbon trading platform should include regulatory, trading and support systems. Given the inconsistencies in trading rules, trading procedures and price control in different carbon trading markets, it is necessary to improve the pricing mechanism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>).<fig id="Fig23"><label>Fig. 23</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>China’s carbon trading market system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/465788_1_En_1_Fig23_HTML.png" id="MO23"/></fig></p><p id="Par203">Auctioning initial carbon emission rights enables the fair and effective allocation of those rights.

As the initial carbon pricing level increases, total energy consumption will decrease. The effects of carbon pricing policies will be evident in the short term and become significant over time.</p><p id="Par219">In contrast to carbon pricing policies, the introduction of renewable energy subsidies will increase total energy consumption. Subsidy policies will have a less significant impact on total energy consumption than carbon pricing policies. In the scenario that incorporates both carbon pricing and renewable energy subsidies, total energy consumption will be higher than in the pure carbon tax scenario but lower than in the subsidy policy scenario.</p><p id="Par220">The scenarios reveal an important insight. If governments are concerned that the introduction of carbon pricing will have a significant negative impact on energy consumption, they can introduce non-fossil energy subsidy policies at the same time. This will increase non-fossil energy consumption and reduce fossil energy use, thereby ensuring a smooth transition in the overall level and patterns of energy consumption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig24" ref-type="fig">24</xref>).<fig id="Fig24"><label>Fig. 24</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Influence of carbon pricing and non-fossil energy subsidies on total energy consumption and the energy mix.</p><p><italic>Note</italic> BAU represents a carbon- and subsidy-free baseline scenario.

Non-fossil energy subsidies will have a greater impact on energy mix adjustment than carbon pricing. This may be due to the slower reduction in cost of non-fossil energy technologies in the absence of policy support. Even though carbon pricing policies reduce fossil energy consumption, if non-fossil energy subsidies are not introduced the widespread use of non-fossil energy would be difficult to achieve and the adjustment of the energy mix would be slow.</p><p id="Par222">In the combined policy scenario, fossil energy consumption can be reduced and subsidy support given to non-fossil energy. Under the joint action of the two policy types, the effects of energy mix adjustments can be very significant. Model analysis results show that by combining carbon pricing at $30/tCO<sub>2</sub>e with subsidies of 30%, the proportion of non-fossil energy in the energy mix can be increased to 50% by 2050. This indicates that a combined policy mechanism is both effective and necessary to promote future energy transformation and an energy revolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec68"><title>Build a New System for Oil and Gas Management and Operation</title><p id="Par223">In line with the overall requirements of Several Opinions on Deepening Oil and Gas Sector Reform published by the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council, China will promote market-oriented reform throughout the entire oil and gas value chain.

China should be more aware that the international energy market can ensure energy security under normal conditions and support efficient and competitive global markets.</p><p id="Par278">There is global consensus that the international energy market can ensure energy security under normal conditions. Dependence on imported energy (mainly oil and gas) no longer means weak energy security. In the future of globalisation, thanks to mutual opening up, the global energy transition and China’s energy revolution, the effects of an energy shortage may not be as critical as before and energy commodities procured from the international market may be cheaper than those produced in China.</p><p id="Par279">Win-win energy development can be achieved by identifying areas for international cooperation, learning from international energy development experience, applying advanced technologies, and using foreign investment to make the domestic energy market more competitive. China’s further integration into the global energy market will contribute to the energy security of the whole world, not only to China and East Asia.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par88">China’s floor space stock in 2015 was close to 60 billion square metres, including 17.6 billion square metres of urban residential floor space, 27.6 billion square metres of rural residential floor space, and 14.0 billion square metres of urban commercial floor space.</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par110">Research on China's Gas Development Strategies, published by China Development Press in 2016 and by Springer in 2017, forecasts China’s gas output to reach 270 bcm in 2020 and 470 bcm in 2030.</p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p id="Par125">Gao Shiji and Guo Jiaofeng et al., Energy Internet Boosts Energy Transformation and Institutional Innovation in China, China Development Press, 2017.</p></fn><fn id="Fn4"><label>4</label><p id="Par136">NDRC and NEA, Action Plan for Innovation in the Energy Technology Revolution (2016–30), 2016, p.6.</p></fn><fn id="Fn5"><label>5</label><p id="Par137">NDRC and NEA, Roadmap for Major Innovation Actions in the Energy Technology Revolution, 2016, pp.67–69.</p></fn><fn id="Fn6"><label>6</label><p id="Par197">Liu Huiping, Song Yan, Challenges for Launching the National Carbon Emission Rights Trading Market and Solutions, in Economic Review, 2017, (01):pp.40–45.</p></fn></fn-group></back></book-part></book-part-wrapper></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Earth Sciences</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Economic Geology</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy Policy, Economics and Management</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environmental Science and Engineering</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Fossil Fuels (incl.
