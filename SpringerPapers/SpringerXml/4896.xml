Since the first demonstration of solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in 2012 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, of which the liquid electrolyte of perovskite-sensitized mesoporous(mp)-structure-based electrochemical cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> was successfully replaced to the solid hole-transporting-material (HTM), the unceasing optimization of each layer of PSC so far has led their power conversion efficiency (PCE) to surpass 22% now<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although those mp-structured architectures have taken a leading role in raising their efficiency, the necessity for the laborious high-temperature annealing process to prepare an efficient mp-structure has aroused intensive researches for the alternative architectures without the mp-structure, so-called planar configurations having simple and low-temperature processibility feasible to the low-cost flexible PSCs.</p><p id="Par4">The planar configuration PSC devices can be constructed to be either an <italic>n−i−p</italic> type or <italic>p−i−n</italic> type, in which a perovskite photoactive layer is directly formed on flat electron-transporting interlayer (ETL) or hole-transporting interlayer (HTL), respectively, prepared on a transparent conducting oxide electrode. Among those, <italic>n−i−p-</italic>type planar configuration PSCs, which utilize TiO<sub>2</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, or ZnO as an ETL, often exhibit hysteretic behaviors showing different current density−voltage (<italic>J</italic>−<italic>V</italic>) characteristics depending on the scan rate and direction, which are believed to be related to various factors such as trap states, unbalanced charge transport, and the charge accumulation induced by ion migration in the perovskite layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. On the contrary, it was shown that those hysteretic behaviors could be mitigated by casting fullerene or its derivative on top of the perovskite layer as an ETL of <italic>p−i−n</italic> planar PSCs, because fullerene and its derivative could passivate defect sites and grain boundaries of perovskite layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Since the first report of <italic>p−i–n</italic> planar configuration PSC having 3.9% PCE in 2013 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, in which perovskite was sandwiched between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL and fullerene derivative ETL, their performances have been significantly improved to around 20% nowadays with the continuous endeavor to replace the PEDOT:PSS, having long-term stability issue due to its acidic nature, to better performing new types of HTLs. In this context, various inorganic semiconductors having p-type characteristics such as NiO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, CuI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, Cu<sub>2</sub>O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, CuSCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, PbS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and graphene oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> have shown great promise to efficiency and stability, but the organic semiconductor-based HTMs, having outstanding processibility for the simple one-step solution-process at low temperatures, also deserve further studies.</p><p id="Par6">Two types of organic semiconductor-based HTMs, small-molecule type (e.g. spiro-OMeTAD derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and triarylamine derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) and polymer type (e.g. PTAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, poly-TPD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, PCDTBT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and thiophene derivative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>), have been applied to <italic>p−i−n</italic> PSCs, and they could be utilized alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> or additionally inserted between inorganic semiconductor HTL and perovskite active layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Even though various types of organic HTMs have been suggested as mentioned, for designing efficient organic HTMs of <italic>p−i−n</italic> PSCs, in common, well-aligned highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels to the valence band edge of perovskite for efficient hole extraction, relatively high hole mobility for facilitating hole-transport, and the superior film quality of both HTL and perovskite after casting perovskite solution on those HTLs are required.</p><p id="Par7">Especially in this architecture, the incident light has to pass through the HTLs before reaching the photoactive layer, and thus their bandgap should be high enough to have their absorption in UV region for maximizing the transmitted light to the perovskite in visible and near-IR region of the solar spectrum. This also means that, under the solar illumination condition, fairly large amount of light energy, at least higher than their bandgap (e.g. UV region), would be continuously applied to HTLs, and therefore photo-excited states of organic HTMs, which have been usually overlooked for HTM design until now, could become important during the solar cell operation.</p><p id="Par8">One of the noticeable changes that we can observe from the energy-state difference in organic semiconductors is the alteration of electron distribution within the molecules, which could induce the variation of molecular dipole moment (e.g. transition dipole)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Until now, various interlayers that can induce dipoles have been often introduced into the PSCs to increase their built-in potential, subsequently enhancing the electric field for the separation of photo-generated excitons and the facilitation of charge extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>; however, the effect of intrinsic dipole states of organic HTMs in <italic>p−i−n</italic> planar PSCs under the solar illumination condition has never been considered.</p><p id="Par9">In this work, we systematically investigate and establish a molecular design principle to utilize the transition dipole moments of HTMs at photo-excitation for the performance enhancement of <italic>p−i−n</italic> configuration PSCs. For this purpose, the molecules, which not only have the aforementioned basic properties of HTMs but also can maximize the transition dipole moment effect under the solar spectrum by their structural properties that follow the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, are synthesized. The ESIPT process accompanies transient chemical variations and therefore the electronic property changes, particularly the dipole moment and polarizability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

Additionally, those molecules were designed more asymmetric than the conventional HTMs such as spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA to have higher dipole moments. More importantly, to design the molecules preserving high transition dipole moment effect under the solar spectrum, those were further manipulated by the introduction of intramolecular hydrogen (H) bond, which could modulate their molecular structures between enol (E) and keto (K) form through a process called ESIPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">ESIPT is a phototautomerization process that occurs in the excited state of intramolecularly H-bonded molecules (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

The existence of the stable excited state is an important feature of ESIPT material, because the inherent four-level character of ESIPT provides the straightforward population inversion in K* state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Consequently, the effective lifetime of photo-excited state could be magnified in ESIPT molecule as K* form, compared to the conventional organic semiconductors (i.e. this will be further confirmed with time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results of molecules, later), and the molecular property in K* form, predominantly existing at the excited state, could become crucial to the operation of <italic>p−i−n</italic> PSC, applying ESIPT material as an HTM, under broadband solar irradiation.

From ME1 to ME3, the angle between a backbone of central imidazole and a phenoxazine unit is getting larger (e.g. angle between imidazole and phenoxazine: ME1 &lt; ME2 &lt; ME3), which increases the electron confinement effect within the molecule, consequently providing higher dipole moment. Moreover, phenyl rings on the bottom of the imidazole were crosslinked in ME2 and ME3, and therefore they have a full-flat conformation around the central imidazole ring, further increasing their effective conjugation length and dipole. In contrast, ME1 has the twisted conformation decreasing its dipole moment due to the flexible phenyl groups within the molecule.

To confirm the work function variation of anode originated from the dipoles, the cross-sectional potential profiles of the devices were characterized by Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM), and the measured contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip of the cantilever and the cross-section surface of the device utilizing ME2, M2 or spiro-OMeTAD as an HTL is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f–h</xref>, as representatives (CPD is the difference of work functions between the tip and the surface), where zeros are set to the Al electrode for comparison.

However, we could notice the slightly decreased photocurrent from the PSC with ME3 having the highest dipole moment (9.64 D at K*), and this is due to the maximized effective conjugation length within the ME3 molecule, which not only increases its absorption efficiency but also shifts its absorption band to the visible wavelength region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), consequently sacrificing the transmitted light into the perovskite photoactive layer. As for the non-proton-transfer compounds (M2 and M3), of which the transition dipole moment effect cannot be intensified, the photocurrent enhancement was not remarkable, but their relatively higher dipole moments on both ground and excited states than those of the conventional HTMs such as spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA were still efficient to provide better device performances. Meanwhile, as the applied bias increases toward <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> condition, the built-in electric field within the device is compensated by the applied bias, and thus the induced dipole moment aligned with the electric field within the thin film would be weakened due to the minimized electric filed inside the device, which could not affect the work function of anode.

The emitted PL was collected using a fast photomultiplier tube detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant) with a magic angle (54.7°) arrangement. The incident angle of excitation pulse was set to be about 30° with respect to the sample. The resulting instrumental response function was about 160 ps in full-width-half-maximum. The PL decays were measured at the emission peak (770 nm) for perovskite. Cut-off filters for 670 nm (FF01-692 nm, Semrock) and 375 nm (Stock #84-754, Edmund Optics) were applied to block the remaining scattering from the incident beam. For PL decays of organic HTMs, 375 nm excitation was utilized. TPC measurement was conducted by generation of a small perturbed bias utilizing a nanosecond OPO laser system (INDI-40-10, Spectra-Physics) from Nd:YAG laser and a background illumination from Xe lamp (LS-150-XE ABET). The devices were located inside a jig directly connected to a digital oscilloscope (DSO-X 3054A, Agilent), and 50 Ω input impedance was installed for short-circuit conditions for transient current. The bias light intensity was controlled precisely by wheel type of neutral density filter (NDC-100C-4M) for attenuating the peak intensity. The initial light intensity from the Xe lamp was adjusted using power meter to be equivalent to 1 Sun (100 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>). Whenever the filter was set up for decreasing light from the lamp, measurements of attenuated light from laser pulse of 550 nm through ND filter were verified using a laser power meter.
