Here we show that a type of copper (Cu)-palladium (Pd) alloy tetrapod nanoparticles (TNP-1) presents an ideal solution to the chemo-PTT challenges. TNP-1 exhibit superior near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency, thanks to their special sharp-tip structure, and induce pro-survival autophagy in a shape- and composition-dependent manner. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyl adenine or chloroquine has a remarkable synergistic effect on TNP-1-mediated PTT in triple-negative (4T1), drug-resistant (MCF7/MDR) and patient-derived breast cancer models, achieving a level of efficacy unattainable with TNP-2, the identically-shaped CuPd nanoparticles that have a higher photothermal conversion efficiency but no autophagy-inducing activity. Our results provide a proof-of-concept for a chemo-PTT strategy, which utilizes autophagy inhibitors instead of traditional chemotherapeutic agents and is particularly useful for eradicating drug-resistant cancer.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">“Conventional chemotherapy-photothermal therapy combination has limited efficacy in drug resistant cancers.

This is one of the most pressing problems affecting the majority of cancer patients, leading to recurrence of disease and eventually death of patients from distant metastases that have become resistant to all available chemotherapy. Current treatment options are highly inadequate in addressing this problem, and novel approaches for overcoming cancer drug resistance are urgently needed. A promising approach, among many that are actively pursued, is photothermal therapy (PTT). In this noninvasive approach, tumor cells are killed by thermal energy generated from photothermal agents after adsorbing light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, thus offering an alternative mechanism to elicit cancer cell death. A variety of nanoparticles, such as gold nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and other carbon nanomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, palladium (Pd) nanosheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, copper (Cu) based nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, metal-organic frameworks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and polymer nanomicelles encapsulated with near-infrared (NIR) dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, have been extensively investigated as NIR<sup>−</sup>assisted photothermal agents, and some of them have demonstrated outstanding results. However, a common issue with nanomaterial-mediated PTT is the inability to induce complete tumor eradication due to the non-uniform distribution of hyperthermia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Combining PTT with chemotherapy, termed chemo-photothermal therapy (chemo-PTT), provides a feasible strategy for resolving this issue, thanks to the complementary, and possibly synergistic, cancer-killing effects elicited by the two approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the majority of the chemo-PTT studies reported in the literature employ chemotherapeutic agents that are widely used in clinics today, and in these circumstances chemo-PTT would be self-defeating for drug-resistant cancer. Complementing PTT with novel chemotherapeutics, which enhance cancer cell killing through non-conventional mechanisms, would be invaluable for countering the prevalent chemo-resistance problem.</p><p id="Par4">One of the nanomaterials with tremendous potential in NIR<sup>−</sup>assisted PTT is Cu-Pd alloy nanoparticle. Both Cu and Pd nanomaterials display strong LSPR absorption in the spectral range of NIR and could efficiently transfer the absorbed NIR optical energy into heat. Pd nanostructures were recently reported as attractive photothermal agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, exhibiting higher photothermal conversion efficiency and better photostability than gold or silver nanostructures. Cu-based nanomaterials have also shown great promise in photothermal thearapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The potential benefit of adding Cu to Pd nanoparticle, in addition to tuning photothermal response and reducing cost, is the ability to induce autophagy, a critical cellular degradation process and a key determinant for cancer therapy. Recent studies have shown that Cu compounds and Cu oxide nanoparticles induce autophagy in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Elevated autophagy oftentimes has a profound impact on the cell fate, promoting either survival or death. Interestingly, and ironically, autophagy induced by Cu compounds elicit both pro-death and pro-survival effects, as the inhibition of autophagy increased cell death for one Cu compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> but decreased cell death for another compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Depending on the cell fate outcome, the induced autophagy may be differentially exploited to enhance cancer therapy. If the induced autophagy is pro-death, it can be utilized either to directly kill cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> or sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic killing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. On the other hand, if the induced autophagy is pro-survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, inhibitors of autophagy can be used to enhance cancer cell killing, as we demonstrated for silver nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">With the above considerations in mind, we propose that a PTT-ready nanomaterial with the capability of inducing pro-survival autophagy may achieve superior therapeutic effect against drug-resistant cancer through the combination of PTT and an autophagy inhibitor, and we demonstrate the feasibility of this chemo-PTT strategy with specially-designed CuPd alloy nanocrystals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis, characterizations and photo-thermal response of CuPd nanoparticles</title><p id="Par6">Three types of CuPd alloy nanoparticles, including two tetrapod nanoparticles (TNP-1 and TNP-2) and one spherical nanoparticle (SNP), were synthesized for the present study. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the two TNPs exhibited very similar size and shape, consisting of four slender arms with ~50 nm in length, while SNP had a slightly smaller size of 35 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref> respectively). Dynamic light scattering analysis showed an average size of 68.2, 72.1, and 50.7 nm for TNP-1, TNP-2, and SNP, respectively, in deionized water (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), with the increase likely due to the thickness of the hydration shell. All three CuPd nanoparticles exhibited near-neutral charge in deionized water (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The EDS spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) showed that the atomic ratio of Cu was 42% for TNP-1, 13% for TNP-2, and 39% for SNP, while the corresponding numbers were 39.7% for TNP-1, 10.3% for TNP-2, and 41.1% for SNP as determined by ICP analysis. XRD analysis further revealed a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, each one of which lies between that of pure fcc Pd (JCPDS no. 46-1043) and pure fcc Cu (JCPDS no. 85–1326), for the two TNPs and SNP (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The ultraviolet-visible-NIR spectra showed strong absorption in the NIR region (&gt;800 nm) for both TNPs, with TNP-2 exhibiting higher absorption than TNP-1, consistent with the higher Pd ratio of TNP-2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). In contrast, significantly lower absorption was observed for SNP. These results strongly suggested that TNPs possess better potential as an NIR photothermal agent than SNP. To demonstrate this, we assessed temperature elevation profile of aqueous dispersions of CuPd nanoparticles upon NIR irradiation with 808 nm laser at a power density of 1 W cm<sup>2</sup>-1. Indeed, rapid temperature increase was observed, reaching 71 and 67 °C after 300 s irradiation, for TNP-2 and TNP-1, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). In contrast, the temperature of SNP dispersion increased to less than 45 °C after 300 s irradiation. These results indicated that TNPs had dramatically enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency as compared to SNP, a property that may be explained by the theory that the sharp-tip structure of TNPs could concentrate light at their tips and thus promote better local heat generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Synthesis and characterizations of CuPd alloy nanoparticles. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> TEM images of CuPd TNP-1 (<bold>a</bold>), TNP-2 (<bold>b</bold>) and SNP (<bold>c</bold>). <bold>d</bold> Size distribution of CuPd nanoparticles in aqueous solution as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). <bold>e</bold> Zeta potential of CuPd nanopartcles in aqueous solution. <bold>f</bold> Different Cu and Pd contents in CuPd nanoparticles revealed by EDS spectra. <bold>g</bold> The UV-Vis spectrum of CuPd nanoparticles in aqueous solution. <bold>h</bold> The temperature changes of CuPd nanoparticles irradiated by 808 nm NIR laser at a power density of 1 W cm<sup>2</sup>^-1 for 5 min</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2018_6529_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>TNP-1 induced complete autophagy in a shape- and composition-dependent manner</title><p id="Par7">We next assessed the autophagy-inducing activity of the two TNPs as well as SNP in EGFP/HeLa, a cell line that stably expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 (EGFP-LC3).

Much lower amount of Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion was released by TNP-2, consistent with its low Cu content.

In contrast, cytochalasin B and D, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, were ineffective. To assess the possibility that induction of autophagy by TNP-1 but not SNP was due to difference in the amount of internalized nanoparticle, we measured the level of intracellular Cu after incubation of nanoparticles with cells for 24 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The level of intracellular Cu, which presumably included both internalized Cu and Cu stably associated with the cell surface, was similar for cells treated with TNP-1 and SNP, indicating that nanoparticle shape did not significantly affect nanoparticle internalization and also strongly suggested that the ability of TNP-1 to induce autophagy was not due to increased cellular internalization.</p><p id="Par10">To further investigate the mechanism underlying the drastically different autophagy behavior of TNP-1 versus TNP-2, we assessed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are known to be induced by a variety of nanoparticles.

To determine which was the case, we assessed cell viability in HeLa, using the well-established MTT assay. 3-MA or NIR irradiation alone had no effect, while their combination showed a small and insignificant decrease, on cell viability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In the absence of NIR irradiation, TNP-1 elicited minimal change in cell viability. On the other hand, co-treatment of TNP-1 with 3-MA resulted in a 37% decrease in cell viability, indicating that TNP-1 induced pro-survival autophagy. These results also indicated that the pro-survival autophagy was sufficient to block the potential death-evoking effect of the high-level ROS elicited by TNP-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In agreement, the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine was able to effectively inhibit cell death occurred after TNP-1 plus 3-MA treatment (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). In comparison, 3-MA caused a much smaller cell viability reduction when co-treated with TNP-2, an ineffective autophagy inducer. Irradiation with 1 W cm<sup>2</sup>^-1 NIR light for 3 min, a treatment with relatively low power and short duration as compared to treatment conditions for other Pd- or Cu-based PTT nanomaterials, enhanced the cytotoxicity of TNP-2 and TNP-1. The enhancement effect was somewhat higher for TNP-2 than for TNP-1, consistent with the higher photothermal conversion efficiency of TNP-2. Importantly, NIR irradiation plus 3-MA had a remarkable synergistic effect on TNP-1-elicited cytotoxicity, resulting in 88% reduction in HeLa cell viability, which was significantly higher than the reduction in cell viability after TNP-1 plus irradiation treatment. In contrast, 3-MA did not further decrease cell viability in HeLa cells treated with TNP-2 and NIR irradiation. Notably, autophagy inhibition with 3-MA enhanced the cytotoxicity of TNP-1-mediated PTT to a level unattainable under TNP-2-mediated PTT either with or without 3-MA (less than 65% viability reduction).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Autophagy induced by CuPd TNP-1 promoted cell survival. <bold>a,</bold><bold>b</bold> Cell viability (<bold>a</bold>) and Annexin-V/PI assay (<bold>b</bold>) of HeLa cells after treatment for 24 h with the indicated combination.

Phantom studies revealed that the mean pixel intensity obtained from MSOT increased linearly with the increasing concentrations of TNP-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), establishing a linear relationship between the intensity of the MSOT images and the relative quantity of TNP-1. We next assessed the MSOT imaging property in vivo after intravenous injection of TNP-1 at a dose of 1.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. The photoacoustic signals at the tumor site increased significantly at 3 h and reached maximum at 24 h post injection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Consistent with this, irradiation of the tumor site at the various times after TNP-1 administration revealed time-dependent temperature elevation, indicating increasing nanoparticle accumulation, that reached maximum at 24 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). We thus chose the 24 h post nanoparticle delivery as the time point for the PTT treatment, and we carefully controlled the irradiation time to ensure, with the aid of camera, that the temperature of the tumor site was between 44 and 45 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). This temperature was achieved within 3 min of irradiation for the mice injected with TNP-1 or TNP-2.

A great variety of nanomaterials have been shown to induce autophagy in cancerous as well as normal cells. Chemical composition, size, shape and surface properties of the nanomaterial all play important roles in determining whether a nanomaterial will induce autophagy in a given cell under given circumstances. In this work we demonstrated that TNP-1 induced autophagy in a shape- and composition-dependent manner, as neither SNP, which had the same composition but different shape, nor TNP-2, which had same shape but different composition, induced autophagy under the same circumstances. Enhanced production of intracellular ROS, particularly ROS generated in mitochondrial, but not the extent of nanoparticle internalization or the level of nanoparticle-released Cu2+ ion, was found to be the underlying mechanism for the distinctive ability of TNP-1 to induce autophagy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that autophagy induced by TNP-1 was pro-survival, as inhibition of autophagy enhanced cancer cell killing elicited by TNP-1. The fact that the autophagy induced by TNP-1 exhibited normal flux without impairment of lysosomal function was consistent with this pro-survival role.</p><p id="Par26">Combining PTT with chemotherapy, or chemo-PTT, is a powerful approach in cancer therapy, as the two treatment modalities kill cancer cells through different mechanisms and oftentimes complement each other well for achieving complete eradication of tumor. However, cancer cells are prone to acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic agents after repeated exposure, an issue that is becoming more and more prudent in clinical practice today. Thus conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have limited utility for chemo-PTT of drug-resistant cancer. Novel chemotherapeutic agents, operating through mechanisms distinct from those of traditional chemotherapeutics, would be invaluable in helping overcome this problem. In this work we demonstrated, as a proof-of-concept, that chemical inhibitors of autophagy may replace traditional chemotherapeutics to accomplish nanomaterial-enabled chemo-PTT in certain situations. Specifically, this chemo-PTT strategy would work if the PTT-ready nanomaterial induces pro-survival autophagy. Such material may be engineered, as we did here by tuning the composition and shape of CuPd alloy nanoparticles. Importantly, inhibition of this pro-survival autophagy renders the cancer cells more susceptible to PTT-mediated killing, thus achieving synergistically-enhanced anti-cancer efficacy that is unattainable with another nanomaterial having the similar photothermal efficiency but no autophagy-inducing activity. The exact mechanism underlying this remarkable phenomenon remains to be determined.</p><p id="Par27">A couple of other points about the CuPd alloy TNPs we synthesized in this work are noteworthy. One is their outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency. High photothermal conversion efficiency is extremely desirable in nanomaterial-facilitated PTT, as it would enable effective PTT under relatively low dosing, which may be critically important for minimizing nanomaterial-elicited toxicity. High photothermal conversion efficiency would also enable PTT to operate in a deep tissue, where light penetration is limited. TNP-1 we synthesized exhibited superior photothermal property, as the degree of temperature elevation required for PTT was easily achievable with a combination of low nanoparticle concentration, low laser power, and short duration of irradiation. The unique tetrapod structure of these nanoparticles was a key factor, as the spherical CuPd alloy nanoparticles (SNP) exhibited a much poorer photothermal response than TNP-1, even though the two nanoparticles had the same composition. We attributed this finding to the theory that the special sharp-tip structure of TNPs could concentrate light at their tips and thus promote better local heat generation than the spherical CuPd NPs. The other useful feature of TNP-1 was their capability for MSOT imaging, an emerging modality that brings great promise to overcome the obstacles encountered in pure optical imaging. NIR-assisted MSOT is noninvasive and can give both anatomical and functional information with deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. In this work we utilized MSOT imaging to visualize nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor tissue and to establish the timing for initiating PTT treatment. In clinics, this feature may also enable imaging-guided PTT, in which the MSOT images are used to guide laser irradiation and achieve precise tumor eradication, thus minimizing photothermal damage to normal cells. In short, TNP-1 represents a superior type of “one fits all” theranostic nanoparticles and is ideally suited for autophagy-inspired chemo-PTT of difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant cancer</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials and antibodies</title><p id="Par28">Ultrapure water (pH 6.7; Milli-Q, Bedford, MA) was used in all situations throughout the experiments.

The platinum content in the plasma was detected by ICP-MS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Toxicity study</title><p id="Par44">BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group), and treated intravenously with an equivalent dose of 1.5 mg CuPd TNPs per kg of mouse body weight following the procedures of therapeutic study in 4T1 tumor model. On the day after the last injection, the blood serum was collected and mouse alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCR) were measured using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, following validation of each ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The major organs of the mice after treatment were collected and stained by haematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) to evaluate the toxicities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>TUNEL assay</title><p id="Par45">Tumors that received various treatments were used for TUNEL assay (TUNEL BrightRed Apoptosis Detection Kit, A113–01, Vazyme). In all, 4 mm frozen sections were washed with PBS and then incubated with proteinase K for 3 min at room temperature. After incubation with equilibration buffer for 30 min, the TUNEL reaction mixture was added to rinsed slides and incubated in a humidified chamber for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the sections were stained for 10 min with DAPI, washed with PBS and visualized with a fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par46">All data were expressed as Mean ± s.e.m. and analyzed by two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (2017YFA0205600), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31430028, 31671030, 81771975), the Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams (2017ZT07S054), the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Guangdong Province (2018B030306035) and Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme (No. 2017A050506016).
