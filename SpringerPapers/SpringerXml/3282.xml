Yet, burning coal produces more global warming CO<sub>2</sub> relative to all other fossil fuels, and it is a major contributor to atmospheric particulate matter known to have a deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular impact in humans, especially in China and India. Here we have discovered that burning coal also produces large quantities of otherwise rare Magn√©li phases (Ti<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>O<sub>2<italic>x</italic>‚Äì1</sub> with 4‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ<italic>x</italic>‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ9) from TiO<sub>2</sub> minerals naturally present in coal. This provides a new tracer for tracking solid-state emissions worldwide from industrial coal-burning. In its first toxicity testing, we have also shown that nanoscale Magn√©li phases have potential toxicity pathways that are not photoactive like TiO<sub>2</sub> phases, but instead seem to be biologically active without photostimulation. In the future, these phases should be thoroughly tested for their toxicity in the human lung.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Solid-state emissions from coal burning remain an environmental concern. Here, the authors have found that TiO2 minerals present in coal are converted into titanium suboxides during burning, and initial biotoxicity screening suggests that further testing is needed to look into human lung consequences.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41467_2017_Article_276.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Coal has been used by humans for thousands of years to produce energy through its combustion. According to the International Energy Agency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, roughly 30% of the world‚Äôs overall energy needs come from coal. The energy/industrial impact of coal is probably best illustrated in this way: it is used to produce approximately 40% of the world‚Äôs electricity, more than any other energy source, and 70% of the world‚Äôs steel. Further, its use for these purposes has continually increased over the last 150 years. At current usage rates, and considering global reserves and demand in the developing counties, especially India, coal will likely be a significant player in the world‚Äôs energy portfolio well into the future.</p><p id="Par4">Nevertheless, dealing with the downsides to burning coal on massive, protracted scales are formidable, including both severe environmental and human health impacts. While greenhouse gas drivers of climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> are the most important consequence to address long-term, the most important short-term consequence is that coal-burning is a major contributor to atmospheric particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5‚ÄâŒºm (so-called PM2.5), which is known to have a significant impact on human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Air pollution, of which PM2.5 is the most important fraction vs. larger fractions, has been estimated to lead to 3.3 million premature deaths per year worldwide. In China alone, 1.6 million premature deaths are estimated annually due to cardiovascular and respiratory injury over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Most Chinese megacities suffer over 100 severely hazy days every year with PM2.5 concentrations two to four times higher than World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Coal combustion is one of the major contributors to PM2.5 in China. Attention has also been given specifically to ultrafine PM because these smallest (nanoscale) particles can penetrate the lung‚Äôs alveolar (air-sack) membranes and thereafter translocate into the bloodstream to other organs, including the heart, and many are also capable of passing the blood-brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Over the last 50 years, as world coal use continues to increase as one of the most economic, abundant, and utilized fuel sources, in parallel, environmental scientists have also been discovering the severe detrimental aspects of this particular energy source. At the same time, a new and dramatically important revolution in science and technology has also been developing, that of nanoscience and nanotechnology, which expedited these environmental discoveries. Especially in the last 20 years, the study of naturally-occurring and ‚Äúincidental‚Äù nanomaterials has become an important subset of the nanoscience and technology revolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In particular, incidental nanomaterials are produced unintentionally (more specifically, an unintended nano-byproduct of some anthropogenic process), and as a result commonly enter the ‚Äúenvironmental world‚Äù very soon or immediately upon formation. Examples include direct producers of incidental nanomaterials (e.g., engines and sewage treatment plants) and indirect producers of incidental nanomaterials (desertification and mining, where humans disturb the Earth‚Äôs surface, and natural processes respond in part by making incidental nanomaterials, i.e., nanomaterials that nature would not have produced otherwise). Many of these natural and incidental nanomaterials possess unique properties, many not shown by their bulk equivalents, and they can contribute disproportionately to environmental chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Until relatively recently, incidental nanomaterials went unnoticed or were without concern. Now, with the development of environmental nanoscience and technology, this is more often no longer the case.</p><p id="Par6">It is the rise of coal, and the rise of incidental environmental nanoscience, that have come together to create the study presented in this article, that is, the discovery of titania suboxides, specifically Magn√©li phases (Ti<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>O<sub>2<italic>x</italic>‚àí1</sub>), as an incidental nanomaterial consequence of coal combustion. We determined in this study that Ti<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>O<sub>2<italic>x</italic>‚àí1</sub> is produced in the coal combustion process from stoichiometric titanium oxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, which very commonly occurs as an accessory (minor, by abundance) mineral in many coals with different coal ranks and sources worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">We originally made the discovery of incidental Magn√©li phases during an investigation of a coal ash spill into a riverine environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In that study, we presumed its generation was associated with coal combustion (more detail is given about this discovery in the Results and Discussion sections below). In the process of following the associations and mobility/bioavailability of arsenic due to this coal ash spill, we observed and recognized these Magn√©li phases, which until now were only very rarely observed in nature, but on the other hand are much more commonly synthesized and studied by materials scientists because of their unusual properties. We did not mention our discovery of these titania suboxides in Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, because so much more verification and assessments of them needed to be completed at that time.</p><p id="Par8">In this article, we describe in detail how we recognized and categorized these incidental Magn√©li phases, our exact crystallographic analyses of the various suboxide varieties encountered, our syntheses of these phases which strongly supports our hypothesis that these materials are generated during coal combustion in power plants, why Magn√©li phases are highly reliable tracers for determining coal ash distributions via aeolian or riverine processes in the environment, and finally a first look at its toxicity using the well-established zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) embryo model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Initial discovery of environmental Magn√©li particles</title><p id="Par9">Sediment samples were collected upstream and downstream from the Dan River (North Carolina, USA) coal ash spill site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (also, see the introduction to this paper above), on 9 February 2014. In addition, coal ash samples still in the plant impoundment pond, as well as unburned coal still at the plant site, were collected.

In this regard, we hypothesized that it was most likely that naturally occurring TiO<sub>2</sub> coal-accessory minerals (the polymorphs rutile, anatase, brookite) were being converted to Magn√©li phases in the high temperature coal combustion chambers of coal fired power plants. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an extensive set of experiments and measurements as described here.</p><p id="Par18">Magn√©li phases were generated in our laboratories by heating pulverized coal with anatase, rutile, or commercial ‚ÄúP25‚Äù nanoparticles (a mixture of approximately 80% anatase, 20% rutile) under an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for two hours (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In these first experiments, our experimental set-up was not meant to closely simulate combustion chambers in actual power plants which would be difficult, but to give a similar, high temperature, low available oxygen effect. The combustion chambers of coal-burning power plants are operated with pulverized coal in the presence of ambient air designed to produce very high temperatures (1400‚Äì1500‚Äâ¬∞C) with the coal carbon and the O<sub>2</sub>-airborne gas converted to CO<sub>2</sub>, leaving very hot TiO<sub>2</sub> temporarily in an oxygen poor environment. Our set-up allowed us to externally heat the titania at well controlled temperatures up to 1100‚Äâ¬∞C in the presence of N<sub>2</sub> gas, oxidizing a very small amount of the accompanying powdered coal (to CO<sub>2</sub>) using only oxygen derived from traces of O<sub>2</sub> in the nitrogen environment, plus the de-oxygenating titania. Under these conditions, after annealing P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> at 550‚Äâ¬∞C, the color of the P25 powder changed from white to gray, and the color of coal-annealed P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> turned to black when the annealing temperature was higher than 700‚Äâ¬∞C (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of coal-annealed P25 did not change up to an annealing temperature of 800‚Äâ¬∞C; interestingly, new characteristic XRD peaks emerged when the annealing temperature was at 900‚Äâ¬∞C or above (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Compared with diffraction peaks reported in International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) files, as well as TEM observations (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), we found that the dominant phase for converted P25, heated in the presence of coal powder at 900‚Äâ¬∞C (designed P25-900‚Äâ¬∞C), is the Ti<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub> Magn√©li phase, and the dominant phase for coal-annealed P25 at 1100‚Äâ¬∞C (designed P25-1100‚Äâ¬∞C), is the Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> Magn√©li phase. Supplementary Table¬†<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> shows that other Magn√©li phases are also produced at these temperatures and conditions, and that grains of rutile and anatase can remain unconverted, at least after the 2-h duration of these experiments. Moreover, the Raman spectra in Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref> also show that the coal-annealed P25-900‚Äâ¬∞C and P25-1100‚Äâ¬∞C samples produced new and distinctive peaks compared with pristine P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> powder, although the generation of Magn√©li phases when going from 700 to 900‚Äâ¬∞C is not as apparent in the Raman spectra. When we switched the starting titania material from P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> to anatase or rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>, the same distinguishing XRD peaks for various Magn√©li phases were observed when annealing temperatures were the same as previously defined (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b, c</xref>).

This is strongly suggested by both the circumstantial evidence presented above concerning the spatial and temporal relationships between Magn√©li phases and coal-fired power plants (over 1000‚Äâ¬∞C, locally reduced environments resulting from areas of incomplete combustion in the firebox), as well as the synthesis of Magn√©li phases under the conditions of our heating experiments (over 900‚Äâ¬∞C, TiO<sub>2</sub> with pulverized coal under a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere). It is also important to consider the possibility of generating Magn√©li phases during coke production. Coke, typically made under highly reducing conditions from low-sulfur, low-ash bituminous coal at temperatures similar to those used in this study (over 900‚Äâ¬∞C), should result in Magn√©li phases production. As mentioned in the Introduction, coke made from coal is used to produce 70% of the world‚Äôs steel.</p><p id="Par27">TiO<sub>2</sub> naturally occurs in coal as anatase, rutile, and brookite, the three mineral TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs, whereas Magn√©li phases have never been reported in any rank of coal, or coal origin. In summary, Swaine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> summarized Ti associations in coals, noting that Eskanazi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> called for an organic association of Ti. While an organic association may be the case in peats and low-rank coals, Finkelman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> found anatase and rutile in bituminous coals. Ketris and Yudovich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> acknowledge this mixed affiliation, placing Ti among the weakly or moderate coalphile elements. The levels of TiO<sub>2</sub> in coal vary, but generally are found within a range from roughly a few tenths of a percent, to a few percent, by weight. For example, Hower and Bland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and Hower et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. found the TiO<sub>2</sub> content in the Pond Creek coal in eastern Kentucky to vary between 0.13‚Äì6.52%, with the highest amounts found in association with relatively high concentrations of Zr (as zircon, ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>) in clastic-origin lithotypes. Similar trends were noted in eastern Kentucky‚Äôs River Gem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and Elswick<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> coals.</p><p id="Par28">It should be noted that we have considered the possibility that Magn√©li phases result from TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs, especially anatase, due to its common use in the catalytic beds of modern coal-fired power plants in the combustion gas exhaust stream. These beds are designed to minimize/eliminate NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> in the exhaust stream, commonly using anatase/rutile to provide favorable chemical conversion of these toxic emission gases present depending on the type of coal that is burned. Any release of the titanium oxides in the gas stream during years of service would be trapped by the plant‚Äôs electrostatic precipitators along with the fly ash exhaust component that it is designed to collect. However, such a scenario does not account for two factors. First, anatase/rutile used in these catalytic beds (e.g., P25) lack Magn√©li phases. Second, the temperature of gases in this part of the power plant are many hundreds of degrees too low to generate Magn√©li phases. Temperatures of at least 900‚Äâ¬∞C were needed in this study to convert anatase/rutile to Magn√©li phases, with that temperature easily exceeded in the combustion chamber of a power plant. Therefore, TiO<sub>2</sub> used in catalytic beds should not be a source for titania suboxides from coal-burning power plants.</p><p id="Par29">It should also be noted that burning municipal solid waste is becoming more and more common worldwide, and the production and/or fate of nanoparticles (including TiO<sub>2</sub> in commercial products) during this incineration is of growing interest (e.g., refs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>). Many incineration protocols use temperatures below what we have found to be conducive to Magn√©li phase production under highly reducing conditions (&lt;900‚Äâ¬∞C). In addition, our preliminary experiments to date using P25 starting material in the presence of sewage sludge under N<sub>2</sub> at 900 and 1000‚Äâ¬∞C produced rutile exclusively (as measured by powder XRD). However, some incineration is driven by burning coal at temperatures well in excess of 1000‚Äâ¬∞C, and here we would expect the production of Magn√©li phases both from the TiO<sub>2</sub> in the coal itself and any in the waste. Given a 2014 estimate that 8600 metric tons of nanomaterials are incinerated annually on a global basis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and that TiO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterials would be some fraction of this, and that high temperature incineration using a carbon-based fuel would be some fraction of this, the production of Magn√©li phases due to incineration is several orders of magnitude less than our estimated Gt levels of Magn√©li phase generation due to industrial coal-burning (see Discussion below). Therefore, waste incineration is not expected to be a significant contributor to Magn√©li phase production relative to coal-burning power plants.</p><p id="Par30">Schindler and Hochella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> very recently identified Magn√©li phases in soils proximal to Cu-Ni-sulfides smelters and refineries in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Although the identified nano-size Magn√©li phases only occurred as minute traces of material in mineral surface coatings, its discovery in this setting suggests that these phases can also form during the reductive smelting and refining of metal-bearing ores in the presence of coke, coal, or carbon monoxide. In this scenario, this also opens the possibility of Magn√©li phases originating from TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs present in the ore being smelted and refined. Hence, the anthropogenic formation of Magn√©li phases may not be limited to coal-burning power plants and likely also coking facilities. Nevertheless, further study is needed, and this paper has concentrated on coal-burning power plants due to their tremendous and still growing abundance in the industrial world.</p><p id="Par31">With the seeming ubiquity of incidental Magn√©li phases from coal combustion, in fact it is quite the opposite for naturally occurring Magn√©li phases. Such naturally occurring instances are very rarely recognized. Magn√©li phases have infrequently been observed in lunar rocks, as oxygen deficient, blue ‚Äúrutile‚Äù<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Further, Magn√©li phases have been suspected or identified, for example, as rare Ti oxide phases in interplanetary dust particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, in carbonaceous chondrite meteorite matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and in micrometeorites in Antarctic ice particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Aside from these extraterrestrial origins, the only Earth-bound natural occurrence that we could locate in the literature comes from Pedersen and R√∏nsbo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> who discovered ‚Äúmudstone xenoliths‚Äù exposed in one location on the central coast of western Greenland where andesitic magma likely flowed into shallow water underlain by a carbonaceous mudstone, resulting in high temperature (about 1200 ‚Äâ¬∞C), low confining pressure (close to five bars), extremely reducing (producing native iron), pyrometamorphosed sediment xenoliths where anatase/rutile grains were transformed to Magn√©li phases.</p><p id="Par32">Given our assessment that the overwhelming majority of nanoscale Magn√©li phases found in the environment are from industrial coal-burning, it is possible that these Magn√©li phases could be used as a tracer for the global distribution of coal-burning solid-state emissions. Scientists have been working on using various source apportionment techniques for tracking coal-burning emissions using isotope geochemistry, chemical fingerprinting, and modeling to differentiate coal ash contamination from other contaminant sources in the environment (e.g., see refs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). This is a very difficult task due to the extraordinary complexity of environmental chemistries and physical matrices. A unique fingerprint to trace the distribution of coal ash components around the globe is still lacking. More specific tracers are also needed for medical diagnoses, especially in the study of lung disease due to the severity of this problem as discussed in the Introduction of this article.</p><p id="Par33">Therefore, Magn√©li phases are presented here as a new tracer candidate for coal-burning power plant and likely coke production/smelting plant emissions, both fluvial and aeolian. Such a tracer could be used alone, or in combination with other source apportionment techniques mentioned above. Perhaps the strength of a Magn√©li phase tracing method is in its surprising simplicity and ease of use. This stems from the confluence of a number of fortunate occurrences and processes that work together to provide such a method. TiO<sub>2</sub> mineral phases are essentially a ubiquitous accessory phase in all coals worldwide, generally varying from a tenth of a percent to several percent, by weight. Combustion of the coal, with included TiO<sub>2</sub> minerals which are never intentionally targeted for separation from the coal due to their relatively benign nature, and at temperatures over 1000‚Äâ‚Äâ¬∞C under locally reducing conditions, very quickly produces Magn√©li phases. Although worthy of a separate study, the grain sizes of the Magn√©li phases generated should be quite variable, although in this study, using TEM as the critical identification and tracking tool, we have selected for submicron grains. These Magn√©li phases are then entrained with the many other gaseous and condensed matter components of the plant emission stream. Some fraction of these phases will leave the plant with the gaseous stream (from virtually none to a significant proportion, depending on the plant design and efficacy of its emission-control systems). The remainder will end up in the collected ash components, to be later stored in impoundments or landfills, or recycled into various ash-containing products (concrete/cement, wallboard, road fill, etc.). In all of these possibilities, the incidentally produced Magn√©li phases are entering some aspect of the environment, and are immediately or eventually (through secondary processes, e.g., wallboard disposal in a landfill, or incinerated) subject to transport via natural aeolian or fluvial process, and often a combination of the two.</p><p id="Par34">The organismal and ecological environments that these Magn√©li phases enter lack the occurrence of Magn√©li phases, given their extraordinary rarity in natural systems. On the other hand, we estimate the production of Magn√©li phases due to industrial coal-burning to be enormous over the last two centuries since the Industrial Revolution. Considering ballpark, but well-founded estimations of coal productions in modern times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, accounting for the great majority of coal that has ever been used, one can say that on the order of a few hundred gigatons (Gt) of coal has been burned by humans. We can also estimate from existing observations and data that coal contains on the order of an average of 2% TiO<sub>2</sub>, and that, on average, a coal will produce roughly 15% residual ash (both of these estimates are ours, from our personal estimations from the vast coal mineral and ash literature, and our own experience). While the conversion efficiency of TiO<sub>2</sub> minerals to Magn√©li phases in the burning process is not known, we can say that, at least in the size range of up to several hundred nanometers (as observed in this study among 22 ashes collected from around the United States and China), most of the titania has been converted to Magn√©li phases.</p><p id="Par35">Considering all of this, we are still left with on the order of a Gt of Magn√©li phase production via industrial coal-burning over the last few centuries to be spread via the atmosphere and hydrosphere around the planet. The bottom line is that if one observes these highly unusual, easily recognizable phases in selective searching with a TEM, whether in or on soils, river/estuary water or sediments, city streets, stormwater ponds, human lung tissue, or wherever else, that portion of the environment has been very likely impacted by these phases and other solid state components in a similar size range from the sources that have been described herein. The reach of these small physical components (e.g., naturally occurring nano-sized inorganic solids) is global, as is well-known and documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">Until now, and as described in detail above, titania suboxides were not known to be widely distributed in the environment, and to our knowledge have not been used in commercial products with wide distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This explains why toxicity testing had not been initiated and underscores why an understanding of the particles‚Äô toxicity potential is now needed. In comparison, the nanoparticles of the polymorphs of TiO<sub>2</sub> are widely used in commercial products, from paints to makeup to sunscreens, among other uses, and as expected, the toxicity of these nanoparticles have been widely studied. TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle toxicity has been extensively examined in the context of freshwater and marine environments and in organisms belonging to several trophic levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. It is generally thought that oxidative stress is the primary mechanism of acute toxicity to developing organisms due to the ability of forms of TiO<sub>2</sub> to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when irradiated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

There is also evidence that sub-chronic exposure to adult zebrafish causes neurological effects associated with spatial recognition memory and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Several studies implicate TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle coating, shape, size, and aggregation properties as confounding variables to these nanoparticle‚Äôs bioavailability and toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. This is especially relevant in studies using zebrafish models because of the protective chorion (an acellular enclosure) encompassing the developing fish between 0‚Äì48‚Äâhpf. Though its permeability has not been thoroughly characterized, the zebrafish chorion is a known barrier to the uptake of many contaminants, including metallic nanomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Studies aiming to characterize the toxicity of metal nanoparticles commonly remove the chorion prior to exposure to ensure particle bioavailability during early stages of development when organisms are most sensitive to environmental stressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In fact, in additional experiments with chorionated zebrafish embryos in this study (data not shown), we failed to observe significantly reduced survival after exposure to P25 and P25-900‚Äâ¬∞C nanoparticles at concentrations up to 1000‚Äâppm; these results corroborate the references cited above, demonstrating the protective effect of the zebrafish chorion barrier to titanium oxide nanomaterial bioavailability. The chorion is also commonly removed in screening assays investigating the toxicity potential of pharmacological agents or other chemicals; for these purposes, the dechorionated embryonic zebrafish is a high-throughput and robust vertebrate model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par37">Therefore, in this first study of titania suboxide toxicity, we were primarily interested in reporting the inherent toxicity of the P25-900‚Äâ¬∞C (Magn√©li phase) particles in the absence of the embryonic zebrafish protective chorion barrier (i.e., toxicity relevance to aquatic animal gills or terrestrial animal lungs). We observed significant reductions in embryo survival following acute exposure to these particles in the absence of SSR, but not following co-exposure to P25-900‚Äâ¬∞C and SSR. These results are in stark contrast to those of P25, in which the detrimental effects are primarily attributed to the material‚Äôs photo-induced toxicity due to the generation of ROS as described above. In contrast, the reason for the toxicity of Magn√©li phase titania suboxides is not known, this being the first time that a formal biotoxicity study has been conducted for these materials. Whatever role Magn√©li phases play in and around biological systems is expected to be fundamentally different than TiO<sub>2</sub> phases. Unlike the wide band gap semiconducting, UV absorbing TiO<sub>2</sub> phases, Magn√©li phases are narrow band gap semiconductors (see above), with electrical conducting properties similar to carbon/graphitic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, these variably defective materials are expected to have interesting and important ionic conductivity and catalytic properties that still need to be thoroughly explored.</p><p id="Par38">The immediate relevance of this work is aquatic organism exposure under conditions of limited solar radiation co-exposure, but there are also translational implications for human health. Of particular interest is the reactivity of Magn√©li phases in human lung alveolar membranes considering their accessibility to this critical and vulnerable portion of our physiology, and the fact that their biological reactivity likely does not depend on solar radiation co-exposure.</p><p id="Par39">Overall, Magn√©li phases are a newly recognized incidental nanomaterial in the environment with very wide distribution, allowing it to be a new candidate for tracing the distribution of industrial coal-burning solid-state emissions worldwide. In addition, while we provide an initial assessment of Magn√©li phase toxicity using an established exposure regimen and animal model, this situation also clearly invites further toxicity studies aimed at comprehensive characterization of Magn√©li phase toxicity at sublethal concentrations and investigations of potential mechanisms of action.

SSR co-exposure was administered using an Atlas SunTest CPS‚Äâ+‚Äâsolar simulator equipped with a standard solar filter (Atlas Material Testing Solutions, Chicago, IL). The solar standard filter achieves outdoor solar radiation as specified by DIN 67501, an international standard for SSR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Plates intended to receive SSR were wrapped in Saran Wrap to allow UV penetration while plates serving as no-solar-radiation controls were subsequently wrapped in aluminum foil. All SSR exposures were performed at 250‚Äâwatts‚Äâm<sup>‚àí2</sup> lamp output at 28‚Äâ¬∞C for 2‚Äâh to achieve total irradiation of 1800‚ÄâkJ‚Äâm<sup>‚àí2</sup>. Embryos were subsequently raised at 28‚Äâ¬∞C on a 14:10‚Äâh light:dark cycle. The experiment was repeated six times with 16 embryos used per treatment per replicate point.</p><p id="Par48">Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism Software (Version 7.0, La Jolla, CA). The effect of nanomatieral exposure and solar radiation on embryo survival was tested by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey‚Äôs post hoc test was used to conduct multiple pairwise comparisons. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par49">The authors declare that all data directly supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and the Supplementary Information file.
