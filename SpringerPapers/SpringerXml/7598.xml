Despite having the great advantage of being powered by cheap heat (instead of expensive electric work), the implementation of systems based on adsorption principles remains limited to few specific applications. The main drawback that needs to be solved is their reduced specific power due to the low thermal conductivity and low stability of the adsorbents. The current state of the art of commercial adsorption cooling systems rely on adsorbers based on coated finned heat exchangers to optimize the cooling power. It is a well known result, that the reduction of the thickness of the coating derives in a reduction of the mass transport impedance, and that the increment of the ratio surface to volume of conductive structures increases the power without reducing the efficiency. The metallic fibres used in this work can offer a ratio of specific surface in the range of 2500–50,000 m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>.Three methods of preparing very thin but stable salt-hydrate coatings on metallic surfaces, including metallic fibres, for the production of coated heat exchangers with high specific power, are presented for the first time. A surface treatment based on aluminium anodizing was chosen to create a stronger bond between coat and substrate. The microscopic structure of the resulting surface was analysed by Scan Electron Microscopy. To verify the presence of the desired species Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transformed Infrared and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were employed in the analysis. Their capacity to form hydrates was verified via simultaneous Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Thermogravimetry (DTG). Over a mass difference of 0.07 g(water)/g(composite) was detected in the coating of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, which showed signs of dehydration at temperatures around 60 °C, and repeatability after rehydration. Also positive results were obtained with SrCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> with mass differences around 0.02 g/g below 100 °C. Hydroxyethyl Cellulose was chosen as additive to increase the stability and adherence of the coatings. The adsorption properties of the product were evaluated with simultaneous TGA-DTG, while their adherence was characterized by means of a procedure based on the test described in ISO2409. Coatings of CaCl<sub>2</sub> displayed a much improved consistency and adherence, while retaining its adsorption capacity, showing mass differences of around 0.1 g/g at temperatures below 100 °C. Also MgSO<sub>4</sub> retains the capacity of forming hydrates, showing a mass difference of more than 0.04 g/g below 100 °C. Finally, coated metallic fibres were investigated. Results show that the effective heat conductivity of a fibre structure coated with Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> can be up to 4.7 times higher as compared to a block of pure Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> . The coverage of the pursued coatings was visually investigated and the internal structure was evaluated by microscopic imaging of cross-sections. Coatings of around 50 µm of Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> were generated, but in general the process requires optimization to achieve a more uniform distribution.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie</institution><institution-id

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Adsorption systems have drawn a lot of attention during the last decades because they represent an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional compression heat pumps or refrigeration systems. With comfort standards and average global temperatures increasing, adsorption systems have the potential to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in the near future. Besides, any improvement in the fields of adsorption refrigeration or heat pumps can be transferred to the field of thermal energy storage, which constitutes an additional increment in the capacity to make an efficient use of primary energy. The main advantage of adsorption heat pumps and refrigeration systems is that they can be processed by low quality heat. This makes them suitable for low temperature sources like solar energy or waste heat. Regarding energy storage applications, adsorption possesses the advantages of its higher energy density and its lower energy dissipation for long term applications as compared to sensible or latent heat storage.</p><p id="Par3">Adsorption heat pumps and refrigeration systems follow similar thermodynamic cycles as those followed by their vapor-compression counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The main difference is the substitution of the compressor part by an adsorber. This element, when maintained at medium temperature, is capable of adsorbing low-pressure vapor refrigerants, which enables the evaporation of higher amount of refrigerant even when the liquid is at low temperatures. It is necessary to ensure a continuous cooling of the adsorber to remove the enthalpy of adsorption (exothermic). The adsorber is regenerated at high temperature, which forces desorption of vapor refrigerant. Heat must be continuously added to supply the enthalpy of desorption (endothermic). As adsorption events are characterized by changes of the temperature, a high thermal conductivity is necessary to obtain high specific powers. However, the low heat conductivity is a major drawback so far in most of the applications.</p><p id="Par4">The main challenge with respect to conductivity consists in the increment of its average value, and at the same time to ensure the maintenance of transport paths that allow the flow of the adsorbed/desorbed vapor. Two approaches have been usually adopted to achieve this goal: composites and coated heat exchangers. The most popular and successful composites are those that use carbon-based additives, i.e., expanded graphite, activated carbon, or carbon fibers. Oliveira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> impregnated calcium chloride in expanded graphite powder to produce an adsorber with a specific cooling power (SCP) up to 306 W/kg and a Coefficient of Performance (COP) up to 0.46. Zajaczkowski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> proposed a combination of expanded graphite, carbon fibers and calcium chloride with an overall conductivity of 15 W/mK. Jian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> tested composites with Expanded Natural Graphite Treated with Sulfuric Acid (ENG-TSA) as substrate in two-stage adsorption refrigeration cycles. Models predicted COPs between 0.215 and 0.285 with SCPs between 161.4 and 260.74 W/kg.</p><p id="Par5">Until now the approach that constitutes the most feasible solution is given by coated heat exchangers. The mechanisms to coat those heat exchangers can be divided into two categories: direct synthesis and binders. The most successful method is the direct synthesis, which consists in the formation of the adsorbent material, out of the corresponding reactants, directly on the surface of the heat exchanger. Sortech<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> patented a synthesis method for coated zeolite that is employed in one of the lines of chillers commercialized by the company Fahrenheit GmbH. Schnabel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> tested the performance of two zeolites coated on stainless steel. However, this method works only with specific adsorbents, which makes coating with binders an interesting alternative. Binders are passive species, selected to maintain the adherence and/or mass transport of the adsorbent, but play no role in the adsorption process or the increment of the conductivity. Freni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> coated an aluminum heat exchanger with zeolite AQSOA-Z02 stabilized by a clay-based binder. Calabrese et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> have investigated the preparation of zeolite coatings with a polymeric binder. Ammann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> presented a method to create a porous zeolite coating with a magnetic mixture of polyvinyl alcohol. Aluminum oxide (alumina) has been also used as binder in adsorbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose have been used only in combination with physical adsorbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Sometimes binders are not used in coatings but to create a structure by themselves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. An alginate-derived polymer matrix was combined with several salt hydrates to create a flexible structure of composite beads, preventing leakage during deliquescence, and allowing sufficient mass transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Clays like bentonite and attapulgite have been employed as binder for the preparation of composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Ethyl cellulose has been used to micro encapsulate calcium chloride<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, or sodium sulfide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Composites with porous metallic structures could be classified halfway between additives and coated heat exchangers. The high ratios of surface-to-volume characteristic of these structures are an advantage. This results into bigger contact surfaces between adsorbent and metal without increasing the inert mass, which would decrease the overall efficiency of the refrigeration cycle. Lang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> increased the overall conductivity of a zeolite adsorber with an aluminum honeycomb structure. Gillerminot et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> intensified the thermal conductivity of a NaX zeolite bed with copper and nickel foams. Even though the composites were used as phase change materials (PCMs) the conclusions from Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> are also of interest for chemical adsorption. They compared the performance of expanded graphite and metallic foams, concluding that the later are preferred only in those cases where corrosion is not an issue. Other metallic porous structures were recently compared by Palomba et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Metallic salts embedded in metallic foams were investigated by van der Pal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. All the previous examples correspond to compact beds of granulate adsorbent. Metallic porous structures have been scarcely employed in coated adsorbers which is a more optimized solution. An example can be found in the publication of Wittstadt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> in combination with zeolites, but no attempts could be found in combination with salt hydrates in spite of their higher energy density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, in this paper three methods for the preparation of adsorbent coatings will be investigated: (1) a coating with binder, (2) a direct reaction, and (3) a surface treatment. Hydroxyethyl cellulose is the binder selected in this work because of the previously reported stability and good adherence of the coatings in combination with physical adsorbents. This method is initially investigated for coatings of flat surfaces, and then applied to metal fiber structures. A preliminary analysis of the possibilities offered by chemical reactions to generate adsorbent coatings has been already previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. That previous experience is now transferred to coatings of metallic fibrous structures. The surface treatment selected for this work is a method based on aluminum anodizing. Aluminum anodizing has been already successfully used in combination with metallic salts for aesthetic purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In those cases, very stable and resistant coatings can be generated. However, they are not able to perform any adsorption or desorption processes. In this work a variation of this method is presented, that allows the transport of mass, while profiting from the adhesion properties of the original process. To the best of our knowledge none of the methods described here have been previously investigated. They constitute novel techniques of great interest because they allow the formation of adsorbent coatings with salt hydrates, which present several advantages as compared to the frequently investigated physical adsorbents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par8">The punched aluminum plates used as substrate for these experiments were provided by ALINVEST Břidličná, Czech Republic.

The heating rate was 1 °C/min, where the sample mass varied between 10 and 20 mg with a resolution of 0.1 µg. It must be noticed in this work, that the values of the mass differences given per unit of surface are subjected to big uncertainty. The samples used in the TGA-DTG are very small and unevenly cut, which makes the determination of their area imprecise.

This surface treatment generates a porous structure of aluminium oxide (alumina) directly on the surface of an aluminium surface. Traditionally this method is composed by two steps: the first step generates a porous aluminium oxide structure while the second creates a coating of aluminium hydroxide that seals the pores. In the following, two approaches are presented to lock the salt without blocking the access to the vapor phase. The first one consists in the use of the honeycombed system of small alumina oxide tubes (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) generated during the first step to retain the crystals of adsorbent and increase its adherence to the metal surface. The generated honeycombs show a diameter of about 50 nm and a length of 200 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). As mentioned before, these cavities are usually closed during the second step by a thin layer of boehmite, AlO(OH), sustained by a boiling process of the aluminium oxide tubes. In the second approach, this sealing process is modified so that the salt crystals are captured in an evenly overlaid layer of boehmite (AlO(OH)), which is not intended for sealing in this case. The second step was performed in a saturated solution of the corresponding salt. The described patterns show dimensions in the range of 50–100 nm and appear as spattered drops (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The surface generated as a result of sealing process, shows an explicit spatial structure with an enhanced contact area. This surface pattern as well as the multitude of their bonding disposition are highly well suited to host and to retain salt crystals. Both described structures appear indeed porous and show small cavities, that seem to be well suited to allow the retention of salt hydrate and the adsorption of vapour by the salt during the operation of the adsorber. However, the EDX element analysis of these surfaces could detect traces of magnesium and sulphur on the surface of boehmite whereas it could not be perceived in case of the alumina surface.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Anodic Oxidising: (<bold>a</bold>) Aluminium oxide Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, (<bold>b</bold>) Boehmite AlO(OH).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_11548_Fig1_HTML.jpg" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">ATR-FTIR of the sample confirmed that the element is found as magnesium sulphate (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).

The curve for a point in the grey areas (point 1 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b) showed few counts for strontium and many counts for aluminium.

The EDX analysis of the white areas shows darker spots (points 2 and 4 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b) with low counts of chlorine and high counts of sulphur.

This phenomenon is characterized by the formation of a dry coat on the surface of the dissolution, which stops the convection-driven drying and starts a diffusion driven process. This second mechanism is much slower than the former one. The consequence is that reasonable drying durations require high temperatures, which increase the risk of formation of bubbles inside the sample. This problem was solved by implementing another crystallization method not based on a change of the concentration (evaporation) but on a change of the temperature (exemplified in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> for MgSO<sub>4</sub>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic representation of the crystallization method by cooling and separation of solid and liquid phases with MgSO<sub>4</sub>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_11548_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par39">With this method, a saturated solution of the salt was prepared either at room temperature or at higher temperature (HT).

The result was a mixture of crystals (B) and dissolution (A), whose liquid part was removed with compressed air. This method not only avoided skinning in those hydrates that suffered it, but also decreased the time required for the preparation of other composites. However, removing the liquid with compressed air, contributed to the crystallization of additional salt, which derived into the formation of thicker coatings.</p><p id="Par40">An alternative method that can be used to coat metallic surfaces consists in the generation of the target salt directly by chemical reaction.

In this case, an additional step was added before the impregnation. The samples were shortly submerged in a diluted solution of the target salt and dried at around 60 °C. This process was intended to modify the surface of the metal creating seeding points that would improve the distribution of the coating in the final step. The fiber structures present a side, where the filaments are finer and closely packed and an opposite side, where the filaments are thicker and coarsely distributed.

The formation of salt on crossing points of the structure is easily observed in this case, confirming that the coating process is mainly driven by the surface tension of the liquid and not by an interaction between the salt and the metal substrate.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MgSO<sub>4</sub> seeding and coating on aluminium fibre structures.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left"><p>Seeding</p></th><th align="left"><p>Coating</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Fine side</p></td><td align="left"><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_11548_Fige_HTML.jpg"/></p></td><td align="left"><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_11548_Figf_HTML.jpg"/></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Coarse side</p></td><td align="left"><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_11548_Figg_HTML.jpg"/></p></td><td align="left"><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_11548_Figh_HTML.jpg"/></p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par45">The results with the combination of strontium chloride (SrCl<sub>2</sub>) and HEC presented similar characteristics as the previous examples (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

The thermal conductivity was measured with a plate apparatus, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>a, according to ASTM D 5470-2017, applying a reference material with known heat conductivity. Compared to other transient measurement methods this principle is beneficial for porous materials as applied in the current study due to measurement in steady-state and an adequate sample size (footprint of 30 × 30 mm<sup>2</sup>, height of ~ 15 mm). Samples have been prepared for the pure coating material (reference) and the coated fibre structures, both for the measurement in fibre direction and perpendicular to the fibre direction, to assess the influence of the anisotropic heat conductivity properties. The samples were grinded (grain P320) at the surface to minimise the influence of the rough surface due to sample preparation, which is not representative for the structure inside the sample.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Determination of the effective heat conductivity of aluminium fibre structure coated with Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.

The effective thermal conductivity can be increased by the porous fibre structure to a value up to 4.7 times higher than the intrinsic conductivity of aluminium sulfate. As expected, the increase with a heat flux along the fibre direction shows a clearly larger increase. Yet, with a non-optimal fibre orientation the increase is nearly factor 2. Additionally, it has to be taken into account that the reference sample is a non-porous sample without cavities inside the sample, whereas the coated structures already include the cavities to enable a media flow in the structure. The initial fibre structure has a porosity of 81.1% (sample in fibre direction) and 77.4% (sample perpendicular to fibre direction). With cavities (e. g. a loose bulk as applied for zeolithes) the effective heat conductivity of the reference sample would be even lower, which would increase the factor for the heat conductivity improvement. This verifies the improvement of the effective thermal conductivity by the fibre structure. The detailed influence of different parameters e. g. coating thickness, coating distribution of the fibres has to be evaluated in future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Summary and conclusion</title><p id="Par48">In this paper, an approach to overcome the low thermal conductivity of salt hydrates for their implementation in chemical adsorbers has been investigated. Three methods were investigated for the preparation of highly conductive composites in detail: coating with HEC as binder, coatings by direct reaction, and coating with surface treatment of the aluminium substrate by anodic oxidation.</p><p id="Par49">Among the methods analysed in this work, coating combined with surface treatment by anodization of the surface is the most promising approach. The results show the formation of very thin layers of adsorbent with very strong adherence. The TGA of the coatings show the adsorption capabilities of this method showing a negative impact on the formation of hydrates only in the case of calcium chloride. An optimization of the method is required to increase the percentage of mass difference of the composite. From our perspective, the improvement of the coating should begin with an increment of the porosity resulting from the anodizing process. Previous results show that the conditions and additives of the reaction can be modified to duplicate the size of the pores and reach porosities up to 65%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par50">Coating with HEC as binder presents improved adherence as compared to coatings with pure hydrate. This method can be potentially used with any compound, although the binder can block the adsorption properties of the active material as observed in the case of zinc sulphate. This coating approach constitutes an improvement as compared to the previous encapsulation found in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, because the direct contact with the surface of the heat exchanger increases the overall heat conductivity, improving the specific power of the adsorber. The transfer of this technique to metallic fibres by immersion and subsequent drying by heating resulted in heterogeneous distributions of the coating due to the influence of the surface tension of the solution. The results presented in this work constitute a broadening of the range of species that can be employed in coated metallic porous structures, as the current state of the art was limited to zeolites or particle beds. This increases the selection of species that can be used in adsorption processes improving the range of temperatures of application. Coatings by wet impregnation or direct reaction in fibres proved to be difficult to control. On the other hand, acid reaction with gases possesses the potential of higher control of the thickness and distribution of the coating. Parameters such as temperature, flow rate, and concentration can be finely tuned to produce optimal results. In future steps, local heating will be supplied to accelerate the reaction and achieve local control of the thickness.</p><p id="Par51">The coating process applied to the metal fibres, either with our without binder, could be improved by a modification of the impregnation and crystallization processes. The crystallization process should happen inside the solution to avoid the influence of the surface tension of the liquid. The problem with that approach is, that the crystallization process is driven by the concentration of the solution (the coat starts forming when the solution saturates), which frequently lead to very thick coats. In order to allow the coating process to yield thinner coats, the concentration of the solution, at which it saturates, should be decreased by the use of lower temperatures. In that case the evaporation of the solvent has to be forced by the reduction of the pressure. The characterization of the thermal conductivity of the coated fibres shows a major increment as compared to the raw adsorbent. This feature, in combination with the characteristic porosity of these structures, evidences the capacity of metal fibres to increase the kinetics and efficiency of adsorbers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was funded by Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, Grant Number 03ET1451A &amp; 03ET1451C.
