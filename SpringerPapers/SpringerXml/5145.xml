And then the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each oneaccording to its kind. And God saw that it was good. A most favourite explanation of environmental interrelations was designed for university students by a contemporary school of soil science a few years ago. Biosphere atmosphere biosphere soil hydrosphere lithosphere Várallyay 2000 Spheric interactions is resulted by the mutual impacts of spheric interactions forming a holocoenosys. Atmosphere, hydrosphere, litosphere and biosphere itself manifest in a unique material called soil. Soil and plant interrelations are essential for studying any life phenomena. All ecosystems in the world are based on life cycles manifested in that. Plant life is determined by soil conditions and processes, however soil is also much influenced by plants. Soil-plant interrelations cover a wide range of bottom-up as well as top-down systems that may be synergistic, antagonistic, or coexistent. This conference is organized under the auspicies of three committees of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; the Crop Production Committee, the Plant Protection and the Soil Science and Agrochemistry Committee. The workshop is dedicated to the Alps-Adria movement providing a bridge to science and people of the region. The aim and scope of the conference is to overview research activities and experimental results in the field of soil-plant interrelations. The venue of the scientific workshop is located in a magnificent mountain resort village of the High Tatras in Stará Lesná. This area is of special interest regarding scientific value, land use properties, nature conservation and environmental protection. It is a typical region of touristic interest and a land of the famous Slovak hospitality. Stará Lesná, May 2008 Márton Jolánkai Alps Adria Scientific Board</p><p id="Pg2">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 3 EXTREME SOIL MOISTURE REGIME AS LIMITING FACTOR OF THE PLANTS’ WATER UPTAKE GYÖRGY VÁRALLYAY Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1022 Budapest, Herman Ottó St. 15. Hungary. E-mail: g.varallyay@rissac.hu Abstract: According to meteorological/hydrological/ecological forecasts the risk probability, frequency, duration and intensity of extreme environmental events and soil moisture situations will increase in the future. Hungary – as the deepest part of the hydrogeologically practically closed Carpathian Basin – is particularly sensitive and vulnerable against these stresses which may result in serious problems in the water (and nutrient) uptake of plants. Under such conditions the efficient use of soils as the largest potential natural water reservoir has special significance. Water stored in soil in plant available form may ensure the “normal” water (and water-soluble nutrient) supply of the natural vegetation and cultivated crops. Keywords: moisture regeime, extreme environmental factors, water storage, water uptake Introduction The natural conditions of the Carpathian Basin are generally favourable for rainfed biomass production. These conditions, however, show extremely high, irregular, consequently hardly predictable spatial and temporal variability, often extremes, and sensitively react to various natural or human-induced stresses (Várallyay, 2004, 2006a,c, 2007a,b,c): – soil degradation processes; – extreme moisture regime; – unfavourable changes in the biogeochemical cycles of elements, especially of plant nutrients and pollutants. Limited water resources, high variability According to environmental forecasts in future water will be the determining (hopefully not limiting) factor of food security and environmental safety. Consequently, the improvement of water use efficiency will be one of the key issues of the sustainability of agricultural production, rural development and environment protection (Pálfai, 2000; Somlyódy, 2000; Sutor and Gombos, 2006). Water resources are limited. The average 450–600 mm annual precipitation in Hungary shows extremely high, irregular and hardly predictable territorial and temporal variability – even at micro-scale. Under such conditions a considerable part of the precipitation is lost by surface runoff, downward filtration and evaporation. Annual precipitation will not be more in the future and its unfavourable spatial and time distribution will even be less favourable. The risk, probability, frequency, duration and intensity of extreme weather and hydrological events and moisture sitautions is expected to increase. The available quantity of surface waters (rivers) will not increase, particularly in the critical low-water periods. A considerable part of the subsurface waters cannot be used for irrigation because of their poor quality (salinity, alkalinity, sodicity). The negative annual water balance in the lowland (450–600 mm precipitation vs. 680– 720 mm potential evapotranspiration) is equilibrated by horizontal inflow (on the</p><p id="Pg3">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 4 surface as runoff, in the unsaturated zone as seepage; and in the saturated zone as groundwater flow), which leads to the accumulation of soluble constituents. In addition to the hardly predictable atmospheric precipitation pattern, the reasons of extreme soil moisture regime are (Várallyay, 2004, 2006a): – the heterogeneous microrelief of the „flat” lowland; – the highly variable, sometimes mosaic-like soil cover and the unfavourable physical and hydrophysical properties of some soils. Soil as the largest potential natural water reservoir Under the given environmental conditions it is an important fact that soil is the largest potential natural water reservoir (water storage capacity) of the Carpathian Basin, Hungary and the Hungarian Plains. The 0–100 cm soil layer may store about 25–30 km³ water, which is more than half of the average annual precipitation (500–600 mm ~ 50– 55 km³/year). About 50% of it is „available moisture content”. In many cases, however, this huge potential water storage capacity cannot be used because of four reasons: – it is not „empty”, it is filled up to a certain extent by a previous source of water (rain, melted snow, capillary transport from groundwater, irrigation etc.): „filled bottle effect”; – the infiltration of water into the soil is prevented by the frozen topsoil: „frozen bottle effect”; – the infiltration is prevented or reduced by a nearly impermeable soil layer on, or near to the soil surface: „closed bottle effect” (see cases in Fig. 1); – the water retention of soil is poor and the infiltrated water is not stored in the soil, but only percolates through the soil profile: „leaking bottle effect”. The schematic map of limited infiltration („closed bottle effect”) and low water retention („leaking bottle effect) is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Limitations in potential water storage capacity in Hungary</p><p id="Pg4">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 5 Hydrophysical properties of soils, limiting factors of the plants’ water uptake According to our comprehensive assessment 43% of Hungarian soils can be characterized by unfavourable, 26% by moderately (un)favourable and 31% by favourable moisture regime, as illustrated by Figure 2, indicating the main reasons of various moisture conditions, as well (Várallyay, 2004, 2007b). Figure 2 Distribution of soils according to their moisture regimes in Hungary. 1–5 = Soils with unfavourable hydrophysical properties (43%) due to: 1: very coarse texture (10.5%); 2: very heavy texture (11%); 3: strong salinity-alkalinity (10%); 4: waterlogging (3%); 5: shallow depth (8.5%); 6–8 = Soils with moderately unfavourable hydrophysical properties (26%) due to: 6: coarse texture (11%); 7: heavy texture or clay accu-mulation in the B-horizon (12%); 8: moderate salinity/ alkalinity in the deeper layers (3%); 9 = Soils with good hydrophysical properties (31%) The main soil factors limiting the water supply of plants are summarized in Figure 3 (Várallyay, 2004, 2005, 2007b,c). These are the reasons of the extreme moisture regime in the Carpathian Basin (especially in the Hungarian Plains): the hazard of floods, water-logging, or over-moistening and drought sensitivity, often simultaneously, in the same year, in the same place. Control of extreme sol moisture regime In site-specific, rational soil management soil moisture control for the risk reduction of extreme moisture situations has great significance. The two pillars of this: help water infiltration into the soil; help water storage within the soil in plant available form; drain the surplus amount of water from the soil profile and from the area (vertical and horizontal drainage). The main possibilities and methods of this moisture control can be found int he literature (Somlyódy, 2000; Várallyay, 2004, 2006c). Most of these „moisture management actions” are – at the same time – efficient environment control measures (Vágó et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2006b, 2007c). 1.

Hungary, e-mail: jolankai.marton@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: All ecosystems in the world are based on life cycles manifested in soil-plant interrelations. Plant life is determined by soil conditions and processes, however soil is also much influenced by plants. Soil-plant interrelations cover a wide range of bottom-up as well as top-down systems that may be synergistic, antagonistic, or coexistent. This paper summarizes principles of plant and soil interrelations; the processes and magnitude of some mutual impacts. Keywords: environment, soil, plant growth, Environment. Ecologically, the environment is the sum of all external conditions and influences affecting the life and development of organisms. Environment is usually considered abiotic and biotic. These divisions are artificial in the sense that neither can be separated when organisms are studied. Holocoenosys comprises environmental aspects and their influences on living organisms (Schulze and Mooney, 1993). The particular environment occupied by an organism or by groups and communities of organisms is the habitat. Environmental conditions generally exist in an area independently of the occurrence of any species of plant or animal that may depend on them, and area is used to express this concept. The whole system of interaction between a particular organism and its physical and biotic environment is the niche of the organism. The term indicates not only the habitat, or microenvironment, but also the activity of the organism. The environment of small areas in contrast to that of larger ones, or of particular organisms in contrast to generalized environments of communities, is recognized as the microenvironment. Other terms commonly applied to this concept, but much more restricted in scope, are microclimate and bioclimate. Soil is a most general example for holocoenosys. Soil formation. Soils are made up of mineral particles mixed with decomposed organic matter. The top soil consists of the mixture which is so vital for plant growth. Below the top soil is the sub-soil which is largely composed of mineral matter. In addition to the mineral and organic matter, called the soil solids, there are spaces between the soil particles which are taken up by water and air, and make up the non-solid part of the soil. Within a soil composition, the amount and proportion of certain constituents constantly vary. Soil solids consist of particles of various sizes. According to their size, they are called gravel, coarse and fine sand, silt and clay particles. The mineral material in all soils is derived from the parent material by the process of weathering, which breaks down rocks into smaller particles, by mechanical disintegration, and chemical decomposition. Soil functions and processes. The main soil functions (Várallyay, 2004; 2006) in the biosphere can be summarised as follows: – The soil is a conditionally renewable natural resource</p><p id="Pg7">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 8 – It acts as a reactor, transformer and integrator of the combined influences of other natural resources (solar radiation, atmosphere, surface and subsurface waters, biological resources) and is the site of “sphere interactions” – It provides a medium for biomass production and is the primary food-source of the biosphere – It stores heat, water, plant nutrients and – in some special cases – wastes – It is a high-capacity buffer medium, which may prevent or moderate the unfavourable consequences of various environmental stresses – It acts as a natural filter and detoxication system, which may protect the deeper geological formations and the subsurface waters from various pollutants – It represents a significant gene reservoir and is an important element in biodiversity – It is the conservator of natural and human heritages. Society has utilized these functions in different ways (rate, method, efficiency) throughout history, depending on the given natural conditions and socio-economic circumstances. The multifunctionality of soil is determined by the combined influences of soil properties, which are the results of soil processes (mass and energy regimes, abiotic and biotic transport and transformation, and their interactions) under the combined influences of soil-forming factors. Any soil-related human activity influences the soil through these processes. Plant life. A plant is a living organism without power of locomotion. Plants consist of different parts, each of which has a specialized function. The basic parts of a plant are the root system and the shoot system. Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil. The shoot system consists of the stem, the leaves, flowers and fruit. The stem transports water and minerals upwards to the leaves and flowers and organic materials down to the roots. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 viability % 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 moisture % te m pe ra tu re o C Figure 1. Soil physical impact on plant germination The process by which water and carbon dioxide are built up to form sugars and other carbohydrates is called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, oxygen is formed and</p><p id="Pg8">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 9 released into the air. Plant life is manifested in various physiological processes, most of which are soil dependent both being parts of a complex holocoenosys. Thus, any soilplant system is determined by their interrelations. Plant life is much influenced by soil conditions, properties and processes (Nagy et al 2006). Figure 1 shows a model of some soil characteristics that have an impact on plant growth, e.g. viability. Since life criteria depend on three basic thresholds: moisture, temperature and the presence of oxygen, soils as the fundamental habitat for any plant growth provide optimal, suboptimal and hyperoptimal conditions for that. The model support the evidence, that germination may be performed between 10 to 90 % of moisture range, regarding temperature within a range of 10 to 40 oC. However an optimum range of this phenomena is much narrower as indicated by the upper levels of the viability pyramid. Plant life on the other hand provides a basis for soil formation, secures the physical, chemical and biological state of the soil, contributes to the maintenance of soil fertility and the cultural state of that, and last but not least that may obstruct soil degradation processes. Figure 2. illustrates a schematic map of major means and regions of land degradation in Hungary. Figure 2. Types of land degradation in Hungary Plants, land use and cropping structure may promote or prevent means of soil degradation like erosion, textural deteriorations, waterlogging, acidity, salinity and alkalinity. Conclusions Harmonization between crop plant requirements and production site characteristics should be as follows.  Coordination of production site (Optimization of cropping structure)  Adaptation of crop plants to production site characteristics (breeding tasks)  Adaptation of production site to crop plants (agronomy, amelioration)</p><p id="Pg9">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 10 The ideal arable soil is defined by Kellogg (1957): The farmer makes his arable soil from a natural soil or old arable soil. He develops and maintains a deep rooting zone, easily penetrated by air, water, and roots. It holds water between rains, but allows the excess to pass through it. It has a balanced supply of nutrients. It neither washes away during rains nor blows away with high winds. The combination of practices to use depends on what is necesary to develop and maintain a soil as nearly as possible to the ideal on a sustained long-time basis. A modern assesment of Birkás et al (2007) reshaped the classical Plinius statement: “Nothing causes as much damage as does neglected arable land.”. According to that a soil is regarded to be in favourable condition when it is workable within a wide range of different moisture content levels, if it provides a reliable basis for crop production and its physical, chemical and biological features have no negative impacts on the environment. The condition of a soil is unfavourable when one or more of its physical properties or biological features qualify as environmental damage and successful crop production requires costly interventions. Finally considerations related to the society may have sever impact on plant and soil interrelations as well. Alps-Adria series have been discussing in details, that sustainable – or believed to be sustainable – systems may have diverse impacts on our environment. On one hand we do something good, on the other hand this may have negative side effects. Success has always been escorted by failures. There is an old proverb, a rudiment of wisdom, according to what “the road leading to the hell is often paved by goodwill”. Politicians label agriculture, as if it was some kind of hobby farming. Actually it is an economic necessity in most countries. Green movements often manipulate the public with arguments of no scientific value. Agriculture and environment are bound together. There are several problems in their interrelation, however these problems should never be placed in the field of politics. Cserháti (1901) has written, that crop production is not an empirical craftmanship, but rather an art based on a wide range of knowledge. Let us be keen on to encourage knowledgefarming versus ecoanarchism.

The share of organic farming has increased dynamically during the last two decades, as a result of the growing demand of the conscious consumer attitude. A few years ago the rate of growth has stopped, beside decreasing organic price premium, which sign that the market has been overstocked. The article analyses the change of market positions of organic products in relation to the rate of growth and share of market. It has been found that cereals and oil seeds have significant market share, but the rate of growth slows down. Because of the increasing demand for organic animal products the demand for organic forages has grown dinamically. Keywords: cereals, market share, rate of growth, BCG analysis, Pareto analysis Introduction The significance of organic farmlands can be evaluated in two ways: based on their ecological and their economic implications. Regarding the former, it does not make a crucial difference how the land is utilised specifically:  pasture and meadow,  arable land or plantation,  certified organic farmland, use not known. For an illustration, let us consider that in 2005, almost half of organic farmlands in the world were located in Australia, amounting to over 31 million hectares (Fig. 1). "Most of this area is pastoral land for low intensity grazing in Australia. Therefore, one organic hectare in Australia is not directly equivalent to one organic hectare in Denmark, for example, due to its level of productivity." (Yussefi, 2006.) As a result, it is worthwhile to survey the exact extent of the three categories of organic farmlands, and the production and market possibilities of different crops. Important factor of the organic production, that inputs is generally lower as industrylike production, so the yields of organic farming usually is lower as traditional ones. [Beke et al. 2006] At the same time the technologies and level of inputs of traditional land use and production significantly changes because of the adaptation of the new technological research results in the practice. (Jolánkai et al., 2006), (Szentpétery et al., 2005a), (Szentpétery et al., 2005b), (Takács-Gyögy, 2007), (Barkaszi – Takács-Gyögy 2007) As it would be an impossibly overwhelming task to conduct a worldwide data collection and analysis, partly due to the lack of accurate data, the present paper focuses on organic farmlands in Hungary. Materials and methods The necessary data regarding organic farmlands can be collected from the annual reports (2003-2006) of Biocontroll Hungária Public Company. Besides this certifying</p><p id="Pg11">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 12 agency, another company named Hungária Ökogarancia Public Company is also licensed to control organic farmlands; however, no data are available on the agricultural activities under their supervision. The results, however, are not expected to be distorted by this lack of data. For the analysis of the crop production sector, the available data were analysed using the accepted EU terminology, introduced in 2003. Besides calculating simple distribution data, the Pareto principle was also considered for drawing up a list of factors affecting land size. The BCG analysis was used to analyse product structure (Fig. 2). To make up the BCG analysis, market expansion was calculated as the average growth in the period 20032006; whereas market shares were taken from simple ratios based on data from 2006. - 2 000 000 4 000 000 6 000 000 8 000 000 10 000 000 12 000 000 14 000 000 hectares Africa North America Asia Latin-America Europe Australia, Oceania No information Permanent pastures Permanent crops Arable land Figure 1. Main land use categories by continents Source: Willer – Yussefi, 2006. For the analysis, initially two categories were distinguished: certified organic farmlands, and lands in transition. As no significant differences were detected, and production and marketing the products are not affected by the distinction, only aggregate data are presented and conclusions are based on results from both categories. Results and discussion Organic farmlands extended to 122,000 hectares in 2005, a decrease of 6,000 hectares compared to 2004. (Roszik, 2006) Applying the Pareto principle, it was found that the size of organic farmlands is 72% attributable to the land area of pastures, meadows and cereals, thus they factors constitute Category A. The sum of Category A factors plus the land area of fodder, industrial crops, ponds, forests, reeds account for 94% cumulatively, making up Category B. Other factors (fallow, orchards, berries, protein crops, vegetables, melons,</p><p id="Pg12">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 13 vineyards, seeds, plantations, potatoes) are in Category C, as they do not have a significant impact on organic farmland area. Since about half the organic farmlands in Hungary is taken up by meadows and pastures, only these two make it to the Category A in the Pareto analysis. In the next step, it is necessary to examine how livestock numbers are related to land area. According to our calculations, the registered number of animals in 2005 needed 8,000 hectares of grazing land, although in the same year, over 65,000 hectares of land were registered as organic meadows and pastures. This simple calculation demonstrates that the vast majority of the available meadows and pastures is not used in agricultural production. For economic considerations, only organic land area actually used for production is relevant; therefore, in the next step of the calculations, areas of ponds, forests, reeds, fallows, meadows and pastures were deducted from the total organic farmland area. The results are summarised in Fig. 2. Category A is mainly made up of cereals and fodders. The latter is a surprise because organic farmers often complain that there is no balance between organic crop production and livestock farming, which is contrary to our findings.

The results of the BCG analysis (own calculations) With the help of the BCG analysis, the following categories were set up:  "Question marks" are relatively new products with low market share and the potential for rapid growth. Their market positions can be strengthened and they may become "stars" if they receive sufficient support; our calculations show that this could be the case for vineyards (grapes), medical and culinary plants (herbs, spices), seeds, rye.  "Stars" have the best market positions with high ratios and expansion, and impact the near future the most. Heavy support is recommended as they have the potential to become "cash cows". At the moment, it is a significant fact</p><p id="Pg13">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 14 reflecting the situation of organic farming that mass rapeseeds, fodders and other cereals are in this category.  At present, the "cash cow" category contains autumn wheat, some cereals, sunflower seeds and some fodders, all with high market share. However, there is no potential for further increase, as there is no extra demand for these products on the market (i.e. common wheat and spelt, oats, barley, sunflower). However, further support helps them to maintain their market positions.  "Dogs" are products with inadequate market share and potential for growth. However, contrary to traditional marketing strategy, this does not mean that steps should be taken to liquidate them, because they have a key role in the strict system of rotation of crops, and no organic farming is possible without them. Crops in this category include fresh vegetables, soybean, potatoes. Conclusions Category A crops, as resulting from the Pareto analysis, influence organic farmland area significantly. Their expansion and maintenance contributes the most to reducing the environmental load, in other words, to the ecological aims of organic farming. On the other hand, the BCG analysis yielded information that could be useful in determining possible market positions in the future. However, it must always be kept in mind that merely market needs should never be the main reason for changing the range of products and extent of organic production. The preconditions for certification prescribe a strict system of crop rotation, which does not necessarily coincide with market needs: this limitation poses a barrier to the dynamic expansion of organic farming as it renders production inflexible.

H-2103; e-mail: Birkas.Marta@mkk.szie.hu 2 Agroszen Kft. Tápiószele Abstract: Our objectives were to assess and rank 3 soil condition variants – root zone improving (RI), mulch leaving (ML) and minimum disturbing (MD) – suitability to soil quality improvement and demonstrate the plant responses to different soil state and find a possible relation between soil condition and plant growth under extreme climate. To rank the soil-plant interrelations twelve soil and plant factors were assessed; quality and depth of loosening state, surface protection by plants and stubble residues, soil aggregation, earthworm number, water supply in the root zone, tillage-induced C-flux, rooting depth of plants, yield, dry biomass and biomass recycling. Finally, seven fundamental requirements were selected to mitigate climate-stress and to improve plant resistance to the heat damage. A climate damage mitigation soil tillage strategy can establish a harmony between soil conservation and the demands of crop production. Keywords: soil condition, root zone, mulch, drought, climate-stress, mitigation Introduction The studied problems in a soil quality and climate trial due to consequences of climate change are rather timely, considering quality and depth of loosening state of soils, surface protection maintenance by stubble residues, promoting soil aggregation and earthworm activity, water conservation in and out of growing and tillage season, managing the tillage-induced C-flux by C-conservation tillage. Measurement and evaluation of climate-stress improving soil quality factors are interests in the practice. The farming loss rising from soil state in an extreme climate are really undervalued while the plant requirements have often been overestimated and the consequences had been decreasing effects on yield stability (Szabó and Pepó, 2007). While close correlation is found between soil quality deterioration and climatic damages (e.g. waterlogging, severe drought) the authors are induced to elaborate variable and effectual mitigation technique in due time (Jug et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2007). By now, a problem of the global climate change, and the importance of the adaptability call attention to develop the classical soil tillage and plant production goals. Materials and methods A field experiment was initiated in 2002, in the district of Hatvan (47º41,’N and 19º36’E) arranged in a randomized strip design. The dominant soil is loam, a Calcic Chernozem formed on loess. The trial included six methods of tillage management (Birkás et al., 2006), and from these three soil condition variants were grouped, namely root zone improving (RI), mulch-leaving (ML) and minimum disturbing (MD). Evaluation factors of the soil condition were: quality of loosening, surface conservation, aggregation, water supply, earthworm number, and C-flux. In the first year (2002) the OM content of soil was 2.79 % at the depth of 0-40 cm. It has increased to 3.27 % during years due to carbon conservation land use. In the crop sequence cash crops (w. wheat, pea, maize) and mulch plants (mustard, rye, pea, phacelia) were grown. Both</p><p id="Pg15">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 16 tillage and crop sequence are subordinated to carbon conservation. To evaluate soilplant interactions a conventional (rooting depth, yield, dry biomass) and a specific (plant sensitivity, actual biomass and carbon recycling) scale were applied. Methods of the measurement and evaluation corresponded to the accepted standards (Jug et al., 2006, Jolánkai et al., 2006, Sabo et al. 2007, Tóth et al., 2005, Tóth and Koós, 2006). In the micro region the annual rainfall fluctuated between 442 and 705 mm with extremes in distribution (three of six years were dry). Our primary objective is to assess and rank soil condition variants regarding twelve qualification factors, while the secondary aim comprises ranking of the soil-plant interrelations in the given climatic conditions. Results and discussion Soil state suitability under extreme climate. Soil looseness was improved annually to the depth of tillage however it has inevitably deteriorated below the disturbed layer. According to results elaborated earlier (Birkás et al., 2006; Bencsik et al., 2007) an adequate loosen state requires in the whole root zone (Table 1). From variants only RI met the demands, while the loosen state at ML and MD were behind in optimum. The second factor in climate stress mitigation is the soil surface protection both in and out of the growing season. In average of 6 years, cover % of the cash crops depended significantly (LSD5%: 2,012) on soil condition, that is 78 (RI)&gt;73 (ML)&gt;69 (MD). Both plant density at RI and the old stubble residues at ML and MD decreased the risk of silting and crusting. Cover % of residues after cash crops scored of 25-50% in any soil state variant. Mulch plants, utilized after-effect of the root zone improving (RI), covered the surface well (95%) and protected effectively. Table 1. Soil condition ranking regarding to twelve qualification factors Rank of realization Factors Optimum state 1. 2. 3. Quality and depth of soil loosening state 80 – 90 % to 40 cm RI ML MD Surface cover (cash crops) % 75 - 85 (mulch plants) % 85 – 95 RI ML MD Surface cover (stubbles) % 35 – 50 ML MD RI Aggregate (0,25-10mm) ratio %  80 MD ML RI Earthworm number pc m -2 (0-20 cm) 10 – 15 ML MD RI Water supply (0-60 cm) Units: 50-100 90 - 100 RI ML MD C-flux (kg ha -1 year -1 ) &lt; 75 – 100 MD ML RI Root occurrence (%) in and out of loosen layer 75 – 80/20 – 25 RI ML MD Yield level (high, medium, poor) high RI ML MD Dry biomass (t ha -1 year -1 ) 13 – 1 5 RI ML MD C-recycling (t ha -1 year -1 ) 4 – 6 RI ML MD Plant sensitivity to climate-stress; Units: 55-100 86 – 100 RI ML MD Continuity of surface protection is proved by progress of the aggregation, that is ratio of soil particles of 0,25-10mm. Aggregates has been significantly increased in both variants to the 5th year due to structure protection land use. The trend is modified under wide-row maize in the 6th year at RI variant, as aggregate ratio declined slightly with 2,2%, however at ML and MD variants it did not occur. The earthworm activity was poorer in dry years (&lt;10 pc m-2) in any soil state, however they were active during an extreme year (2007), except July. In this case earthworms preferred MD variant,</p><p id="Pg16">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 17 contrary to the preceding years. Role of the surface cover is really proved in water conservation (Bencsik et al, 2007; Várallyay, 2007). Data of the deeper layers of soil can be studied from Farkas et al. (e.g. 2007). In our work water content of the root zone was assessed that is level of water supply to a depth of 0-60 cm. For evaluation moisture level units were composed from the optimal to the unfavourable state (Table 1). The basis, namely soil water content of 21%, w/w, is considered as best level for aggregation, earthworm activity, residue decomposition and soil workability. In the spring soil was wet at RI however in summer ML was favourable regarding uptake of cash and cover plants. The soil disturbed minimally (MD), owing to other important factors could not be ranked into climate-stress mitigation variants. A new factor for soil state ranking is tillage-induced C-flux, which fell into the field of sight for the reason of the global climate change (Tóth et al., 2005, Tóth and Koós, 2006). The fact that C-flux of the soil disturbed deeply is really high has convincingly been proven (e.g. La Scala et al., 2006). In our case the C-release was highest (Figure 1) following primary tillage at RI variant (50-60 kg ha-1 day-1), however this value is really moderated comparing to the soil ploughed deeply without surface levelling. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 RI ML MD C -f lu x k g h a -1 d a y -1 Stubble (cover%&lt;15%) Stubble (cover%&gt;35%) Primary tillage Seedbed Plants Mulch-planting We found that rata of Cflux is usually modified by stubble residues decomposition process in soils. Another influencing factor is water content of soil i.e. higher C-release can be measured from the disturbed, dry soil. A relative low C-flux was measured at ML variant (12-20 kg ha-1 day-1), and this value can be not more than half at MD variant (Figure 1) Figure 1. C-flux from soil at different condition (2002-2007) Soil-plant interrelations in the given climatic conditions Assessing subsoil condition can be used the rooting depth of the plants and their growth in the soil (cf. horizontally growth above pan-layer). Cash crops took roots well in soil loosened to a depth of 40 cm (RI), and about 6% of roots penetrated down to the tilled layer. A larger ratio (75-80%) of the roots similarly occurred in the tilled layer at ML variant however rate of the remainder penetrated to the deeper layers. An analogous occurrence was stated at MD whereas 70% of the roots localized at the depth of upper 20 cm. Both deeply (RI) and moderately (ML, MD) loosen state covered the demand of mulch plants, except phacelia which showed higher sensitivity to MD variant. The yield of plants is a classic indicator for soil state qualification. Among soil condition the yield was numerically in order: MD&lt;ML&lt;RI indicating poor, medium and high yields. Rank of dry biomass (t ha-1) recycled into the soil were RI (91)&gt; ML (80) &gt; MD (59) during 6</p><p id="Pg17">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 18 years. Since approximately 40% of residues is carbon (La Scala et al. 2006), for this reason 36-32-24 t ha-1 carbon has been recycled by biomass. Rank is inverted regarding to C-flux (Figure 1); rata of the release is significantly lowest from soil disturbed mildly (ML) and minimally (MD). Plant responses to climate-stress (withering) were assessed in warm and hot days using a scale developed to the estimation (Table 1). Rank of the soil state variants regarding to plant sensitivity to drought stress is as follows: RI&gt;ML&gt;MD. A medium level of the stress mitigation at ML has to be taken into consideration for future. Since MD applications have not resulted in climate-stress mitigation soil quality during 6 years, it may be upgraded in the next 6 ones. Conclusions Our results clearly indicated that each soil state variant may improve, or maintain soil quality; however their adaptability to climate-stress mitigation is presumably different. For mitigation of plant sensitivity to climate-stress the following application are required: 1) Apply an adequate loosen state in the whole root zone to promote plant resistance to heat-stress. 2) Surface protection during and out of the growing season. 3) Protection and improvement of soil aggregation process. 4) Maintaining a favourable habitat for earthworms – it is similarly suitable to cash and cover plants. 5) Creating soil condition adaptable to water conservation – assure enough water to dry growing season. 6) Creating C-conserving soil condition by primary and secondary tillage – water retaining capacity of OM is superior to clay minerals. 7) Utilizing plant biomass rationally – recycle those to improve soil carbon status.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 19 ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF CHEMICAL REDUCTION ON FARMING: ROLE OF PRECISION FARMING – WILL THE PRODUCTION STRUCTURE CHANGE? Katalin TAKÁCS-GYÖRGY Department of Farm Management, Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, Szent István University, H-2103 Gödöllő, Páter K. u. 1., takacsne.gyorgy.katalin@gtk.szie.hu Abstract: Precision farming – besides other aspects – enables the reduction of use of chemical substances in crop production while decreases farming risks, contributes to specific field-cropplant applications, makes production processes more plannable and increases profitability. The latter, however, can be realised on farm level only under well-determined economic conditions. The objective of the study is to examine the optimal farming size of crop producing farms, when the development of own precision farming equipment is managable and the farm can become self-financing with different production structure. The study also makes recommendations for forms of co-operation. In addition to application of hired machine work, the machine clubs, machine co-operatives can offer solutions for small-scale farms, so that similarly to precision crop production they can apply the same environmentally friendly and efficient technology in economic sense. Keywords: precision farming, field-cropplant applications, viable size, production structure Introduction During the recent decades, new directions have appeared in the agricultural production of developed countries which moved farming towards reduced chemical use. These include the following:  reduction of plant protection chemical use in general (long-lasting, curing agents) with which less treatments are needed during vegetation. The reduction of active ingredient doses results that the quantity of agent per area unit is dropped.;  chemical-free (banning the use of artificial chemicals) trends (types of organic farming), or total banning of chemical use for the sake of environmental safety. The extension of this trend slowed down in 2005, the primary reason for which was the decreasing bonification following the market saturation processes. This resulted a drop – stoppage - of producers’ income. (Willer - Yuseffi, 2006; Takács, 2007);  implementation of integrated crop production systems that is reasonable farm management (Integrated Pesticide Management);  precision farming – which enables targeted agent spraying via spot treatments – results rational chemical use besides – or instead of – chemical reduction. Precision nutrient supply with appropriate technical background has become general practice by now. (Csathó et al., 2007) Precision fertilizing has proved its cost efficiency, while the cost reducing impact of precision crop protection has been less examined by researchers. Besides the reduction of number and extension of treatments, however, the proper selection of dosage depending on soil features would further reduce the agent quantity sprayed. (Wiles, 2004). At the same time, precision crop protection may serve value production purposes, public welfare services, preservation of biodiversity and the protection of nature and the Earth. It requires from the farmer, however, to create appropriate technical background (additional investments) and the maintenance of the available technique which means extra costs (extra costs of extra investment, technology and quality assurance). An analysis, based on years of data collection, carried out in Denmark, stated that on the level of national economy, the 33% decrease</p><p id="Pg19">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 20 of chemical application level in the past decade did not reduce significantly the income level of farmers. Income supplements for producers were not necessary. (Ørum et al., 2001) Based on data from North-America Lowenberg-DeBoer (1996) put down that less than half of farms that switched to precision crop production could obtain surplus income compared to conventional farms, in an area where basically the large-scale technology was general in the last decade. Precision farming can meet both requirements: it can be a tool of reducing chemical use and profitable farming at the same time. It is necessary to examine the economic aspects of this new technology, regarding the consequences of turning to a new farming strategy that could reduce chemical use and environmental pollution at the same time (Swinton, 2005; Wiles, 2004; Kis, 2006) Under the economic conditions of Hungary, payback on the investment on precision farming can be ensured in case of at least 250-280 ha field crop production cultivated with this technology. (Takácsné György - Kis, 2007; Székely - Kovács, 2006). On the basis of economic statistical data this group involve approximately 10% of producers. Those farmers, who deal with crop production on smaller scale, the machinery rings or joint machine co-operatives can offer solution in addition to hired machine work. The virtual large-scale farm – from 3000 ha to even 20-30 thousand hectare farms e.g. in Germany – covered with one machine club implements high-level exploitation of highquality technology, developed with big investments.(Takács, 2000; Kovács et al., 2003; Baranyai – Takács, 2007 Thus the machinery ring reduces the cultivation cost per area unit and increases the individual income of the producer. Materials and methods Based on our former model calculations, during the research the model was updated and cost-margin analysis was made in order to show how the viable size – covering the simple capital replacement, too – is modified by the introduction of precision farming with average crop production structure. (Kis – Takács-György, 2005) Upon the calculation of investment costs it was presumed that the required machinery is developed parallel with the introduction of the new farming strategy (technology) and the purchase of basic instruments is not delayed, therefore only the extra investment costs were defined on the basis of Hungarian distributors’ data of 2006. Thus the extra investment need of a farm having the basic equipment (including corn harvesting machine) is 22.000 EUR. Production costs include costs corrected with income expectations from the invested assets. The produced crops are as follows: 30% winter wheat (61 ha; 5.15 t/ha) – where precision crop protection is not significant – 15% sunflower (31 ha; 2.49 t/ha), 35% maize (72 ha; 7.35 t/ha) – in case of these latter ones, significant cost savings can be calculated due to precision crop protecion – and 20% alfalfa (41 ha) which is utilised within the farm so it was not taken into account upon calculating the viable farm size. The crop yield was calculated on the basis of average Hungarian yield data of test farms in 2006. In the calculations, the material cost saving of precision farming was 10%, the cultivation cost was higher by 5%, and the yield was higher by 10%. The model was built under Hungarian conditions, calculating the costs on price level of 2006.</p><p id="Pg20">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 21 Results and discussion In case of applying precision crop protection, the calculations help to determine the income per unit in connection with production size, compared to the income of conventional farming (it was integrated crop production in this model). The introduction of precision farming technology will reach positive gross margin at 55-60-hectare size of precision crop fields – but it does not mean positive revenue for the farm –, that was about 12000 HUF/ha in winter wheat not taking into consideration the subsidies in 2006 on the base of data FADN farms.

In the examined case, at least 206 hectares – involved in precision farming – is required for crop production in order to realise the same income as in case of production without extra investments, considering also the costs of necessary extra investment for the given year, presuming that the other factors are the same. It means that this type of farming can be viable for medium-size farms. (Kis – Takács, 2005; Kis 2007) Others should find some ways of co-operation – common machinery use, machine lending, machine leasing – that can help to avoid significant extra investment. Figure 1. Viable size determination in case of precision vs conventional farming Source: own calcultaitons The calculations proved that the reduction of cereals (sowing area) by 40% (31 ha) and the extension of sunflower branch by 50% (27 ha) would increase the income only by 3 %. When the maize branch is increased by the above degree at the expense of winter wheat, the farm-level income grows by 4%. When the proportion of the two widespaced crops is increased to the same degree, the income growth is 4 %, too. When winter wheat is not included in the optimum production structure made with linear programming, the farm income was higher by 11% than the income with the initial structure. If the changes of production structure is examined, it can be stated that the increased proportion of wide-spaced crops increases the total income on enterprise level. In other words it means that farms applying precision crop protection can reach surplus income with low production proportion of cereals.</p><p id="Pg21">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 22 Conclusions The investment in technical background required for the introduction of precision crop production can be a rational economic decision but only with a certain farm size and production structure. Based on own equipment system – under Hungarian conditions – it means 220-250 hectare size. The implementation of precision crop protection is reasonable only in wide-spaced cultures. Payback on complementary equipment can be expected when these crops are in higher proportion in the production structure of the above-sized farm. Shift of smaller farms to precision farming is possible if they apply the technology as a hired service, or the investment is made in the frames of joint machine utilization, like machinery rings.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 23 NON-CHEMICAL CONTROL – EFFECTIVE AND ECOLOGICALY ACCEPTABLE APPROACH OF POTATO CYST NEMATODE CONTROL Dinka GRUBIŠIĆ – Tanja GOTLIN ČULJAK – Siniša JELOVČAN Department for Agricultural zoology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska cesta 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: djelinic@agr.hr Abstract: The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a major world crop the yield of which greatly depends on growing management strategies but also on many pests, including quarantine potato cyst nematodes (PCN) Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber, 1923) Behrens, 1975 and Globodera pallida (Stone, 1973) Behrens, 1975. The integrated management strategies in the control of PCN involve the cultivation of resistant potato cultivars, trap cropping, crop rotation and use of nematicides - which should be applied only if necessary, because of their cost, toxicity and/or other drawbacks. In order to define the efficacy of non-chemical treatments in control of PCN in infested potato fields, two field trials were conducted in 2002 and 2003. Prior to planting and at potato harvest, the fields were examined for the presence of PCN by soil sampling, followed by extraction of cysts by Spears's flotation technique and determination of cyst viability. The efficacy of treatments in field trials was determined by Henderson - Tilton and was analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT, P&lt;0.05). Resistant cultivars tested were Agria, Camilla, Colette, Fianna, Laura, Marabel, Romula and Vineta. In 2002, the high efficacy (84.00-94.75%) in control of the initial PCN population was recorded at all resistant cultivars, except for the cultivar Agria (54.33%). In 2003, the efficacy of resistant cultivars in the control of G. rostochiensis was 80.25-95.67%, in the case of trap cropping it was 85.00% and of crop rotation 91.25%. Because of high results in the control of G. rostochiensis, obtained by tested non-chemical control measures, the use of nematicides should be applied only if necessary. Potato yields of resistant cultivars varied considerably, 9.03–22.16 t ha -1 in 2002 and 6.55-11.48 t ha -1 in 2003, which could be attributed to their different tolerances to the parasitism of G. rostochiensis. In order to choose more suitable resistant cultivars, considering the initial population of PCN in infested fields, and to avoid the use of nematicides for ensuring satisfactory yields, such investigations should be continued. Keywords: Solanum tuberosum, potato, Globodera rostochiensis, PCN, non-chemical control, resistant cultivars, trap cropping, crop rotation Introduction The potato (S. tuberosum) is a major world crop and thus for the sake of higher potato yields and better tuber composition, it has been the subject of many investigations (Szalóki-Zima and Szalóki, 2006; Pepó et al., 2006) including those conducted for the optimisation of fertilization (Poljak et al., 2007) and the use of irrigation (Doležal et al., 2007). Potato yield is also related to the presence of potato pests and pathogens, including nematodes. In the fauna of soil nematodes, plant-parasitic nematodes, including potato cyst nematodes (PCN) - specialist parasites of this crop, can be detected (Brmež et al., 2007). The quarantine species the golden potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis is one of the most troublesome pests of potatoes worldwide, causing yield reduction from 80 to 100%, inspite of fertilization, irrigation or other cultural measures. PCN reduce the size of root systems so that the volume of soil plants are able to exploit, and therefore the available reservoirs of water and nutrients, are decreased (Turner and Evans, 1998). This species was discovered in Croatian for the first time in 2001, and since than G. rostochiensis has been detected in four Croatian counties (Grubišić et al., 2007). Integrated management strategies, neglected until 2001, have now been implemented and will prevent the build-up of infestation and replace the previous practices of monoculture, the use of short rotations and the cultivation of susceptible cultivars. In integrated PCN control, growing resistant potato cultivars can</p><p id="Pg23">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 24 decrease soil infestation by at least 80%, trap cropping by up to 80%, crop rotation by at least 20-49%, while few effective nematicides are used commercially, because of their cost, toxicity and/or other drawbacks (Whitehead and Turner, 1998). In field experiments, conducted in 2002 and 2003, the efficacy of non-chemical measures, including the growing of resistant cultivars, trap cropping and crop rotation in the control of G. rostochiensis were investigated. Materials and methods Two experiments in fields infested with G. rostochiensis (pathotype Ro1) were established in 2002 and 2003 in the locality of Belica (Međimurska County). In field trials eight resistant and two susceptible potato cultivars (Table 1) were mechanically planted on April 17th 2002 and April 18th 2003. In 2003, the efficacy of trap cropping (plots sown with the cultivar Desiree) and crop rotation (plots previously sown with wheat) in the control of G. rostochiensis was also investigated. For the trap cropping method, emerged potato plants were desiccated with herbicide (a.i. glyphosat) six weeks after planting (Whitehead and Turner, 1998). Fresh tuber yield was determined by harvesting on October 10th 2002 and October 15th 2003. Experimental plots 2.60 x 8.00 m size (4 replications per treatment) were organized in randomized block design. Initial (Pi) and final population (Pf) of G. rostochiensis were determined after soil sampling (50 cores with a semi-cylindrical sampling tool per experimental plot) and extraction of cysts (from 100 ml of air-dried soil sub-samples) by Spears's flotation method (Spears, 1968) prior to planting and at harvest. Cyst were crushed in Huijsman's homogenizer (s'Jacob and v. Bezooijen, 1984) and their vitalities were determined. The efficacy of treatments were assessed by Henderson-Tilton. All data were subjected to ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT, P&lt;0.05). Results and discussion In 2002, the influence of both resistant and susceptible potato cultivars on the initial population of G. rostochiensis was investigated. The cultivar Kondor multiplied the initial population for 3.33 times, while resistant cultivars decreased the initial population, with different degrees of efficacy (Table 1). The lowest efficacy in the control of G. rostochiensis was attained with the treatment of Agria (54.33%), which was subjected to the lowest initial population of nematodes. Given a low population of nematodes, plants may develop greater roots and finally produce even more tubers (Turner et al., 1998). In these conditions the mentioned cultivar could achieve the highest potato yield (Table 1). The other resistant cultivars reached 84.00-94.75% efficacy in control of G. rostochiensis, which is comparable with literature data (Whitehead and Turner, 1998). Yields of other resistant and susceptible cultivars are statistically different (Table 1), which could be caused by different tolerance of cultivars to nematode parasitism, but also by their different suitability for growing in the area of the locality of Belica. In 2003, the high efficacy of resistant potato cultivars, but also of trap cropping and crop rotation in control of G. rostochiensis was determined (Table 1). The susceptible</p><p id="Pg24">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 25 cultivar Desiree multiplied the population of PCN 3.19 times. The treatments trap cropping and crop rotation decreased the initial population by 85.00 and 91.25%, which is, in case of trap cropping, comparable with literature data (Whitehead and Turner, 1998). The efficacy of crop rotation is much higher than in the literature (Whitehead and Turner, 1998). The obtained results could be higher because in some cases densitydependent or age-dependent decline has been reported: in the case of heavy infestation or new eggs, the population can decline faster initially than in later years (Whithead et al., 1980). Potato yields were significantly different (Table 1). Significantly the highest yields were determined with the cultivars Romula (resistant cultivar) and Desiree (susceptible cultivar). This indicates the great tolerance of Desiree to parasitism by G. rostochiensis and to dryness of soil. Differences between the yields of other resistant cultivars are due to their different tolerances to parasitism by G. rostochiensis and/or their different suitability for cultivation in the area of the locality of Belica. Potato yields were also affected by drought in 2003 and were lower than usual in the same potato production area. Table 1.

A high efficacy of resistant potato cultivars, 54.33-94.75% in the control of G. rostochiensis was recorded in 2002. Potato yields varied greatly from 9.03 to 22.16 t ha-1. Significantly the highest yield was obtained with the resistant cultivar Agria, which was exposed to the lowest initial population of G. rostochiensis. In 2003 resistant cultivars of potato attained 80.25-</p><p id="Pg25">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 26 95.67% efficacy in the control of G. rostochiensis. The other non-chemical control measures, trap cropping and crop rotation (with wheat) showed an efficacy of 85.00% and 91.25%, respectively. Very high efficacy of crop rotation may be due to heavy infestation (72.39 eggs g–1 soil) and new eggs in soil. Tuber yields of all cultivars in trial determinated 6.55-11.48 t ha-1. High tuber yield of the susceptible cultivar Desiree indicates the great tolerance of this susceptible potato cultivar to G. rostochiensis and the good response to dryness of soil. The potato cultivar Agria, in spite of its resistance to G. rostochiensis, when exposed to high population of nematodes, obtained low yield, which could indicate its low tolerance to parasitism by G. rostochiensis. Such investigations are of great importance and should be continued, in order to obviate the use of nematicides to protect resistant cultivars with low tolerance to PCN and to achieve higher potato yields in infested areas. Non-chemical control measures of PCN, with a high efficacy in the decline of the initial population of nematodes in infested fields, should be properly applied and combined, so the use of nematicides will not be necessary.

(HOMOPTERA: APHIDIDAE) IN WHEAT AND ITS ROLE AS BARLEY YELLOW DWARF VIRUS VECTORS Tanja GOTLIN ČULJAK – Dinka GRUBIŠIĆ – Siniša JELOVČAN 1 Department for Agricultural Zoology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska cesta 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: tgotlin@agr.hr Abstract: Wheat is a most important crop without which human nutrition is unimaginable. Along with fertiliser, variety and other cultivation elements an important role in the amount of the yield is played by pests, above all by aphids, which reduce the quality of the grain and also transmit BYDV. The most dangerous barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) vector in Croatia is the species Rhopalosiphum padi (L.). Research was carried out from 1996 to 2003 with the use of a Rothamsted suction trap (RST) located in Zagreb. The results obtained show that the species R. padi is the dominant species during the aphid remigration (autumnal) flight when its share in the total aphid population comes sometimes to more than 18%. Then it is at its most dangerous for the transmission of the virus to the just-sprouted winter wheat crop. Since the species flies at maximum daily temperatures of below 10 ºC, or mean daily temperatures of 5 ºC, it is necessary to shift the dates of the sowing, to monitor flight activities and abundance and carry out chemical control of the vector in autumn if the R. padi population is large. Keywords: wheat, Rhopalosiphum padi, Rothamsted suction trap (RST), barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), abundance Introduction Wheat is an important source of staple food and has a major role at human nutrition and it is essential to know the relationships between yield and its components in wheat breeding programms. Numerous scientists deal with, for instance, research into the different cultivars of wheat and their qualities (Butta, 2007), the dependence of wheat yield on mineral fertiliser (Bertić et al., 2007; Varga et al., 2007), draw up ecologicaleconomic analyses of climatic changes on the whole of the nutrient system (Dobó et al., 2006) and study the main elements of sustainable agriculture (Husti, 2006). As well as these elements, pests, particularly aphids, have an important role in the amount of the yield.They reduce the quality of the wheat used in the baking industry (the ratio of gliadin/glutenin is very different in aphid-infested and non-infested wheat) (Basky et al., 2007). In addition, aphids are the most important virus vectors. In the Republic of Croatia, the species Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) is the most important vector of BYDV. It appears in autumn at low temperatures when it is also most dangerous for the recently sprouted wheat crops with respect to the transmission of this virus (Igrc Barcic and Gotlin Čuljak, 2003). The aim of the study was to establish the damage caused by and the population level of R. padi in wheat in Croatia. Materials and methods In the 7 years of the investigation (1996 – 2003), the population dynamics and flight activity of the bird cherry-oat aphid were investigated with the use of a Rothamsted suction trap (RST) located in Zagreb. The RST is 12.2 m high, and its suction capacity is 43 000 m3. Samples are taken each day, the aphids are isolated and placed in a test tube with alcohol, and determined according to recognised keys (Blackman and Eastop,</p><p id="Pg27">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 28 1984, 2000). The periods in which the flight of the aphids were monitored are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 30 The R. padi population amounted from 1.3% (in 2003) to 18.4% (in 1996) of the total aphid population. The first catch in all years of investigation in the RST was recorded in the period May 03 – 15. The maximum flight, in all years of investigation, was observed during the aphid remigration flight (in autumn), in the period from September 15 to October 15. The last catch in the RST was recorded in the 3rd decade of October and in the 1st or 2nd decade of November. The last catches of the species R. padi overlap with the last catches of aphids in the total population and are recorded when the average daily temperatures are from 5 to 10 ºC, or when the maximum daily temperature has fallen below 10 to 15 ºC. If we analyse the figure of the dynamics of the catch of the species R. padi we will notice that in our area a very high autumn maximum is recorded in all years of the research, that is, the species is abundant during the aphid remigration flight with a maximum flight in the first decade of October, with some minor deviations brought about by weather conditions, particularly temperature. The species R. padi is the most dangerous vector of the cereal virus barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which is transmitted in autumn onto winter crops that have just sprouted. It is at this time that the species is most abundant, and hence it represents a very dangerous threat to the cultivation of winter cereals, the more so that its flight is recorded at maximum daily temperatures of lower than 10 ºC. In Croatia, during 2002, faunistic research into cereal aphids showed a very high correlation between the catch of aphids in yellow traps during 2001 and the outbreak of BYDV during 2002 in the whole of Slavonia, which brought about a reduction in wheat yield of up to 20% (Igrc Barčić and Gotlin Čuljak, 2003), while damage in 2007 to some crops were even considerably more. Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the help of Irena Dušak and Damir Bertić for sampling of aphids. Conclusions The bird cherry-oat aphid is a very important pest in Croatia where winter wheat are much more affected than spring cereals. The species is dominant during the remigration flight (in autumn), which is the most dangerous period for BYDV transmission. References Basky, Z. – Harrington, R.: 2000.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 31 INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT OF CEUTORHYNCHUS SPECIES (COLEOPTERA: CURCULIONIDAE) IN OILSEED RAPE Siniša JELOVČAN – Tanja GOTLIN ČULJAK – Dinka GRUBIŠIĆ Department for Agricultural Zoology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: jelovcan@agr.hr Abstract: In Croatia, oilseed rape is cultivated on about 15 000 ha. Because of the production of biofuels the area of land devoted to rape will rise to as much as 100 000 ha. An increase in the area will lead to an increase in the number and the abundance of pests. The most significant oilseed rape pest is Meligethes aeneus Fabricius, 1775 which can reduce yields by up to 50 %. In the spring, however, damage is caused by Ceutorhynchus napi Gyllenhal, 1837 and Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus Marsham, 1802 the larvae of which drill mines in the stalks, the plants in consequence lagging in growth and development. Research into stem mining weevils on oilseed rape has in recent times, as well as with yellow traps, also been conducted with sticky traps. During 2007 the density of stem mining pests in oilseed rape was carried out at three sites in the inland part of Croatia with the use of yellow sticky traps and yellow water traps. On the basis of the size of the population of adult individuals, a detailed survey of oilseed rape plants was carried out, the objective being to ascertain the intensity of the stem-mining weevil infection. Keywords: oilseed rape, population density, Ceutorhynchus napi, Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus Introduction In Croatian about 15 000 ha of land are sown with oilseed rape, but the trend anticipated is up to 100 000 because of the production of biofuel (biodisel). In the last few years research has been carried out in many European countries aimed at producing bioethanol as a replacement for fossil fuels (Sipos et al., 2007; Voća et al., 2007). The greatest problems concerned with yield reduction in rape arise from pests. In spring, damage is caused by the stem weevils (C. napi and C. pallidactylus) which also significantly reduce the yield (Marczali et al., 2006; Marczali et al., 2007). These weevils come earlier than the pollen beetle, lay eggs in the stalks and veins of the leaves, whence the larvae move into the stem. By drilling the stem they prevent sap circulation and the plants are underdeveloped, while the stems crack and become deformed (Maceljski and Jelovčan, 2007). Danon et al. (1985) in Croatia determined the critical numbers for C. napi and C. pallidactylus. For C. napi the critical number is considered a catch of 10 to 20 adult weevils in a yellow water trap caught during several consecutive days and/or when an infection of more than one weevil to five plants is established and/or if there are signs of ovipositioning on over 20% of the plants. For the species C. pallidactylus the decision threshold is considered to be a catch of 10 to 20 adult individuals in a yellow trap during eight days. Investigation of stem weevil density on oilseed rape has in recent times been carried out with yellow sticky traps (Jelovčan et al., 2007). When the presence of adult individuals is determined, a detailed survey of plants of oilseed rape is carried out in order to determine the intensity of the infection with C. napi and C. pallidactylus larvae. Materials and methods Research into population density of oilseed rape pests was carried out in 2007 at three sites in the inland part of Croatia: Županja, Velika Trnovitica, and Gornje Bazje. At each site, yellow sticky traps 24 x 17 cm in size were used, and yellow water traps 21</p><p id="Pg31">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 32 cm in diameter and nine cm deep. The yellow sticky traps were placed on wooden sticks, and the yellow pots were placed on metal holders. In each pot, 1.5 l of water and two or three drops of detergent were placed. The trial plot, 2000 m2 in area, was located in a larger plot of about 10 ha. Four sticky and four water traps were placed on the plot, and these were changed every seven days during the period from March 7 to June 6. The sticky traps were placed vertically according to the growth of the plant, so that the lower part of the sticky trap was always immediately above the top of the plant. The pot traps were also raised according to the growth of the oilseed rape, and the top of the pot was at the level of the terminal part of the plant. The determination of the beetles was carried out according to the literature keys (Alford, 2003). During 2007 research into the intensity of infection was carried out at the same sites in Croatia. The rape plants were chosen at random and were in a phonological phase on the BBCH scale of 76 to 78 (Weber and Bleiholder, 1990; Lancashire et al., 1991). Lifting of the plants at the Županja site was carried out on May 8, at the Velika Trnovitica site on May 9 and at the Gornje Bazje site on May 14. At each site, 10 plants were lifted in three replications. The plants were examined in detail and dissection was carried out. The examination revealed the percentage of damaged plants, the number of entry and exit perforations (holes), the number of mines in each damaged plant, and the total number of larvae in the sample. On the basis of the data obtained, the intensity of the infection was calculated on the basis of number of larvae, mines and perforations per plant (Hadžistević, 1983): Intensity of infection = [Y x Z]: 100 n where Y = percentage of infected plants Z = total number of larvae found (perforations or mines) in the sample n – number of plants with larvae (perforations or mines) in the sample. Results and discussion The results for the density of the population of the species C. napi on the yellow sticky traps are shown in Figure 1, and in the yellow water traps in Figure 2. The results for the density of population of the species C. pallidactylus on the yellow sticky traps are shown in Figure 3, and in the yellow water traps in Figure 4. The results for the infection intensity with larvae of the species C. napi and C. pallidactylus are shown in Table 1. In the Županja site, with the use of sticky traps on March 22, 10 adult weevils were caught, and in the yellow pots just one weevil, while at Velika Trnovitica on May 21, 12 weevils were found on the sticky traps, while not a single weevil was found in the yellow water traps. At the Gornje Bazje site, the yellow sticky traps caught 12 C. napi weevils on April 6, and there were the same number in the pots. The catch of C. pallidactylus on yellow sticky traps at the Županja site ranged from two to a maximum of 226 adult individuals (April 11), and in the yellow pots from one to 39 weevils, while at the Velika Trnovitica site the number of weevils ranged between one to a maximum of 57 individuals (April 4) on sticky traps and in the yellow pots three weevils were determined (April 11). At the Gornje Bazje site the number of individuals of C.</p><p id="Pg32">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 33 pallidactylus ranged between two and 87 (on June 1), with 52 caught on April 13, the maximum population of C. pallidactylus recorded, while in the yellow water traps at most four weevils were caught (on March 9). Although for C. napi and C. pallidactylus there are critical numbers, which relate to the catch in the yellow pot (10 to 20 weevils in a pot during a few days) our preliminary research suggested that a far greater catch of this pest is recorded on sticky traps. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 n u m b e r o f a d u lt s 10 week 11week 12 week 13 week 14 week 15 week 16 week 17 week 18 week 19 week 20 week 21 week 22 week 23 week Zupanja V.

C. pallidactylus in the yellow water traps On the basis of the maximum catch of C. napi and C. pallidactylus on the yellow sticky traps at the Zupanja site, 27 days after the greatest density of population, the oilseed rape plants were examined and an average infection of 5.2 larvae per plant was determined, with a mine length of 51.7 cm, and 8.46 perforations per plant. At the Velika Trnovitica site, 35 days after the maximum appearance of C. pallidactylus on the yellow sticky traps oilseed rape plants were inspected and an infection of 2.4 larvae per plant with a length of mine of 15.8 cm and 2.33 perforations per plant were recorded, while at the Gornje Bazje site, 31 days after the first maximum flight of C. pallidactylus an average infection of 2.66 larvae per plant with a mine length of 21.75 cm and 1.46 perforations per plant were recorded. Table 1 shows that the intensity of infection as compared with the number of larvae of stem mining weevils was not significantly different, while the number of mines and perforations at the Zupanja site did significantly differ from those at the Velika Trnovitica and Gornje Bazje sites.</p><p id="Pg33">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Data obtained concerning the populations of C. napi and C. pallidactylus the intensity of the infection of oilseed rape plants are the first results about adversity of this species in Croatia, which point at great need for their timely control followed after forecast by investigated methods.

Fauna investigation was carried out by branch beating method during 2006 and 2007. The aim of investigation was to prove a connection between plant structure in green cover and insect structure depending on diet behaviour. Positive influence of green cover on soil structure, nutritive richness of soil and soil moisture regime are known. A negative impact of green cover might be in the insect structure like vector-appearance of phytoplasmas. Keywords: green cover, ecological infrastructure, insect complex, vineyard Introduction In the history of agriculture there has been discovered a poor management of monoculture production. The first problem with resistant pests and disease species was in large orchards and vineyards. Main reason was in low biodiversity. Investigation of the food chain management has an important role in sustainable agriculture. In the agro-ecosystem, especially in monoculture, sustainability does not work because of a low number of species with high population (Diercks, 1983). Biodiversity has an important role in sustainable agriculture (Husti, 2006). Ecologically safer agriculture implies integrated food production aimed at enhancing biodiversity. Interaction between soil, plants and insects has become an important subject of investigation. The connection between safe-food, soil, agriculture implies a food chain (Várallyay, 2006) in that soil and bears an important role. In integrated viticulture the transformation of monocultures into more complex agro-ecosystems is made possible by a green-cover strategy (Boller and all, 2004). The green manure application research was conducted in many countries. The establishment of a green cover requires an additional nitrogen input (Csaba and all,2006). Investigation of green cover impact in vineyards on soil quality and nutritive effect in Croatia was carried out by Karoglan-Kontić, 1999. Materials and methods The investigation was carried out in an experimental vineyard in Zagreb owned by the Faculty of Agriculture. In one part of the vineyard (about 3 ha) a green cover was built in with mixed plants: Agrostis alba, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Lotus cornuculatus, Trifolium repens. The other part of vineyard had open soil. In the fauna research a branch beating method was used once per month during two years of research. Identification of sampled insects was made in a laboratory using determination keys. The aim of the research was to determine a number of insect species on green cover and open soil in the vineyard and a structure of insects depending on diet behaviour.</p><p id="Pg35">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 36 Results and discussion Fauna investigation showed that the vineyard with green cover was richer and had better insect structure in both years of research. In 2006 by a branch beating method more insect species were collected in the green cover area (18 different species) than in the open soil area (13 species). Depending on a diet behaviour, in the green cover area there were 9 antagonist species, 8 species of plant feeders and one indifferent (neutral). Phytophage species were feeders on cereal (bugs from Lygaeidae family and the leafhopper from Cicadellidae). This is because of a grass-legume mixture used as a green cover. In the open soil area there were only 5 antagonist and 8 phytophage species (regular vineyard pests). Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 39 THE IMPACT ON LAND USE OF BIOFUEL PRODUCTION Béla MARKÓ1 – József POPP2 1 Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest 2 Research Institute for Agricultural Economics, Budapest Abstract: Producing fuel from agricultural crops has already raised questions about the impacts on the supply of food and land. What has received less attention is the shift that would result in the location of feedstock and fuel production. Energy demand and land productivity are somewhat asymmetrical. To date, this asymmetry has not mattered greatly as the consumption of biofuels has been insignificant compared to fossil fuels. Most countries have been able to supply their markets with domestically produced biofuels; importing biofuel for transportation use has been minimal. However, as demand increases and as developing countries identify a market in which they may have a comparative advantage, international trade in biofuels may become more commonplace. While developing countries thus arguably have a comparative advantage, there are also concerns that increased production of feedstocks and biofuels in these countries might contribute to increased food insecurity and prove environmentally disruptive. Keywords: biofuel production, land use, environmental effects, climate change, EU. Introduction The idea that producing biofuels at home will reduce a country’s dependence on foreign sources of energy, particularly oil from the Middle East, it has also helped increase the political popularity of biofuels. Security of supply is perhaps the main goal of energy policy often expressed in terms of minimizing risk of interruptions in supplies. Basically, all else equal, governments want to keep prices of energy low, minimize volatility and reduce the environmental impact of energy. The accelerated growth in ethanol and biodiesel production is causing a transition in global agriculture from its traditional role as a producer of food and fiber to a producer of these products as well as a substantial producer of motor fuel. This transition is creating one of the most rapid and farreaching changes in agriculture ever experienced. It has very significant implications for land use and environmental issues. Biofuel programs create an additional demand on the limited supply of global cropland (Wisner, 2007). Cropland availability will set a very modest upper limit on the size of the global renewable fuels industry unless economical technology emerges soon that will allow large volume production of ethanol from cellulose. This report focuses on the biofuel production as it relates to competition for cropland and to environmental effects. Materials and methods Estimating or even calculating the environmental impacts linked to the biomass production phase on the field is very difficult because agri-environmental effects are very context and location specific. Their impact will depend on the current land use they are replacing and on the environmental vulnerability (to soil erosion or nutrient leaching) of the specific location within the change is taking place (Várallyay, 2007). Detailed spatial data would therefore be required which are generally difficult to obtain and process with reasonable resource investment. However, at member states level it could be possible to build on general knowledge of the agriculture – environment interaction (modelling) for estimating the likely impact of different land use changes due to the introduction of energy crops.</p><p id="Pg39">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 40 A possible model framework should include the effect of competition between bioenergy and food production for domestic food supply. Results and discussion The impact on land use Energy demand and land productivity are somewhat asymmetrical. Developed countries import most of their fossil fuel. While their demand for biofuels is therefore rising, the same industrialized countries do not have sufficient land availability to entirely meet that demand with domestic production; even if they could, this would not necessarily constitute the most cost-efficient or environmentally sustainable approach. The most ideal land for sugarcane and oil palm trees, currently the most energy efficient biofuel feedstocks, is primarily located in developing countries in tropical and sub-tropical climates. In addition to having land more suitable to efficient biofuel feedstocks, these countries also have longer growing seasons and lower labor costs than developed countries. EU The increasing demand for first and second generation biofuel would affect land use in the EU in different ways. Biofuel demand adds another outlet to the food and feed production of agriculture. The impact of 10% minimum requirement (10% biofuel in fossil fuel) in 2020 on land use in the EU will not be modest. About 15%-20% of arable land would be used for the production of biofuel feedstocks. The main source of adding production potential would be the obligatory set aside, which is used as a supply control instrument requiring farmers to idle land in order to restrict production (European Commission, 2007). The CAP reform of 1992 introduced a mandatory set-aside to regulate food markets, but enabled farmers to produce energy crops on their set-aside land. However, these energy crops did not cover the whole set-aside land (the biofuel objectives used to be small). In the fraction of land where no energy crops were produced, biodiversity benefited from the fallowing of the land and proliferated. But the provision of the 2003 CAP reform says that once market opportunities arise farmers could use set aside land to grow non-food commodities, i.e. first and second generation biofuel feedstock. Environmental effects A primary concern is the potential for biofuels to accelerate climate change, rather than to combat it. Production involves considerable emission of greenhouse gases from soils, carbon sink destruction and fossil fuel inputs and is already causing significant deforestation and destruction of biodiversity. Monoculture expansion is, on many occasions, directly related to increased land conflicts. Biofuel production increases the pressure to convert extensive, low input farming into intensive production of biofuel, with crops such as cereals, oilseeds and sugarbeet (Németh, 2006). Supplying feedstock requirements of biofuel production will almost certainly require major changes in cropping patterns in agriculture. A small part of the needed increase in feedstock production is likely to come from higher production per hectare, but much of it will need to come from increased planted area. Promoters of biofuel expansion claim that yields must be increased by using more fertilizers and irrigation. Irrigation depletes lakes, rivers and aquifers while fertilizers cause an increased burden of nitrates in soil and water, with impacts such as</p><p id="Pg40">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 41 eutrophication – a major threat to fish stocks. Herbicide tolerant GE crops facilitate the use of aerial spraying of herbicides with serious effects on biodiversity and small-scale farming. Effects on soil fertility depend on production method and fertiliser use, as for any crop. If good practices are used biofuel feedstock production can maintain or even improve soil fertility, including on marginal land, but in other cases the nutrient balance or soil structure may be undermined. Biofuel feedstocks, particularly those grown in plantations, require pest management, but the extent to which pesticides damage human health and have unwanted effects on biodiversity will depend on the genetic qualities of the feedstock, as well as on the type, intensity and scale of pest management applied (Jolánkai et al., 2006). Different feedstocks have different requirements with respect to water use and may require irrigation or the use of relatively large amounts of water in situations of water scarcity. Therefore potential environmental effects from widespread production of biofuels may require further research and new technology to prevent negative impacts. More research is needed on the long-term effects of monoculture agriculture such as continuous corn on soil erosion, and the impact of sharply increased fertilizer use on nitrogen and phosphorous content in streams and rivers. Another potential area of research where questions are being raised by some soil scientists is the long-term impact on soil organic matter from continuously removing large amounts of plant residue over a long period of years. EU This section addresses the issue of the enforcement of environmental policies in agriculture, in the context of an increased production of energy crops. We focus on the limits of the existing instrument (environmental cross-compliance) in the new biofuel framework. In the EU, the single farm payment (which decoupled support from production) was introduced with the CAP mid-term reform of 2002-2003, together with provisions for cross-compliance. The decoupled payment might be partially or totally withdrawn from the farmer, should some infringement be uncovered when controls are carried out. Two effects are likely to occur with the development of biofuels. On the one hand, the incentives to evade the environmental cross-compliance policy will increase with the high level of feedstock prices. It is central to find what kind of protection could be set up in order to temper the evolution of the production of energy crops towards more intensive practices. The success of an environmental policy hinges upon the effectiveness of the associated control scheme. Climate change Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere are leading to potentially irreversible climate change. Transport fuel consumption will increase faster than the amount of fossil fuels which can be replaced by biofuels. Another concern is that the production of biofuels requires large inputs of fossil fuels – in fertilizer production, refineries and agricultural machinery and for transport – which is rarely considered in calculating emissions savings. There is strong evidence that any emission savings from reduced fossil fuel combustion are almost undone by far greater emissions from deforestation, peat drainage and burning, other land use change, soil carbon losses and nitrous oxide emissions. A shift in temperature zones caused by climate change could seriously affect</p><p id="Pg41">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 42 biodiversity. Changes in precipitation and more irregular precipitation will mean that water resources in many regions are depleted. As far as Europe is concerned, Southern Europe and the European Arctic are considered to be the most vulnerable regions (Avis et al., 2003). Conclusion There are a lot of controversies regarding the energy, environmental and economic balances of biofuel production. The outbreak of biofuels might deeply alter agricultural and environmental policies. However, the question of the regulation of agricultural and environmental policies must still be addressed, with even greater emphasis. On the one hand, energy demand and land productivity are somewhat asymmetrical. On the other, the environmental issue will need to be considered more closely, as the energy crops are bound to be produced in a very intensive manner in order to reach the prominent objectives of the biofuel policies. In respect of soils and water, the expansion of crops for biofuels can actually have negative effects. Already, rapid growth in demand for biofuel feedstocks is changing cropping patterns.

Maize was grown for 4-year period 2003-2006. Precipitation and temperature regimes were resposible for considerable differences of maize yield among years. For example, under drought stress of 2003 annualy yield was from 21 to 45% lower than annualy yields for remaining three years. In general, applied fertilization resulted by significant but moderate yield increases for 14% (2003: PK- treatment), 7% (2004: K-treatment), and up to 16% (2005 and 2006: PK and P-3, respectively). K fertilization resulted by decrease of leaf Mg for third part compared to the control. However, for the applied fertilization and the control nutritional status of maize (leaf and grain P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn) remained in normal ranges. Keywords: ameliorative fertilization, maize, nutritional status, phosphorus, potassium, yield Introduction Soil degradation processes became serious environmental problem (Varallyay, 2006). Kadar (2007) reported about sustainability of soil nutrient levels, while Pepo (2007) and Nagy (2007) emphased role of fertilization and genotype in sustainable field crop growing. Low plant available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels are in place limiting factor of the field crop yields in Croatia (Petošić et al., 2003; Kovačević et al., 2005. Application of the higher P and K rates could be solution for better efficiency of soil (Kovačević et al., 2006; Lončarić et al., 2005; Banaj et al., 2006; Rastija et al., 2006). Aim of this study was 4-year testing of maize response to P and K fertilization. Material and methods The field experiment, soil and weather characteristics The field experiment with three ameliorative rates of P (kg P2O5 ha -1: 250 = P1, 500 = P2 and 750 = P3), rate of K (500 kg K2O/ha = K2) and their combination (P2K2: 500 kg both P2O5 and K2O ha -1) was conducted on soil of moderate fertility (Maslenjaca, Bjelovar-Bilogora County) in spring of 2003. Standard fertilization (kg ha-1: 160 N + 125 P2O5+ 125 K2O) used as the control treatment. P was added as MAP (monoammonium-phosphate 12% N and 52% P2O5) and K in KCl form (60% K2O). Nitrogen was equalized for all treatments with addition of CAN (calcium ammonium nitrate: 27% N). For the next three years (2003-2006), residual effects were tested and the trial was fertilized in level of the control. The field trial was conducted by randomized block design in four replicates. Gross of the basic plot was 92.2 m2. Maize (OsSK552 hybrid) was sown at beginning of May by pneumatic sowing machine on theoretical (planned) plant densities (TPD: depended on the year, between 51948 and 62111 plants ha-1 - Table 3). Maize was harvested manually (4 internal rows from each basic plot) in the second half of October. Mass of cob was weighed by Kern electronic</p><p id="Pg43">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 44 balance (d=200 g). Ten cobs from each treatments was used for determination of grain moisture and grain share in cob (waiging by Kern electronic balance, d = 100g). Grain moisture was determined by electronic grain moisture instrument (WILE-55, Agroelectronics, Finland). Yield were calculated on 14% grain moisture basis. The Maslenjaca soil is favourable for field crops growth regarding soil reaction (pH) and humus contents, but moderately supplied with plant available P and K (Table 1). Table 1.

Precipitation for 4- month period (May-August) was 155 mm or only 50% compared to the LTM. At the same time, air-temperatures were for 3.5 oC higher (Table 2). Under these conditions plant density reduction and low grain yields were found (Table 3). However, the remaining three years were favourable for maize. In general, low maize yields are in connection with drought and the higher air-temperatures, especially in July and August (Josipovic et al., 2005). Sampling and analyses of plant and soil samples from the experimental field The ear-leaf at flowering (middle of July 2004 and 2005: 25 leaves in the mean sample) and grain at maturity (five cobs in mean sample) were taken for chemical analysis. Soil sampling (depth 0-30 cm) was made at start of the experiment. Mobile fractions of elements in soil were extracted by the AL-method and NH4-Acetate + EDTA (Lakanen-Ervio, 1971). The total amounts of P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn in maize leaves and grain were determined using ICP after their microwave digestion by conc. HNO3+H2O2.

Cereal Research Communications 46 resulted by decrease of leaf Mg for 22 % compared to the control. However, for the applied treatments nutritional status of maize remained in normal ranges (Table 4). This finding could be used as explanation for moderate response of maize to the fertilization. However, low levels of P and K were found by the soil testing. For this reason, in question is scientific application of AL-method in interpretation of soil nutritional status for investigated soil. Loncaric et al. (2005) reported similar observation in 2-year study of application ameliorative P and K rates. Also, Rastija et al. (2006) applied four rates of NPK 10:30:20 up to 3748 kg ha-1 for maize – soybean rotation. Yield increases were up to 14% and up to 32%, for maize and soybean, respectively. Banaj et al. (2006) used three P2O5 rates up to 2000 kg ha -1 and tested response of maize for three-year period. As in our study, the growing season was the most influencing factor of yield. Conclusion In general, in our study yield differences of maize among the years were greater than among ameliorative P and K fertilizations. Water deficit and the higher air-temperatures are responsible for the lower maize yields under our environmental conditions. Nutritional status of maize regarding contents of P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn was in adequate ranges for the applied fertilizations. References Banaj D., Kovačević V., Šimić D., Šeput M., Stojić B.: 2006.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 47 EFFECT OF GRAPEVINE SOLARIZATION ON THE ANTHOCYANINS COMPOSITION OF PINOT NOIR WINES Bernard KOZINA – Marko KAROGLAN. – Ana JEROMEL – Luna MASLOV Department of Viticulture and Enology, Faculty of Agronomy, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: bkozina60@yahoo.com Abstract: The main purpose of grapevine solarization technique is reflection of sunlight into the grapes, and therefore changes in light spectrum and temperature can be noticed. Effect of solarization on the anthocyanin content in Pinot noir wines, was investigated in 2004, 2005 and 2006 year. A HPLC procedure was used for the analysis of anthocyanins. Solarization technique caused higher anthocyanins content in all three investigated years. The strongest solarization effect was observed in 2004 year which can be seen through higher content of 3-O-glucosides of delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin and specially malvidin. Keywords: solarization, Pinot noir, anthocyanins Introduction Sunlight is important for the development of quality grapes, through its effect on photosynthesis and on the induction of pathways leading to secondary metabolites such as polyphenols, flavonoids and stilbenes. One of the technique, which can be used in the vineyard to improve grape quality is solarisation of vines by use of the reflective cover, a solar matting placed directly on the ground under the vine rows (50 cm on each side) during the grape maturation period (Robin et al. 2000). The anthocyanins that are extracted from the skins of grapes during crushing, pressing and fermentation are the major components responsible for red wine colour. In addition to their direct role on colour, anthocyanins also contribute to the taste and chemical characteristics of wine because of their interactions with other molecules (Mazza et al., 1999). Anthocyanins have been identified as chemical markers for differentiating red grape cultivars and red wines made from different cultivars (Revilla et al., 2001). The free anthocyanins in wine are mono- or di-glucosides of five anthocyanidins, namely delphinidine, cyanidine, petunidine and malvidine. Wide range of environmental and management factors such as climate, soil condition, solar radiation can affect the anthocyanins concentration in red wine grapes. Significant differences in anthocyanins concentration between sun exposed and shaded clusters of Cabernet Sauvignon were found by Crippen and Morrison (1986) and in Pinot Noir by Price et al. (1995). The objective of this investigation was to determine differences in anthocyanins composition in Pinot Noir wines produced from grapes subjected to solarisation technique. Materials and methods In this study Vitexsol a solar matting produced by Capatex is used. It is placed directly on the soil under the vine rows (50 cm on each side) during the grape maturation period to improve the ripening of grapes. Winemaking Pinot noir red wines made from grapes harvested in 2004, 2005 and 2006 year, were used in this study. For the winemaking a lot of 100 kg of grapes of each treatment (control, solarisation) was de-stemmed, crushed and fermented in 100 l stainless-steel tanks. During a 14 day fermentation period with Saccharomyces cerevisiae</p><p id="Pg47">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 48 (commercial yeast) the cap was punched down and mixed twice a day. At the end of alcoholic fermentation wines were racked, transfered to 50 l glass bottles and sulfited to the final concentration of 40 mg l-1 free sulfur dioxide, and the samples for chemical analyses were taken, while the rest was stored in celler conditions. Chemical analysis Basic chemical analyses of must (sugar and total acidity) were done using methods proposed by O.I.V. (2001). Anthocyanin analysis Solvents used for chromatography were acetonitrile of HPLC ultra gradient grade supplied by Mallinckordt Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands) and deionised water. Chemicals used for adjusting the pH of mobile phase were 85 % H3PO4 of analytical grade and KH2PO4 for preparation of pH standard buffer solutions supplied by Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Standard substances of cyanidin-3-glucoside, paeonidin-3glucoside and malvidin-3-glucoside were also delivered by Fluka. Ethanol of Kemika (Zagreb, Croatia) was used for preparing standard solutions. Samples and mobile phases were filtrated by membrane filters, 0,45 -µm pore size delivered by Phenomenex (USA). The equipment used in this work was an Agilent model HP 1100 binary gradient HPLC, equipped with an automatic sampling system. Chemstation software was used for data storage and integration. The separation was performed using Zorbax SB-C18 (4.6 x 150 mm, 3.5 µm) associated with a Zorbax SB-C18 analytical guard column (4.6 x 12.5 mm, 5 µm). The following mobile phases were used: 10 mM KH2PO4 + H3PO4 to pH 1.6, solvent A: buffer, solvent B acetonitrile-buffer (50:50). The oven temperature was 50 ˚C. Gradient elution was applied at 1 ml min-1 flow rate according to the following program: linear gradient from 10 % B to 45 % B in 30 min, from 45 % B to 100 % B in 1 min, 100 % B for 3 min, from 100 % B to 10 % B in 1 min, 10 % B for 10 min. Samples (20 µl) were injected, UV-Vis detection was applied at 518 nm. The wine samples, standard solutions and mobile phases were filtered by 0.45 µm pore size membrane filter. The linearity was investigated for malvidin -3-glucoside in the range of 25 – 200 mg l-1 at seven concentration levels. The standard solutions were prepared by weighing the standards with a Sartorius CP 225D micobalance and dissolving in 12 % ethanolic solution at pH 3. Results and discussion In Table 1. sugar and total acidity concentrations, at harvest time, of control grapes and grapes subjected to solarisation technique are reported. In all three investigated years solarisation grapes had higher sugar content compared to not solarisation ones (control) especially in the year 2004 and 2006. These results are in accordance with data published by Capatex (Vitexsol producer) saying that solar matting use can increase the sugar content by 1-3% (Capatex Ltd). Five years investigation with Syrah grapes also showed that use of solar matting allowed the reflection of a minimum of 20% of the incident solar radiation towards the lower parts of vine canopy. Such a reflection provokes a significant modification in temperature values of berries and grape clusters up to 1,5-2,0 °C.

In table 2. initial results are reported about individual anthocyanin content in the control Pinot noir wines and Pinot noir wines made from grapes subjected to solarisation technique. Solarisation technique positively influenced the composition of analysed Pinot noir individual anthocyanins in all three investigated years. All of the samples exhibited malvidin-3monoglucoside as the major compound what is in accordance with previous works (de Villiers et al., 2004). The amounts of malvidin-3-monoglucoside measured in 50 different French red wines range from 91-382 mg l-1, (mean value 164 mg l-1) while in German red wines Netzel et al. (2003) have found much higher values ranging from 257-504 mg l-1 (mean value 403 mg l-1). In our case the concentrations were relatively high, except in the year 2006. No acetyl or coumaryl anthocyanins forms were found what is in accordance with investigations by Burns et al. 2000. Table 1.

Technical progress – as part of technical development – increased the efficiency of production, thus the demand on labour decreased. As a consequence, the role of agricultural crop production in employment significantly decreased – even in the – labour-intensive branches. Based on FADN database, the article examines the changes of labour utilization and labour efficiency in field crop production after 1989 in the countries of the European Union. The main statement is that the labour capacity decreased by about two million people while the output increased, which resulted the growth of labour efficiency. This could not be realised, however, without the increase of production potential of biological basis, fertilizers, plant protection chemicals and mechanization. Keywords: technology, technical development, machinery, partial efficiency, FADN Introduction The development of agricultural production in the 20th century was significantly quicker than in the previous times. Man had had passive role in plant-soil relation system for a long time but from the 18th century significant research work started with the aim of increasing agricultural yield. The development of rational crop rotation was followed by crop breeding, artificial crop nutrition and, last but not least, crop protection. Due to technical progress, steam-engines appeared besides draught force in the 19th century, then the internal combustion engines at the beginning of the 20th century. In the 20th century the whole process had accelerated: agricultural practice had expanded besides the development of the biological basis, chemicalization and mechanization. All these were defined in the concept of technical development by the European agricultural economists in 1955, in Helsinki. (Husti, 2003) The content of conceptual definition of technical development has been constantly developing and widening. Nowadays – due to the general technical and social progress – the above factors should be completed with further items, most significantly with information (Késmárki, Galli, 2006; Husti, 2006) Sustainable agricultural production requires new production methods and technologies, the key element of which is mechanization. (Birkás et al., 2007; Magó, 2006; Várallyay, 2007) Measuring the effect of technical development is a complex task, because it includes the changes occurring in the function of time. It is a general requirement towards technical development that it should increase output; its structure should change in positive direction and decrease the production costs. (Andrássy, 1998) The interrelation of these two factors determines the efficiency. The technological efficiency (relationship between yield and expenditure) and the economic efficiency (proportion of production value and production cost) should be distinguished. (Nemessályi Zs., Nemessályi Á., 2003)</p><p id="Pg51">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 52 One of the most widespread ways of analysing the efficiency of technical development is the calculation of partial efficiency, where the change of productivity (y·L-1) is determined in the function of labour productivity and capital productivity: as the multiplication product of technical equipment (K·L-1) and capital efficiency (y·K-1). y means yields (incomes) (EUR), L is labour (person), K is capital (assets) (EUR). The inter-company or international comparison of this index points out how the productivity differences can lead back to the differences of capital productivity and capital supply (capital per head) (Késmárki, Galli, 2006) The effect of technical development has significantly decreased the labour need of agricultural production (by more than 2 million people in the EU-15), and thus increased the productivity of labour. The released labour force went first to the processing industry and later to the tertiary sector. The aim of the research is to examine the changes of labour productivity and the partial efficiency in the last one and a half decade in the former 15 member countries of the European Union and – out of the countries integrating in 2004 – primarily in Hungary, in the field crop production. Materials and methods Secondary data were used for the examination: the data were from the Eurostat, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office and FADN database of the European Union. The examined period was from 1989 to 2005. Data were available for 15 countries until 2003, then for 21 countries from 2004, arranged according to economic size unit (ESU) (into 6 groups namely: (1) 0 - &lt;4 ESU, (2) 4 - &lt;8 ESU, (3) 8 - &lt;16 ESU, (4) 16 - &lt;40 ESU, (5) 40 - &lt;100 ESU, (6) &gt;= 100 ESU). Out of the 152 standard variables the following variables were used for the research: average labour use (person), average utilised area (ha), gross production value (EUR) and invested machine equipment (EUR). The secondary values in the database give the average value of farms which meet the given requirements. Data of the EEC-12 are available for the whole time interval, thus the examination of time series was made for them. The examinations were made with univariate statistical methods (average, dispersion, relative dispersion calculation) and the graphical boxplot based on them. Productivity in the examination meant the output (product quantity, production value) made with the resource unit (labour, machine assets) used in the production. In order to analyse partial efficiency, the changes of technical equipment (machine assets value per one labour unit: K·L-1 (EUR·AWU-1)) and capital efficiency (production value produced with one unit of machine assets value: y·K-1 (EUR·EUR-1)) were calculated for the EU-12/15/25 countries. AWU means annual working unit. Grouping on the basis of relative deviation from the average of the variables (X, Y) was used for the evaluation of the outcomes of the examination, according to the following relation:           Y Yy X Xx yxP ii )( ; )( ),( Due to the article’s size limits, the results are demonstrated only for the countries taking decisive part in the agricultural output of the Union.

The share of Hungary was 1.4% in spite of the fact, that its proportion from the agricultural area is 3.6% and from the agricultural labour use is 4.6%. Results and discussion The examination has proved that the productivity of labour increases significantly by the increasing of economic farm size (Figure 1). The primary reason for this is the difference in technical supply, because the difference in capital efficiency between size groups is mostly not significant. The comparison of member countries shows (Figure 2) that labour productivity is significantly lower in the Southern-European countries and the technical supply is not significantly different. 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Figure 1.

Most of the newly integrated countries have lower technical supply and the equipment is used at below-average level. The labour productivity of field crop production – mechanized at typically high level – increases significantly with the farm size. This justifies the necessity of farm concentration and indicates that the process will go on in the branches involved in mass production.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia, jasenka.cosic@pfos.hr 2 Agricultural Institute Osijek, Juzno predgradje 17, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Isolations of Fusarium species were made from the 1954 residues of wheat, barley, maize and common weed species (Abutilon theophrasti, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Amaranthus retroflexus and Sorghum halepense) during an eleven-year period (1996-2006) from eleven locations in eastern Croatia. Nine Fusarium species were isolated from residues of cultivated plants and four Fusarium species from residues of weed plants. Keywords: cultivated plants, Fusarium, residues, weeds Introduction Fusarium species have a cosmopolitan distribution in soils and on organic substrates.In order to reduce the risk of an epidemic of Fusarium diseases we must reduce the quantity of inoculum. All Fusarium species that infect small grain cereals and maize can survive saprophytically on plant debris. That debris are very important source of Fusarium inoculum and other soilborne pathogens that infect cultivated plants. Applied agrotechniques, growing resistant cultivars and use of fungicides or biological antagonists have a significant effect on severity of soilborne diseases and yield quantity and quality (Husti 2006; Drezner et al. 2007; Pepo et al. 2007; Vrandecic et al. 2007). The main objectives of our study were to isolate and determine Fusarium species from plant debris and test their pathogenicity to wheat seedlings. Materials and methods Wheat, barley, maize and weeds residues (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. - annual ragweed, Amaranthus retroflexus L. - redroot pigweed, Abutilon theophrasti Med. - velvetleaf and Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. – Johnsongrass) were collected during an eleven-year period (1996-2006) in eleven sites (Bizovac, Brijest, Cacinci, Cepin, Karanac, Knezevi Vinogradi, Osijek, Pozega, Sopot, Valpovo, Zupanja) of eastern Croatia. Plant debris were sampled in November, January and April. Collected plant debris (roots and stems/stalks) were washed for 30 minutes in running water. For each plant debris, 5 pieces (1,5 cm in lenght) were cut. Pieces were surface sterilized in 96% ethanol for 60 sec, rinsed in distilled water, dried on filter paper and placed on potato-dextrose agar (PDA). Petri dishes were kept in thermostat at 20±1ºC with 12 h light/dark regime. After 5 days they were examined with stereomicroscope. Parts of developed mycelium with and without conidia, which were assumed to belong to Fusarium species, were transferred to PDA, carnation leaf agar (CLA) and water agar. Identification of Fusarium species was based on colony and conidial morphology using standard identification key (Nelson et al. 1983).</p><p id="Pg55">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 56 A total of 15 isolates of Fusarium species (8 of F. graminearum, 3 of F. verticillioides and 4 of F. subglutinans) were used in testing their pathogenicity to wheat seedlings (cv. Srpanjka). Pathogenicity test was done according to Mesterhazy (1978). Results and discussion Isolations made from 1954 plant debris (1598 from cultivated plants, 356 from weeds) yielded 629 Fusarium isolates. Fusarium species were isolated from 35.73% residues of cultivated plants and from 16.29% residues of weed plants. Eight Fusarium species were isolated from wheat residues, seven from maize, five from barley, three from A. theophrasti, two from A. retroflexus and one from A. artemisiifolia and S. halepense, respectively (Table 1).

This study confirms the conclusions of our earlier studies that these Fusarium species are dominant fungi on small grain cereals and maize roots and stems/stalks in Croatia (Cosic 1999; Cosic et al. 2004). The data for F. avenaceum and F. culmorum indicated a moderately high density. The predominant Fusarium species isolated from weed residues was F. graminearum. These species was isolated from plant debris of three weed species, F. verticillioides was isolated from plant debris of two weed species and F. subglutinans and F. culmorum were isolated from one weed species, respectively. The ideal approach to controlling many plant diseases is to identify the inoculum source and then eliminate or inactivate it. Host residues are important reservoir of inoculum which includes conidia and hyphal fragments and for some species ascospores surviving on plant debris at or near the soil surface (Sutton 1982; Parry et al. 1995). Teleomorph stage on residues of cultivated plants and weeds is a significant source of inoculum. Every year we found perithecia of Gibberella zeae on maize and S. halepense and in some years on wheat, barley, A. retroflexus and A. artemisiifolia. Ascospores produced during the growing season can infect maize and small grain cereals. Out of 15 tested Fusarium isolates from plant debris, the most pathogenic to wheat seedlings were isolates of F. graminearum, and the most pathogenic isolate was FG Sorghum 1 (Table 2). Germination of seeds that were inoculated with F. graminearum</p><p id="Pg56">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 57 isolates was between 37.50 and 47.50%, and 60.00 to 76.47% of seedlings had necroses on germ root or hypocotyle. Isolates of F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans were less pathogenic to wheat seedlings. Depending on isolates, germination of inoculated seeds was between 70.00 and 85.00%. Table 2.

Conclusions Based on the eleven-year long research, it can be concluded that F. graminearum, F. subglutinans and F. verticillioides were predominant species isolated from plant debris of cultivated plants and common weeds. Other Fusarium species isolated from plant residues were F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. sporotrichioides, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum and F. solani. The most pathogenic species to wheat seedlings was F. gramienarum. References Cosic J. - Jurkovic D. - Drezner G.: 1999. Fusarium species found on wheat root and stem in Eastern Croatia.

Positive correlation coefficient was determined among tested methods of inoculation. Keywords: Diaporthe/Phomopsis complex, soybean, pathogenicity Introduction Fungi of Diaporthe/Phomopsis complex (DPC – an acronym for Diaporthe/Phomopsis complex) cause several important diseases of soybean. Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae (Dps) and Phomopsis longicolla involved with pod and stem blight and seed decay, Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora (Dpc) is the casual agent of stem canker (Sinclair and Hartman, 1999). Besides soybeans, these fungi colonize other crops or weeds (Mengistu and Reddy, 2005). DPC survive in field on plant residues for several years and can be a source of inoculum for the following growing season (Garazonio and McGee, 1983). Weeds may play important role for maintenance of inoculum density in soil (Cosic et al., 2007; Vrandecic et al., 2007). Applied fungicides, cultural measures and sowing resistant genotypes have a direct influence on the yield quantity and quality and disease severity (Jug et al., 2007). Resistant genotypes are economically the most beneficial and do not have impact on the environment (Husti, 2006). Aggressiveness of the isolate should be tested in advance to provide disease process for genetic differentiation of breeding material. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in pathogenicity of isolates DPC (isolated from soybean and Abutilon theophrasti) for soybean using two methods of inoculation. Materials and methods Inoculation by mycelial plugs The following isolates were used for inoculation: Dps originated from soybean (PS 1, PS 2, PS 5 and PS 03) and from A. theophrasti (Ab PS5 and Ab PS6), P. longicolla from soybean (PL 1, PL 2, PL 6 and PL 9) and from A. theophrasti (Ab PL 1, Ab PL 2 and Ab PL 4) and isolates Dpc from soybean (Dpc 1, Dpc 2, Dpc 4, Dpc 9 and Dpc 11) and A. theophrasti (Ab Dpc 3, and Ab Dpc 4). The inoculum was cultured on PDA at 25±1ºC with 12 h light/12 h dark regime for four days. Pathogenicity trials were performed on the soybean plants in the V1 growing stage (Fehr and Caviness, 1977). The trial was carried out in three replications, with 10 plants in each repetition. Plants were wounded in cotyledonary node with a scalpel and inoculated with a 4 mmdiameter PDA mycelial plug, covered with wet cotton wool. Control plants were inoculated with plugs of PDA without mycelium. The pathogens were reisolated from stems of randomly chosen inoculated plants. The pots with plants were placed in chamber maintained at 23 ºC and humidity 90% for 4 days. Later on, humidity was</p><p id="Pg59">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 60 decreased on 60 %. Longitudinal lengths of lesion were measured 7, 17 and 27 days after inoculation and percentage of dead plants was calculated at the end of test. Toothpick inoculation The isolates used for toothpick inoculation were the same as those used in previous trial. The trial was carried out on field-grown plants in three replications, with 10 plants in each repetition. The toothpick inoculation method was described by Keeling (1982). Soybean plants (V1 growing stage, Fehr and Caviness, 1977) were inoculated by inserting a small piece of toothpick overgrown with mycelium into a hole made with sterile scalpel right below the cotyledon. The inoculated site was protected by vaseline. Plants punctured with sterile toothpicks served as control. Inoculation was made on May 23, 2005. The longitudinal lengths of lesion were measured on June 12 and on July 7, percentage of dead plants was calculated at the end of test. The data for both tests were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and LSD using Statistical Analyses System Version 8.2 (SAS Institute). Results and discussion After inoculation of soybean plants by mycelial plugs, differences in pathogenicity were determined regardless of Diaporthe/Phomopsis species and origin of isolates (Table 1).

The least pathogenic were isolates Dps from soybean, particularly PS 5 and PS 03. Control plants in both trials remained healthy.

Cereal Research Communications 62 between isolates with the purpose to evaluate resistance of soybean cultivars (Keeling 1982, Vidic et al., 1998; Pioli, 1999). Examination of differences in pathogenicity of DPC isolates, selection of the most pathogenic isolates and the choice of appropriate methods of inoculation are very important in establishing resistance to disease within a breeding program. Conclusions Results obtained after inoculation of soybean plants by mycelial plugs and toothpick inoculation showed differences in pathogenicity among tested Diaporthe/Phomopsis species. Both methods of inoculation proved that the most pathogenic isolates were P. longicolla (Ab PL 1 and Ab PL 2) and Dpc (Ab Dpc 3, Dpc 9, Dpc 11). Isolates of Dps regardless of their origin and method of inoculation were less pathogenic. Positive correlation coefficient was determined between tested methods of inoculation.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 63 INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS ON GRAIN YIELD AND APPEARANCE OF WHITE ROT (SCLEROTINIA SCLEROTIORUM) IN FIELD EXPERIMENTS WITH SUNFLOWER HYBRIDS Branimir SIMIC1 – Jasenka COSIC2 – Ruza POPOVIC1 – Karolina VRANDECIC2 1 Agricultural Institute Osijek, Juzno predgradje 17, 31000 Osijek, e-mail: branimir.simic@poljinos.hr 2 University of Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek Abstract: The three year research results of tests with sunflower hybrids in micro, macro and production experiments enabled the proper choice of the most suitable cultivar and in the way high and stabile yield of grain and oil. In unfavorable production years and due to its genetic constitution and morphological characteristics sunflower is susceptible to attack of different pathogens, who significantly decrease the grain yield as well as the content and yield of oil. Field experiments (2005 - 2007) were conducted on two locations (Vinkovci and Osijek) with seven sunflower hybrids: Apolon, Favorit, PR63A90, PR63A42, Heliasol, Opera, NS-H-111. It was determined that grain yield and disease appearance significantly vary depending on the quantity of rainfall, temperatures over the vegetation and selection of sunflower hybrid. The minimal grain yield (1.14 tha -1 ) and the highest disease appearance (24 – 67 % of diseased plants) was in wet 2005 and the highest yield (3.87 tha -1 ) and the lowest disease appearance (3.2 – 5.8 % of diseased plants) was in dry 2007. The highest average yield had the hybrid PR63A90 (3.12 tha -1 ) and the lowest yield had the hybrid NS-H-111 (2.05 tha -1 ). The differences in the yield quantity and disease appearance between the two locations were not signifficant. Keywords: macro experiments, sunflower hybrids, disease, grain yield, oil content Introduction Sunflower (Helanthus annuus L.) is the most important culture for production of qualitative edible oil. It is one of the four most significant oleaginous plants, planted on more than 20 million hectars worldwide with grain yield varying from 0.5 to 3.6 tha-1 and an average grain yield of 1.16 tha-1 (FAOSTAT Database, 2002). The yield of crop cultures significantly varies depending on the climate conditions in the certain year and genotypes (Kerekes, 2004, Liovic at al., 2006, Hudec, 2006, Husti, 2006, Göksoy and Turan, 2007). The main goal of crop improvement is to make new high productive hybrids tolerant or resistant to dominant pathogens, with increased drought and lodgging resistance and increased oil content. Current production includes hybrids with the yield potential of over 5 tha-1, oil content of 50 - 55 % and high tolerancy to the most important pathogens (Phomopsis helianthi Munt.-Cvet. and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary). Sunflower is a host for almost forty pathogenic organisms (Gulya et al., 1997). Those pathogens are very important in Eastern Croatia (Cosic et al., 2005, Vrandecic et al., 2006). Therefore the breeding program on sunflower has to be based on creation of new tolerant lines and hybrids (Vrataric and Sudaric, 2004, Liovic et al., 2006). Over the years many factors influenced the variation in yield, disease appearance and oil content. The most significant factors were the quantity of rainfall and the temperature over the vegetation (Hunyadi Borbély et al., 2007). Based on the results of field experiments the producers select the most suitable hybrids (Liovic et al., 2006).</p><p id="Pg63">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 64 Materials and methods Sunflower field experiments (2005 - 2007) were conducted on two locations (Vinkovci and Osijek) with seven hybrids (Apolon, Favorit, PR63A90, PR63A42, Heliasol, Opera, NS-H-111) of recognized world companies (Pioneer, RWA, KWS, Institute for crop and vegetables Novi Sad, Agricultural Institute Osijek). Experiments were set up in randomised block design. The size of the main plot was 15.4 m2. Sowing was performed with pneumatic sawing machines and with plant density of 65 000 grains. Experiment included common sunflower production agricultural technic, without using fungicides. Intensity of incidence of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was evaluated at stage R8 (stages according to Schneiter and Miller, 1981) and for each hybrid forty plants were examined. Grain yield was determined after the harvest with an electric scale (Schrran Engeneering, model 715) and presented in tons of dry grain per hectar (9% water in the grain, 2% ingredients). Grain moisture was determined with Dickey John measurer, model GAC 2000 (Grain analyses computer). Results of the study were processed by Statistica for Windows v. 6.0. Significant differences among the treatments were determined by analysis of variance applying LSD test. Climate conditions Over the vegetation period (April - August) of the each year of the experiment climate conditions varied in the amount of rainfall as well as in the average temperatures. The driest year was 2007 with quantity of rainfall 94 and 106 mm, respectively and average temperature 19.78 and 20.11°C, respectively. In wet 2005 the amount of rainfall over the vegetation period was from 4 to 5 time higher (496 and 514 mm, respectively) than in 2007 (Table 1). Table 1. The amount of rainfall and average temperatures over the vegetation Location Year Amount of rainfall (mm) Average temperatures °C 2005 514 17,87 2006 483 18,47 Vinkovci 2007 106 20,11 2005 496 17,99 2006 461 18,22 Osijek 2007 94 19,78 Average amount (1970 – 2005) 502,67 17,47 Results and discussion The average grain yield was 2.36 tha-1 of dry grain, regardless the location, year and the hybrid. The highest grain yield was in 2007 (Opera 3.72 tha-1) and the lowest in 2005 (NS-H-111 0.87 tha-1). The highest average 3-year grain yield had the hybrid Opera (2.81 tha-1) and the lowest hybrid NS-H-111 (1.97 tha-1) (Table 2). Analysis of variance showed that the major influence on yield variation and disease appearance had the year of production (P&gt;0,01) and hybrid (P&gt;0,05) (Table 3). Accordance to the results of the experiment, production of sunflower significantly depends on agroclimate conditions of the production year. In average production conditions the difference between the yields of the most important hybrids varies approximately 15%, on the other hand in unfavourable years those differences are significantly decreased or they almost do not</p><p id="Pg64">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 65 appear. Comparing these results with multiannual experiments (1997 - 2001) grain yield was not significantly increased, but disease appearance and oil yield significantly varied depending on the year of production (Liovic et al., 2006). There are different caueses of variation, but the most important is the influence of unfavourable climate conditions during the vegetation. In years with wet and cold summer months there is a significant disease intensity of white rot of the middle part of stem and white rot of the head (S. sclerotiorum) and grey mould (Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr) of the sunflower. Negative consequences of such weather conditions on grain and oil yield were noticed in 1996, 1999 and 2001 (Liovic et al., 2006). Intensity of disease incidents and variation of grain and oil yield show that still there are no hybrids which have a wider genetic tolerance towards pathogens. Therefore the optimal use of genetic potentials of the existing hybrids will be possible only with use of modern agricultural technic - crop rotation, use of qualitative protection from weed, disease and pests (Kerekes, 2004).

In 2005 on both location was determined extremely high number of heads infected with S. sclerotiorum (40 - 80%) what confirms that weather factors have crucial influence on disease incidence.

Cereal Research Communications 66 Conclusions Based on the carried experiment it can be concluded that the most important influence on sunflower grain yield have agroclimate conditions of production, while the selection of hybrids has less influence. Appearance and intensity of disease significantly depend on the choice of hybrid and agroclimate conditions (temperature, amount and distribution of rainfall) of the production year. Breeding program acchieved significant results on creation of new genotypes, but only to certain pathogens, while the problem of multiple tolerance yet needs to be solved.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: The effectiveness of biological nitrogen fixation in soybean linked to genotype and environment was tested using the number and dry weight of nodules per plant, above-ground plant mass, nitrogen content in the above-ground part of plant and grain yield. A field study conducted in eastern Croatia from 2004 to 2007 year and involved 8 cultivars in two variants of seed inoculation by Bradyrhizobium japonicum (uninoculated and inoculated). Significant increasing of grain yield affected by inoculation was determined. Effectiveness of biological nitrogen fixation was significantly varied depends on genetic factor, environmental variables and their interaction. Genetic improvement of soybean for biological nitrogen fixation has economical and ecological benefits for soybean production. Keywords: soybean, genotype, environment, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, nitrogen fixation, grain yield Introduction One of the main demands of sustainable agriculture is the use of renewable resources of nitrogen reserves and reduction of nitrogen fertilizers inputs having economical and ecological benefits for production (Várallyay, 2006; Husti, 2006). Soybean has ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen by a symbiotic association with rhizobial strains. Use of high quality rhizobial inoculants has contributed substantially to the nitrogen economy of farming systems through the inputs from biological nitrogen fixation (Peoples and Baldock, 2001). The effectiveness of biological nitrogen fixation in field conditions is a resultant of many factors: environment (physical, chemical and biological components of soil, weather conditions during vegetation), seed quality, compatibility of genotype with rhizobial strains, genetic potential of host plant for nitrogen fixation as well as efficiency of nodular bacteria (Roughley, 1985; Milic et al., 2000; Andric et al., 2007; Redzepovic et al., 1986, 2007). Genetic improvement of soybean for biological nitrogen fixation contributes to both development high yielding germplasm in nitrogen-deficient soils and improvement the nitrogen status of soil (Delauney and Verma, 1996). It is important by economical and ecological aspects of soybean production. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of biological nitrogen fixation in soybean linked to genotype and environment. Materials and methods Research was conducted in eastern Croatia from 2004 to 2007 year on a hypogley hydromeliorated soil (pH 6-6.5; humus 2.2%; 27.4 mg K2O 100 g -1 of soil; 18.4 mg P2O5 100 g -1 of soil). Field trials were set up in a RCBD in four replications and block involved 8 soybean cultivars in two variants: without (control) and with application of microbiological preparation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain. Basic plot was 12.5 m2. Tested cultivars have originated from the Agricultural Institute Osijek in Croatia. According to the length of growing season on local level, they belong very early (OS-100, OS-2-00), early (OS-1-0, OS-2-0, OS-3-0) and full-season (OS-1-I, OS-2-I, OS-3-I)</p><p id="Pg67">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 68 cultivars. Pre-sowing fertilization in each year was performed using 400 kg ha -1 NPK 8:26:26. In the growth stages R5 and R6 (full-flowering), 10 plants per plot were taken in order to determine the following nitrogen fixation indicators: number and dry weight of nodule, above-ground plant mass and nitrogen level in the above-ground plant part. Grain yield per plot was converted to 13% seed moisture and t ha-1. The obtained data were statistically processed by SAS 9.1. Considering to the weather conditions during study, mostly there were normal for soybean growing, with partly exceptions during 2006 (precipitation excess) and 2007 (dry period). Results and discussion The obtain results of testing nitrogen fixation indicators during the 4-years period (Table 1) were showed that all indicators were had higher mean values in inoculated variant compared to control variant. It implies positive effect of seed inoculation with B. japonicum strain on measured traits. There is evident that cultivars OS-3-0, OS-1-00 and OS-3-I have possessed the highest potential for nitrogen fixation. Significant differences among tested cultivars in each measured trait indicate genetic diversity of tested material in both potential of biological nitrogen fixation and compatibility cultivar by B. japonicum strain, as well.

It suggested that the grain yield in soybean as well as other crops, significantly depends on genetic factor, environmental variables and interaction between genotype and environment (Vrataric et al., 2006; Sudaric et al., 2007; Drezner et al., 2007). Tested cultivars with the best potential for nitrogen fixation (OS-1-00, OS-3-0, OS-3-I) had the highest grain yield increasing (14.4%, 14.3% and 14.0%, respectively). Concerning to the environmental influence on the effect of inoculation, the highest increasing of grain yield was in the arid 2006 year (14.5%), while the lowest increasing was in the dried 2007 year (12.7%). There was determined significant variability in increasing grain yield within cultivar affected by year.

PETRÓCZI 3 1University of Szeged Faculty of Agriculture, Hódmezővásárhely 2University of Szeged Faculty of Engineering, Szeged 3Cereal Research Non-profit Company, Szeged Abstract : Gluten, rheological and fall number investigations were performed in the years 2004 and 2005 on four winter wheat varieties; GK Garaboly, GK Kalász, GK Verecke, GK Petur; treated with herbicides. In both years, the effect of variety was significant (p&lt;0.001) on each baking parameter tested, while the effect of crop year was significant on wet gluten content, baking value, technological water absorption and falling number. The effect of herbicides was significant (p&lt;0.01) on the gluten spreading only. Taking the two years and four varieties together, only Lintur caused significant decrease of gluten spread. Variety-treatment interaction was seen in both years. The averaged wet gluten content and technological water absorption of the fur wheats was significantly higher in 2004 than in the somewhat more wet year 2005. Keywords: herbicide, wet gluten content, gluten spreading, backing value, falling number Introduction Beside nutrient replenishment (Matuz et al., 2007; Németh, 2006; Jolánkai et al., 2006) weed can be controlled in densely sown wheat only by herbicides, applied widely and correctly (Tóth, 2005). Chemization, however, affects certain baking characteristics. (Tanács et al., 2005). Crop year had, as shown by previous studies (Tanács et al., 2005, 2006; Tanács, 2007) an effect on the techno-functional characteristics of wheat. The aim of our work was to see how herbicide treatment and crop year influenced the parameters of wet gluten content, gluten spreading, baking value, technological water absorption and falling number of wheat samples in the years 2004 and 2005. Materials and methods The three-factor, four-repeat, random block experiment with the wheats was performed at the test area Öthalom of the Cereal Research Non-profit Company, Szeged, on a deep-saline chernozem soil with medium nitrogen and good potassium and phosphorus supply, after peas as forecrop. Wheat was sown on 6 November 2003 and 4 November 2004, with 500 grains m-2. The herbicides were applied on 24 April 2004 and 9 may 2005 in 1-2 nodal state. Harvest was on 16 June 2004 and 20 June 2005. For doses, see Table 1. The flour winter wheat varieties used in the experiment were GK Garaboly, GK Kalász, GK Verecke and GK Petur. Results and Discussion The effect of variety (factor A) was significant on all five baking parameter at 0.1%, while herbicide treatment (factor B) influenced significantly (1%) only gluten spreading. Crop year (factor C) had significant effect on all parameters except gluten spreading at 0.1%.</p><p id="Pg71">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 72 Table 1.

Spike length (SL) and grain weight per spike (GWS) with increasing nitrogen (N) rates and three seed densities (SD) used were examined. The genotypes studied were determined to have expressed a decrease in both SL and GWS as SD increased. Over the three-year period, average SL obtained at SDs of 500, 400 and 300 grains per m -2 was 6.94 cm, 7.13 cm or 2.74 % higher and 7.53 cm (8.50%), respectively. Average GWS obtained at SDs of 500, 400 and 300 grains per m -2 was 0.76 g, 0.79 g (3.95%) and 0.83 g (9.21%), respectively. However, the effect of increasing nitrogen rates used in nutrition resulted in an increase in both SL and GWS. Over the three-year period, average SL in the control variant was 6.86 cm, in the 30 kg N ha variant – 7.19 cm (4.81%) and in the one with 60 kg N ha used – 7.54 cm (9.91%). Average GWS was 0.74 g in the control, 0.79 g (6.76%) in the 30 kg N ha variant and 0.86 g (16.22%) in the 60 kg N ha variant. Furthermore, these traits were significantly affected by climatic factors, and the highest average SL and GWS were established in the year with the most favourable effect of growing conditions recorded. Keywords: Two-rowed spring barley, nitrogen nutrition, seed density, spike length, grain weight per spike. Introduction Spike length (SL) and grain weight per spike (GWS) are important yield components. Two-rowed barley genotypes should have long lax spikes which enable full development of grains the width of which should be over 2.50 mm. GWS is dependent on the productive tillering, SL, soil fertility, plant nutrition and seed density (Paunovic, 2001; Kovacevic et al., 2006; Lalic et al., 2006; Madic et al., 2006; Izsaki et al., 2007; Bertic et al., 2007). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cultivar, seed density (SD) and nitrogen (N) fertilisation on SL and GWS of barley. Grain yields of barley as affected by these parameters were shown in a previous study. This particular research is a supplement to and completion of the comprehensive earlier investigation (Paunovic, 2001; Paunovic et al., 2006, 2007a). Material and Methods The experimental research was carried out in a three-year period (1996, 1997 and 1998) with five two-rowed spring barley cultivars (Kraguj, Dinarac, Dunavac, Jastrebac and NS-294) at the trial field of the Small Grains Research Institute in Kragujevac (Sumadija region of Central Serbia). Three seed densities (SD: 300, 400 and 500 germinated seeds m-2) and three N fertilisations (50, 80 and 110 kg N ha-1) were applied in four replicates (the experimental plot = 5.0 m-2). Equal amounts of NPK fertilisers (kg ha-1: 50 N + 50 P2O5 + 50 K2O) were used in the autumn/winter of the previous year. Barley was sown at the following dates: 11 March 1996, 3 March 1997 and 28 February 1998. The remaining amount of N was distributed by topdressing (0, 30 and 60 kg N ha-1) at the end of April/beginning of May. Soil and weather characteristics were described in detail in the earlier study (Paunovic, 2001). A total of 30 plants from each elementary plot were analysed with respect to the parameters tested (SL and GWS).</p><p id="Pg75">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 76 Results and Discussion During the three research years, the increased SD, the average SL decrease and the increased N rates resulted in a SL increase in the two-rowed barley analysed (Vegh and Rajkai, 2006; Paunovic et al, 2007b). In the first research year, determination was made of high significant differences in SL between the SD of 300 grains m-2 and the SD of 400 and 500 grains m-2 (Table 1). The SL difference between the 400 and 500 grains m-2 densities was not statistically significant. As regards the N effect on SL, the differences in SL between the control variant and the ones using 30 kg N ha-1 and 60 kg N ha-1 fertilisation were determined to be statistically highly significant in 1996. The NS-294 cultivar had a significantly greater SL compared to other cultivars, among which no significant differences in this trait were recorded. In the second research year, significant differences in SL were found between the cultivars examined. Furthermore, a significant SD effect and a highly significant increasing N rate effect on SL were determined. Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 77 In the third research year, owing to favourable growing conditions, the averagely highest SLwas established. All the factors studied (cultivar, SD and N fertilisation) had significant effects on SL. A highly significant interaction between the cultivar and SD (A x B) was recorded in this year. In the first research year, as regards GWS, there were highly significant differences in the SD of 300 grains per m-2 compared to the ones of 400 and 500 grains per m-2. The difference in GWS between the densities of 400 and 500 grains per m-2 was also significant (Table 2). The difference in GWS between the rate of 60 kg N ha-1 and that of 30 kg N ha-1 was very significant. In the second research year, increased N nutrition significantly affected GWS resulting in highly significant differences in this trait between the 60 kg N ha-1 variant and the remaining ones (the control and the variant using 30 kg Nha-1). In the third year, a highly significant difference in GWS was recorded between the cultivars examined. SD and N nutrition had, respectively, a statistically significant and a highly significant effect on GWS. Furthermore, a significant interaction was determined between the cultivar used and the SD employed (A x B). Table 2.

There were no significant differences in GWS between the densities of 300 grains per m-2 and 400 grains per m-2. The cultivar effect in all three research years was highly significant compared to GWS. The increased SD in the research year induced decreases in SL and GWS. The increased N nutrition effect resulted in an increase in both SL and grain number per spike (Paunovic et al., 2006; Knezevic et al., 2007; Biberdzic et al., 2007; Balogh et al., 2007; Pepó, 2007). Conclusions The two-rowed spring barley genotypes examined expressed a highly significant effect on GWS during the three research years. The increased SD induced a SL decrease and the effect of increasing N rates in plant nutrition resulted in SL and GWS increases. References Balogh, A. – Hornok, M. – Pepó, P.: 2007.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 79 NxP AND NxK INTERACTIONS ON GRASS YIELD AND MINERAL ELEMENT COMPOSITION Péter RAGÁLYI – Imre KÁDÁR Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest Abstract: The effect of different N, P and K supply levels (low, satisfactory, high, extreme high) and their combinations were examined in the 31 st year of a long-term fertilization experiment on the development, yield and mineral element content of a 4 years old established all-grass sward in 2004, with seed mixture of eight grass species. The trial was established on a calcareous chernozem soil. The soil of the growing site contained around 3% humus, 3–5% CaCO3, 20–22% clay in the ploughed layer and was originally moderately well supplied with available K, Mg, Mn, Cu and poorly supplied with P and Zn. The NxP fertilization rose 3-fold the hay yield. The „moderate” supply levels (135 mg kg -1 AL-K2O and 153 mg kg -1 AL-P2O5) basically satisfied the P and K demands of grass. Without a satisfactory P supply the efficiency of N fertilization was much lower and vice versa. As a function of rising NxP supply levels, the Mo content of hay in the 1 st cut dropped from 1.0 to 0.3 mg kg -1 , while in the 2 nd cut hay from 4.5 to 0.4 mg kg -1 . The Na content of the primary hay increased one order of magnitude with the increasing N-supply, while the K-fertilization reduced it to its 20%. The NxK interactions had negative effect on Na, Ca, Mg and B uptake. Keywords: fertilization, interaction, grass, yield, element composition Introduction The synergetic effects of N on the element uptake of the main major nutrients has been recognized for many decades. The antagonistic effect of K on the uptake of Ca, Mg, Na, B etc. elements are also well known (Finck, 1982; Geisler, 1988; Izsáki, 2006, 2007; Blertic et al., 2007; Kovacevic et al., 2006; Németh, 2006). The interactions among N×P, N×K and P×K supply levels are not well understood, their effect on yield and element uptake has not been revealed yet. The present work aimed to evaluate the effect of different N, P and K supply levels and their combinations on the yield and mineral composition of an established all-grass sward in the 31st year of a long-term fertilization trial set up on a calcareous chernozem soil. Details of this experiment were described earlier (Kádár, 2007; Kádár – Ragályi, 2007; Ragályi – Kádár, 2006). Materials and methods The calcareous chernozem soil of the growing site contained around 3% humus, 3–5% CaCO3, 20–22% clay in the ploughed layer and was originally moderately well supplied with available K, Mg, Mn, Cu and poorly supplied with P and Zn. The trial included 4N×4P×4K= 64 treatments in 2 replications, giving a total of 128 plots. The area was drought sensitive with the groundwater table at a depth of 13–15 m and with a negative water balance of about 100 mm yr-1. Treatments and soluble PK contents of the soil’s ploughed layer are given in Table 1 representing low, satisfactory, high and extreme high supply levels. The mixture of 8 grass species was established on 21st September 2000. In 2004 the first cut was made on 11th May, while the 2nd one on 19th July. The first cut had 227 mm, the second one 141 mm rain. Later no harvest could be done because of water shortages.</p><p id="Pg79">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 80 Table 1.

The “moderate” 153 mg kg-1 AL-P2O5 P-supply level satisfied the P demands of the young herbage. At the 2nd cut however, there were no P responses any more, even on the low P-supplied soil with 66 mg kg-1 AL-P2O5 value. The hay yield dropped on the Nexhausted soil to 0.4 t ha-1, while the 300 kg ha-1 N load rose it 8.5 times compared to the control plots, reaching 3.4 t ha-1 as an average. The K-fertilization did not change the yield, so data are given as a mean of K-treatments (Table 2). Table 2. Effect of NxP supply levels on the air-dry hay yield in 2004, t ha-1.

The 2nd cut hay however showed lowered Sr contents with the enhancing N supply reflecting a dilution effect. The hay’s Mo contents dropped down at both cuts when NxP fertilization was lifted mirroring negative N x P interaction. Thus, the study of interplay among nutrients might have great importance for fodder quality control based on plant analysis. In our experimental conditions, on the same site and in the same year the hay’s Sr content fluctuated between 7-28 mg kg-1, while that of Mo between 0.3-4.5 mg kg-1 according to NxP supply. Both the scale and the direction of the interaction may change with time, so detailed analytical work is necessary to reveal these changes even within a year.</p><p id="Pg80">VII.

Na has great mobility and extremely sensitive to NxK supply. At the 1st cut Na content changed between 62-1923 mg kg-1 indicating more than 30-fold difference. Na content of hay was increased almost an order of magnitude by N fertilization, while K fertilization caused an 80% decrease moderating each others influence. K fertilizer is a source of Na in soil, but the K-Na antagonism and N-Na synergism were of crucial importance for plant uptake. In 2004 fertilization has little impact on Ca on this calcareous soil. With higher N supply the hay yield increased and Ca concentration moderately diluted. The K-Ca antagonism has also negative effect on Ca uptake. The fate of Mg is almost the same as of Ca. Concentration of B is diluted due to the yield increase induced by N-fertilization. The K-B antagonism however appeared only in hay of the N-treated plots. NxK interactions resulted in B content ranging 4.3-9.5 mg kg-1 in 2nd cut hay (Table 4). Conclusions NxP fertilization had great impact on grass yields on this site. The „moderate” supply levels (135 mg kg-1 AL-K2O and 153 mg kg -1 AL-P2O5) basically satisfied the P and K demands of grass. The long-term fertilization can drastically change the content and ratios of elements built in the hay through synergetic or antagonistic effects. NxP fertilization had crucial importance on Sr and Mo content of hay with 3 and 15-fold differences resp. NxK negative interactions showed up mainly at higher N and K-levels</p><p id="Pg81">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 82 having negative effect on Na, Ca, Mg and B uptake.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 83 GENOTYPE BY ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION OF GERMINATON IN SOYBEAN CULTIVARS Tomislav DUVNJAK – Ruža POPOVIĆ – Ivica LIOVIĆ – Marija VRATARIĆ – Aleksandra SUDARIĆ Agricultural Institute Osijek,Južno predgrađe 17,31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: tomislav.duvnjak@poljinos.hr Abstract: Germination of four soybean cultivars across four years and three locations was tested in main soybean production area in Croatia. The analysis of variance of the four cultivars in 12 environments shows that environment (E), genotype (G), and their interaction (GEI) were significant (P&lt;0.01) for soybean seed germination. The paper shows that AMMI (additive main effects and multiplicative interaction) model was effective for studying genotype by environment interaction. The biplots show that cultivars Podravka 95 and Ika had the highest stability for investigated trait. No genotype has superior performance in all environments. Keywords: soybean, germination, environment, AMMI, biplot Introduction Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is the leading oil and protein crop in the world and according to FAO (2006), the major production area of soybean in Europe is the southeast region, mainly in Serbia, Croatia and Hungary. In recent years, there have increased soybean production, what is attributed to improved cultivars and improved cultural practices (Sudarić et al., 2007). In order to improve both the quantity and the quality of yields, it is important to acquire a complex ecological attitude and more rational use of the natural resources. According to Hunyadi-Borbely et al. (2007) the present economical environment somewhat narrows the possibilities for developing production methods. The genetic improvement of soybean cultivars, based on conventional breeding strategies, contributes to advances in production by developing high-yielding and high quality soybeans cultivars (Sudarić et al., 2007). An important part of every serious breeding program includes testing of newly developed genotypes in a wide range of environmental conditions (Mijić et al., 2007). Specific response of some cultivars in particular growing area may ensure valuable knowledge for further selection and breeding purposes for targeted well-characterized production environments. A different environments investigation provides a great assistance in choosing suited cultivars for production site (Pepo, 2006). Field trails results may be used as predictors for successful cultivar usage (Drezner et al., 2006; 2007). The significant value in successful soybean production has seed quality performances such as seed vigour and germination (Andrić et al., 2007). The multivariate method called Additive main Effect and Multiplicative Analysis (AMMI), widely used for genotype by environment interactions (GEI), can help to identify highly productive and broadly adaptable genotypes, and perform the so-called ecological regionalization, to establish region specific recommendations. This method has been shown to be effective because it captures a large portion of the GEI sum of square, clearly separates main and interaction effects that present agricultural researches with different kinds of opportunities, and the model often provides agronomically meaningful interpretation of the data. This investigation was aimed to evaluate the differences of soybean cultivar seed germination and their adaptation on different environments.</p><p id="Pg83">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 84 Materials and methods Four soybean cultivars (maturity group 0-I), created in a frame of soybean breeding program of The Agricultural Institute Osijek Croatia were used in this study (Anica (1), Ika (2), Podravka 95 (3) and Tisa (4)). Soybean germination was laboratory tested in the laboratory of Department for Seed Production and Processing, The Agricultural Institute Osijek, by standard laboratory method: 4x100 seeds from each lot were put in a growth chamber on wet paper, 20°C for a 16 hours and 30°C for 8 hours, and 12/12 light regime. After 8 days was counted and expressed in percentages. Seed samples are collected from four consecutive years (2001-2004) and three locations: Valpovo (VA), Vukovar (VU) and Osijek (OS) on different soil types – pseudogley in Valpovo, degradated chernozem in Vukovar and eutric cambisol in Osijek. Each year-location combination was considered as an environment. Twelve environments were analyzed as a series of random locations with entry means and effective error variance, which is used for the combined analysis. In the combined ANOVA, genotype by environment interaction (GEI) sum of squares was partioned according to „symmetrical joint linear regression analysis” (DeLacy et al. 1996). In addition, Additive Main and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis was done. GLM procedure of the SAS program (SAS 2003) was run to obtain ANOVA and AMMI analyses. Results and discussion In combined ANOVA, effects for seed germination of environment (E), genotype (G) and genotype x environment interaction (GEI) were highly significant (Table 1). Table 1.

In AMMI 2 model biplot (Figure 2), IPCA2 vs. IPCA1 for germination, genotypes and environments close to axis’s intercept have lower interaction respectively higher stability. The best environments for genotypes distinguishing are more distant from axis’s intercept (OS-02 and VA-01). Genotypes grouped around particular environment are specifically adapted for that environment (G 3 is the closest to E OS-01, which mean that is specifically adapted to that E). Environments which are close to each other are similar (VU-01, VU-02, VU-03 and VU-04) which means that there is no necessity for testing on such number of environments regarding small GEI. Conclusions The obtained results of this paper provided valuable information about genotypes reaction in different environments regarding seed germination. Environment has a stronger influence on investigated trait than genotype. These results could be applied in soybean breeding process related to improvement of soybean seed quality having an impact on stabile and successful soybean production.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 87 MARKETABLE TUBER YIELD STABILITY IN POTATO Ivica LIOVIĆ – Marko JOSIPOVIĆ – Domagoj ŠIMIĆ – Goran KRIZMANIĆ – Anto MIJIĆ Agricultural Institute Osijek, Južno predgrađe 17, HR-31001 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: ivica.liovic@poljinos.hr Abstract: In the paper was analyzed marketable tuber yield stability of eight foreign potato cultivars (Arosa, Rosara, Velox, Flavia, Satina, Hopehely, Goliath and Rioja) grown in Croatian production environments for three growing seasons (2003-2005), on four locations (Brinje, Varaždin, Velika Kopanica and Osijek). Results of marketable tuber yields and estimated stability parameters indicate that genotypes, which have a high stability, were not the highest-yielding genotypes. The highest-yielding cultivar was Hopehely, which could be recommended for high-yielding environments, and the most stable cultivar was Rosara. There is concordance between regression coefficient estimates and AMMI analysis. Keywords: potato, marketable tuber yield, stability parameters (Wi, bi, s 2 di), AMMI Introduction Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is grown in the Republic of Croatia on area of 63097 ha, representing 5.9 % of sown area in 2003 (Statistical information, 2004). Soil is very important in potato production as place where plants live, as well as source of water and soluble mineral nutrients for synthesis of organic matter. Realization of genetic potential of some variety depends of climatic and soil conditions in agricultural production (Abraham and Sarvari, 2006; Hoffmann et al., 2006; Hunyadi Borbely et al., 2007; Vad et al., 2007). Moreover, it’s very important to use stable and high-yielding cultivars which are able to achieve satisfy yield in different environmental conditions. According to Chloupek et al. (2004), the crops that had the highest increase in yield were also the most adaptable to the variable production conditions. Testing of genotypes at different environments enables estimation of genotype (G) and environmental (E) effects that we can use for explanation of existing GE interactions (Becker and Leon, 1988; Diepenbrock et al., 1995). Stable genotypes have low GE interactions. The objective of this study was to analyze marketable tuber yield stability of eight foreign potato cultivars grown in Croatian production environments. Materials and methods Field experiments were carried out for three growing seasons (2003-2005), on four locations: Brinje (B), Varaždin (V), Velika Kopanica (K) and Osijek (O), on soil types: distric cambisol, sandy soil, humogley and eutric cambisol. Each year-location combination was considered as an environment. Eight potato cultivars were evaluated in a completely randomized block design in three replications. Distances between rows was 70 cm and within row 40 cm, while the plot area was 14 m2. Five cultivars belong to the German company Solana Agrar-Produkte GmbH &amp; Co. KG (Arosa, Rosara, Velox, Flavia, Satina) and three to the University of Veszprem, Georgikon Faculty of Agriculture, Keszthely, Regional Potato Research Centre, Hungary (Hopehely, Goliath and Rioja). Twelve environments were analyzed as a series of random locations with entry means and effective error variance, which were used for the combined analysis. In the combined ANOVA, genotype by environment (GE) interaction sum of squares was partitioned according to “symmetrical joint linear regression analysis” (DeLacy et al.,</p><p id="Pg87">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 88 1996). This investigation combines methods of the GE interactions partitioning: ecovalence Wi (Wricke, 1962; in Becker and Leon, 1988) and the regression approach (Eberhart and Russell, 1966). Parameters of regression approach bi and s 2 di are interpreted according to model of Haufe and Geidel (1978; in Becker and Leon, 1988). Genotypes with bi about 1, and small s 2 di have high-yield stability, but with large s 2 di low-yield stability. When bi &lt;1 genotypes are adapted to low-yielding environments, and when bi &gt;1 genotypes are adapted to high-yielding environments. Regarding the ecovalence Wi, stable genotypes have low values of Wi. In addition, Additive Main and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis was done. GLM and IML procedures of the SAS program (SAS, 2003) were run to obtain ANOVA and AMMI analyses. Results and discussion Analysis of variance has revealed highly significant differences of marketable tuber yield among years, locations, genotypes and their interactions (three-factor ANOVA), as well as among environments, genotypes and their interactions (combined ANOVA), justifying herewith the stability analysis by proposed methods (data not shown). In AMMI analysis, Gollob’s test was highly significant for principal components PC1 and PC2. The sum of squares (SS) for PC1 was 45.90%, for PC2 27.02%, presenting 72.92% of the interaction SS.

This is in accordance with results of Yilmaz and Tugay (1999), Liović and Kristek (2000), and Sanwal et al. (2003). In our case, the highest-yielding genotype was Hopehely with relatively low value of Wi, the highest bi and low s 2 di suggesting that this cultivar could be recommended for high-yielding environments. Other high-yielding genotypes, suitable for high-yielding environments were Arosa, Goliath and Satina. Similar relations among the parameters were presented by Tekalign (2003), and Sudarić et al. (2006). Since value of bi is near to 1.0, and were low values of Wi and s 2 di, cultivar Rosara can be considered as wide adapted genotypes. Positive significant correlations were detected between mean and bi as well as between Wi and s 2 di (Table 2). There were negative associations between bi and Wi as well as</p><p id="Pg88">VII.

Separated cultivars 3 (Velox) and 4 (Flavia), which had the lowest marketable tuber yield, also had the lowest bi, what means that they are suitable for low-yielding environments. Regression coefficients and AMMI principal components detected similarly the group of three cultivars (1-Arosa, 5-Satina, 7Goliath) that are adapted to high-yielding environments.

Natural virus infections of ornamental plants were studied in the Carpathian basin. Virus infestations to 12 different viruses were testing using DAS-ELISA and back inoculation in 123 samples from 10 plant genera. Different symptoms (mosaic, chlorosis, leaf deformation and necrotic lesions) were observed on the collected plants. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) infection of Begonia cucullata, Dahlia dalina, Dendranthema x grandiflorum, Helichrisum bracteatum, Petunia sp. and Zinnia elegans were showed. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Impatiens walleriana and Potato virus Y (PVY) in Petunia sp. were found. Complex TSWV and PVY infection was detected in a Dendranthema x grandiflorum sample. The results are discussed in relation to control the different vector species, reservoir weed plants and seed and other propagation materials to reduce the spread the viruses in the ornamental crop production. Keywords: Potato virus Y (PVY), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), complex virus infection, virus epidemiology, natural virus infection Introduction The ornamental industry has experienced tremendous growth in the past 50 years and has developed into one of the major economic branches of modern agriculture. During the past 30 years many viruses, viroids, phytoplasmas, bacteria and fungi have been isolated and characterized from diseased ornamental plants. These are major factors limiting plant production all over the world. Viruses of the genus Tospovirus caused serious damages on economically important crops e.g. different ornamental plant species. The Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) vectored by Thrips tabaci and Frankliniella occidentalis has been a well known virus disease of tobacco, as well as pepper, tomato and also ornamental plants in Europe. Since the cultivation of the forced tomato, pepper or lettuce is not continuous throughout the year, the populations of F. occidentalis from to time cannot find in there cultivated plants, for several months. During this time its specimens could survive on the weeds in the surroundings greenhouses or in the heated greenhouses. In summer the adults migrate to the surroundings of the greenhouses where its specimens were found on 36 plant species (Jenser, 1990). Among them Chenopodium album, Dahlia pinnata, Galinsoga parviflora, Melilotus officinalis, Stellaria media and Trifolium repens are also the host plant of TSWV. Viruses infecting ornamental crops have been widely distributed around the world. At the beginning Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus Y (PVY) and Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) occurred in the cultivated crops, then subsequent research has isolated from different weed and ornamental plants (Kadlicskó et al. 2004; Takács 1999; Takács and Rauscher, 2000). The reasons for the difficulty in controlling viruses include the wide host range, alternative weed and crop hosts (Takács et al., 2006). The identification of viruses in an ornamental crop is the first step to the control of diseases (Pintér and Takács, 2003).</p><p id="Pg91">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 92 The intensification of ornamental plant production, the introduction of contaminated propagation plant material, and the outbreaks of insect vectors may all play a role in the establishment and distribution of viral diseases (Gáborjányi et al. 2002; Hajmási et al. 2006; Sherpa et al. 2003; Takács 2000). The susceptibility of plant to different pathogens depends on the plant health and nutrition (Nagy et al., 2006, 2007). The most effective protection against viruses is the resistance (Takács 2007; Takács and Dolej, 1998a, b). In the mid 1980s, partly as a results of advances in plant transformation, it also became apparent that pathogen-derived resistance could be used against virus infection. Many different factors can contribute to the occurrence and spread of virus diseases, these include different vectors, natural influences and also transport and international trade (Fekete et al. 1998, 2002). Biotechnology offers new means of improving ornamental crops by the addition of desirable traits to existing horticulturally-adopted virus-resistant cultivars. Therefore we have studied the natural virus infection of some ornamental plant species. Materials and methods One hundred and twenty three ornamental plant samples were analysed from the genera Begonia, Cymbidium, Dahlia, Dendranthema, Helichrisum, Impatiens, Pelargonium, Petunia, Rudbeckia and Zinnia. A survey of samples of ornamental plant species growing in the different regions of Hungary and Serbia (Dunakeszi, Gyékényes, Keszthely, Kőszeg, Mórakeresztúr, Nyírbátor, Pétfürdő, Szigetszentmiklós, Szigliget, Topolya, Várpalota and Veszprém) showed various symptoms on the leaves and flowers (Table 1). Plant samples were screened trough bioassay and DAS ELISA test, using Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Chrisanthemum virus B (CVB), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Cymbidium mosaic virus (CYMMV), Cymbidium ringspot virus (CymRSV), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), Petunia asteroid mosaic virus (PAMV), Potato virus X (PVX), Potato virus Y (PVY), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) antiserum from Loewe Biochemica (Clark and Adams 1977). Samples were considered positive if ELISA absorbance value was more than three times higher than the absorbance value of the negative control or bioassay tests were positive. Results and discussion Mosaic symptoms, chlorosis, leaf deformation, and necrotic lesions were observed on different ornamental plants. Some symptomless plants were also studied in our experiments. TSWV infection was found in 1 Begonia cucullata, 2 Dahlia dalina, 9 Dendranthema x grandiflorum, 2 Helichrisum bracteatum, 2 Petunia sp. and 1 Zinnia elegans plant samples. Three samples of the examined varieties of the genus Petunia were infected with PVY. One Dendranthema x grandiflorum sample showed TSWV and PVY complex infection. CMV was detected in 1 Impatiens walleriana sample (Table 1). On several occasions complex virus infections, which were also visually indicated by the more serious symptoms, were also detected. Great advances have been made to increse the health status of ornamental plants. Further improvements are beeing made as information and methods of detection on</p><p id="Pg92">VII.

The distribution of the virus in Europe depends on Thysanoptera vector species (mainly Thrips tabaci and Frankliniella occidentalis) and its perennial weed hosts. In the present work the occurrence of natural virus infections of 29 weed species to TSWV were tested using DAS ELISA. Thrips transmission of TSWV was also studied to different plant species using T. tabaci. Adult vectors were collected from TSWV infected tobacco plants. Natural transmission by T. tabaci on tobacco, Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Pelargonium zonale was also demonstrated. Two TSWV infected weed species (Asclepias syriaca and Sonchus arvensis) were found as new natural host of TSWV. The distribution of TSWV and yield losses can be reduced only by the control of thrips vectors and reservoir weeds. Keywords: weed plants, virus epidemiology, Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella occidentalis, thrips transmission, natural virus infection Introduction Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is worldwide distributed pathogen, causing severe yield losses in numerous cultivated plants. Herbaceous plants serve as reservoir for the virus. However, the survival and spread of this virus are sustained by peculiar relationships of the TSWV, the virus vector Thysanoptera species and their host plants. Only the larvae are able to acquire the virus from the infected plants (Ullman et al., 1992). The virus is harboured and replicated in the body of the vector (Peters et al. 1995, Jenser et al., 2003). Until now six Thysanoptera species are known vectoring TSWV, but only two of them occur in the Palaearctic region: Thrips tabaci (Lindeman) a native, and Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) an introduced species. Thrips tabaci was the first published vector of TSWV (Pittman, 1927). However regarding the occurrence of this virus disease an interesting and significant note is that of Lindeman from 1888. In investigating the causes of a severe damage of the tobacco, he has observed large number of a Thysynoptera species, which he has described under the name of Thrips tabaci. At the same time he has also described a symptom that appeared on tobacco leaves infected by T. tabaci, which identified with the damage of TSWV (Zawirska, 1976). It seems that Lindaman’s was the first observation of the joint presence of the TSWV and T. tabaci on tobacco in Europe. In Hungarian climatic conditions TSWV could survive only in the larvae of T. tabaci having acquired the virus from the infected cultivated plants and weeds. The overwintering adults harbour the virus in their body and the overwintered adults will infect new plants in spring. The Frankliniella occidentalis is also a worldwide well known efficient vector of TSWV has been introduced to Europe at the end of 1980s. The host range of TSWV has been investigated in Europe in Poland (Zawirska et al., 1983), in the Czech Republic (Mertelik et al., 1996), in Greece (Chatzivassiliou et al., 2001) and in Hungary (Jenser et al., 2003). In Greece 86 species proved to be the host of TSWV. Among them the relative infection potential index was high in the case of</p><p id="Pg95">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 96 Aster ssp. Ballota nigra, Plantago major, Senecio vulgaris, Solanum nigrum. According to the findings of Zawirska et al. (1983) among the 36 examined wild plant and weed species only Galinsoga parviflora, and Datura stramonium proved to be infected. Among the weeds the occurrence of TSWV and T. tabaci has been observed many times on G. parviflora in Poland (Zawirska et al., 1983), in Czech Republic (Mertelik et al., 1996) and in Hungary (Jenser et al., 2003, Kocsis et al., 2004). Because of fundamental role of weed species in the TSWV epidemics our aim was to study the natural infestation of weeds and transmission of the TSWV to different weed and ornamental plants. Materials and methods Natural virus infections of 29 weed species (Amaranthus retroflexus, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Artemisia vulgaris, Atriplex patula, Asclepias syriaca, Cannabis sativa, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Cirsium arvense, Chenopodium album, Chenopodium hybridum, Convolvulus arvensis, Echinocloa crus-galli, Erigeron canadensis, Euphorbia cyparissias, Equisetum arvense, Fumaria officinalis, Galinsoga parviflora, Geranium molle, Hibiscus trionum, Lamium amplexicaule, Lamium purpureum, Matricaria inodora, Melandrium album, Plantago major, Polygonum aviculare, Portulaca oleracea, Reseda lutea, Rumex obtusifolius, Sonchus arvensis, S. oleraceus, Stachys annua, Stellaria media, Syringa vulgaris, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium repens, Veronica hederifolia) to TSWV were studied. Leaf samples were collected from the fields, home gardens and vineyards from different part of Hungary (Becehegy, Cece, Debrecen-Pallag, Bököny, Geszteréd, Kecskemét, Kőszeg, Napkor) in 2007. Until ELISA test leaf samples were stored for 1-4 days on 4 oC in special plastic bags. Virus content was checked by DAS ELISA method using antiserum from Loewe Biochemica (Clark and Adams 1977). Substrate absorbance was measured at 405 nm wavelength on Labsystem Multiscan ELISA reader. Samples were considered negative if the absorbance value did not exceed three times those of the healthy control ones. T. tabaci were collected from TSWV infected tobacco plants. Five adults and 10 larvae (to each plant) were transferred from infected leaves to different host plants (Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Nicotiana tabacum and Pelargonium zonale). After two day’s feeding period the acceptor plants were sprayed with an insecticide (deltametrin) and kept in a vector free greenhouse until assessment. Thirty five days later the plants were also checked by DAS ELISA. Results and discussion According to our preliminary studies the larvae of the T. tabaci could acquire the virus from Galinsoga parviflora and Stellaria media. The larvae acquire the virus from the biennial and perennial herbaceous plants and the over wintered adults infect the further plants in spring, especially in the time of transplantation of young tobacco, tomato or pepper seedlings (Jenser et al., 2003). G. parviflora and S. media frequently grow in the fields of tobacco, potato, tomato and pepper, in the surroundings of the greenhouses and tunnel-type greenhouses in the second half of summer. It is suspected that these two species serve major sources for the perpetuation of TSWV. F. occidentlis is not able to overwinter in the field, under our continental climatic conditions (Jenser, 1990; Trdan et al., 2003) except the Mediterranean region. However,</p><p id="Pg96">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 97 following its spread the epidemics of TSWV in Hungary markedly increased in the greenhouses, causing severe yield losses in the forced pepper and tomato cultures (Gáborjányi et al., 1995). Weeds are always important as virus and insect vector reservoirs for several crop diseases. Surveys made in Hungary’s tobacco plantation areas determined the more abundant reservoir plants of TSWV. About hundred plant samples representing 29 species were analysed. Most of the studied plants were symptomless. Among the tested weeds Asclepias syriaca and Sonchus arvensis were identified as new natural host of TSWV. Beside TSWV other viruses can also occur on these species. Formerly Asclepias syriaca as a new aggressive weed proved to be a reservoir of Alfalfa mosaic virus and Tobacco mosaic virus (Kazinczi et al., 1999, 2002). Other natural hosts of TSWV were listed by Takács et al. 2006. By the spread of Sonchus arvensis in crop plantations means a new threat in epidemics of TSWV. Development of feasible control procedures has been difficult because TSWV has an extensive plant host range. It has been demonstrated, that some weed species play an essential role in the epidemiology of TSWV. Therefore the nutrition and control of weeds the fields is a basic agro technical prevention method against virus infection of crops (Holb, 2005a, b; Takács et al., 2005, Nádasy and Nádasy, 2006). The epidemics of TSWV depend from the vector activity and the climatic conditions of the years. In 2007 the vector activity and infection rate was relatively low. We have demonstrated that thrips transmission of TSWV using Thrips tabaci vector between tobacco and different plants (Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Pelargonium zonale) was also possible. A thorough understanding of interrelationships between virus, insect vectors, crops and reservoir hosts is necessary for development of effective management procedures, which needs further studies.

Introduction Grape and vine production has approximately two thousand years traditions in Hungary. In 2006 grape plantations covered about 72 thousand hectares, and the yield reached 551 thousand tons. By the new plantations new wines of the region, resistant varieties are preferred. The cultivation of new varieties means a threat of new pests and diseases. Grapevine productions have serious pathological problems, especially the grapevine degeneration and the ESCA disease causing the early decline of grape stocks. Some of them could be solved by the changing of rootstock varieties (Cseh et al., 2006), but the problem of virus disease remained unsolved. The main object of our present study was to collect all information’s about the viruses still occurred in Hungary in the past and to call the attention of the possibilities of new pathogens to be expected. Materials and methods With considerable experience, several other diseases can be reliably diagnosed based on field symptoms. With most grapevine virus diseases, diagnostic symptoms only occur during certain times of the year (Weber et al., 2002). ELISA is a sensitive, accurate and rapid detection method. One limitation to ELISA testing is those antiserums have not been produced for all grapevine viruses (Weber et al., 2002). To the serological test one can choose a lot of products, but for us the more often use kits were from Loewe Biochemica (Takács et al., 2006, Horváth et al., 2007). The most sensitive molecular method for pathogen detection currently available is PCR. Commercial PCR testing is currently available for many pathogens of grapevines (Weber et al., 2002). Results and discussion Until now fifteen virus diseases have been reported in Hungary. Half of them are soilborne pathogens, transmitted by nematode vectors. Soil-borne viruses can reduce crop yield and their impact is particularly acute in the degeneration and early decline of vine stocks. The second half part of the viruses spread by aphids and mealy bugs and the remaining group of viruses whose mode of transmission is not known. Diseases of grapevine caused by different groups of viruses, transmissibility, first descriptions and first occurrence of the pathogens in Hungary are listed in Table 1. By the intensive exchange of propagation materials new virus diseases are also expected. Table 1. does not contain a few grapevine diseases previously considered as virus diseases caused by prokaryote micro-organisms, like flavescence dorée, Pierce’s disease or stolbur. The occurrences of these diseases are not fully demonstrated in Hungary.</p><p id="Pg99">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 100 Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 101 Grapevine fanleaf virus The soil-borne nepovirus (GFLV) causal agent of grapevine fanleaf degeneration disease together with other nepoviruses, causing yield losses of up to 80%, poor fruit quality and reduced grapevine longevity. This soil-borne virus can cause rapid death of young plants or a progressive decline, over several years (Lehoczky és Reichart, 1968). Symptoms are: double and short internodes, abnormal branching and fasciations, zigzag growth. On the leaves enlarged petiolar sinus, primary veins having the shape of a fan, blade often asymmetrical, with acute denticulation, irregular veins and various patterns of chlorotic mottles (Bovey et al., 1980). GFLV is naturally transmitted by Xiphinema index. Through grapevine seeds have been reported in 1996 (Lázár, 1996). GFLV- Yellow mosaic strain Yellow mosaic is caused on grapevine leaves by GFLV virus strains. GFLV- Vein banding strain A vein banding symptom causes other strain of GFLV. Arabis mosaic virus Symptoms are similar to those of fanleaf, and mixed infections with fanleaf may occur. Nematodes, Xiphinema diversicaudatum, Longidorus caespiticola and seeds can transmit ArMV. (Brunt et al., 1996) Grapevine chrome mosaic virus Vines infected by GCMV lack vigour, bear little or no crop and tend to decline and die within 5- 6 years after infection (Lehoczky és Reichart, 1968). Transmission by Xiphinema index is doubtful (Brunt et al., 1996). Tomato black ring virus TBRV induces conspicuous pattern of some rather big yellow rings and blotches on the leaves, later, in the following years, symptoms are reduced and only small yellow spots appear consistently on them (Lehoczky, Burgyán, 1986). The spread of TBRV occurs through seeds, grafting and the Longidorus attenuatus (Brunt et al., 1996). Grapevine Bulgarian latent virus It’s latent in some cultivars, but it has also been isolated from grapevine varieties with reduced growth and fanleaf-like symptoms too (Pocsai, 1981). GBLV can be regarded as a likely member of the nepovirus group, although its vector is not known. (Bovey et al., 1980). Conclusions Because of vegetative propagation grapevine plantations the danger of virus infection is constant and the possibility of the appearance of new diseases is relatively high. Therefore the correct identification of viruses has an essential role. The use of virus-free propagation materials is an important factor to improve quality and volume of grape production (Lázár et al., 2002).

Besides the control combinations (not treated with lime), a lime-dose calculated upon the Hungarian Liming Recommendation System (that is based on the hydrolytic acidity) and the half of this dose resp. were added to the treatment combinations. A year later, soil samples were taken from each sites and plots, and a pot-experiment on the basis of Mitscherlich was set up, with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a test plant. In this work the yield and element composition of plants grown on limed and not limed soils will be compared. These experiments confirm the results of former experiments that state, that the lime amount calculated from the hydrolytic acidity is excessive. Keywords: acidic soil, hydrolytic acidity, liming, perennial ryegrass, pot experiment Introduction Soil acidity as a consequence of anthropogenic loadings and natural processes has a negative influence on soil parameters. This problem became more and more serious with the intensive fertilizer-application through the years, and more than the half of Hungarian soils are affected by it. The knowledge of the exact value of soil acidity is important for the estimation of lime requirement, thus the amelioration and protection of soils (Várallyay, 2006; Husti, 2006). In Hungary, just like in many other countries of the world, the CaCO3 amount needed to ameliorate acid soils is calculated by considering their hydrolytic acidity (HAC1). In this measurement the acidity of the equilibrium solution of the soil’s Ca-acetate extract is quantified (Kappen, 1929). The other parameter, that is currently used to define the lime-requirement of soils is the soil plasticity index (KA) according to Arany (Filep, 1999), which refers to the amount of organic and inorganic colloids in the soil, as well. However, many experiments suggest, that the lime-requirement calculated upon this method is not always appropriate (Zsuposné, 2005). Liming can significantly modify the organic and inorganic nitrogencontent of sandy soils (Filep et al., 2002). Changes in soil pH can influence the availability of nutrients, and through this the yield of plants (Kádár, 2007). The longterm effect of liming can be different on soils with different characteristics (Kátai, 2006, Prokisch et al., 2007). To reveal the long-term effect of liming, we set up field and (on their basis) pot experiments as well. . In this work the dry matter production and Ca-, P-, K-, S-, Cu- and Fe-content of ryegrass grown in pot experiments on – with and without lime treated – soil samples from the previous year field experiment will be compared.</p><p id="Pg103">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 104 Materials and methods For the basic field-experiment 3 sites with low or even extreme low soil pH value were chosen from the north eastern part of Hungary. The most important soil properties of these sites are presented in Table 1. The experiments had 3 treatments in 4 replications in randomised plot design. The area of each plot was 0.1 ha. The treatments were the determined full and the half lime demand. The lime dose was calculated by the following formula: lime dose = 0.0174*KA*HAC1 (t ha -1), where KA is the upper limit of plasticity and HAC1 is the hydrolytic acidity. The liming material was sugar industry sludge with 80 % of CaCO3 content. The plots were treated during the spring of 2006. Exactly a year after we set up the field-experiment, we took soil samples from all layers of each parcel, so that we could use them in the pot-experiment. In the pot-experiment we used Mitscherlich-pots. We added 2.5 kg air dry state soil and 40 mg kg-1 N (in form of NH4NO3-solution) per each pot. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was used as test plant. The above ground biomass was cut after 28 days, then the dry matter production per pot was weighed. The determination of plant element concentrations was carried out with ICP-AES method after cc. HNO3 + H2O2 digestion in the laboratory of RISSAC. For data evaluation 2 and 3 factor ANOVA was used.

Regarding, that the interaction between liming and soil site was also significant, it has to be considered, that liming had a different effect on different soils. Table 2.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 105 From the data of Table 2 it can be stated, that at soil site Álmosd 1 half dose of liming material did not have any effect, while lime dose calculated to the Hungarian Liming Recommendation System had a depressive effect on the yield. Similar tendencies were observed in case of soil site Álmosd 2, but at this site the half dose of liming material has already had a yield-reducing effect. The tendencies were different at Vasmegyer soil site, which is characterized by the extremely high acidity. At this site treatments with lime increased yield, especially the higher lime dose resulted in yield increment. Ca content of plants (Table 3) was primarily determined by soil site makings, still the positive effect of liming was also dominant. At all three soil sites it can be stated, that half dose of liming material increased the Ca content of plants intensely. In comparison to this, the full dose did not have a more expressed effect. K content of plants also depends mostly on soil site, but liming had a significant effect, as well: at both sites of Álmosd 1 and 2 the K uptake decreased according to liming. This can be explained by the antagonism between ions. Table 3.

The availability of P was decreased by adding the smaller amount of liming material, while full dose resulted in the destruction of P supplement of plants at each soil sites (Table 4). Table 4.

Soil sites had an influence on the S uptake of plants. In this paper we can only introduce the results – concerning the microelement content of plants – of copper and iron (Table 5). From the data of the table it can be stated that liming had no effect on the uptake of these elements, but their concentration in plants was determined by the soil site. Table 5.

The calculation estimates the lime requirement at soils with moderate acidity and low plasticity much higher, than needed. Adding this amount of liming material at these soil sites can result in the depression of the yield and disorders in the nutrient uptake. Our experiments also confirm the results of Csathó (2001).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 107 EFFECTS OF GREEN MANURE PLANTS ON SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT AND SOIL PENETRATION RESISTANCE Péter MIKÓ – Csaba GYURICZA – Petra FÖLDESI Institute of Crop Production, Szent István University, Gödöllő Abstract: The water use and impact on soil penetration resistance of various green manure plants used as main and secondary crops were examined under unfavourable field conditions in Gödöllő. As a result of the research it can be concluded that green manure plants exert considerable impact on deeper soil layers as well. Keywords: green manuring, green manure plants, soil moisture content, soil penetration resistance Introduction The value of agricultural by-products is continuously increasing. On the one hand, this is beneficial as thanks to the „green revolution” an increasing amount of bio-energy is used. On the other, it has negative effects as a growing amount of organic matter is removed from the land. Livestock numbers have considerably decreased in recent decades, as a result of which agricultural areas suffer from a lack of manure. This deficiency is made worse by the fact that stalk residues are taken from the land to ever larger extents, thus depriving it from any remaining source of organic material. The way that organic matter removed from the land is fairly considerable. In an average year in the case of winter wheat can be planned with 4-5 tons of seed grain it amounts to almost 4 tons of straw while in the case of corn assuming an average yield of 6-8 t ha-1 and 1015 tons of straw yield can be obtained (Antal, 2000). Although the nutrient needs of plants can be supplied with artificial fertilizers in the short run, soils do not even receive the other necessary nutrients in this form. In 2006 in Hungary total artificial fertilizer use was 76 kg active substance for 1 ha of arable land, and 64% of this was N, 16% P and 20% K (KSH, 2008). In the long run, maintaining adequate soil structure, and improving compacted or dispersed soil cannot be carried out without regular input of organic matter. This is important not only for economic but also for environmental protection reasons (Birkás, 2007; Birkás et al., 2005; Birkás et al., 2006; Birkás et al., 2007; Gyuricza et al,. 2007). Green manuring is an excellent way to improve organic matter provision. Green manuring as a method to improve soil structure, exploring nutrients and maintaining soil productivity was pushed to the background in recent decades. However, nowadays, the land area devoted to growing green manure crops has started growing again and it exceeded 33 000 hectares in 2007 (Bojtárné, 2007). Green manure plants have a beneficial impact on the physical and biological condition of the soil as they improve water management, increase organic matter content and decrease water and wind erosion damages. Since they are fast-growing, they take up a considerable amount of nitrogen from the soil and thus prevent its leaching and preserve it for the next crop (Gyárfás, 1953; Westsik, 1965; Kahnt, 1986; Antal, 1993; Hansen et al., 1997; Lazányi, 2000; Barczi et al., 2005; Gyuricza et al., 2006). Materials and methods The green manuring experiments were carried out in the Szent István University Demonstration Farm for Plant Cultivation in 2006 and 2007. In the summer of 2006</p><p id="Pg107">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 108 secondary crop and in the spring of 2007 main crop green manure experiments were set up. In 2006 seven treatments were repeated 3 times. The following plants were studied: phacelia, mustard, oil radish, forage rape, buckwheat, and spring vetch. The control plot was unsown and kept weed-free. In 2007 nine treatments were repeated 3 times: phacelia, mustard, oil radish, forage rape, buckwheat, spring vetch, lupin and melilot were sown. The control plot was left as stubble field. The soil of the experimental area is rusty-brown forest soil formed on sand with poor nutrient supply. There was no significant difference between the experimental plots used in the two years in terms of physical and chemical soil properties. The preceding crop was winter wheat in both years. During the experiment soil physical, phenological and internal constituent tests were conducted. Soil penetration resistance and soil moisture content measurements were taken in the flowering crops prior to turning the green manure under in October 2006 and June 2007. Soil penetration resistance was measured for each 10 cm layer up until the depth of 50 cm. Soil moisture content was measured to the depth of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm in 2006, while in 2007 it was measured at each 10 cm going as deep as 50 cm. Results were analyzed statistically applying one factor analysis of variance (Baráthné et al., 1996). Results and discussion Out of all the plants examined, mustard, oil radish and spring vetch were entirely weed free. In the case of phacelia, forage rape and buckwheat, weed coverage was minimal. For melilot, due to slower plant growth, and for lupin, due to lower stand density, around 10% weed coverage was observed. Examining soil moisture content at the secondary crop experiments in 2006, we found significantly less water content both in upper (0-20 cm; LSD5%=1.2 %) and the lower (20-40 cm; LSD5%=1.0 %) layers related to the control plot. The moisture content values for the 0-40 cm soil layer are depicted in Figure 1. According to Gyuricza et al. (2006), soil moisture content in the soil below the green manure secondary crop can that be as much as 3-5% lower than that in stubble field soil. With the exception of phacelia plots there was no significant difference found in any of the soil layers, in the 2007 experiment for main crops, a significantly less soil moisture content values were assessed compared to the control (LSD5%=0.9; 1.2; 0.9; 1.0; 1.1 %) to the depth of 2030 cm and below. Moreover, we observed a significant difference in the case of mustard, oil radish, forage rape and lupin regarding to the depth of 0-10 cm. Examining the moisture content results for the 10-20 cm layer, with the exception of phacelia and mustard, all other plants showed significant differences compared to the control variant. Moisture content values for the 0-50 cm soil layer are shown in Figure 2. Examining soil penetration resistance, in 2006 for all plants there were one or two layers where significantly higher soil penetration resistance was found related to the control variant (LSD5%= 1.1; 0.9; 0.6; 0.8; 1.5 MPa). However, for oil radish, forage rape, buckwheat and spring vetch this difference can only be obtained for deeper soil layers. In 2007, with the exception of oil radish, all plants indicated significantly larger soil penetration resistance in several layers than that of the control that was not covered by crops. In the case of phacelia, this significantly larger difference was observed in the upper two layers of the soil, for mustard in the upper four ones, and for buckwheat, rape, vetch, melilot and lupin for all layers (LSD5%= 0.4; 0.4; 0.5; 0.4; 0.3 MPa).</p><p id="Pg108">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 110 Conclusions It was stated that all assessed plant species can be cultivated both as main and secondary crops. Compared to the unplanted control, green manure plants utilize considerably more water at the given site conditions. However, a part of this moisture is returned when the plants are inverted into the soil. In addition, while those provide cover and are used as mulch, the evaporation rate can effectually be reduced. Green manure plants take up and retain significant amounts of nutrients, thus preventing the leaching to the deeper layers. The plots covered by crops as a result of which the soil is significantly drier, plants can efficiently draw water from deeper layers as well. It can be concluded that following inverting, a few weeks need to pass for the moisture content of the plant-covered soil to reach values similar to the control. While a drier soil can difficulty be tilled during the drought periods, for this reason, it is advisable not to plant new crops directly after the ploughing in of green manure plants. The reasons for significantly greater soil penetration resistance can be corresponded to drier soil and the pressure exerted on the soil by root growth. In order for steady plant growth as well as for producing adequate amounts of biomass on soils that are poor in nutrients, an extra supply of nutrients needs to be provided as relying solely on the nutrient content of the soil an appropriate impact cannot be exerted.

Troubsko, CZ 3 Department of Agrochemistry, Soil Science, Microbiology and Plant Nutrition, MUAF, CZ 4 Department of Food Technology, MUAF, CZ 5 Research Institute of Brewing and Malting, Plc., Malting Institute in Brno, CZ Abstract: Root system size (RSS) was measured in 6 barley varieties using electrical capacitance. Estimates of RSS were taken twice during plant development: 3 tillers detectable (RSS1) and middle of heading (RSS2). The barley varieties were assessed during three years on the Žabčice (N49°01´ E16°36´) site (CZ). Grain yield (t.ha -1 ), nutrients uptake by grain (kg), and their relationships to RSS were evaluated (correlation coefficient). The variety share in the RSS variability was 9% to 12%. A negative correlation between RSS2 and the yield (r=-0.237**), and between RSS2 and P, K, Ca and Mg uptake (r=-0.272***, -0.229**, -0.197*, -0.322***) were found. A negative dependence of RSS1 on the N uptake by grain (r=-0.202 ** ) was established. Keywords: root capacity, barley, nutrients uptake, grain, yield Introduction Root system is an important plant part that fulfils many physiologically vital functions. Meanwhile, it is an apparatus that reacts sensitively to every change of environment. The root system architecture affects the level of stress caused by drought and therefore, participates on the plant’s competition and survival ability in a given environment (Santrucek, 1998). The issue of the relationship between roots and environment was studied by many authors. The main topics of the studies have been the effects of abiotic and biotic stresses (Chloupek et al., 2006). However, one unanswered question remains: how large should the root system be in relation to the environment, yield and quality? King et al. (2003), for example, engaged in modelling the optimum root system sizes (RSS) of cereals. Gorny and Larsson (1989) claim that a larger RSS is a yield stabilizing factor because during critical periods, it is able to supply the plant with water and nutrients from deeper soil layers. According to King et al. (2003), the grain crops yield is connected to the number of roots in deeper-seated layers, which also means that the yield is related to a relatively larger RSS. However, in the optimum environmental conditions, a bigger RSS may consume photosynthetic products. According to Szymanska (1989), highly yielding varieties generally have physiologically more active root systems. The aim of this study was to establish the relationships among the spring barley yield, the nutrients uptake by grain, and RSS. Materials and methods Plant material and environments In 2005-2007, RSS values of six spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) varieties – ´Bojos´ (CZ), ´Jersey´ (NL), ´Kompakt´ (SK), ´Malz´ (CZ), ´Sebastian´ (DK) and ´Tolar´ (CZ) were measured during three growth stages (BBCH 23 – RSS1 and BBCH 55 – RSS2) on the Žabčice site (CZ; average altitude 179, N49°01´ E16°36´) – Table 4. The</p><p id="Pg111">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 112 harvested grain yield was determined (Table 1), and after mineralization (H2SO4 + H2O2), the macroelements content was also established (Table 3), N was assessed according to Kjeldahl, P spectrophotometrically and K, Ca and Mg by AAS. Based on the results, the evaluation of RSS in relation to the yield and nutrients uptake by grain was carried out (Table 2). Evaluation of RSS and statistical evaluation RSS was evaluated on the basis of its electrical capacity (Chloupek, 1977) measured by the means of the LCR meter ELC-131D (frequency 1 kHz). The results were assessed by the analysis of variance and by the general liner regression analysis (SchabenbergerPierce, 2002). The influence of genotype was evaluated by Tuckey test. The calculations were conducted in the GenStat system version 9. Results and discussion Grain yield and root capacity The selected varieties differed in their yield potential and in their real yield in individual years. To compare their performances in relation to RSS, the varieties’ order in each year as well as the total order was established (Table 1). On average, a higher yield was achieved by the ´Sebastian´ variety. However, this variety belonged to those with smaller root capacities (Table 4). High yield was also found in the ´Bojos´ variety that had relatively low RSS1, but it had the highest RSS2. The lowest average yield was established in the ´Jersey´ variety that had always been considered a relatively high RSS variety. The ´Jersey´ variety’s low yield may be the result of, for example, its low compensation ability under stress conditions (Martinkova et al., 2007). A negative relationship between RSS2 and the grain yield was proved (r=-0.237). This implies that a large root system of a barley plant presents a competitive sink during the last third of vegetation. A genetic factor plays a role, too (Sharma et al., 2007), the varietal share on the RSS value variability was 4-16%. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 114 Macroelements content in the grain and root capacity Significant differences among the varieties were found in their uptake of basic macroelements (Table 3). For example, the value of the nitrogen uptake did not always correspond with the root capacity. The ´Bojos´ variety had the highest N uptake and the biggest RSS2. On the contrary, the ´Jersey´ variety showed the second biggest RSS1 and RSS2 values but the lowest N uptake by grain. During vegetative growth, the required nutrients are supplied mainly by roots, and nitrogen in particular is used for forming of the photosynthetic apparatus. Nitrogen accumulation in the plants usually peaks in the flowering period (Hejnak, Ernestova, 2007). During the reproduction growth stage, the root activity and nutrients uptake generally decrease, mainly as a result of the falling carbohydrate supply to the roots, so the remobilization of mineral nutrients is particularly important (Marschner, 2003). This finding was confirmed by the negative correlations between RSS and nutrients uptakes by grain in the heading phase. Conclusion The results show varietal variability of RSS. A conclusive difference in nutrients uptake by plants was found. The RSS and yield comparison indicated that a large RSS does not necessarily correspond with a high yield or a high nutrients uptake. For a more complex understanding of the RSS and yield relationship, it will be appropriate to extend RSS monitoring to other vegetation phases.

The prosperity of the beef industry depends on both political and economic conditions. The political climate can alter growing by imposing regulations that control operations or by directly or indirectly subsidizing production. The social and environmental role of the beef cattle sector is equally important: sustaining rural populations and countryside. In the last 10 years however, beef production in Europe has been declining, mainly due to disease crises and the consequent reduction in demand. Extensive farming most commonly refers to cattle and sheep farming in areas with low agricultural productivity. With extensive farming we can use little inputs during the cattle fattening without using industrial technologies debiting our environment, while the quality of the meadows getting better, furthermore with these technologies we can fulfill the requirements of the animal welfare. Keywords: extensive farming, beef cattle, meadow, environment Introduction The agriculture is not only for getting income for the people who do it, not means simply work, livelihood but it is much more complex. The agriculture was always much more than just a sector. Beyond the food, and raw material producing function, the agriculture has other functions like landscape, soil, waters, environment support and protection; furthermore it gives livelihood and work for the people, and community of the rural areas. World demand for beef is increasing more rapidly than supply, and this is true with few exceptions, for both developed and developing countries. In the future there is a possibility to expect an increasing gap between supply and demand for this commodity. Regulations have made the position of the slaughter cattle sector very difficult in Hungary. Subsidies appropriated for quality production did not prove adequate for producing bulls of high-quality meat in Hungary. The absence of a live cattle export subsidy also keeps prices of quality beef low. Introducing income subsidies for beef cows can be regarded a positive step. However, further measures need to be taken to encourage the development of quality beef production. The extensive beef cattle keeping can be an answer for the pressure on the farmers who have to satisfy the high quality standards and the demands of the environmental rules. With this extensive farming practise the meadows and the grasslands can be used effectively but not in an overused way. The quality of these areas can be developed in a sustainable way, without the destruction of the biodiversity of the grasslands. In Hungary the environment sensitive areas, and some other places are subsidized by the EU and the government. Materials and methods In this study I made a short review on the Hungarian state of the meadows, grasslands, and the possibilities of the extensive beef cattle keeping. My study is based a short</p><p id="Pg115">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 116 review on the national issue papers prepared by national and foreign experts and deductive data basis analysis on statistical databases like the Hungarian KSH, FAO, and USDA. Results and discussion Hungary has adopted an integration program before we joined to the European Union, to fulfil the EU requirements on the environmental standards. This program included the introduction and the development and of an Agri-Environmental Program (NAEP). Regional programs like environmentally sensitive areas or zonal schemes have welldefined geographical boundaries that delimitate non-protected or partly protected areas valuable for nature conservation. The main aim here is to protect, and enhance the natural habitats and values, furthermore maintenance the high natural value farming. There have been remarkable subsidies in Hungary since 2004, for the development of the agricultural environment. More than 26,000 farmers are supported over a five-year period. This support was amounted more than 44 billion HUF in 2005. These lands are cultivated on environmentally sound management. The size of these areas was about 153,000 hectares in the year when the Hungarian government launched the ESA program in 2002. In this year 10 ESA programs were launched, and more annually. 10 most important ESA was prepared with a detailed database for the pilot areas. Present –days this area has grown to almost one and half million hectares, now it is about 179,500 hectares. The National Agri- Environmental Program (NAEP) 2000- 2004 gave the framework for the comfortable, sustainable and ecology- based land use in Hungary. The Development Plan (NRDP) 2004- 2006 was the next milestone in the life of the project, and the last was launched in 2007 the New Hungary Rural Development Programme (NHRDP), and it will last until 2013. The New Hungary Rural Development Programme contains support measures targeting, the sustainable agricultural land use, like less favoured area payments, Natura 2000 payments and others. In this programme they promoting the extensive cultures like grassland and forage crops on the environmentally sensitive areas enhancing the environment-concious farming and sustainable landscape use. The following figure shows the network of the environment sensitive areas in Hungary.

Figure 2 : Diagam of the lands of Hungary Source: own diagram from KSH database The Hungarian grasslands have outstanding nature conservation importance in European scale. The share of the grasslands in Hungary is about 11% of the whole land. Most of them are “secondary” grasslands, which mean they were formed in the past few thousand years due to the considerate land use methods. Their maintenance and the preservation of their rich biodiversity depend on the human use in the future too. The social changes of the past few decades did not contribute to the preservation of the grasslands. The European Union supports the extensification of the beef cattle keeping.

Cereal Research Communications 118 Advantages of using extensive beef cattle keeping technology, that the meadows can provide all the nutrients needed by most livestock, and the soil can be fertilized on a natural way, without using chemicals. The prescribed grazing can increase the health of the animals and decreases stress through better management. These lands provide highquality forage to livestock. The meadows give the best forages to match the animals’ needs. The reasonable grazing can raise production potential of the soils, and as the forage gets older, the nutrient content can drop. Pastures should be either grazed or mown for hay to encourage new growth of high-quality forage, furthermore wildlife habitat can be increased with a well-managed grazing system. Conclusions Healthy pasturelands provide livestock products, flood protection, wildlife habitat, purification of air and carbon sequestration. These lands also provide aesthetic value, open space and vital links in the enhancement of rural social stability and economic vigour. For the Hungarian extensive beef cattle keeping it can be an answer for the challenges and the regulations of the European Union. The extensive farming has a good effect on the quality of the meadows, the animal welfare, and the beef quality. With good farm management we can identify our opportunities in extensification and with good farming practice we can encourage diversification and use of sustainable grazing systems.

The trial was set up on three vitisol subtypes: dystric cambisol (pH KCl 3.75), pseudogley (pH KCl 4.68) and rendzina on marl (pH KCl 7.25). Equal fertilization and vine protection were applied in all three vineyards. To determine the level and dynamics of phosphorus in plant material, leaf samples were taken three times in the course of the growing period: at the flowering and veraison stages and at the end of the growing period. Statistical methods used in the present study included correlation and regression/analysis of variance. Regression analysis revealed that vine leaf phosphorus content increases with increasing the soil reaction pH; it starts with 0.02% for each pH unit at the flowering stage and reaches the value of 0.11% at harvest. At all samplings, higher leaf phosphorus contents were found in calcareous soil compared to acid soil. Phosphorus concentrations at the veraison stage were 2 times and at the end of the growing period even 3 times higher in leaves of plants grown on rendzina compared to plants grown on dystric cambisol. These differences may be attributed to better solubility of calcium phosphates in calcareous soils compared to aluminium and iron phosphates in acid soils. Differences in sugar and acid concentrations in must indicate a positive correlation between concentrations of leaf phosphorus and must sugar (R=0.90) and negative correlation between the leaf concentration of phosphorus and must content of acids (R= - 0.89). Keywords: grapevine, phosphorus, soil reaction, leaf, must Introduction Though there are abundant data on the quantitative relation between phosphorus sorption and soil properties, influence of soil properties and phosphorus forms on the kinetics of phosphorus sorption and desorption has been little investigated (Horta and Torrent, 2007). In comparison to other plant nutrients, the mobility of phosphorus in soil is low because of the generally low solubility of phosphate compounds and the strong P–binding capacity of soil components (Kadar, 2007). The main factor determining phosphorus solubility and availability to plants is the soil reaction (pH), that is base saturation of the cation exchange complex. In the conditions of neutral and alkaline pH reaction, different forms of Ca-phosphates prevail in soil, which are more soluble that aluminium and iron phosphates in acid soils (Füleky, 2006). Chemical binding and transformations of soil phosphorus are correlated with soil moisture and temperature (Sárdi et al., 2006). In highly acid soils, secondary clay minerals decompose and free aluminium, iron and manganese ions are formed, which deposit phosphate ions (Jemo et al., 2007) and/or are toxic to vine plants (Smart et al., 1991). Phosphorus inactivation may occur also in calcareous vineyard soil due to high concentration of Ca- ions and high soil reaction pH (Shehata et al., 1996). Although little is known about the influence of phosphorus on vine growth and development, the research results to date point to positive correlation between phosphorus fertilization and phosphorus concentration in vine leaves. Also, the phosphorus content in vine leaves has a significant effect on plant vegetative growth, number of clusters per vinestock and sugar content (Skinner and William, 1988). Assessment of the level of</p><p id="Pg119">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 120 vine phosphorus sufficiency is one of the major problems in vine nutrition with this element. For this reason, the research goal was to determine the impact of soil reaction on phosphorus content and dynamics in grapevine leaves. Use was made of the European criteria for assessment of the level of vine phosphorus sufficiency, which are based on whole leaf analysis in contrast to American criteria according to which only leaf petiole is analyzed (Bravdo, 2007). Materials and methods Investigations were conducted in the Plešivica wine-growing region (North-western Croatia) in 2007. Influence of soil reaction on phosphorus dynamics in vine plants was studied on the variety Sauvignon Blanc (planted on SO4 rootstock), on three vitisol subtypes: dystric cambisol, pseudogley and rendzina on marl. Soil chemical properties were determined in layers at 0-30 and 30-60 cm depths before the trial was set up (after harvest) in 2006, (Table 1). Identical agricultural management practices were applied in all three vineyards. Basic fertilization with 500 kg ha-1 of Hydrocomplex NPK12:11:18 was applied on 28/02/2007. Table 1.

Average leaf samples were formed from 240 healthy, fully developed and undamaged leaves, taken opposite to clusters from 120 vinestocks (3 replicates x 40 vinestocks), on each soil. Soil phosphorus and potassium were determined according to Egner–RiehmDomingo (Egner et al., 1960). Total soil nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method (AOAC, 1995). Exchangeable aluminium in acid soils was determined by the Sokolova method, and the active lime content in calcareous soil was assessed by the Galet method (JDPZ, 1966). Leaf phosphorus was determined upon digestion with concentrated HNO3 (MILESTONE 1200 Mega Microwave Digester) spectrophotometrically (AOAC, 1995). Must sugar content was determined using a digital Refractrometer PR-101, Atago, and the values were expressed as brix percentages. Total acids (TA) in must were determined by the titration method (EEC, 1990). Statistical methods used in this study included correlation and regression/analysis of variance. Prior to their use as regressors, and in order to construct the most informative model, correlation was estimated between all soil variables. P content in leaves was then modelled using the selected soil variable, adding the effect of physiological phase (to respect the differences in P content between phases), as well as their interaction (allowing for the differential response to the soil variable in different phases). Finally,</p><p id="Pg120">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 121 the relationship between harvest P content and must P, sugar, and TA content was examined by correlating them. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2007) procedures CORR and GLM. Results and discussion As seen from the selected statistical model (Graph 1), phosphorus content and dynamics in vine leaves depended significantly on the soil pH as well as on the phenophases of vine plant development. y = 0.020x + 0.0963 y = 0.055x - 0.0003 y = 0.110x - 0.2019 0,1 0,3 0,5 0,7 3 4 5 6 7 8 pHKCl le a f P c o n te n t (% ) flowering véraison harvest Linear (flowering) Linear (véraison) Linear (harvest) Figure1. Effect of soil reaction on phosphorus content and dynamics in vine leaves. In all three phenophases (flowering1, veraison2 and harvest3), higher phosphorus contents were determined in vine leaves on calcareous soil compared to acid soils. Highest leaf phosphorus contents were determined at harvest, and the lowest at the flowering stage in all three soil types. Regression analysis indicated that leaf phosphorus content increases with a rise in soil reaction pH, starting with 0.02% for each pH unit at the flowering stage to reach 0.11% at harvest. These differences may be explained by better phosphorus solubility and availability from calcium phosphates in calcareous soil compared to aluminium and iron phosphates in highly acid soils (Marschner, 1995; Füleky, 2006). Significantly highest phosphorus content in vine leaves (0.60% P/DM) was recorded in calcareous soil at harvest, and the lowest (0.16% P/DM) at the flowering stage in highly acid soil. Phosphorus values determined in vine leaves on dystric cambisol (0.161, 0.182 and 0.223 % P/DM) and pseudogley (0.211, 0.292 and 0.303 % P/DM) are below optimal values (0.25-0.45 % P/DM) reported by Bergmann (1992). According to the same author, the level of vine phosphorus sufficiency on rendzina (0.241,0.392 and 0.603 % P/DM) can be allotted to the category</p><p id="Pg121">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 122 of optimal to rich supply. Besides, investigations have revealed a relationship also between leaf phosphorus content and levels of phosphorus, sugar and total acids (TA) in must (Skinner and William, 1988). Stronger correlation was detected when it was compared with must sugar (R=0.90) and TA(R= - 0.89), while the relationship between leaf and must P was substantially weaker (R=0.64). Must sugar content on dystric cambisol and pseudogley amounted to 23.1% brix, and on rendzina to 26.3% brix. Must content of total acids (TA) ranged from 5.73 g l-1 on rendzina to 7.01 g l-1 on dystric cambisol. Conclusions The presented investigations have shown that soil reaction has a significant effect on phosphorus content and dynamics in vine leaves, and that likewise leaf phosphorus content influences the contents of phosphorus, sugar and total acids in must.

Szeged, Hungary, e-mail: jmatuz@gabonakutato.hu Abstract: Water retention ability and relative water content of excised leaves, post-anthesis stress induced by chemical desiccation and the determination of the canopy temperature were assessed in the nursery to study a wide range of breeding material's cuticular resistance against water loss and translocation ability of stored stem reserves. A mobile automatic rain shelter (MARS) construct was developed in nursery of CRC in Szeged. The MARS, parallel with ideal water supply gives a good chance for field testing of relatively high number of genotypes for drought tolerance. Correlation between the rankings of entries in the different tests however was low. Keywords: winter wheat, breeding, selection for drought tolerance, rain shelter Introduction In all over the world stresses are the most limiting factors in crop production. The improvement of the yields under stress conditions therefore must combine the high yield potential and specific factors, which are able to protect the crop against reductions due to different abiotic and biotic stresses. The most important abiotic stressor in Europe is the shortage of water (=drought). Although there are new sensing methods available (Tamás et al., 2007) drought stress can not be measured precisely in the field. Since drought stress may be different in strength, continuity and timing year after year, the field selection for drought tolerance per se is a difficult project. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a quite stress tolerant species, but even under European conditions (especially in Eastern and Middle Europe) drought may cause remarkable losses in grain yield and quality. In a breeding program for resistance to environmental stresses the most important step is to find a proper selection method by which we can characterize tolerance and susceptibility and we can run an effective selection system. In addition the laboratory and greenhouse tests we need to have fast and reliable field selection methods too (Blum, 1998; Clarke, 1982; Hagyó et al., 2007). Materials and methods Our breeding system is a modified pedigree method, based on manual crossing, head selection from F2 generation until uniform head-rows are available. Generally from F4 generation information yields trials, later four-replicated yield trials, and at last multilocation performance tests help selecting the best ones among the advanced lines. From the generation of F5 quality tests and parallel scoring in rust and virus nurseries (under provocative conditions) give additional information for the successful selection (fig. 1.) In the younger, segregating generations (F3-F5) visual scoring of morphological and phenological characters is the only effective method to evaluate the large number of genotypes (10000-20000 accessions per year) of drought tolerance. The most important traits that may be checked visually are leaf firing, leaf rolling, leaf color under serious stress, the hairiness or glaucosity of the leaves, kernel size and healthiness. Fast seedling emergence, rapid phenological development in spring, earliness in heading,</p><p id="Pg123">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 124 Figure 1.Selecting methods included in a Pedigree breeding program anthesis and maturity are also advantageous parameters when the goal is drought tolerance. Several researchers reported that the high initial leaf water content and the low rate of water loss due to the desiccation were related to the drought resistance and may be used as a selection method (Clarke, 1982). According to this method flag leaves are harvested from the field early in the morning. After keeping them in a controlled environment room for 8 hours their weight will be measured again and after a total</p><p id="Pg124">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 125 desiccation the dry weight of the leaves was determined. From these data the total loss of initial water content could be defined. We determined the actual water relations of the different genotypes by the determination of their actual relative water content (RWC) two times (at late boot stage and after heading of the most genotypes). RWC was determined by their fresh weight (FW), turgid weight (TW-after a 24 hrs incubation on wet filter paper in Petri-dishes), and dry weight (DW) by this formula: (FWDW)/(TW-DW) x 100 (%). Water retention ability (WRA) have been determined from the relative water content of the fresh (RWC1) and the desiccated (RWC2) flag leaf from this formula: WRA= RWC1/RWC2 x100% By the chemical desiccation we can model a lethal post-anthesis water stress and check the plants` ability to support grain filling by translocated stem reserves (Blum, 1998). Desiccant (2% NaClO3 solution) spraying is done 14 days after anthesis of each entry. Kernels weight reductions due to the post-anthesis stress assessed by comparing treated and control plots for each entry. Canopy temperature has been considered to be effective in screening wheat genotypes for drought tolerance since tolerant genotypes can maintain photosynthesis (and evaporation) longer (Winter et al. 1988). Canopy temperature is measured on the control plots (irrigated) and under the automatic rain shelter (stressed) by infrared thermometer (Crop Trak, Spectrum Technologies Inc.) at midday to test the genotypes’ dehydration avoidance since tolerant ones can keep their flag leaves cooler. Results and discussion The water retention capacity of the excised flag leaves is an important characteristic under water-prone conditions, so by measuring this trait we can compare hundreds of lines within a short period of time. Since the stomata close immediately after excision, water loss can only be decreased by the cuticle. In this case morphological traits like leaf pubescence or the presence of epicuticular wax will have special importance. In water retention ability we have found a variation of 20 - 79 % water loss in relative water content of the excised leaves after the 8-h desiccation. This method can test the cuticular resistance (=dehydration avoidance) of the flag leaves only and no correlation was found with the results of the other tests. Determining the canopy temperature is a very fast screening method, by which single measurements can be made within a few seconds. Even hundreds of genotypes can be measured easily. However, the results can be affected by numerous factors such as wind, moving clouds, the angle of the equipment, the density of the canopy etc. so the results must be based on several replications and a lot of control measurements (on check genotypes). The most informative results can be obtained by carrying out an irrigation trial which enables us to compare the canopy temperature (=photosynthetic activity) of each genotype under both stressed (under the automatic rain shelter) and stress-free conditions. In canopy temperature we could find a moderate variation among genotypes (22 - 25 ºC). Due to the desiccant treatment wheat varieties differed in a range of 17 - 55 % reduction of kernel mass and this response was correlated with the response to the late season drought among the genotypes tested.</p><p id="Pg125">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 126 These selection methods are applied in our conventional winter wheat breeding program. In younger, segregating generations (in head-rows of F3 - F5 generations) we select on the base of the visual scoring of morphological and phenological characteristics that are advantageous under dry conditions. This selection process is running parallel with the yield tests. At the end of the breeding procedure not more than 60-70 lines are tested in our multi-location (ten locations in the country) yield performance network and under irrigation, too. In this network we can check our lines’ performance under different climatic and soil conditions. This breeding procedure indirectly appropriate for the better understanding of the effects of different soil conditions on yield under drought too. The collected and recorded information helps us in decisions to find the best genotypes. At last among the high yielding and stress tolerant lines we will find the most tolerant and productive ones which could perform well under sub-optimal soil and climatic conditions. The advance in drought tolerance can be found among our latest registered wheat varieties and numerous new winter wheat candidates with a higher level of adaptability to dry environments. Bread wheat varieties: GK Jászság (1999), GK Szálka (2000), GK Ati, (2001), GK Csongrád (2001) GK Békés (2005) GK Csillag (2005) GK Hunyad (2005) are reputed tolerant, and performed very well under stress conditions, too. Conclusions There is no single selection method for achieving progress in drought tolerance. A breeding program can be successful by using the appropriate combination of different selection criteria. The best way of accumulating different genes which are advantageous under stress conditions is the recurrent selection. These selection methods are applied in our conventional winter wheat breeding program. The above-mentioned tests are carried out at the very start of the breeding among the crossing partners and at the very end of it, namely among the advanced lines before entering them in official yield performance trials. By this way we can find the most tolerant and productive candidates which will perform well even under sub-optimal soil and climatic conditions.

Szeged, Hungary, web:www.gabonakutato.hu, e-mail: fonadp@gabonakutato.hu Abstract: Wheat quality is highly influenced by soil and weather factors such as the amount and pattern of the precipitation during grain harvest. Wet gluten (WG) and protein content (PC), gluten spreading (GS), Hagberg falling number (FN), farinographic value (FV), ICC stability and hardness index (HI) of 13 commercially grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were measured during a two year (2006, 2007) period in Szeged, Southern Hungary to estimate the effect of delayed harvest on the flour quality. Results proved that damages emerged in the rheological parameters due to late harvest are different in the years studied. We did not observe a coherent trend in changes of most of the traits in the current study. Even, contrary to the expectation, FV and GS showed raise in one year in delayed harvest. Other features like PC and HI were decreased in value. Results proved that delayed harvest along with harvest-time rains is able to produce a serious stress position of grain traits in wheat cultivars but the volume of quality degradation depends strongly on the cultivar and the climatic condition of the given year. Keywords: harvest loss, gluten, baking quality, environmental factors, flour properties, rheology Introduction Wheat yield quantity and quality is influenced by genotypic and environmental factors. Inconsistent crop years (i.e. dry soil conditions before anthesis, heat shock and harvesttime rains associated with delayed harvest) may cause unexpected stresses in nutritional status of the plant along with problems of grain and flour quality (Bona et al., 2002; Gooding et al., 2003). In extreme dry and hot season, because the specific plant-soil interaction, even the otherwise favorable nutrient status of the soil can not be realized by the plant root system resulting unexpected quality traits (Hagyó et al 2007). The highest quality can be reached in the waxen ripeness phase of the wheat under optimum soil and weather conditions. Because of the unfavorable weather and soil conditions in ripening period many farmers can start the harvest later than optimum time. The aim of this research was to find how the late harvest impacts the most important baking properties of the wheat in two different crop years in. Materials and methods In 2006 and 2007, 13 winter wheat cultivars were tested for flour quality parameters. The cultivars originated from the Cereal Research NPC, (GK) Szeged, Hungary: Kalász, Ati, Garaboly, Békés, Csillag and Élet were from the early, Tisza, Petur, Hattyú, Piacos and Jubilejnaja-50 were from the medium and Holló was from the late maturity group. The cultivars were also represented different quality classes with excellent (Ati, Békés and Tisza ), medium (Garaboly, Petur etc.) and poor level of baking quality (Hattyú). Agronomical- and soil conditions were highly appropriate for wheat production in both years except the very dry and hot weather in 2007. Harvest times were 4th of July (optimum) and 20th of July (delayed) in 2006, 7th of July (optimum) and 4th of August (delayed) in 2007. In 2006, there was a downpour with 27 mm of precipitation between the two harvests. In 2007, there was an extremely hot July with insignificant rain (6 mm) between the optimum and delayed harvests. Grain samples were cleaned in an air flow separator. The extraction rates, wet gluten and protein</p><p id="Pg127">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Hardness index (HI) was calculated by SKCS (Perten) method. Results and discussion On the average, there were no significant changes in the PC of the cultivars in 2006; however some cultivars i.e. Békés and Holló suffered great loss (Fig. 1.). Some cultivars (Ati, Kalász) showed even increases of PC probably due to their thousand kernel mass decrease mostly caused by biotic stresses (i.e. head scab, leaf rust) in 2006. -2,0 -1,5 -1,0 -0,5 0,0 0,5 1,0 K al á sz A ti G ar ab o ly B ék és C si ll ag É le t T is za P et ur H at ty ú P ia co s Ju b il ej na ja -5 0 V er e ck e H o ll ó A v er a ge C h a n g es i n p ro te in c o n te n t, % 2006 2007 Figure 1.

Cultivars Holló and Élet suffered the highest losses for ICC trait. A reverse aspect was found at FN: generally, a decrease was observed due to delayed harvest in 2006 (Fig. 5.). In 2007, however, some cultivars (Tisza, Verecke, Holló) experienced a slight increase in the late harvest.

Extreme soil-climatic conditions may have crucial effect on certain quality parameters like FV and PC. Our results suggest that features like ICC, GS and HI were considerably determined by the cultivar with less effects of the weather. Among the tested cultivars, Verecke, Ati, Tisza, Piacos and Csillag emerged as tolerant ones to the late harvest conditions. References Bona L., Szabo Zs., Acs E. and Hajos Gy. 2002.

László CSEUZ – János MATUZ – Erika ÁCS – Péter FÓNAD – János FALUSI Cereal Researc Non-profit Company – H-6726 Alsókikötő sor 9. Szeged, Hungary, e-mail: laszlo.cseuz@gabonakutato.hu Abstract: Nine winter wheat varieties were tested in a network of a ten location field test series under different environment conditions. Presently many mono- and oligogenic features had been characterized by molecular markers by which the selection for these parameters can be accelerated. On the other hand both the stability of yield and quality - as polygenic - very complex attributes cannot be approached by marker assisted selection technique. The multi-location trial system is the most suitable way to select for these traits. Stability of different quality traits (wet gluten content, gluten stability, kernel hardness, farinograph water absorption, farinograph value, Zeleny-value, falling number) were evaluated to test the varieties’ adaptability to the different location, and year effects. The most significant differences were found in falling number, farinograph water absorption and developing time of dough. Keywords: winter wheat, breeding, selection for drought tolerance, rain shade Introduction Stability of grain yield and technological quality are crucial points in wheat production. Growing wheat under different conditions makes difficult to produce a calculable yield and quality level which is affected by the different years (Matuz et al., 2007) and different locations and agro technical conditions as well (Tóth et al., 2007). Breeding answers these questions by multi-location testing of advanced lines to find the most adaptable ones among the ones with high yield potential and technological quality. In this paper we tried to show this work by which we can make an effective selection for finding the best cultivar with higher level of stability in bread-making quality. Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 132 Materials and methods In both years (2006 and 2007) nine Szeged-origin winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties were tested. Early varieties (GK Kalász, GK Ati, GK Élet, GK Verecke, GK Békés, GK Csillag), medium ripening ones (GK Tisza, GK Petur), and late (GK Holló) cultivars. The multi location trials locations were: Enying, Kocs, Törökszentmiklós, Bóly, Kiszombor (non-treated), Kiszombor (treated with fungicides), Fülöpszállás, Öthalom, Táplánszentkereszt and Szeged-Kecskés breeding station. These locations could present the most typical soil, and weather conditions which characterize Hungary’s wheat growing areas (figure 1.). Genotypes were planted in eight-row plots in four replications in latin-square design. Plot sizes were 6,5 m2. From all locations’ samples - besides the micro testing methods - which hold valuable information (Bóna et al. 2003.) (H.I. studies, diameter, thousand kernel mass (TKM), NIR wet gluten, protein content, falling number, sedimentation tests MSZ ISO 5529) we determined flour yield, wet gluten content (MSZ 6367/12-87), gluten elasticity, and farinograph value (MSZ 6369/6-1988). Of course, we registered the grain yield, too. Results and discussion Kernel hardness of wheat varieties (figure 2.) proved to be a stable character, did not react on crop year effects, no changes happened in category. The effect of locations was more significant in 2007 than in the previous year. Winter wheat cultivar GK Holló was poorer than the rest of the varieties. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 A ti B ék és C si lla g K al ás z T is za É le t V er ec ke P et ur H ol ló K er n el h a rd n es s Minimum Mean Maximum 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 A ti B ék és T is za K al ás z H ol ló C sil la g Pe tu r É let V er ec ke P r o te in c o n te n t, % Minimum Mean Maximum Figure 2.

At the other locations hardly can be found falling number value under 300 seconds (figure 4.). GK Verecke performed excellent in both years. In case of Zeleny value among the tested cultivars in the first year GK Verecke, GK Petur and GK Kalász performed significantly better (41,9 ml 40,3 ml, 39,1 ml), while GK Holló (25,7 ml) did not fit the demand. Significant differences were proved between the two years in wet gluten content. The mean of wet gluten content was 27,8 % in 2006, while 30,7 % in 2007. GK Tisza, among the varieties performed very well in both years with the lowest variability in spite of the very different conditions. GK Ati fit the improver category in 2007. The effect of location was strong. Found very low values in 2006 in Kiszombor and Bóly, in 2007 in Fülöpszállás and Táplánszentkereszt. In case of gluten spreading we found a minimal variation. In 2006, values slightly higher but still acceptable values were registered for milling quality. Water absorption capacity was around the average in 2006. In this year water absorption was 56,7 % while 60,2 % in the year 2007. In 2006 at Kiszombor I., Törökszentmiklós, Táplánszentkereszt and Kocs locations gave 55 % data close to the mean values. The highest values (58,1 %) were registered in the samples from Enying. In this year the lowest cultivar-value (52,6 %) was found in case of GK Petur, while the highest value was 59,8 % in case of GK Békés. If we compare the locations the lowest location-value (58,1 %) was at Fülöpszállás, while the highest (61,9 %) at Enying. Significant differences were found between the two years in farinograph-value too. 2007 was the better year in this field. Lowest deviation was at GK Tisza in 2006, while GK Ati in 2007. GK Békés, GK Tisza, GK Csillag, GK Petur and GK Ati were in category “A” in 2006. In the next year the same genotypes got in category “A” with GK</p><p id="Pg133">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 134 Kalász, GK Verecke and GK Élet too. According to the farinograph value the best location in 2006 was Szeged-Kecskés (90,3) while Táplánszentkereszt in 2007 (95,1). Stability value formed on a wider range (figure 5). Mean data were high in both years (2006:10,9, 2007: 11,6). Average values of varieties almost at all genotypes reached or overrun the 10 value in 2006. At all genotypes (except GK Tisza) could be found some lower value mostly at location Kiszombor, due to the treatment. In 2007 GK Verecke performed very well at every location. At the other cultivars we could find lower values, but value under six could be found only in case of GK Holló and GK Petur. Long stability characterizes our varieties. Conclusions Different locations were tolerated differently by the tested varieties. The highly adaptable varieties’ (with low variance values) variance for farinograph stability was under 10. GK Tisza and GK Békés proved to be adaptable while GK Élet and GK Holló proved to be much more sensitive to different conditions. Hardness index showed a minor fluctuation among locations, and the average of varieties was very high. GK Csillag, GK Békés, GK Ati varieties average value was over 80, but GK Kalász, GK Tisza and GK Élet also showed values over 70. Variance of kernel hardness was low in both years. The most stable materials are GK Békés and GK Ati. In falling number data no significant difference occured. The difference among the locations had similar effects on genotypes. In Törökszentmiklós almost 20 % lower value was measured comparing to the average. Zeleny values were high, while GK Holló gave poorer quality, with low variance. Both the stability of yield and quality - as polygenic characteristics - cannot be approached by marker assisted selection technique. Presently the multi-location trial system is the most suitable way to select for these traits. The demonstrated work helps us to find the best genotypes for the different wheat breeding regions for maintaining the premium quality grain production.

Abstract: The objective of research was to determine influence to grain yield, the quality of organic wheat Munk grain and parameters of soil by usage of growing stimulator Penergetic-p in organic farming. Experimental trials were implemented at the Centre of Agroecology, Lithuanian University of Agriculture during period of 2005 and 2006. Scheme of usage of Penergetic-p was as follows: I- control, II-seeds felted with Penergetic-p before sowing (a rate of 100 ml t-1) and III-felted with Penergetic-p before sowing (a rate of 100 ml t -1 ) and in the period of bushing sprayed (rate of 100 ml ha -1 ). A strong correlation (R 2 =0.99) has been found between usage of Penergetic-p and yield. A significant increase in fall number of grain has been determined after the usage of Penergetic-p in test trials II and III compared to the control trial. Other significant differences in quality indexes of grain have not been determined. According to electrochemical parameters of wheat grain, antioxidation properties of grain were found decreasing and the amount of ions of mineral materials was found increasing as a result of Penergetic-p usage. Keywords: organic farming, growth stimulator, grain quality, soil parameters. Introduction Development of organic farming in Lithuania is taking place at an ever faster pace. Like that of the European Union, general agricultural policy of Lithuania is directed towards organic farming which in its turn provides of environmental value too. The soil quality improvement can be considered as a relatively new concept in soil science (Birkas et al, 2006). Protection of soil and the environment is fundamental to organic farming. Maintenance and enhancement of soil parameters is the central objective of organic farming. This problem is not solved fertilizing soil with manure, composts and growing green fertilizers. Insufficient quantities of manure are accumulated on the farms of organic production and using manure from farms of intensive production is impossible (Pekarskas, 2005). The greatest effect is obtained, when crop rotation is chosen and agricultural plants are provided with all nutritional materials they need (Rutkoviene et al., 2006; Beke et al., 2006). To improve germination and vegetation qualities of plants on organic farms growth stimulators can be used. Penergetic-p is certified and permissible growth stimulator for organic production, used for felting up wheat grain before sowing and spraying plants during the period of their vegetation. Since 2005 scientific research has been carried out in the Center of Agroecology at the Lithuanian University of Agriculture aimed at determining the effect of usage of Penergetic-p on changes in agricultural plants and soil qualities under the circumstances of organic farming. The aim of the research is to assess changes in parameters of soil and their influence on wheat grains quality under the influence Penergetic-p. Except for traditional measurements of soil, electrochemical tests of plants and soil were carried out that provide us with additional information about their qualities and vitality.</p><p id="Pg135">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 136 Materials and methods Investigations of the effect of Penergetic-p on wheat grain and soil parameters were carried out in Agroecological Center, at site Kazliskiai4, the Lithuanian University of Agriculture in 2005-2006. In the object of the research summer wheat Munk were grown. Preceding crop was bare fallow in 2005 and in 2006 it was a mix of clover and timothy of the first year usage. Medium loam soils (Fere triangle method) of moderate heaviness Endohypogleyi – Eutric Planosols – PLe- gln – W. prevailed on the experimental field of the research area. The soil prevailing fraction are fine sand (0.25 – 0.05), coarse dust (0.05 – 0.01) and silt soil (&lt;0.001). The soil was neutral, 6.6 – 6.8, the moderate hummus 2.10 – 2.15 %, potassium 152 - 162 mg kg-1 and phosphorus 153 - 171 mg kg-1 The soil was extremely saturated with bases -99.7 %. Total nitrogen of the soil was detected 0.185 – 0.196 %. Evaluation of soil characteristics was carried out every month during the period of research. After harvesting, yield grain was assessed for yield and quality parameters. Mineral nitrogen (spectrometric method), electrochemical parameters - redox potential, pH (potenciometric method), and soil conductivity (conductometric method) were determined in the soil and wheat grains at the Laboratory of Environmental research, Lithuanian University of Agriculture. Chemical composition –gluten, proteins, sedimentation (Infratec analyzer) of wheat grain were determined at the Laboratory in Experimentation Station, Lithuanian University of Agriculture. Fall number was determined at the Laboratory of company “Linas Agro”. The scheme of growth stimulator Penergetic-p use was as follows: I- control trial, where growth stimulator Penergetic-p was not used, II trial- seeds have been felted with Penergetic-p rate of 100 ml t-1; III trial seeds have been felted with growth stimulator Penergetic-p and plants were sprayed with a 100 ml ha-1rate of Penergetic-p during the period of bushing. Area of one test field was 21 m2 (3×7). Experimental test fields were established by four repetitions, which made a total of 12 test fields. Statistical analyses were carried out using STATISTICA, statistical significance was detected at the 0.05 level of probability.

Influence of growth stimulator Penergetic-p on mineral nitrogen. Data of LUA Agroecological centre, 2005-2006. Investigation of mineral nitrogen in the soil showed that amount of nitrogen during growing season and after harvesting was more in trials (II and III) with growth stimulator, although yields were higher here (Figure 1) . It can be explained by stronger oxidation properties of soil (redox potential in trials &gt;28), process of mineralization becomes faster and higher amount of mineral nitrogen was found in soil after crop harvesting. According to data of 2005 – 2006, research of the effect of growth stimulator Penergetic-p on the yield of summer wheat Munk has shown that the greatest yield of summer wheat 2.9t ha-1 was obtained when the seeds had been felted with the Penergetic-p and then the plants were additionally sprayed during the period of milk maturity. The increase in this case makes more than 10% compared to the yield of control trial where growth stimulator Penergetic-p was not used.

These data are shown in Table 1. pH determined in the control trial and that of grain grown under the effect of Penergetic-p are almost the same. Greater number values of electric conductivity of data specify the greater amount of ions of mineral materials in grains of summer wheat Munk in test trials II and III. This demonstrates weakening antioxidation properties of grain after the use of Penergetic-p. Conclusions 1. Growth stimulator Penergetic-p used has an effect on soil characteristics and this vicissitude influences changes in plant characteristics. The greatest yield of summer wheat Munk was obtained when the seeds had been felted with Penergetic-p and plants additionally sprayed during the period of milk maturity (r2 =0.99). 2. Research shows that growth stimulator Penergetic-p enhances soils oxidation processes, increases its electrical conductivity and has an effect on vicissitude of mineral nitrogen in the soil. 3. A significant increase in fall number of grains was found after growth stimulator Penergetic-p had been used in test trials II and III compared to control trial. Other differences in quality indexes between the trials were not found.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Agricultural producers who possess large areas of arable land and a lot of machinery can achieve substantial savings, thus improving their business performance, if they manage to ensure adequate assignment of machinery to appropriate jobs during the entire production cycle. When attempting to establish the optimum assignment set of agricultural machinery, a variety of factors need to be taken into consideration, for example the features of human and technical resources engaged in production, weather conditions, characteristics of soil and crops, distance of fields from the machinery storage space. In this domain it is possible to use the assignment model as a decision support. The initial assignment model, which is deterministic in character, has undergone improvements in this paper by means of computer simulation, which makes it suitable for usage in conditions of uncertainty, which are quite common in agriculture. In the proposed model, simulation is carried out for the values of all the parameters estimated to be stochastic. On the basis of scores assigned according to set criteria, the efficiency matrix is then formed, whose elements represent the expected benefits from assigning the machinery to particular activities in agriculture. The optimum assignment set of agricultural machinery is the one in which the sum of efficiency for all assignments is maximum. Usage of modern information technologies is an essential prerequisite for implementing the model discussed in this paper. Keywords: agricultural machinery assignment model, computer simulation, information technologies, efficiency matrix Introduction A frequent problem arising in the area of management is the issue of adequate organization, i.e. redistribution of work. The main objective in solving this problem is to establish such distribution of work tasks that will result in maximum efficiency in view of the established criteria for individual performance. The problem posed in this way is defined within operations research as an assignment model. The issue of correct assignment of machinery in agricultural work is very sensitive due to a number of specific circumstances. In agricultural production there are human and technical resources to consider, as well as other factors, such as meteorological conditions, characteristics of soil and crops, distance of fields from machinery storage space. It should be noted that delays in completing any of the agricultural activities, arising from non-optimum machinery assignment, might have highly adverse effects on total business performance. The basic intention of this research is to demonstrate the possibilities of a quantitative approach and computer supported decision-making in solving the problem of agricultural machinery assignment. The model presented in this paper is an improvement on the initial assignment model by means of computer simulation. Another specific feature of the proposed model is the way of approaching the efficiency matrix. To bring forward the advantages of the model, it is essential to use modern information technologies in its implementation. In this way the model becomes accessible to a wider range of users.</p><p id="Pg139">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 140 Materials and methods The starting point of the model under consideration in this paper is the assignment model, which belongs to quantitative models. Several techniques have been developed that can be used to solve it, and the most famous one is probably the Hungarian method. In its initial form the assignment model is deterministic, since it is assumed that all its relations and parameters are known with certainty. To make the model applicable in the conditions of uncertainty, its chosen parameters are defined as random variables, whose values are simulated by computer. In this way the proposed model acquires a stochastic character. Results and discussion In the assignment model the aim is to achieve the optimum pairing of units from two groups, under condition that each unit from one group is paired with only one unit from the other group. Before solving the problem of agricultural machinery assignment it is necessary to define the efficiency matrix (C). Its elements are the effects of assigning each machine to the work to be carried out by that machine.                    nnnjnn inijii nj nj cccc cccc cccc cccc C 21 21 222221 111211       If the number of machines and jobs is not equal, we need to insert into the model an adequate number of fictitious rows, i.e. columns, whose elements have the value 0. This implies that the assignment in such a row, or such a column, will be provisional. The elements of the efficiency matrix in the proposed model are determined by assigning scores according to certain criteria. To illustrate this procedure, let it be assumed that the management is aiming to establish the optimum assignment set n of tractors to n fields during the ploughing period. In such a case, for each tractor system, consisting of a tractor and a plough, we have to determine the values of adequate number of indicators. Among other things, these indicators include engine power (kW), number of revolutions at max. power (min-1), power pull (kW), drawbar pull (kN), working width (cm), ploughing depth (cm), specific energy (kWh/ha), driving speed (km/h), slip of wheels (%), fuel consumption hourly (l/h), productivity (ha/h) and coefficient of advantageous operation. For each field it is also necessary to identify the most prominent characteristics and determine their values. These characteristics include the field size (ha), its distance from machinery storage space (km), soil type, soil moisture content (%), clay content (%), sand content (%), soil density (g/cm3) and specific resistant soil (N/cm2). For certain parameters the management can decide that they are stochastic, and define them as random variables that follow one of theoretical distributions. Given that it depends on meteorological conditions and thus its value cannot be assessed with certainty, one of these variables might be soil moisture content. Let it be assumed that the management has concluded that this variable follows normal</p><p id="Pg140">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 141 distribution, with parameters mean () and standard deviation (). Parameter values need to be assessed before the simulation process. If they are available, for this purpose we can use the data obtained from previous measurements of soil moisture content under conditions corresponding to those predicted in weather forecast. After that the first random number from the interval (0,1) is generated. It represents the probability that the soil has a certain moisture content. Adequate computer support is then used to determine the value x of random variable X~N( ,) for which P(X≤x )=p. The management has to decide how many times to repeat the simulation process. Note should be taken that random numbers are not to be generated from the uniform distribution, as for a sufficient number of repetitions the average simulated value, used to determine the efficiency matrix, will tend towards the mean (). The procedure described above needs to be repeated for all the parameters that are stochastic. After determining the values of all the relevant parameters of the model, the assignment efficiency for each machine is evaluated. This is done by assigning scores to all the analyzed characteristics and features of the fields. Here the management needs to determine the scoring range. Thus the efficiency of a tractor system with a small working width on a very large field will be given a minimum score, whereas the maximum score will be assigned to the tractor system with the highest coefficient of advantageous operation. However, it is not absolutely necessary that all the scored elements are evaluated in the same way. If they judge this to be necessary, the management can apply weighting to emphasize the importance of a certain factor included in the model. Thus, for example, in contemporary circumstances, characterized by constant increase in fuel prices, the variable defined as fuel consumption can be assigned the highest weight. Ultimately, the value of the matrix element cij, which represents the efficiency of assigning the tractor system i to the field j, is calculated by adding up all individual scores. The values of all assignments established in this way are used to determine the efficiency matrix and to set up the assignment model. Given the accessibility of the software appropriate for its solution, the described assignment problem will further be defined as a linear programming model. Let it be assumed that two equally numbered sets S and P are known, as well as the function RPS:C  . The optimum solution is then a bijection PS:f  for which the function of efficiency is maximal. In this case the linear programming model reads as follows:    n i n j ijij xcimizemax 1 1 subject to    n j ij x 1 1 , n,...,i 1    n i ij x 1 1 , n,...,j 1  ,,xij 10 n,,i ... 1 , n,,j ... 1</p><p id="Pg141">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 142 Variable xij will have the value 0 if the tractor system i has not been assigned to the field j, and, conversely, it will have the value 1. The aim is to determine the assignment set that will maximize total efficiency. It is possible to use several program packages for solving the linear programming problem defined in this way. Some of them, such as LINGO, Qsopt and ORSTAT, can be downloaded from the Internet free of charge for educational purposes. The graphical user interface of most of these program packages enables users to interactively define, modify and solve the posed problem, which makes them easy to use. All this contributes to more efficient solving of the agricultural machinery assignment problem. Conclusions The paper has presented the agricultural machinery assignment model improved by means of computer simulation. It is used in the model to determine those parameter values for which it was estimated that they cannot be determined with certainty. In this way the initial model becomes stochastic, which makes it suitable for use in the conditions of uncertainty. One of the specific features of the proposed model is the way of determining the efficiency matrix. Its elements are arrived at by assigning scores according to the criteria set by the management. Should this prove necessary, the model allows us to emphasise the importance of certain factors by adequate weighting. Because of these characteristics, it is very important to computerize each phase of model construction and solution, which leads to an efficient decision support system. By implementing the proposed model and its continued application companies can achieve considerable financial savings, and minimize the possibility of problems arising from delays in completing agricultural activities.

In a nature conservation area it can reduce and increase biodiversity, however in the Tihany Peninsula nature conservationists try to protect the present natural environment. Human induced landscape changes gained the peninsula the first landscape protection district status of the country. Geological background, microclimatic conditions, given soil heritage, plant cover and land use plays an important role in the life of the peninsula. We wish to give an example how human induced activities might affect the valuable natural environment in a way that threatens the aim of the protection. Keywords: soil, nutrients, grazing, land use change Introduction Taking into account the most influencing soil formation factor, the human activity, we can state that soil is a non-renewable natural resource (Várallyay, 2007). Human activities (e.g. deforestation, over-intensified arable farming, animal husbandry and grazing, introduction of invasive plant species) can cause soil compaction, soil erosion (Jakab 2006, Centeri and Császár, 2003), nutrient loss and damage to local plant and animal populations (Csontos and Tamás, 2006; Deák and Keveiné, 2006). Geologypedology relation is examined in very specific cases, mostly during soil ecology researches and connected with the weathering of the rocks. Researches on relation between plant and soil are more often and less specific (Halbritter et al, 2003; Penksza et al., 2005; Nagy and Penksza, 2006). Soil tillage changes soil properties rapidly (Birkás et al., 2005) however on the examined area soil has not been tilled recently. Land use changes (Máté, 2007; Szabó et al, 2007; Malatinszky, 2004; Malatinszky and Penksza, 2004) are the most common agents of land degradation. The most dangerous case is when forests are removed and replaced by arable land. It is not as damaging but includes potential problems when forests are changed into grassland. In this case overgrazing is a serious problem. Materials and methods The Tihany Peninsula was the first Landscape Protection District in Hungary. From 1997 it has been a part of the Balaton Upland National Park and does not exist separately as landscape protection district. There were three lakes situated on the peninsula. Now we can find two lakes with water surface all year round. The Outer Lake is a strictly protected nature conservation area. Both lakes has its own watershed inside the peninsula, no water flows in from outside</p><p id="Pg143">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 144 and neither they have connection with the water level of Lake Balaton, in what the peninsula is situated. The Inner Lake a fishing lake, situated close to Tihany village. There is a parking lot and a restaurant on the shore of the lake. The area of the Inner Lake is 28.2 ha, its average depth is 1.5 m. The bottom of the lake is silty on the southern and covered with marl on the northern part. The lake is a natural crater lake. The climate is Sub-Mediterranean. The Inner Lake was originally framed by a reed zone, almost all around its shores. The lake suffered serious damage when plant eating species were introduced to the lake. Nearly all the reed was gone. The rehabilitation of the lake started about a decade ago, now we can see some reed zone between the lake and the village. For soil analyses we used the Pürckhauer type soil core sampler (Finnern, 1994). Six sampling point and a sample slope were chosen (Figure 1.) for pedological examination. A soil profile was opened and described on the western side of the lake.

However, in the northern part of the lake, where there is more reed cover, we can find some peaty meadow soil. Following the shores of the lake, there is a very narrow stripe of raw Fluvisol with some spots where we could find some young peaty layers (peaty meadow spots). After the Fluvisol there is a gravel road creates a ring around the lake. The road is surrounded by and was created on Vertisol. Coenological examinations found extreme plant associations indicating salt in the soil, especially on the shores. Further away from the lake there are Vertisols with some</p><p id="Pg144">VII.

These soils carry vertic properties in their clayey loam texture and dark colour, their structure is crumby with some calcic coat in the springtime. The parent material towards the lake is swampy clay and powder like Pleistocene slope material. We compared two analyses of soil maps (prepared by Góczán, 1970 and Barczi, 1995). The comparison was done for soil types that occur around the Inner Lake (Table 1). Table 1.

Soil profile laboratory examination proved that grazing is not a principle form of land use around the soil profile (Table 2.) since the phosphorus content was very low. Table 2.

It was unexpected that K2O content was normal since phosphorus was very low in the profile. The soil texture of the examined soil profile was clayey loam. Slope angle was 5%. The amount of total salt content was zero. Compared to the 1995 examinations, results of laboratory examinations of soil samples from 2007 (Table 3.) show big differences. We chose a sample slope on the southern part of the lake (Figure 1). Table 3.

In the lower third of the slope P2O5 content is 4.2 and K2O content is 1.7</p><p id="Pg145">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 146 times higher than on the upper third of the slope. CaCO3 content shows that erosion reached the parent material, causing mix up of the lime content. Conclusions Soils have undergone several changes on the peninsula. The introduced Hungarian Grey cattle herd caused trampling, increasing soil compaction, soil structure degradation and nutrient loss that can be further threat to the ecosystem of the lake. Water pollution can reach a level that must be handled thus influence the fishing and recreation activity of the tourists. References Birkás M., Bencsik K., Stingli A., Percze A. 2005.

A study with sweet corn was set up during 2006 in Slovenia at two locations: in clay loam soil and in sandy loam soil. At each location 5 cultivars (Tasty Sweet Trophy F1, Tasty Gold F1, Gold Cup F1, Sweet Nugget and Zuckergold) were tested. The highest kernel weight cultivar was Tasty Sweet Trophy F1, regardless of the type of the soil texture. Kernel number per unit area was closely and negatively correlated with kernel weight. The type of soil had no significant influence on soluble sugars composition. However, when the sucrose content was observed, there were remarkable differences between cultivars irrespective of soil type. Keywords: sweet corn, yield, agronomic characteristics, soluble sugars, Slovenia Introduction Commercial sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. saccharata Korn.) cultivation areas in Slovenia are relatively minor compared with field corn cultivation areas. Furthermore, sweet corn is usually produced on relatively small, part-time family farms. Despite the above-mentioned constrains, interest in sweet corn production in Slovenia has grown in recent years. This is mainly due to the fact that today more and more farmers are looking for a new alternative to traditional vegetable growing that is threatened by various cultivation problems. It is known that in the last few years the cultivation of vegetables has been affected mostly by climate change and has become dependant on high amounts of water to ensure good yields. As sweet corn is as a relative droughttolerant crop that is adapted to a wide range of climates (Bray, 1997), the production and cultivation of sweet corn, rather than vegetables, is the most effective strategy when facing climate changes. However, one needs to take into account that beside climate, soil characteristics play a very important role in crop management. Several authors over the last few years have published information relative to optimum yield and quality evaluations for sweet corn (Öktem et al., 2004; Kwabiah, 2004; Ramachandrappa et al., 2005; Hadi, 2005; Bódi et al., 2006; Buzás et al., 2006). The purpose of our study was to compare the effects of different soil type (a sandy loam and a clay loam) on sweet corn yield, agronomic characteristics, and the composition of kernel soluble sugars. Materials and methods Field experiment was conducted at two Slovenian locations, representing different soil types. Soil at location 1 – Experimental Field of the Biotechnical Faculty in Ljubljana (46o 04' N, 14o 31' W, 299 m altitude) – was clay loam (medium texture). Soil at</p><p id="Pg147">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 148 location 2 – Commercial farm near Murska Sobota (46o 38' N, 16o 11' W, 188 m altitude) – was sandy loam (light texture). Some soil physico-chemical properties of the experimental fields are given in Table 1. The climate at both locations is a typical temperate continental climate. During the growing season the mean temperature in Ljubljana was 19.0 oC and the sum of rainfall was 480.6 mm. Equivalent data for Murska Sobota was 17.3 oC and 407.5 mm, respectively. The preceding crop in the year before growing sweet corn was annual ryegrass at both locations. Five shrunken (Sh2) cultivars (Tasty Sweet Trophy F1 – Royal Sluis, Tasty Gold F1 – Saatbau Linz, Gold Cup F1 – Semenarna Ljubljana, Sweet Nugget – Saatbau Linz and Zuckergold – Immergrün Wiena) were used as the crop material. Corn was machine sown at 5 cm depth on May 1st 2006. Seedling rate was set for 71,500 seeds ha-1. Each experimental field was 1000 m2 in size and each cultivar was sown in randomized complete block with four replications. A basal dressing of 350 kg NPK (15-15-15) ha-1 was applied at the time of sowing. Additional fertilizer other than N was supplied uniformly across the plot areas to correct any deficiencies indicated by soil test results. Irrigation was supplied by a combination of furrow irrigation methods and natural rainfall, according to evapotranspiration data. All other crop procedures were followed out as used in commercial sweet corn production. Twenty days after seedling, data were collected for emergence. When the kernel moisture was about 70% (Olsen et al., 1990), samples from 2 rows in the centre of each replication were harvest manually early in the morning. The content of soluble carbohydrates was analyzed separately by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The procedure was fully described by Dolenc-Šturm et al. (1999). The obtained results were first submitted for a variance analysis, and the arithmetic medians were then compared by the Duncan test. Table 1.

Days from planting to harvest indicated a possible inhibitory effect in clay loam (Murska Sobota). Sandy loam (Ljubljana) advanced harvest date with an average of 5 days. A cultivar with shorter maturity duration (Tasty Sweet Trophy F1) was the highest kernel weight cultivar regardless the type of the soil texture. Although it is difficult to determine the precise influence of environmental factors on maturity in the present study, climatic factors are likely causes. For example, a comparison among locations showed that Ljubljana had higher mean temperature (+1.7 oC). For the site with clay loam texture, most cultivars decreased emergence to warmer sandy loam. Field emergence among the cultivars ranged from 80.5 to 90.2 (sandy loam) and from 71.3 to 85.4 (clay loam). Even though the clay soil appeared to cause reduction in emergence, the delayed</p><p id="Pg148">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 149 emergence had no significant influence on kernel weight. Therefore, it is important to consider that environmental factors are unlikely to be the main cause of differences in emergence. Some authors (Douglass et al., 1993) mentioned that poor seedling emergence was due to the reduced starch concentration in sweet corn kernels, which results in reduction in the energy reserves required for emergence. In cereals, final grain yield is defined mainly by the number of harvested kernels per unit area (Fisher, 1975). In our study the number of kernel m-2 displayed significant differences among locations and among cultivars. The final number of kernels reduction was evident in sandy loam. The increase of single kernel weight was in response to reduced kernel number m-2. Kernel number m-2 was highly negatively correlated with kernel weight in sandy loam (r2 = –0.86; P &lt; 0.001) and in clay loam (r2 = –0.91; P &lt; 0.001). Kernel weight ranged from 162.1 g (Sweet Nugget) to 286.4 g (Tasty Sweet Trophy F1) and from 234.1 (Gold Cup F1) to 340.5 (Tasty Sweet Trophy F1) in sandy and clay loam, respectively. In light of our results, the greater kernel weight at Ljubljana (clay loam) was explained by the fact that under hot, midsummer conditions, clay loam soil has the advantage of holding much more moisture.

The quality of fresh sweet corn depends to large extent on kernel sweetness (Azanza et al., 1994). Sucrose, glucose and fructose are the three major components that contribute to the total soluble sugar content (Evensen and Boyer, 1986). The sugar concentration in the different types of soil at the time of fresh-market maturity showed negligible variation. It should be noted, however, that there was a significant difference between cultivars regarding the total soluble sugar content concentration and the concentration of</p><p id="Pg149">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 150 each individual sugar. Overall, in both accessions higher concentration of sugars was present in the kernels of cv. Zucckergold compared to other cultivars. The ratio of total sugar to sucrose in the kernels examined showed that sucrose accounted for almost 60% of the total sugar concentration. The above results are in agreement with those obtained by Hubbard and Pharr (1990) who pointed out that increasing sugar content during ripening is primarily a function of the accumulation of sucrose, while glucose and fructose levels are modulated to much lesser extent. Of the three major soluble sugars assessed in this study, only sucrose level variations correlated significantly with the total sugar level variations. In both soil types, the slope of the relation between sucrose and total sugars content was over 0.7 (data not shown). Conclusions Our research serves to indicate which cultivars of sweet corn will be most successfully grown in the two frequently types of soil in Slovenia. A major benefit associated with sandy loam is earlier harvest, while growing sweet corn in clay loam is ultimately translated into higher yields. It appears, however, that there was no discernible effect of the soil type on the rate of soluble sugars. Furthermore, the research reveals the important role of sucrose in determining total sugar concentrations and hence quality in sweet corn kernels. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether the results in our study are site specific or can be applicable to other areas. Reference Azanza F., Juvik J.A., Klein B.P. 1994.

If organic and mineral fertilizers use results in yield increase, physical and chemical soil traits will also be affected. Harmony of economically and ecologically justifiable crop production is achieved by sustainable agriculture system. Investigations aimed at the above mentioned goals were carried out by field experiments on the stationary model with surface lysimeters (12 pieces) during years 2003 and 2004. Effect of organic and mineral fertilizer on primary water pollution was investigated. Series of required monitoring and measuring: climatic factors, analyses of liquid manure, soil and filtration waters as well as lysimeter weighing were conducted during winter wheat growing season. Achieved results were processed by statistically adequate methods and means of achieved values were used for results interpretation. Efficiency of mineral fertilization was higher than organic fertilization with the same nitrogen content in real climatic and pedological conditions. Pollution by nitrogen in filtration waters was higher at mineral fertilization variant. Nitrogen losses by leaching were at the stationary in positive correlation with used amount of organic and mineral fertilizer. Keywords: wheat, mineral and organic fertilization, soil and water pollution, lysimeter, nitrogen leaching Introduction The amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) have an important influence on biological and grain of winter wheat yield (Bertic et al., 2007; Kádár, 2007). The nutrient supply and fertilization have the key-role in the sustainable wheat production because on the one hand fertilization directly and indirectly modifies every other cropping system factors (planting-technology, crop protection etc) and on the other hand the non-optimum fertilization causes some harmful environmental effects (NO3 --N accumulation in different soil layers etc) (Pepó, 2007). Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important inputs in wheat production, but it is also responsible for agriculture-related pollution through leaching or denitrification (Baric et al., 2007). Leaching of nitrates from soil depends on the amount, frequency and intensity of precipitation, soil traits, crop and crop development stage, evapotranspiration, and nitrogen fertilization (Vidacek et al., 1996, 1999; Nadasy and Nadasy, 2006; Nemeth, 2006 and Josipovic et al., 2006). Diffuse pollution of surface and ground waters is a major environmental issue in the European Union. Agriculture and the agrochemical measures are applied an important factor determining extended regional pollution and affecting the chemical composition of groundwater. Water for drinking and agriculture use, high in nitrogen compounds is potentially harmful to human and animal health. Therefore, when fertilising fields it is necessary to take into account the rations of fertilisers since the amount of fertilisers used influenced on the nutrients leaching (NO2 -, NO3 -, NH4 +) and the quality of groundwater. The high</p><p id="Pg151">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 152 fertilization rates and irrigation lead to increased hazards of groundwater pollution (Rutkoviene et al., 2007). Materials and methods Stationary field trial with 6 treatments in 2 replications was set up near Osijek city. Research was performed during winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing season, year 2003 and 2004. The trial included the following fertilization treatments: 1. MF100, 2. MF50, 3. Check (C), 4. OF50, 5. OF100 and 6. Fallow (F). The trial plot size by treatments was 11.25 m2 (4.5x2.5). Fertilization was carried out with mineral fertilizer: urea 46%, KAN 27%, NPK 15:15:15 and super potassium as well as organic fertilizer with the same nutrition value. Fertilization treatments are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Fertilization treatments Fertilization treatment Fertilizer dose, kg ha -1 Crop Mark Type Ntotal P2O5 K2O Winter wheat 1.

Water leached through the soil to a 90 cm depth was caught by 12 lysimeters with 60 cm diameter each. Water leached were analysed according to Standard Methods of the Examination of Water and Wastewater, APHA-AWWA-WPCF, Springfield, 14th ed. The nitrogen content was determined in samples of soil (before sowing and after harvesting) and in leached lysimeter water. Nitrogen utilization is shown in terms of wheat yields and the amount of nitrogen applied, together with the results of chemical analyses for nitrogen content in soil and in lysimeter water. Results and discussion The trial was formed at location which belongs to mild continental climate. Major longterm (1901-1985) indicators of climatic traits for this area are: semi-annual precipitations mean which was 708 mm and semi-annual air temperatures mean which was 11.0 °C. In 2003-2004 growing season there was 446.85 mm of precipitation, and temperature sum was 2412 °C with monthly values as shown in Figure 1.

Hugues 8, Porec, pavlo@iptpo.hr 2 Department of Economics and Rural Development, Institute of Agriculture and Tourism Abstract: In this paper we discuss about possibilities of rapeseed production as a base for biodiesel production and its economic effects in rural economy in Istria. Therefore authors examined possibilities for rapeseed production and its possible transverse to oil-biodiesel. Effects of such a production chain could affect rural economy in positive ways. Authors question following effects: what are the natural resources for rapeseed production; is there sufficient rapeseed production as base for oil; how the production chain can affect rural economy. Further authors argue the hypothesis that biodiesel reproduction has possibilities for improvements in agricultural land use, employment and rural economy development. Keywords: rapeseed production, biodiesel, rural economy, Istria Introduction Four agricultural species are dominant for oil production, the first place belongs to rapeseed (according to Mustapić et al., 2006., 85% of all oleiferous plants production), other species like sunflower soya, palm, olive oil are less used in domestic and industrial purpose. The idea of biodiesel production from plants came from Rudolf Diesel which in 1900. on world exhibition in Paris presented the use of diesel motors on plant (peanut) oil production. Because of low crude oil (petroleum) production price, plant oil was not interesting for that time. Nowadays plant oil became more in focus of interest because of price rise of crude oil and lack of new natural wells, therefore regulations of several countries demanded enlarged use of biodiesel. For example in EU by directive 2003/30/EC, all member states were obliged to substitute 2% of crude oil sue with biodiesel until 31. December 2005., and up to 5,75% till 31. December 2010. Till 2020. predictions propose 20% of biodiesel, bioetanol, biogas and biocarbone use. In Croatia possibilities of rapeseed production for biodiesel occur through use of agricultural soils, crop rotations (beside wheat and corn), extra farm income and less use of crude oil. Materials and methods Metodology of research in this paper is based on estimations for rapeseed production possibilities and its impacton production chain and finnaly in effects on rural economy in Istria. We used statistical data by which we used production statistics on World, European and Croatian level. Further, we used methods of comparation and analytics. Using these methods and using literature we have confirmed our hypothesis.</p><p id="Pg155">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 156 Results and discussion On world level four cultures dominate for oil and biodiesel production. The most important is rapeseed, but soya, sunflower and palm trees are also interesting for such use. Rapeseed biodiesel is most similar to crude oil chemical features (table 1). Table 1.

The similarity of rapeseed oil and crude oil (petrol) is widely recognized; therefore rapeseed production is growing each year (table 2). Each five years rapeseed production grows for 10 millions of hectares. Table 2. Land use and production of rapeseed in the world Year Land in 000 ha Yield in 000 t 1990. 17.610 24.428 1995. 23.816 34.185 2000. 25.833 39.515 2005. 26.950 46.409 Source: Ružić P., 2004. Largest producers are China 26,8 % (7220 thousand hectares), and India 25,2 % (6800 thousand hectares) of world production. Europe has 23,2% of world production (6800 thousand hectares), with largest producers Germany and France. In Croatia rapeseed production shares 0,3% of total agricultural land, and 8,7 % of all oil plant production. Agricultural production as a basic economy branch can propose future development in food and industry use of agricultural products and raw materials that reply’s also to production of biodiesel from rapeseed. Market possibilities for biodiesel are not used in sufficient ways of production and sales. Therefore most biodiesel is marketed from import. In Croatia there is only one factory for biodiesel which produces 20 thousand tons per year (Krička et al., 2001). These quantities are not sufficient for Croatian market needs. In 2004. Croatian production was 1.080.000 hectares of rapeseed, what refers to 8,7% of all oil plants. Although production facilities allow much bigger biodiesel production, rapeseed production is not following such needs. From other agricultural cultures, sunflower, soya and corn are less likely to be used for industry, and biodiesel as these are used for human – food use. In production structure of Croatia in 2003. from 94.290 hectares</p><p id="Pg156">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 157 - rapeseed had 15.891 ha(16,85% of total oil plants production), - soya had 50.286 ha (53,33%) - sunflower 28.113 ha (29,82%). In production structure 2004. from 79.811 hectares - rapeseed had 14.299 ha(17,52% of total oil plants production), - soya had 37.131 ha (46,52%) - sunflower 28.381 ha (35,56%). Possibilities of oil plants production in Istria are mainly in river valleys of Mirna river and Raša river. From total land surface in Istria (281.900 thousand hectares), agricultural land has 171.500 hectares from which 98.600 is in active use. From the 72.900 hectares presently not in use (pastures, not ploughed land, and abandoned land) a part could be used for profitable rapeseed production. Climatic conditions of Istria are analyzed and reviewed in literature (Legović, 1997) as Mediterranean climate with temperature variations from 10 C below zero to middle annually temperature as 15 degreeC, and average winter temperature of 7 C. in central parts of Istria there is an influence of continental climate in which the temperature can fall to 20C below zero, average annual temperature is 11 C, a average winter temperature 3,5 C. In climate conditions of Mediterranean climate 65% of agricultural land is present, while 31% is in continental climate conditions. The other 4% is under influence of mountainous climate influence mixed with continental climate. Beside climate conditions Istria differs also in precipitation conditions that are in coastal parts about 823 mm annually in central Istria 1060 mm, and in mountain Učka 3000 mm annually. Most rains fall in spring and autumn. In average coastal parts have 101 days of rain and central parts 132 days of rain. These circumstances allow rapeseed production, especially in river valleys with influence of Mediterranean conditions. Basic reasons of rapeseed production implementation in Istria economy are: ecological reasons of space preservation, production of energy sources which are scarce in Croatia, improvement in income sources of family farms, employment possibilities and finally enlargement in agricultural land use. Conclusions Concluding our discussion about biodiesel production and its chain from rapeseed to biodiesel and its effects on economy we conclude that: Istria has solid basis for rural economy development which are created by agricultural land, climatic and pedology circumstances. Istria has possibilities of different ways to develop rural economy in primary production, processing of agricultural raw materials, and other non agricultural activities.  Effects of production chains of biodiesel on Istria rural economy are in better agricultural land use, enlargement of agricultural outputs, employment and retaining young people in rural spaces and ecological effects.</p><p id="Pg157">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

For this study one farm was chosen based on collected soil-samples from the area, assessing the effects of traditional tillage systems including soil-condition measurements done in the last three years. For monitoring of soil condition agronomical structure, penetration resistance and moisture content measurements were regularly used. Based on the research date and the results, some new proposals were summarised to enhance environmental conscious sustainable farming. Keywords: agronomic structure, soil resistance, soil moisture, environment conscious farming Introduction Due to the efforts in the last decades to achieve high yield average by intensive cropping, agro-technological interventions that pay attention on fertility, structure and biological conditions of the soil were drawn back. Degradation of soils, decrease of fertility, physical soil structure that suits cultivated crops less can be traced back primarily on this. As Birkás (2006) proved in the traditional tillage relation the soil condition that is supposed to be satisfactory for the optimum development of plants is reached by more traffics then appropriated and by a huge waste of time, energy and costs. Soils are conditionally renewable natural resources. The most important measures in this respect: proper agro-technics and prevention of soil degradation processes and soil pollution; and minimizing their unfavourable environmental/ecological consequences (Várallyay, 2007a). The VAHAVA report (2007) reveals the adverse impacts of the climate change, which could endanger the production of food stocks, the water-resources of the soil, the agricultural green areas, the forests, the forest belts, the parks and other places, thus adaptation to the changing weather and climate conditions is also necessary from the point of cultivation. Environment friendly technologies focus on the protection of soil and the conservation of its fertility. Ignoring sparing and soil improving technologies leads first to the deterioration of physical and biological conditions of the soil, then to the deepening of soil and environment damages like extraction, water and wind erosion. Improvement of the soil conditions is not only important from an economical viewpoint, but also for the protection of the environment (Birkás, 2006; Birkás et al., 2007). Both soil tillage costs and damages could also be decreased by the help of the soil condition maintenance and improvement. Materials and methods The field tests took place in 6 farms in a pilot micro-region of Central Hungary in 2004. Out of the six farms one was selected where the effects of traditional soil tillage were examined and resulted in suggestions to the farm agro-technologies in harmony with environmental issues. Since there had not been a soil test in the pilot farm before, liquid limit, pH value, calcium-carbonate content, humus percentage, and phosphorus and potassium content were examined in laboratory, according to the specifications of professional soil analysis, between 2004 and 2006. Besides the results of the tests crop sequences and the applied soil tillage methods were also compared. To monitor soil</p><p id="Pg159">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 160 structure condition a clod-fraction analysis and a dry sieving method were used. We took a sample of 0.20 - 0.25 kg of soil to the depth of sowing, weighed it precisely and then sift it. After sifting measured the soil held in each of the sieves and then expressed the result in percentage. The soil condition to a depth of 500 mm was evaluated during periods measuring soil strength for each 100 mm increment with an electronic penetrometer. Besides soil penetration resistance moisture content (%, w/w) of the soil was also checked, since this factor is the most responsible for soil loosening or compacting state. Soil tests were carried out three times during the vegetation period. One-factor variance analysis was used for statistical evaluation (Baráthné et al., 1996). Results and discussion According to the results, the pilot farm can be characterized by appropriate humus percentage and adequate phosphorus and potassium supply. The soils’ physical quality is loam. The crop sequence in the rotation was maize-sunflower-maize in 2004-20052006. The preceding crop in the previous year (2003) was maize. Soil tillage steps after harvest were similar in the given years: disking of the topsoil, then ploughing (30 cm). In the spring a combined tool was used for seedbed preparation before planting. Percentage of the agronomical structure units (&lt; 0.25 mm dust fraction, 0.25 – 10 mm aggregate fraction, &gt; 10 mm clod fraction) can be used for soil state monitoring. In the soil of the best structure the total aggregate ratio is at least 80 %. The high rate of dust and/or clod fractions refers to degraded soil structure (Birkás et al., 2006). In the experiment significant differences were found between years 2004 and 2005 in the dust fraction ratio, however an appropriate tillage reduced the dust fraction ratio (LSD5%= 3.4 %). The ratio of clod fraction increased significantly between years 2005 and 2006 (LSD5%= 7.9 %) but then the ratio of crumb fraction decreased significantly (LSD5%= 8.1%). Probable cause of the negative tendency originated from the inappropriate tillage. We concluded that the highest heterogeneity can be detected at the &lt;0.25 mm dust fraction regarding to the yearly checking. From the clod, aggregate and dust fraction the most homogeneous range was found at the 0.25 – 10 mm fraction, where the ratio of the aggregate exceeded at least 70% (Figure 1.). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2004. 1. 2004. 2. 2005. 1. 2005. 2. 2005. 3. 2006. 1. 2006. 2. 2006. 3. measurement % Clod Crumb Dust Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 161 Over-automation, intensive production, short crop rotations, intensive grazing, and improper use of the soil lead to packed soil (Hamza and Anderson, 2005). According to the tests of soil resistance we have concluded that at the first test in both years we have not found unfavourable compaction levels in none of the measured depths. According to Hungarian and non-Hungarian scientists, the soil is unfavourably compact if its penetration resistance reaches 3.0 MPa in a dry (not extreme dry) state (Hakansson, 1990; Soane and Van Ouwerkerk, 1998; Birkás and Gyuricza, 2004). Due to the precipitation conditions and the applied cropping techniques an unfavourable compacted levels were observed at the second field test in the given years mainly at the depth of 30-40 cm soil layer (Figure 2). -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 2004 I. measurement 2004 II. measurement 2005 I. measurement 2005 II. measurement 2006 I. measurement 2006 II. measurement Figure 2. Changing of soil resistance in the examined years (MPa) Among the examined 3 years 2005 proved to have the most precipitation. Similar to the case of soil resistance we concluded that soil moisture may significantly differ from year to year. We indicated that on the long run the applied soil tillage methods in the pilot farm can really be deteriorated soil structure, and increase soil moisture loss, limit the earthworm activity that are important in maintaining soil fertility, and highly contribute to weeding above average level. These factors result in a less efficient farming which ignores aspects of environment friendly soil tillage and is not rewarding from an economical viewpoint, neither. Crop production requires cultivation creating, conserving and/or retaining good physical and biological soil condition. Reliable crop production may be provided for by improving and conserving the quality of the soil. As Birkás noted (2006) proper tillage contributes to creating and preserving harmony between the environment and the production systems by protecting the quality of the soil. Conclusions The effects of the precipitation, season, crops and the applied soil tillage system were similarly influencing factors on soil structure quality at the examined conditions. The results supported that the soil- and environmental friendly methods need to be introduced, since the typical tillage systems have several passes promoting structure degradation, although they demand more energy consumption. During the years data of soil compaction derived from the penetrometric tests can fairly be compared. From the</p><p id="Pg161">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 162 values of the soil resistance and moisture measuring and the statistical analysis we could diagnose that the year’s weather conditions significantly affected both attributes. An unfavourable soil condition limits both water and nutrient uptake of the plants. In order to amend physical conditions of the soil the applied tillage technology needs to be radically renewed. This requirement is proved by the data of the penetrometric resistance, the soil structure, the soil water content and the soil biological condition examinations. According to the field tests and data derived from the experiments we formulate proposals concerning soil tillage, in order to enhance environmental consciousness and sustainable farming. - For improvement of soil structure and avoid of soil compaction a combined use of primary tillage and finishing tools is recommended (avoiding high number of passes and energy consumption). - Besides cultivated plants it is worthwhile to fit catch crops and plants into the crop rotation to maintain a loosen soil state. - To improve soil structure and to regulate weed infestation green manure plants – as first or second crop – can be used on the given fields. On the other hand, green manure plants utilize a large quantity of water that partly gets back into the soil by disking, and also the remains decrease evaporation significantly by working as mulch (Gyuricza et al., 2006; Mikó et al, 2005). - To avoid loss of soil moisture it is suggested to use water conservation methods (i.e. covering the surface, catch crop growing, using ploughless tillage methods). - To create a favourable habitat for earthworms chopped crop residues can be left on the surface promoting both biological mellowing and soil aggregation. - To improve topsoil and subsoil condition adaptable methods is recommended (i.e. mid-deep loosening), as well as using weed controlling soil tillage techniques in the given pilot area.

V. Abstract: The more important soil factors appear to be pH, drainage, and fertility. All turf grasses respond extra fertility. Actually, none of the turf grasses can be grown well without plenty of plant food. We were examining the effects of the traditional and the controlled released Scotts fertilizers with regards to the quality, colour, density, species composition and the change of plant coverage of the sports grass of the FTC football field. The applied fertilizers for nutrient supply of the soil were the traditional NH4NO3 (34%); the long-term longevity (2-3 months) Sportmaster (26:5:11); the medium-term longevity (5-6 months) Sierrablen (28:5:5+Fe); and the long-term longevity (8-9 months) Sierrablen (27:5:5+Fe). According to the research findings we can state that the nutrient treatments had a positive effect on the species composition of the football field grass. The growth of coverage is dependant on the nutrient supply, whereas the species composition varied subject to the effect of residue. The density of the grassland, the change in its green colour, the lasting of its colour are primarily defined, in addition to the grass species, by the durability of the effect of the nitrogen. As a result of the lasting effect of the Scotts fertilizers a gradual improvement occured within the available grass species. Keywords: improving soil fertility, turf quality change, effect of fertilizer, soccer field. Introduction The sports grass is a special type of grasslands, as in line with the expectations of the target sports the application, the proportion composition, wear endurance and selfregenerative ability of the grass species are determined. (Hessayon, 2002; Szemán, 2007). The most important element of the intensively used football field sports grass is the nutrient supply of the soil of the pitch (N:P:K), which greatly adds to the colour, density, homogenity of the grass, as well as to the stress caused by drought and cold. (Voigt-Fermanian-Wehner, 1998); (Landry, 2000); (Hale–Camberato, 2002); (Landschoot, 2003); (Richard-Duble, 2005); (Németh, 2006); (Németh–Cséplő–Vida– Bedő–Veisz, 2006). For the effective quality maintenance of the football field the nutrient storage of the soil has to be considered when determining the applicable fertilizer quantity. (Steffanovits-Filep-Füleky, 1999). The nutrient supply has to meet the environmental protection requirements as well as tackle the ever more relevant problems of washout and nutrient loss. (Gombos, 2007). In addition to the traditional fast and slow (lasting) effect fertilizers the Scotts controlled release fertilizers play a role. For shoot and root growth the adequate nitrogen level of the soil is essential. At each mowing we have to count with 1g/m2 nitrogen agent need, (Gruber, 1964), but it leads to environment pollution, as the excessive nitrogen washes out from the root zone. This is why it is important to use the Scotts controlled release fertilizers, as they ensure the continuos presence of nutrients in the root zone and during the growth of the grass it uptakes the nitrogen not allowing time for it to leach out. In connection with the N-fertilization level of established turfs Benyovszky and Penksza</p><p id="Pg163">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 164 (2002); (Nagy, 2006); carried out researches. The results of examining pocaeae content in natural grasses are summarized in Centeri et al. (2007); (Tasi, 2007). The number of the frequency of fertilizing times is determined by the mode and intensity of use. (Csathó-Árendás-Fodor-Németh, 2007). After the winter vegetation break a powerful growth can be expected lasting from March till May. The surfaces that are ruined, spoiled after the winter break and/or due to their winter use require the first fertilization this time. (Barcsák, 2004; Szemán, 2007). The sports grasses have the biggest nutrient requirements during the months of June-August. It is impractical to apply N-content fertilizer from the end of September onwards, as it facilitates strong growth of the grass before the winter rest. (Beard, 1964, 1973; Szemán, 2007; Kádár, 2007). The vegetation of the football field consisted of perennial ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bentgrass and annual bluegrass, as well as spreading meadow-grass, (Poa humilis), which spreads on all ruderal territories. (Penksza 2000a, 2000b, Penksza – Böcker 1999/2000; Penksza – Szabó 2004, 2005; Gyulai et al. 2003); (Gyulai-MesterKiss-Szemán-Idnurni-Heszky, 2003). One of the aims of this experiment was to control the nutrient supplying ability of the soil through the evaluation of the state of quality of the sports grass. Materials and methods The SZIE MKK Department of Grassland Management started a three-year, banding fertilizer, multi-repetitive nutrient supply experiment on the center soccerfield of the FTC Football Club. The aim of this experiment was to study the effects of improving soil fertility levels on turfgrass quality. In order to ensure even nutrient spreading, we created parcels, we marked the playfield by the sidelines at every six metres. Each marked parcel was divided so that we can monitor the more even fertilizer spreading and the broadcast treatment design. The size of the FTC field is 105m x 68m, the size of a parcel is 408m2. Before determining the fertilizer quantity of one parcel, we determined the annual N agent/kg. In the first year (2004), we applied Sierrablen 2-3; 56; 8-9; and NH4NO3 fertilizer treatment in the second half of March; in June, in July and in the middle of August. In the year 2005, we applied Sierrablen 8-9, Sierrablen 5-6, Sportmaster 2-3 type products, treatment dates: 12 April; 7 June; 30 August. In the year 2006, Sierrablen 8-9, on 11 May; Sierrablen 5-6, on 11 May; Sportmaster 2-3, May-June, and traditional NH4NO3 treatment, May- July. Results and discussion We continuously observed the changes in plant coverage of the field. The greatest plant coverage was achieved where we had applied the Sierrablen 8-9 month longevity fertilizer, as the first treatment in May started the shoot count formation. As a result the coverage increased, mainly due to the excessive release of nitrogen agent at one application. With the Sierrablen 5-6 months longevity fertilizer we experienced 5 % of uncoverage after mowing as a result of the smaller nitrogen dose. With the application of three times 20 kgs of traditional NH4NO3 fertilizer the grassland did not become dense, and almost an additional 20% of the territory remained uncovered. In connection with the change in the vegetation, with the application of the Sierrablen 8-9 months longevity treatment we released the 224 kg N for the whole year with one application, hence the coverage showed a stronger growth compared to the other treatments.</p><p id="Pg164">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 165 The in-between nitrogen treatment slightly prolonged the effects but it can be observed that the nitrogen supply of the soil decreased in July-August (Figure 1). Its use for sporting purposes and the frequent mowing strongly exploits the grassland and it cannot preserve its established coverage. After the treatment in May a strong recovery was experienced, but then the starting condition returned, which is not characteristic of the non-exploited grasslands. With the treatment in August the coverage of the grassland strengthened again, but since the growing strength of the grass is not strong at this time of the year, the same agent did not reach its springtime rate. By applying nitrogen more frequently and in a bigger quantity, this fluctuation can be balanced, but the danger of leaching out has to be accounted for, and also, that the strong-blade grass cannot as well cover the mowned grassland therefore it is unsure that in the end the quality of the sports grass is better. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Ma Ap1 Ap2 Mj1 Mj2 Jn1 Jn2 Jl1 Jl2 Au1 Au2 % Sb 89 Sb 56 Sm 23 CN Figure 1. The percentage change of plant coverage for grass per treatment Explication: Ma= March; Ap1, Ap2=the first and second half of the April; Mj1, Mj2=the first and second half of the May; Jn1, Jn2=the first and second half of the June; Jl1, Jl2=the first and second half of the July; Au1, Au2=the first and second half of the August. Conclusions It can be stated about the football field sports grasses that are subject to intensive wear, that applying short-term longevity fertilizers more frequently results in a more balanced effect than applying long-term longevity fertilizers with one or two applications. The effect of Scotts fertilizers on coverage is better than that of the traditional fertilizers. With the Scotts Sierrablen and Sportmaster types a better effect can be achieved due to their slower nutrient release, as in these cases the grassland was not subjected to hunger as opposed to the CN fertilizer. Based on the summarizing evaluation of the research data it can be stated that the change in the green colour of the grassland and the durability of the colour are determined by the longevity of the fertilizer, which is dependant on the time of release. The density and quality of the grassland are primarily defined, in addition to the species composition, by the durability of the continuous effect of the nitrogen. The plant coverage increase was dependant on the nutrient supply, whereas the species composition varied subject to the effect of residue.

Monthly precipitation sum, ground water table course, non-limited plant available soil water storage of three different soil varieties are evaluated considering the crop water demand. initiates about According to model calculations 2 mm daily water flux to the root zone for soils studied occurs at about 120 and 150 cm ground water table depth. It means that crop water supply is not highly dependent on the amount and distribution of precipitation in case of high ground water table course. . The non-limited available soil moisture storage proved to be suitable for judging the actual plant water supply. Keywords: non-limited soil water availability, capillary rise, ground water table, plant water demand, alluvial soils. Introduction Water is one of the most limiting environmental factors in plant production in Hungary (Rajkai, 2004). For this reason the amount and distribution of precipitation is critical in plant production in the rain feed fields in Hungary. However, on soils where capillary rise from ground water table occurs drought on crop production develops rare and with lower crop loss. From this reason ground water table depth and its annual fluctuation is crucial in the alluvial territories in Hungary especially in the large river tributaries as Szigetköz. Level of the ground water table is closely related to the water level and amount of the water flown in the riverbed. After direction of the water into the newly created bed of the Danube at Gabcikovo in 1992 the ground water level has changed in some respect due to the new water level and amount carried in the old riverbed. In order to monitor the changes of the changed water supplies in the Szigetköz region the Hungarian Ministry of Water and Environment maintains a monitoring network. Crop production of the monitored agricultural fields is affected both by the weather conditions and the ground water table course. The present study analyses plant usable amount of soil water storage at different varieties of meadow soils of the Danube alluviums in the Szigetköz region, Hungary. In dry and normal weather year crop yields and available soil water amount at selected sites are studied. The significance of capillary rise to the root zone in dry weather conditions in the Danube catchments area is also considered (Várallyay, 2006) Materials and methods Three regularly monitored sites are selected in a meadow soil on alluvial materials in the Danube catchments area between the main and the Moson-branch in the Szigetköz region, Hungary. Water storage of 1 m deep soil profile is calculated from the</p><p id="Pg167">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 168 monitored soil water content profile data collected at sites signed as Nr. 1019, 2659, and 2661. As in Fig. 1 shows the selected monitoring sites align in a straight line perpendicular to the main Danube branch. Distance of the closest Nr. 2659 site is 3 km and the farthest Nr. 2661 is 4.5 km from the main Danube bed. The Nr. 2661 site is at the lowest elevation (112,35 m above the Baltic-see). Elevation of the Nr. 2659 site is 12 cm, and the Nr. 1019 is 29 cm higher. The main soil properties used in the study are given in Table 1. 1 - Chernozem soil, clayey; 2 - Alluvial soil, loamy; 3 - Alluvial soil, loamy; 4 - Meadow soil, clayey; 5 - Alluvial soil, loamy; 6 - Chernozem soil, loamy Figure 1. Selected part from the soil map of Győr-Sopron County with the selected monitoring sites. Easily available amount of water is calculated from the water storage of 1 m soil profile minus the amount of limited availability water (pF&gt;3.1) (Sútor et al., 2005; Štekauerová &amp; Šútor, 2004; Novák &amp; Havrila, 2006.). Depth of the ground water table resulting 0.2 cmday-1 flux of capillary rise to 80 cm deep root zone we calculated by the computer program of Anlauf et al. (1990). Plant water demand was taken from the literature (Sárközy, 1989) for crops of the monitoring sites in 2003 and 2005 years (Table 2). Piezometric ground water table depths were measured at the observation wells at the monitoring sites at the time of soil water content profile measurements. Soil water contents were measured in preset access tubes with a BR-150 capacitance moisture meter (Andrén et al., 1991) in 10 cm interval down to the ground water table. Precipitation data are collected at the weather station in Győrladamér. Calculated monthly plant available soil water storages of the sample sites integrate precipitation and capillary rise added to the water stored in the soil and water consumption of the crops. Since soil water content measurements are done twice a month in the summer period, – in Slovakia (Štekauerova et al., 2002) – they have indicative value only. Table 1.

Model calculation with depth values and texture of the soil layers in Table 1 about 150 cm ground water table depth is needed for effective capillary flux into the root zone. Monthly amount of non-limited available water of 1 m soil is shown in Fig. 3a and 3b for dry and normal weather year of 2003 and 2005 when wheat crop was grown. Water supply of wheat is dramatically different due to about 150 mm more precipitation is the vegetation period and the ground water table course. -3,5 -3,0 -2,5 -2,0 -1,5 -1,0 -0,5 0,0 Jan Feb Már Ápr Máj Jún Júl Aug Sze Okt Nov Dec Months D e p th ( m ) 1019 in 2003 1019 in 2005 2659 in 2003 2659 in 2005 2661 in 2003 2661 in 2005 Figure 2.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 171 INFORMATICAL BACKGROUND OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS Csaba KUTI – László LÁNG – Zoltán BEDŐ Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Abstract: An information system was developed in Martonvásár to back up the work of research teams breeding various self-pollinating plant species. The system can be used for keeping records of breeding stock, for planning field and laboratory experiments, for site-plant performance evaluation, for the automated collection of experimental data and for the rapid evaluation of the results. The same system is used to record breeding data and the data of the institute’s cereal gene bank. The information system is used to organise the work of more than 40 scientists and their assistants. Research is conducted on large field areas at several locations, and in quality analysis and molecular genetics laboratories. The central database system set up to achieve uniform data handling allows simultaneous access to around 50 workstations connected to the network, thus facilitating team work. Each year the system handles approximately three million identification, observation and measurement data from over 100,000 plots. Keywords: agroinformatics, breeding, field trials, plot-plant interrelations, pedigree, software, barcode Introduction In Martonvásár breeding is underway on a number of cereal species, and large numbers of genotypes are tested each year in the field and under laboratory conditions. The computerised registration of the breeding material has been carried out since the mideighties using software developed in the institute. The first successful program package, which facilitated the registration of pedigrees, the design of various types of experiment and the printing of lists and field books, was completed by 1989 and was in use for ten years. It provided breeders with a number of important applications, such as automatic pedigree generation for new crosses, the generation of the selection history of each genotype, and the registration of international seed exchanges. With the appearance of digital instruments the volume of data increased enormously, necessitating the handling of over 2 million identification, observation and measurement data each year. This raised the need for online data input, for the simultaneous accessibility of the data to multiple users, and for the rapid retrieval of data classified in various ways, covering a single year or several years. Based on the experience gained in the previous ten years, the aim was to set up an information system capable of handling all the data arising during breeding, and containing applications designed to facilitate all the steps in the breeding process. Materials and methods The application package (Breeder) of the information system was developed using the Microsoft® Visual Basic Integrated Development Environment (VB-IDE). The applications can be run using various versions of the Windows operational system: Windows® 98/2000/XP®. The computers involved in the system include standard office equipment (Intel P4 3 GHz / 512 MB DDR, 200 GB HDD, DVDRW) and any data collector with the minimum configuration required for Windows 2000/XP. Requests from the work stations are processed by a central database server of the IBM eSeries 200 type with the following specifications: 1.6 GHz processor, 160 Gbyte hard disc, 1 Gbyte RAM. The combined size of the databases accumulated since 1984 is approximately 200 MB.</p><p id="Pg171">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 172 Data identification within the institute’s data collection network takes place using the barcode technology. This requires the following equipment: barcode readers (BCH5X49 / BS-L01), thermoprinters (TTX300 / TTX350) and conventional laser printers for printing self-adhesive labels. Data are collected from the following measuring and analytical instruments: Infratec® 1241, Inframatic® 8611, Mettler balances, Polycorder data collectors attached to combine harvesters, SKCS 4100, Alveograph and Alveolink, Farinograph, Minolta CR-300, Farinograph E, Texture Analyser, HPLC. Results and discussion 1.) Design and construction of a relational data model The aims of database design are as follows: (1) the uniform, integrated registration of all the breeding data, (2) the grouping of reports and the information required for decisionmaking, and editing, (3) the creation of links between breeding data and the genealogical, gene bank and seed exchange databases. In designing the data model (Hernandez, 2003) an analysis was made of all the available data (accumulated over two decades) and an estimate was made of current and future information requirements. This was followed by the construction of specific databases for each activity. It was decided that the databases containing breeding material should be renewed each year with a new file name (but with the same structure), and used to store data from the given harvesting year. Each of these annual databases contains separate data tables for various aspects of breeding. The central table contains the experimental designs, while other tables linked to this contain yields, data from measuring and analytical instruments, field observation data, quality data, etc. (Figure 1.). Other information is stored in separate databases, to which data are added from year to year. These include the genealogical, seed exchange, gene bank and pedigree analysis databases. The genealogical database contains two main data tables: one is used to store the pedigrees and the other to store the identification data of homozygous lines. These are linked to the crossing register and to the tables containing phenotype and genotype data. The seed exchange database registers all basic materials received from Hungarian and foreign partners and all seed lots sent out from the institute, while the gene bank database stores data on genetic resources from wheat and related species. The information system contains the tools required to create data new databases, data tables and to enter data in them. 2.) Pedigree management The 100–200 thousand lines sown each year in the institute’s breeding programme stem from 4–6 thousand crossing combinations, i.e. on average at least 20 progeny from each combination has to be registered. In young generations, where tests are made on large numbers of sister lines, and in later generations in the course of variety maintenance, each pedigree may be included in the annual register two or three hundred times. One major element of the new system is that each genotype only appears in the central register as a single entry, and information on the genotype can be attached from here to the registers of individual years or experiments (Kuti, 2006). The pedigree data recorded for each genotype and the other related information stored will be illustrated for the wheat variety Martonvásári-16 in Table 1.</p><p id="Pg172">VII.

Year of state registration 1987 12. Withdrawal of state registration 2001 The nomenclature of the pedigrees strictly follows the method reported by Purdy et al. (1968), which allows both the automatic generation of pedigrees when planning crosses and the automatic separation of the pedigree elements during pedigree analysis. Each combination is designated by a constant, unique “Pedigree Identification Code” (PID). 3.) Data collection Data collection is the vulnerable point of any information system (Szarka et al 2006). Automated or semi-automated data collection necessitates the use of digitally controlled measuring and analytical instruments, which are equipped with microprocessors and can be connected to a computer, and the introduction of the barcode technology. With the help of these modern techniques the rate of data collection can be increased to equal that of data processing, and this balance can be maintained even if the volume of data input suddenly increases (during the peak periods of harvesting and sowing). In Martonvásár the introduction of the barcode technology has completed replaced the use of handwritten codes. Barcodes ensure reliable identification and reduce errors to a minimum. 4.) Program modules for the organisation of breeding activities The program modules, each of which can be run independently, are able to organise all the following steps in the breeding process (Figure 1.):  Design of crosses - generation of pedigrees and identification codes for new combinations.  Selection - manual or automatic inclusion of genotypes or groups of genotypes in new experimental designs, including updating the selection history and checking data consistency; records of available and utilised seed quantities.  Determination of final sowing order (plot number), with the automatic inclusion of standard varieties, ordering the genotypes on the basis of any given parameter.  Preparation of sowing lists, taking into consideration the seed drill type and sowing method and automatically calculating the seed requirements per plot.  Flexible preparation of field books, containing observation and measurement data of several years, if required.  Printing of plastic plot markers using a thermoprinter; printing of self-adhesive labels containing barcodes and any other data from the database.  Registration of seed exchanges.</p><p id="Pg173">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 174  Replenishment and updating of the local gene bank.  Statistical evaluation of the recorded data.  Special search and listing functions. Figure 1. Diagram of the wheat breeding information system Conclusions The information system has been operating in Martonvásár since 2001. During peak season data are collected online from over 20 digital instruments (balances and quality analysing instruments) simultaneously, breeders carry on selection/statistical analysis/report generation from over 15 workstations on the central database. The system is designed to collect and evaluate agronomical data and trial data aiming the study of soil-plant interrelations.

By analysis of relations of maturity variables in the field and in the dryer, the association strength was described by Pearson coefficient on correlation of the mentioned variables, and it resulted as high as 0.7235. High correlation between the in-field and connection drydown rates showed that the cultivar Alaska had the highest seed drying speed both in the field conditions and in the dryer. Keywords: rapeseed, field, drying Introduction Technological (artificial) drying is the seed treatment procedure with the highest costs. The process is the final phase of the seed maturity process, which could not take place in the field due to the weather conditions. The aim of the drying process is to extract the excessive moisture from the seed, and to preserve the moisture content which is sufficient enough for the seed's latent existence but at the same time low enough to reduce to minimum the biological activity of microorganisms (Gely and Santalla, 2000). Speed and quality of seed drying depends on the drying method applied. Therefore, in natural drying process, the air temperature is approximate to the seed temperature which results in slow moisture losing speed. When drying medium is hot air, drydown rate is higher because increase in air temperature decreases the seed's relative moisture and increased difference between seed and air moisture, speeds up the drying speed. The efficiency of drying process is also affected by air's heat intensity, relative moisture level, air flow speed and design of the dryer. Differences in content of specific parts of the seed as well as mass relations of these parts result in different behaviour of the seed during the drying process. In addition to anatomy of the cell structure, particularly of the seed wall, important determinants in the drying process are also the seed's anatomic parts, and their interrelations within the seed (Mujumdar, 2000). . Cultivation of rapeseed extends the plant rotation which affects, directly or indirectly, the yield of other crops in the rotation and, thus, results in reduced costs of individual crops (Drezner et al., 2007). In rapeseed brought from the field, moisture content may be as high as 18%. Only the seeds with moisture content below 8% can be efficiently preserved. Hence, the moisture content exceeding 8% must be removed from the seed Since dryers use high amount of energy for seed drying (about 30% of total energy input) a wide range of new drying techniques has been introduced, in combination with modifications in the dryers' design, with the aim to reduce drying costs and to improve the quality of stored seeds as much as possible (Voća et al., 2007). However, all these engineering and technological modifications are not sufficient for further reduction of drying costs, and new possibilities for drying efficiency are being investigated.</p><p id="Pg175">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 176 According to Kiš et al. (2006), one of potential methods of improving economy and quality of seed, would be to optimise the harvest and drying on the basis of linking rapeseed drying to the convection drying process. Based on this, this paper will compare non-dependable processes of in-field rapeseed drydown rate with the drydown rate in the convection dryer on three "00" cultivars of rapeseed grown in Republic of Croatia. Materials and methods Examinations were conducted during three years in Croatia's region of western Slavonia on three "00" rapeseed cultivars, Alaska, Express and Lirajet. All three cultivars are eruca acid free and low in glucosinolate content. In the first growing season (2003), the sum of medium monthly temperatures was 113.3C, and precipitations level was 476.6 mm; in the second growing season (2004) these values were 125.9ºC and 653 mm respectively. During the last research year (2005) the sum of medium monthly temperatures was 113.8C and precipitations amount was 728 mm. The experiment was set for each year and each sort in three iterations (by split-splot). The size of one plot was 6x1000 m, with one meter distance between the plots. Soil used for experiment setting was pseudo-glay. Same crop production measures were applied in all three experiment years. Seed sampling started in the period of green maturity and samples were taken every third day until the harvest. Seeds were picked manually, and moisture was determined by conventional etalon method (105C, 3 h). Based on the results obtained, the curve of seed moisture loss in field, i.e., maturity speed until harvest, was determined. After the harvest, and in order to establish the difference in drying rate of the investigated cultivars, the seed was dried in a lab-scale dryer placed. Samples were dried in a thick stationary layer (15 cm) at air temperature of 60C and at drying speed of 0.9-1.3 ms-1. Measurements were conducted in ten iterations for each drying cultivar, each sort and year. Results were statistically analysed. For the analysis of rapeseed moisture, loss by days in field and artificial drying conditions, the mathematical model of exponential curve of seed moisture loss was applied. For understanding the association between in-field maturity time and in-dryer drying time, Pearson correlation coefficient was used (SAS, 2001). Results and discussion In the harvest, seed yield of examined rapeseed cultivars, Alaska, Express and Lirajet, was determined for all three research years. The highest rapeseed yield was obtained in 2004, and, in average, it amounted to 5,204 kg/ha, followed by 3,125 kg/ha in 2005, while it was the lowest in 2003, a drought year, when it was 3,025 kg/ha. The differences in the seed yield between the examined cultivars were statistically considerable. The highest yield was obtained on the cultivar Express, 5,480 kg/ha. When observed by cultivars, the highest average yield of all three years was obtained on Express (4,069 kg/ha), followed by Alaska (with a yield of 3,686 kg/ha), while Lirajet gave the lowest yield (3,599 kg/ha). Differences between the sorts were statistically significant. It is evident that the yields were mostly influenced by climate conditions during the rapeseed cultivation period.</p><p id="Pg176">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 177 By sampling during the period of green maturity until harvest (every three days), the seed moisture content was determined and the results obtained were used to determine the exponential equation of seed moisture loss in the field conditions until harvest on all three cultivars, which is given in Table 1.

Negative coefficient in the mathematical model shows that the drydown rate lowers with time, i.e., that it is the lowest at the end of maturity period. Seed moisture in cultivars at the maturity end is held by stronger so that the specific moisture loss takes longer time. Maturity rate of the cultivar Alaska was the highest, because the late vegetation cultivar is the same so that in time when measurements started, seed moisture was significantly higher than in cultivars Express and Lirajet. Year 2005 corroborates the maturity speed of the examined cultivars although the moisture loss rate is higher than in 2004, because that was the year with less precipitation during the maturity period. 2003, as a dry year shows that there were no large differences in drydown rate among cultivars in the field. For the purpose of analysis of rapeseed moisture loss during the drying process in lab scale dryer, a convection dryer exponential equation is shown in Table 2, as a convection drying mathematical model.

In 2005, drydown rates are lower than in 2004 for the observed cultivars while the dry year 2003 showed no large differences in drydown rates in the observed cultivars. The analysis of time variables of in-field and convection dryer maturity gave the Pearson correlation coefficient for the mentioned variables which is as high as 0.7235. It results that there is a strong connection between seed moisture loss during in-field maturity period in relation to moisture loss rate during the convection drying period. When being acquainted with this coefficient, it can be determined that faster maturing cultivars will also lose seed moisture at higher rate, which was corroborated. By knowing Pearson correlation value only, it can be concluded that the relation between two variables is linear, and that the calculated coefficient indicates the strength of association. Regression technique is using the presence of association between two variables in order to project the value of one (dependent variable) from the other one (independent variable) by regression equation construction. Linear regression model best describes linear connection between in-field maturity time and in-dryer maturity time. From the estimation of regression coefficients and pertaining error, the linear regression equation was obtained, y = 1.2632x-5.3227; where: y is in-dryer drying time in minutes and x is in-field drying time in days. Conclusions Based on a three-year research of rapeseed cultivars (Express, Lirajet, Alaska), as energy sources for biodiesel production, the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. Mathematical models of seed maturity of cultivars determine seed moisture content during maturity as well as maturity speed. There are no statistically significant maturity differences in the observed cultivars. There are significant differences in maturity by days and years, which means that they depend on weather conditions. Higher the precipitation levels during a year, the wider the difference, and vice versa. 2. Mathematical models of observed cultivars' seed drydown in the dryer determine drying curves, i.e., seed moisture content during drydown process and moisture loss rate and thus the time needed for setting the dryer in terms of capacity and energy. For the examined cultivars there are no statistically significant drydown differences within one year but considerable differences are obtained on a year to year basis. 3. Coefficient calculation may enable to determine that there is a strong connection between seed moisture loss in relation to moisture loss in the convection drying process, and that cultivar with higher drydown rate in the field conditions will have a higher moisture loss during convection drying in a lab scale dryer.

Appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has resulted in prohibition of using meat bone meal in animal nutrition as a by-product of rendering. It is a fact that slaughterhouse waste is highly valuable raw material, as well as alkaline hydrolysis as a method for the remediation of slaughterhouse waste or meat bone meal. In the process of alkaline hydrolysis, slaughterhouse waste is mixed with alkali NaOH/KOH and boiled for 3-6 hours at temperature of 150°C and pressure of 4 bars. The resulting chemical compound is a neutral or partially alkaline solution of organic substances suitable for anaerobic microbiological decomposition, or a valuable raw material for anaerobic digestion and very good fertilizer. Keywords: alkaline hydrolysis, slaughterhouse waste, biogas, fertilizer Introduction Processing of animal carcasses is generally achieved by incineration (pyrolisis), gasification or other forms of heat treatment, and may involve burning of complete carcasses, rendering or a combination of these two processes. According to recent legislation in EU, Regulation 1774/2002/EC on animal by-products limits the use of materials derived from rendering as human or animal foodstuff. Rendering process is a process which generally consists of crushing and grinding of animal by-products under high pressure and high temperature, leading concequently to hydrolysis and separation of melted fat from solid material, meat bone meal. Meat bone meal had traditionally been used as feed supplement for animals, but was banned for such use in the EU. Now, the only method for its final treatment is incineration or its usage as alternative fuel in cement kills. Regulation 1774/2002/EC provided by the European Commission allows the use of alternative methods of treating or disposing of animal by-products. Following methods are proposed as alternative: alkaline hydrolysis, high pressure-high temperature hydrolysis, high pressure hydrolysis and biogas production, and biodiesel production from tallow. According to the above mentioned regulation, animal by-products are divided into three categories: Category 1 implies to materials with the highest risk for public health, animals or environment. Category 2 includes all animal by-products such as digestive tract content and all animal materials collected when treated waste water from slaughterhouse. Category 3 comprises of those animal by-products which would be adequate for human consumption but for commercial reasons aren’t. The second and third categories are suitable for biogas production while the first category and part of the second category are suitable for alkaline hydrolysis. The aim of this paper was to investigate alkaline hydrolysis as a new method of pre-treatment in production of biogas</p><p id="Pg179">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 180 and fermented fertilizers; moreover, quality of fermented fertilizers and amount of biogas production was determined. Materials and methods Slaughterhouse waste used in this research was taken from the rendering house of “Agroproteinka d.d.“ from Sesvetski Kraljevac. Alkaline hydrolysis of animal by-products was carried out in a closed system made of inox, with addition of 45% potassium hydroxide solution at pressure of 3.0 bar and temperature of 133°C in a three-hours period. The process of anaerobic digestion of hydrolized slaughterhouse waste took place in a sealed vessel (fermenter) under controlled conditions, which was according to literature (Boekhurst et al., 1981). To promote bacterial activity, the fermenter maintained temperature of at least 35°C (mesophylic conditions). Lab-scale biogas plant reactors were filled with mixture of slaughterhouse waste, water and inoculum for triggering the fermentation reaction, and the biogas production was set out. The inoculum used as hydrolized slaughterhouse waste fermentation agent was active slime taken from the waste water treatment facility in the town of Velika Gorica. Chemical analyses were conducted on fermented remains of slaughterhouse waste, previously treated by alkaline hydrolysis, and included following determinations: pH, directly from sample on pH-meter with combined electrode (DIN EN 12506:2003), electrical conductivity (E.C.), by means of conductivity meter MA5964 with combined electrode design (ISO 7888:1985), total nitrogen, determined by Kjeldahl method (ISO 1871:1975), nitric nitrogen (NO3 -), determined by spectrophotometric method by means of yellow color complex by phenol-disulphonic acid (USDA-SCS-NSCS, 1992), ammoniac nitrogen (NH4 +), determined by spectrophotometric method using Nessler's reagent based on Jackson method (1958), phosphorus, determined by the molybdateblue spectrophotometric method, potassium and sodium determined by flame photometry, while all other microelements (Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Cu, Fe, Pe, Cd) are determined by use of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Results and discussion Anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse waste, previously treated with alkali, was conducted for sanation of the first category waste, which gave the organic fertilizer as a by-product. Figure 1 shows the cumulative increment of biogas produced from hydrolyzed slaughterhouse waste. It can be stated that cumulative biogas production started only fifth day of fermentation respectively, when methane phase, in which biogas production was emphasized, prevailed over acid phase in the substrate. Such indicators are comparable with the data found in the literature, which quotes that biogas production from organic waste is higher as dry matter levels are lower (Wulf et al., 2006). Methane share during the fermentation was on average 63%, while CO2 share was 33%.</p><p id="Pg180">VII.

High amount of organic substance in samples resulted in high organic carbon content (45.0048.0%). The organic carbon content in filtrate was low (4.66-11.50%) and therefore it doesn’t represent potential problem in application as organic fertilizer.

Cereal Research Communications 182 dealt with if these products would be used in agriculture. Measurements of pH values established almost neutral reaction (pH 6.19-6.32), which indicates that fermentation was performed well, i.e. that volatile fatty acids were not developed, and that there was no acidification of substrate, i.e., methane production was not halted. As for the quantity of basic biogenic nutrients, the examined samples were very rich in nitrogen (13.0813.49% N), phosphorus (2.38-2.82% P2O5; original sample and 1.44-1.89% P2O5; precipitate) and potassium (2.56-2.80% K2O; original sample and 1,56-1,68% K2O; precipitate), i.e., N:P:K ratio, which is 3.07:1:1.02. Referring to C/N ratio, fermented residue of meat-bone meal is below standard values for bio-fertilizer and it was 5.85:1. The amounts of nutrients (N, P, K) in the analyzed samples was several times higher than in the same nutrient in quality farmyard manure from domestic animals. Since the mentioned samples are rich in nutrients they can be used in agricultural production as organic fertilizers. The contents of heavy metals in the examined samples are below maximum allowed contents, set out under Regulation on protection of agricultural land against harmful pollution agents (Official Gazette 15/92). Conclusion Cumulative increase in biogas after anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse waste previously treated by alkaline hydrolysis showed that in mesophylic conditions 33% of carbon (IV) oxide, 63% of methane and 4% of other components of biogas were generated. On the basis of chemical analysis of fermented residue of slaughterhouse waste after anaerobic digestion, it can be concluded that treated waste contained large amount of water (82.7%), namely percentage of dry matter was very low (17.3%). Total nitrogen content was about 9.4%. The amounts of phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium determined by analysis were found to be in normal percentages. Total content of microelements and heavy metals was found to be in amounts that do not exceed maximum allowed contents set out by the Croatian Regulation. In relation to farmyard manure, this fertilizer has more nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium and higher content of microelements. Hence, the fertilizer can be used for treatment in plant production. However, before its utilization, soil analysis should be carried out and the particular plant’s needs for macro- and microelements should be determined.

Abstract: The objective of this paper was to determine the biomass production of three rapeseed cultivars - Alaska, Bristol and Eurol - in a three-year period. Stand was determined for each cultivar, as well as whole plant mass and height, number of branches and stem mass for the purpose of determining the biomass production per each cultivar. In order to determine to which extent it is possible for rapeseed biomass to replace oil, calorimeter was used to measure heating values. Furthermore, ash, volatile and combustible matter, C-fix, sulphur (combustible and bound) as well as volatile components were determined. Keywords: biomass, rapeseed, cultivars, heating value, energy production Introduction Agricultural production in EU, as well as in Croatia, is facing uncertain times. High production costs, low yields and competition from other countries challenge its future. At the same time, increasing environmental and energy security concerns are making renewable energies more attractive. EU recently endorsed a target of achieving 20% of energy consumption coming from renewables by year 2020, which opens up enormous opportunities for certain agricultural commodities that can be used for energy purposes (Antal and Grasselli, 2007; Blanco and Azqueta, 2008). Consequently, Croatia has started with biodiesel production, and future plans are 100.000 tons to be produced by 2010, which will make biodiesel the most interesting liquid biofuel for the country. Croatian concept of biodiesel production is based on rapeseed, due to the fact that it is the most cost-effective production. Rapeseed is best grown on good quality soil, meaning of its physical, chemical and biological properties; and most convinient soil is the one rich in organic matter. Most commonly, it is fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium fertilizers, and needs calcium in the form of calcium carbonate. After the harvest, straw residues can also be used as a source of energy. Profitability of biodiesel production encompasses today rapeseed meal and glycerol in addition to biodiesel. Straw is not taken into account despite the fact that it is quite valuable (Kiš et al., 2007). However, approx. 30% of the biomass can be gathered from the field without any major biological changes occurring. (Ciria et al., 2000; Krička et al., 2000). Therefore, this paper aimed at exploring the exploitability of rapeseed biomass after the harvest for energy generation; paper also determined whether there is an influence of cultivar on mass and energy value of biomass per unit of surface. Materials and methods Research was conducted in a three-year period (2005-2007). The first research year was within temperature and precipitation limits of yearly averages for this area; however, the second research year was rainy indeed, and the third one was quite dry. Rapeseed “00” cultivars in the research were as follows: Bristol, Alaska, and Eurol. The experiment was organized in three repetitions. The soil on which the experiment was conducted was pseudo-gleic, and preeceding crop to rapeseed was wheat. The agrotechnological measures applied on the experimental plots were as follows: stubble field disking, initial</p><p id="Pg183">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 184 fertilization (before plowing, 41 kg ha-1 N, 117 kg ha-1 P2O5 and 176 kg ha-1 K2O), deep plowing 30-35 cm, closing of the furrow with the disk harrow 2x along the tracks, levelling and planing, pre-sowing herbicide incorporation (Devrinol 2.7 kg ha-1 and Triflurolex 1.5 kg ha-1), the application of the seedbed preparator in additional presowing tillage 1x along the tracks, sowing by wheat grain drill (seed norm 4.6 kg ha-1), first top-dressing with 54 kg ha-1 N (KAN), second top-dressing with 43 kg/ha N (KAN) (Pospišil et al., 2000). Research factor was the rapeseed cultivar, and research parameters were as follows: mass and length of whole plant, number of branches, stem mass and branch mass, and pod mass. Based on the results of moisture and weight of specific insertions, the pondered mass value was calculated. In this way, the actual amount of available biomass per hectare was determined. The average biomass moisture was 50%; and after the harvest it was left to dry up to the moisture of 30% (Ciria et al., 2000; Krička et al., 2000). Then, for the purpose of calculating to which extent rapeseed biomass is capable of replacing oil, calorimeter was used to determine the upper and the lower heating value of the biomass at certain humidity. Also, ash, volatile and combustible substances, C-fix, sulphur (combustible and bound) as well as volatile components were determined by the process of burning at 900ºC (Onay et al., 2001). All statistical analyses were carried out using the PROC GLM procedure by STAT module of SAS Release 8.2 (SAS, 2001). Results and discussion Based on the research results, it can be claimed that the significantly biggest average mass of a single plant was found in the second research year, 351,09 g, unlike the first (150.38 g) and third (150.65 g) research year when plant mass values weren’t significantly different. Consequently, it is obvious that the dry year resulted in the lowest average stand for all of the cultivars. Similarly, if the mass of a single plant is analyzed for all of the cultivars in the research, it can be concluded that, despite the fact that the stand for cultivar Eurol was lower than the stand for cultivars Bristol and Alaska, the produced average mass of a single plant was not significantly different (Table 1). Research results indicate that, in spite of the difference in plant stand, branch number, and mass and stem mass were not significantly different for any of the research cultivars. Branch number depended on the cultivar and the production conditions; pod number depended on the number of lateral branches; however, pod mass significantly varied among the research cultivars; the highest pod mass had Alaska, which was also the tallest research cultivar. Biomass samples of all three cultivars were taken after the harvest and their moisture was analyzed in order to determine their fuel properties (Table 2). Table 1.

Besides that, cultivar Bristol had the highest share of volatile and combustible substances, and the lowest share of C-fix and coke. It is very important to notice that there is no sulphur as the by-product of straw combustion. Sulphur is a environmental pollution factor and it is also a consistent of dross after the burning process (C-fix and coke are within permitted limits). High content of volatile substances and almost ash-free mass is favourable for optimal combustion in reactors; certain amount of biomass can be produced per hectare as the replacement for liquid fuel.

In the second year, the average stand was 30.2 plants/m2; the average number of plants for cultivar Alaska was 30.5 plants/m2, Bristol 32 plants/m2 and Eurol 28 plants/m2. The lowest average plant stand per unit of surface was found in the third year, it amounted 25.8 plants/m2; i.e. in the third research year the average stand of plants of cultivar Alaska was 29 plants/m2, Bristol 24.5 plants/m2 and Eurol 24 plants/m2. It is obvious that cultivar Eurol had the lowest plant stand per surface unit, which had a direct effect on the biomass production. Despite the fact that Bristol had the highest average number of plants per surface unit, it didn’t have the highest biomass quantity; on the other hand, it did have the same oil equivalent value as cultivar Alaska, which produced the most biomass. Cultivars Alaska and Bristol were found to have a favourable oil equivalent value as well; Eurol didn’t show adequate stand stability, i.e. plant number per surface unit, which was manifested</p><p id="Pg185">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 186 by a constantly lower number of plants per surface unit. Climatic and soil conditions play an important role in the cultivation of rapeseed grown in dry farming, namely in conditions present in the first and third research year. For the purpose of intensive rapeseed production on pseudo-gleic soil, it is necessary to apply amelioration. Pseudogleic soil is characterized by unfavorable physical features - it contains a compact layer almost impervious for precipitation water. Moreover, high dust content is the cause of lower structural stability, tendency towards the creation of surface crust and high level erodibility. It is also characterized by undesirable chemical features, higher acidity, lack of humus, small adsorption capacity and lack of available nutrients. Biological features are less favourable, as well. It is therefore advisable to apply integral amelioration measures for the purpose of larger production, measures comprising three phases: excess water draining, rhizosphere layer deepening and soil structure and its chemical features improvement. However, it is not necessary to ameliorate soil when growing of rapeseed, because rainfall is usually adequate in its vegetation period. If these measures are applied, pseudo-gleic soil can be used as favourable soil for rapeseed production. These soil reacts well to crop rotation with rapeseed included which, among other benefits, loosens the soil with its roots thus improving its features required for plant production. Conclusions Data regarding morphological properties indicate that there was no significant difference between cultivars when speaking of morphological properties and plant number per unit of surface; differences in yield were caused by the peculiarities of genotype and its adjustment to the agro-ecological conditions of the area. Generally, rapeseed is a good culture for pseudo-gleic soil used in this research, and it is recommended for crop rotation. Differences found in certain years were the result of weather conditions. If biomass is to be used as fuel, it is necessary to leave it on the field to dry to the moisture approximating 30%. In a three-year average of using 30% of rapeseed straw, the best results of lower heating values were found in cultivar Bristol, then Alaska; the lowest results were found in cultivar Eurol.

After controlling the calibration, we found that NIR analysis is suited to characterize the raw-protein and wet gluten content of samples. During our examinations, we found bigger significant difference in the qualities examined between the habitats than the varieties. Coefficients of variation were higher among the varieties. Sequences of varieties in case of either quality were very variable per habitat. Habitat differences originated from differing of soil parameters and meteorological circumstances (mainly the distribution and amount of precipitation). Keywords: triticale, grain quality Introduction Triticale is a stable hybrid of wheat and rye was one of the most successful cultured plants in Hungary in the last two decades when its sowing area touched the 158.000 hectares. The largest advantages of its growing are its productivity often exceeds the wheat, its growing are cost and environment saving (triticale requires less herbicides and insecticides than wheat) and its yield is easy to sell as a good quality feed or food grains. Favouring forage value of triticale is owing to 13-16 % crude protein content which is depending on the abiotic condition but it is always higher than rye. The high content of lysine, methionine and cysteine are particularly valuable in the protein of triticale (Sipos, 2007.). Triticale will be one of the most promising non-foods, small-grain cereals for industrial production. It has a prospect as a raw material for bio-fuels (ethanol), organic and industrial chemicals, paper, the building and plastic industries and the beverage (beer) industry. In addition, it may also be possible to utilize triticale as a substitute for wheat and rye for human use in baking and breakfast cereal products (Bóna, 2002). The production of triticale is mainly concentrated in the following areas: • Areas characterized by raw, sandy soils with low pH, low organic matter content and poor in macronutrients. These large areas are located in the north-eastern (Nyírség) and western (Somogy) parts of Hungary. • Areas characterized by sandy soils with a pH of 6 to 9 and low or medium organic matter content. Precipitation is usually very low in these areas (400 to 500 mm/year). These soils are rich in calcium and sodium; sometimes the B-horizon is highly sodic. These areas are located in the middle of the country. • Areas characterized by meadow ‘solonetz solods’ with dry and compact soils, located in middle of the country. • Areas characterized by black Chernozem soils and meadows (appropriate for excellent wheat production). To a lesser extent, growers produce triticales on these soils for feed for the pork and poultry industries. • Areas characterized by red or brown forest soils, located in the western part of Hungary. These are smaller, hilly areas where wheat has poor yield in terms of quantity and end-use quality traits.</p><p id="Pg187">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 188 Today, on all of the areas previously described, smallholders as well as larger farms utilize this crop as a feed grain for livestock and obtain better results with triticale than with any other crops (Bóna, 2004). The average grain yield in the poor areas varies between 3 and 4.5 tonnes/ha. However, recent studies revealed that even in the infertile, acidic, sandy soils in north-eastern Hungary triticale can produce up to 7.9 tonnes/ha yield, if properly fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium (Kádár, 1999). Biberdžić (2007) reported that grain protein yield of 4 triticale variety were similar in their experiment applied fertilizing treatments with different NPK levels. Materials and methods We analyzed triticale grain samples from variety testing trials in five habitats in 2007. Grain samples originated from mixture of four repetitions of 11 varieties per habitats. Parcels of trials got fertilizers by soil tests according to uniform methodology. Weeds and insect pests were eliminated but it has not been used fungicide in trials.

Grain samples from the five habitats were examined with NIR analyzer (Infratec 1241). We used the last wheat calibration what we controlled with conventional laboratory methods. Results and discussion Firstly, we analysed the context between the results of NIR analysis and the conventional laboratory method. We compared 14 analytical outcomes and we detected a strong correlation (r=0.97) between the results of raw-protein content of Kjeldahlmethod and NIR analysis. We got lower correlation between the results of wet gluten content (r=0.92) and the Zeleny-index (r=0.52).

Coefficients of variation were considerably high. The most equable yield was presented by variety number 11 with CV=14.1%. Sequence of varieties by raw-protein content was very variable per habitat, variety number 5 was on 9-11 place in the sequence but variety number 1 placed among 1 and 10 depending on trial conditions. Changing sequence of varieties was similar in wet gluten content, the most equable varieties in term of position were number 3 and 5 (placed among 9 and 11) the most variable were number 6 and 7 (placed among 1 and 10).

Cereal Research Communications 190 The best quality results were originated from Gyulatanya, where it was the smallest the difference between the triticale varieties. Conclusions During our examinations, we found bigger significant difference in the qualities examined between the habitats than the varieties. Coefficients of variation were higher among the varieties. Sequence of varieties in case of either quality were very variable per habitat, there were the most permanent positions of the two most weak and the one best variety. Among the habitats one (Kecskemét) had considerably high coefficient of variation, probably the disadvantageous circumstances put to the test the adaptability of varieties. This coefficient was the lowest in the optimum habitat to triticale (Gyulatanya) with the highest raw-protein and wet gluten contents. Because of the similar cropping technology in trials, habitat differences originated from differing of soil parameters and meteorological circumstances (mainly the distribution and amount of precipitation). After more year old trials on the same habitats, we can define more exact pedology and meteorological effects to the grain quality. Acknowledgements This project was supported by ABO MILL Zrt.

ON DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES Sándor KESZTHELYI1 – Pál KURUCSAI1 – Tamás SZABÓ1 – Ferenc PÁL-FÁM1 – Zsolt MARCZALI2 1University of Kaposvár, FAS, Kaposvár, Department of Botany and Plant Production 2University of Pannonia, GFA, Keszhely, Institute of Plant Protection Abstract: Our experiments was motivated by more accurate knowing of damages of corn weevil (Tanymecus dilaticollis Gyll.) and the preventive chemical treatments. In the interest of trials we placed from acreage originating corn weevils in isolator. In isolator was 1-2 leafy corn. We ended up the trials three different soil types (sand, transition braun forest soil, clay). Beside the controll setup one dressed (active substance: klotianidin) and one soil disinfected treatments (active substance: teflutrin) were in the case of every soil in the trial. We memorised the perished individual number by 6. day, -by the end of the experiment, percentage of leave surface decreasing, and we determined effectiveness of different pesticides treatments. Our investigations proved the efficiency of seed treatment and the inefficiency of soil disinfection in point of corn weevil damages. On the surface of grain impregnated klotianidin successfully protected juvenile corn from damages of pest due to agent’s absorptive influence. Mayor of the experimental beetles were perished by 6. day (90-95%), and the leave damage was negligable by the end of the experiment too (0-1.35%). Beside of this our results confirmed the decreasing of pesticide effectiveness in the case of compacted soil type. Keywords: corn weevil, seed treatment, soil disinfection Introduction Corn is one of the most important cultivated plants of Hungary, for the last years its sowing area can be said unchanged ranging from 1,1-1,2 million ha (Izsáki, 2007; Hegyi et al., 2006). Easy to see that disclose the biotic yield decreasing factors of this economically important crop is an essential task (Pepo, 2006). Literary data on damages caused by weevils in Hungary were first supplied by Sáringer (1952). Parallel to it the first yield loss in corn was discovered by Manninger on 4 June 1944 in Alsotekeres (Kadocsa, 1957). The corn weevil (Tanymecus dilaticollis Gyllenhal) is an East-Mediterranean species. Its original areas of distribution are the Near-East, the Balkans and southern regions of the late Soviet-Union (Nizamlioglu, 1954). Acording to Čamprag (1969) its multiplication must first be reckoned with on meadow- and chernozem soils. The corn weevil is a polyphagous species. The damage done by the adults is typical. At the beginning they masticate the corn leaves is an irregular shape. In serious cases they may even lay waste the field. Then the further development of the plant depends on whether the meristema has remained intact. According to Takács (1972) the consequence of extensive masticating at a 2-3 leafy stage is that the plant dies even when the meristema has remained intact. Takács (1972, 1973) found that in the case of an individual density of 40 adults/m2 devastation occurred in all circumstances. Due to economic considerations control of larvae cannot be taken into account (Balás, 1966). The chemical control of adults was earlier carried out by soil disinfection before or combined with with sowing, as well as by repeated dusting, and later by spraying. Subsequently Takács (1975) achieved excellent results by employing seed treatment and various granulates in large-scale farm. In addition Sáringer (1990) emphasizes the</p><p id="Pg191">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 192 environment protecting aspect of seed dressing and throwing granulates in the row instead of the surface treatment procedures. Materials and methods For the purpose of examinations corn weevils were collected in the second decade of April 2007 from a 50 ha field beside Toponár (Somogy county) after autumn deep ploughing. The corn weevils were placed under isolator previously sown with corn (1-2 leafy stage). The experiment consisted of a seed treatment- [Bayer CropScience® Poncho FS600 (a.s.: klotianidin)] and a soil disinfection [Syngenta® Force 1,5G (a.s.: teflutrin)] treatment (13 kg/ha). Each treatment was carried out with 3×10 replications on three soil types (sand, transition braun forest soil, clay) per treatment. Plants growing on transition braun forest soil without pesticide treatment were taken control. In the course of the experiment the number of insects perished by the 6th day and by the end of the experiment (14 days), respectively, as well as the percentage of plant masticating were registered. To determine the efficiency of the pesticide treatment we used the Abbott index [Abbott index: A% =[(C-T)/C]×100; where: C= number of the living weevils in control. We calculated with living individual number by the 6th day (in the case of control: 2.4 living weevil number)](Seprős 1984). Different of treatments were statistically analysed by variance analysis by means of Microsoft Excel 2003 software. Results and discussion Table 1. shows the results of insecticide treatments of corn weevil on various soil types. The table contains the average emerging time of the corn plants too. Unambiguous conclusions cannot be drawn from these values, but it is clearly seen that on the sand soil the plants appeared nearly one day earlier than on the compacted soils. Table 1.

In the case of seed treatment the death values were higher in both cases. By the 6th day most of the experimental insects died, and in the course of the 14 days: observation a nearly 100% death of insects was registered for all the three types of soil. Proceeding from the lighter to the compacted soil type the rate of death decreased while the difference in it between the two points of time of observation increased. On sand soil the rate of death was 80% by the 6th day; int he case of clay soil the same value was 46.6%, and even by the end of the experiment did not reach 100%. The</p><p id="Pg192">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 193 values of the soil disinfection treatment were more or less similar to those recorded for the control, and no remarkable difference was found in the case of the various soil types either. When judging the different treatments the number of the days survived and the values of the Abbott index may give a clearer view. The efficiency of seed treatment with insecticide is conspicuous here too. However, when considering the number of days survived the efficiency of seed treatment was not found to be essentially modified by the various types of soil, still, in this treatment nearly half of the weevils lived as long as in the control or as in the case of plants sown combined with the soil disinfectant. Survival of weevils on plants treated with piretroid soil infectant was about the same as in the control, while on an average it was higher than that. That Abbott index shows best the efficiency of the treatments. Seed treatment – in particular on sand soil – seems to be the most efficient of all treatments. Although the values of the Abbott index fall back towards the compacted soil types in this treatment too, still they are essentially higher than those in the soil disinfection. The Abbott index of soil disinfection applied to transition hard soil indicates that int he control fewer insects were living at the time of observation than in the mentioned pesticide treatment. Figure 1. Leave masticating of juvenile corn in the case of different treatments The plant masticating% shows the damage done to the assimilation surface of the juvenile plant. It is clearly seen that under the influence of seed treatment with insecticide the insects hardly ate. The destruction of the leaf surface was negligible. On sand soil no damage occurred, and on clay soil it did not amount to 1.5% either. The soil disinfectant, on the other hand, could not prevent the damage done to the leaves. In the course of repetitions higher than 50% destruction of the leaf surface was registered, which did not differ from the values obtained in the control. In order to make a visual examination of the damage caused to the leaf surface possible, the scanned figure of plants from transition soils is annexed here (Fig.1.) The variance analysis confirmed statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0,0001) in the case of the number of the survived days and leave masticating. This significant difference didn’t confirm in the case of the number of the perished insects by 6th day.</p><p id="Pg193">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 194 Conclusions Out of the insecticide treatments examined the efficiency of seed treatment and the failure of soil disinfection has to be emphasized. Owing to its systemic effect the klotianidin active substance impregnated to the surface of seed successfully protected the developing plants from the damage of corn weevils. However, we found in our experiment that the efficiency of the pesticide may decrease in harder soils. The soil disinfectant containing teflutrin as active agent was not able to protect the juvenile plants from the damage caused by the corn weevil. Anyway, the range of action of the systemic pesticide widely and successfully used against western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) (Takács et al., 2005a, 2005b) does not cover the damages of weevils and possibly of other pests of the corn either. On the basis of our investigations, out of the preventive pesticide treatments used against the weevil pests of corn seed treatment is the technological procedure from which satisfactory efficiency can be expected.

Our examinations were focused on the investigations of the hailstorm and corn smut fungus [Ustilago maydis (DC.)Corda] infection effects on corn seed germination, as well as inkernel air-dry content values of the seeds. The corn samples were collected in 3. September 2007 from three plots (control, hail stormed and transition areas). Beside, smut-infected samples were collected, too. The samples were analysed by Wendei-analysis in order to get information about the in-kernel air-dry content value changes of the hail stormed and smut infected seeds. In order to supplement our study -amylase activity, sucrose, glucose and fructose content in the first 7 days of seed germination were also investigated. In the case of hail stormed samples cob mass and in-kernel air-dry content values decreased. The smut fungus infection decreased the raw protein (-2.7 %), raw fibre (-0.3%), raw ash (-0.5%), extractable matter exempt from N (-12.9%) and starch (-9.2%) contents. It was evident that enzyme activity and sugar content in the stressed germinating was significantly lower compared with the control ones. The lowest data were detected in the seeds originating from corn smut fungus infected plants. Our results clearly show that stress conditions applied altered not only the chemical components in the seeds but decreased their germinating activity as well. Keywords: corn, corn smut fungus, hailstorm, -amylase activity, sucrose, glucose, nutrient content Introduction In the case of Hungarian climatic conditions rainfall and temperature are the two essential factors determining near the corn growth the average yield mass development (Izsáki, 2007; Surányi, 1957). In the recent years different biotic factors have contribute significantly to cultivation insecurity (Keszthelyi, 2007). The mechanical damage of hailstorm consists on the decrease of assimilation surface, resulting the insufficiency of crop production (Trappeniers et al., 1992). The cultivated plants can be damaged in different degree depending on the phenological phase in which they are affected with hailstorm. In the juvenile stage of vegetation corn is less sensitive to hailstorm, but later (tasseling, florification, fertilisation stage), hailstorm can cause significant decrease in crop production (Anda et al., 2002). Near the mechanical damage caused by hailstorm secondary infections caused by phytopathogenic micro-organisms can take into consideration too (Österreicher et al., 2001). The corn smut fungus infection has a particular importance in seed breeding fields (Bölker, 2001). Corn smut is caused by the basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis (DC.) Corda, an ubiquitous pathogen of corn causing smut disease. The name "smut" comes from the appearance of the ripe galls containing dark sooty spores. The fungus grows through the kernel and causes hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Both of these, along with proliferation of the fungus, cause large galls to replace the kernels of corn, sucking the energy from the development of the other kernels, decreasing the yield of the corn crop. The fungus can grow inside the plant, spreading to other ears of corn on the same plant as well as to many other parts of the plant. (Agrios, 2005) Results of the hailstorm and corn smut fungus infection analyses on corn development in the field were already published (Pozsgai et al., 2007).</p><p id="Pg195">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 196 Materials and methods To determine the damage a survey was made in 03. September 2007 in Somogyszil (Somogy County) in a 35 ha corn field grown in monoculture. The territory has brown forest soil, with an average 18,6 KA. In the field the hybrid of Monsanto® FAO 330 DK 440 was sown on 16 April 2007. Half of the territory was affected by hailstorm on 19.june 2007. coming from northwest. Sample plots: On the area in question 3 sample plots were selected, 40x10 m each: control (no hailstorm); hail stormed; and transition (partially affected with hailstorm). Sampling: 10-10 cobs were collected per sample plot on 03. September 2007. Another 10 cobs affected with corn smut fungus were also collected. The cobs were shelled resulting samples of 2-2 kg of seed. Analysis of the in-kernel air-dry content values: the Wendei analysis was made according to MSz. (1977, 1978, 1981) for the following parameters: draw matter (MSz 6830/3-77), raw protein (MSz 6830/4-77), raw fat (MSz 6830/6-78), raw fibre (MSz 6830/7-81), raw ash (MSz 6830/8-78), extractable matter exempt from N (calculated), starch (MSZ 6830/6-77). On the basis of the measured values the samples were compared in order to determine the changes. Germination: After surface sterilization (3% hypochloric acid) the uniform sized seeds were soaked in sterile distilled water for 24 hour, and then were germinated for 7 days in Petri dishes between double layers of filter papers moisted with sterile water in the dark thermostat at 25 °C. Samples and detection: 1/ -amylase: Seedlings were removed at daily intervals and were homogenized in 4 cm3 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.7 1mM CaCl2) at 4°C using power-driven potter. The extracts were centrifuged at 3500 g for 20 min. Aliquots of these clear supernatants were used for determination of -amylase activity measured with Phadebas--amylase test. 2/ Sugar content: Seeds were extracted one by one three times under reflux using 10 cm3 boiling water for 15 minutes. Fractions were collected and purified by filtering, dried under reduced pressure at 40 °C and dissolved in distilled water. Amounts of glucose, fructose and sucrose were measured using Boehringer Mannheim GmbH Kits. Eight replicate samples were taken in each measurement. Results and discussion The in-kernel air-dry content values of the different samples are compiled in table 1. The hailstorm caused significant disturbance in the incorporation of nutritive matter. This is aggravated by the wound parasite. It can be confirmed that the corn smut fungus decreased the raw protein (-2.7 %), raw fibre (-0.3%), raw ash (-0.5%), extractable matter exempt from N (-12.9%) and starch (-9.2%) content. It was well observable the decrease of these parameters from the control to hail stormed samples.

These data were correlated with our earlier experiment (Tóth et al., 1993). Changes in fructose content (not shown) were not characteristic. Our results clearly show that corn in the 10-11 leafy stage responds very sensitively on both biotic and abiotic stresses, applied and these effects caused a dose-dependent alteration in the early processes of germination activity. Our results supported the statement, of Nagy (2007) and Hegyi et al. (2007) that environmental variability is one of the highest risk effects on the yield of maize production and a very close correlation is found between the starch metabolism and the thousand kernel mass. Conclusions The effects of hailstorm and the following corn smut fungus infection were clearly observable, causing a decrease of almost all parameters in nutrient content, as well as decreasing -amylase activity and sugar content of the germinating seeds. These decreases were the highest in seeds infected by corn smut fungus. The results are important in the utilisation of corn germs in beer-brewing, distilling industry, as well as in cosmetics industry too (Tömöskei et al., 2000; Szél, 2007).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 199 COMPETITIVE ABILITY OF CORN AND ITS WEEDS ON THE DIFFERRENT PH OF SOIL Jenő POZSGAI–– Ferenc PÁL-FÁM – Sándor KESZTHELYI University of Kaposvár, FAS, Kaposvár, Department of Botany and Plant Production Abstract: In the course of the small plot trials which was appointed on the corn large field we searched for answer, what happened in the competitive ability of the corn, the dicotyledonous (Amaranthus retroflexus, in the following: AMARE) and the monocotyledonous (Setaria viridis, in the following: SETVI) weeds in relation to changes of the soil pH. It was found that the competitive ability of the corn is not depend on the soil pH, but the yield of corn is decreasing by the effect of the competition at all pH levels. From the two weeds the SETVI is less sensible for the decreasing of the soil pH and the competitive ability of it is also less decrease. On the other hand the competitive ability of the AMARE is decreasing with higher volume for the effect of the pH but except for 5.2 pH, it is stronger competitor of the sugarbeet than the SETVI. Keywords: soil pH, competitive ability, corn, Amaranthus retroflexus, Setaria viridis Introduction Soil degradation process are observable (Várallyay, 2006), research of these consequence is important task. Echological research of natural plant assotiations have innumerable results which indicate that also changes of the species-composition of natural assotiation is a consequence, namely the consequence of the soil’s get sour which is happen because of the human effect (Kassai et al., 2006; Tolimir et al., 2006). Also change the competitive ability of the plants, which makes the species composition change too. The competitive ability of certain cultivated and weed plants is not stable, depending of the ecological and agricultural factors it is changes (Pozsgai, 1988). In spite of the fact that lot of articles were published that the soil pH influences changes of the species-composition of the plant assotiation (Radosevich-Holt, 1984), a few author studied the soil pH’s effect which influences the competitive ability (Weaver-Hamill, 1985). Materials and methods We assigned homogen, well-established parcels (100 plants/plots = 4 rows×25 plants) in three different large fields / using the same cultivation / in 3 repetation in three area of the country near to each others ( Röjtökmuzsaj, soil pH is 7.3; Sopronhorpács, soil pH is 6.1; Horvátzsidány, soil pH is 5.2). On the experimental fields the corn hybrid was the same one, with early maturity. When the experimental fields were choose it was a critical aspect that in the previous years during the draw a map of the weeds, AMARE and SETVI were the dominant weeds.The experimental plots were covered during the chemical weed control. From the plots all of the weeds were removed mechanically apart from AMARE and SETVI. In the interest of the trial from 3×1 m in the rows we removed the corn too. Thus the treatments were the follow in the fields with different soil pH: Treatment 1 st : corn free from weeds Treatment 5 th : AMARE Treatment 2 nd : corn+AMARE Treatment 6 th : SETVI Treatment 3 rd : corn+SETVI Treatment 7 th : AMARE+SETVI Treatment 4 th : corn+AMARE+SETVI</p><p id="Pg199">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 200 Density of the weeds everywhere was 5 pc/m2 which is above the critical density After harvesting we measured the corn yield (t/ha) and the aboveground dry weight of the weeds (kg/m2). In the laboratory we quantified the N, P and K content of the weeds (Loch-Nosticzius, 1980) and indicated them in the percentage of the dry weight. The effects of competition and pH were analysis with correspondence analysis with NuCoSA software (Tóthmérész, 1996). Results and discussion The N, P and K-content of the corn’s leaves (percentage of the dry weight) was no changed fundamentally in the different treatments (Table 1.). The N, P and K content of corn was less than the same parameters of the weeds in every treatments. The correspndence analysis shows that the difference is the same on the base of soil pH between the treatment, but the corn+SETVI on 5.2 and 6.1 pH is different from all of the others. In case of AMARE (Table 1.) the N-content of the plant increasing together with pH increasing, especially when AMARE developing without interspecific competition. Changes of the AMARE‘s K-content is reversed, in case of the lowest soil pH the K-content is the highest among the treatments. N, P and K content of SETVI (Table 1.) is higher in case of soil pH 6.1 and 7.3 in every treatment, but in the soil with 5.2 pH these parameters are lower. Table 1.

Buchanan et al. (1975) proved that the wide spectrum of weeds react sensitively to changes of soil pH and supposed to the change of the competitive ability of the weeds in relation to the change of the soil pH. SETVI is less sensible for decrease of the soil pH and it’s competitive ability is less decrease too. The competitive ability of AMARE is decreasing on the soil pH 5.2 but on the 6.1 and 7.3 pH it is stronger competitor than SETVI. Change of the soil pH and N, P and K-content of the plants refers to the soil pH influences indirectly the competitive ability (by change of the accessibility of nutrient). Authors (Schubert et al. 1990, have demonstrated that in most cases reactions of the plant following pH decrease are connected decreasing of the access to calcium and phosphorus. So, our results are consistent with literary attitude, that most of the cultivated plants and weeds react to changes of the soil pH with their metabolism (Teem et al.1994).

Abstract: Soil flux measurements of nitrous oxide and methane have been carried out at a grassland site between August 2006 and July 2007. Eight static chambers and a GC-FID-ECD system have been used for sampling and determination, respectively. Mean soil emission of nitrous oxide is 0.15 kg N ha -1 yr -1 that is 4–5 times lower than measured in an earlier period (2002-2004). Methane flux is negligible due to the unfavourable soil parameters. Measured methane fluxes were below the detection limit in most of the cases. These phenomena have been the consequences of the unusual weather conditions (extremely low precipitation), which influenced not only the nutrient uptake by plant but also the microbial processing responsible for soil fluxes of trace gases. Keywords: Nitrous oxide, methane, soil flux, grassland Introduction Eleven per cent of the total territory of Hungary is grassland and more than 200,000 hectares of extensive grasslands are nature reserve (Szentes et al., 2007). This kind of ecotype was most widely studied by many aspects e.g. carbon cycle (Hidy et al., 2007), and measurement of soil flux of CO2 (Nagy et al., 2005), as carbon dioxide is the most important component in the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, responsible for climate change. Beside carbon dioxide nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) play also important role in the growing greenhouse effect. Though atmospheric concentrations of N2O and CH4 are much lower than that of CO2, global warming potential of N2O and CH4 is approximately 300 and 25 times higher, respectively, compared to the CO2 (IPCC, 2001). In the soil, the production of nitrous oxide and methane are controlled by natural processes in each ecosystem. Principally, two mechanisms are responsible for N2O production in soils: namely the nitrification (as an aerobic process) and dominantly the denitrification (in anaerobic condition). Methane is produced by decomposition of organics by bacteria under anaerobic conditions. Soils may also act as a sink for methane in aerated soil where methane can be oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria. These microbes are often residing in a relationship with many native plants. It is well known that N-forms can be deposited from the atmosphere (through wet and dry deposition) into soils and onto plant surface and may have a series of impacts on the soil-plant interrelation (Németh, 2006) (e.g. unnatural growth rates, nutrient imbalances). Owing to the soil processes a part of deposited N-compounds are converted in soils into nitrous oxide, which contributes both to the greenhouse effect and to the stratospheric ozone depletion. The net N2O and CH4 exchange fluxes between soil and the atmosphere are controlled by the balance of concurrent production and consumption mechanisms within the soil.</p><p id="Pg203">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 204 Our aim was to estimate the net fluxes of these greenhouse gases above a semi natural grassland. Materials and methods Bugac puszta experimental site is a semi natural semi arid sandy grassland in Kiskunság National Park (46°41´ N 19°36´ E). Dominant plant species are Festuca pseudovina, Carex stenophylla and Salvia pratensis. The plant association is sensitive to disturbances but Hungarian Grey Cattle (0.5-0.8 cattle ha-1 in the period of investigations) have been grazing for centuries in equilibrium with the grass ecosystem. Soil N2O and CH4 flux measurements were carried out weekly by 8 parallel static soil chambers. Samples were taken at t=0 and 30 min. after closure of chambers. Concentration changes in 30 min were determined by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and flame ionisation detector (GC-FID), for nitrous oxide and methane, respectively. Fluxes were calculated by: F = b* hch *M * a /Vm formula, where F: is the flux [μg/m2/h] b: is the slope of change in concentration [ppb/min], hch: is the height of static chamber [m], M: is the molecular weight of the given component [g/mol], a: is a constant = 6*10-2, Vm: is the corrected standard gaseous molar volume Vm= 22.4*10 -3*((273.15+t)/ 273.15) *(1013/p) [m3/mol], where t is the air temperature [ ◦ C] and p is the air pressure [mbar].

The average measured N2O flux is 0.2 kg N ha -1 yr-1 from August– December 2006, and 0.1 kg N ha-1 yr-1 from January–July 2007. The N2O flux is approximately 4 times lower than it was measured in 2002-2004 (in the EU5th GreenGrass project (Flechard et al., 2007) caused probably by the unusually low precipitation (e.g. 130 mm in the 2nd half of 2006) and for dry soil in the examined period. As we expected, there was no N2O flux peak in spring, as usual after thawing, caused by the mild weather during the winter. In an average winter the soil surface is generally frozen for the cold period and the produced trace gases are stored in the lower layer of soil. For this reason the first thawing event results in high emission peaks of each trace gases. Measured methane fluxes were frequently below the detection limit (7.5 μg C m-2 h-1). Mean CH4 flux (1.8 μg C m -2 h-1) is also within the detection limit of the sampling and measurement. Figure.2. Measured methane soil fluxes (weekly samplings) (Dashed lines show the detection limit of flux measurement) Dry and hot weather and extremely dry soil in the examined period do not favour both the catalytic surface decomposition and anaerobic formation (emission) of methane. Conclusions Both N2O and CH4 emissions are strongly controlled by soil organic carbon (SOC), mineral N, soil temperature and soil moisture. The studied semi natural grassland received unusually low precipitation during the study period (2nd part of 2006 and 1st half of 2007). For this reason wet N deposition was lower (3.2 kg N ha-1) than measured during regular years (4.7 kg N ha-1, Horváth et al., 2005). Hence less amount of atmospheric N reached the soil that limits the mineral N in converting to gases through denitrification and nitrification processes. The sandy soil was extremely dry, the average water-filled pore space (WFPS) was about 20 %. In the dry soil the denitrification process was limited (nitrous oxide production and following emission have a maximum rate at WFPS range of 50-70%) (Davidson, 1991).

The CH4 emission is negligible due to the unfavourable soil conditions for the anaerobic microbial communities. The methane consumption in the mineral layer is negligible resulting in methane fluxes below the detection limit. It has to be mentioned that temporal and spatial variations carry a source of uncertainty in estimation N2O and CH4 fluxes above grassland field in annual scale. Further flux measurements for multi year dataset and ecological modelling are necessary to explain better the atmosphere–soil–plant exchange processes of components.

Abstract: The effect of five N top-dressing rates (0, 50, 100, 100+50, 100+100 kg ha–1) on the yield and grain protein content of winter wheat was examined in wet and dry years on loam and clay soils. Rainfall deficiency in the winter months (Dec.–Feb.) led to a lower soil NO3-N content in late winter. The total quantity of soil nitrate-N and mineral fertiliser N was more closely correlated with the yield in the wet year on both loam and clay soils. In the wet year the reduction in the protein content could be counteracted by lower N doses on clay soils than on loam soils, which had poorer water retention. Keywords: N top-dressing, Nmin, winter wheat, yield, protein % Introduction Long-term experiments designed to demonstrate the effect of agronomic factors on the yield make it clear that nutrient supplies have a decisive influence on the predictability of the yield and in moderating the fluctuations caused by year effects. The determination of nutrient requirements is complicated, however, by a number of factors, including the fact that the optimum supply level required for high yields is generally different from that required for high quality (Izsáki, 2006). In wheat production higher nutrient rates are often required to achieve high quality than are needed for high yields (Pepó, 2007). The presence and availability of N in the soil during the first half of wheat development has a decisive influence on the development of the generative organs and thus on the grain yield. During the heading and ripening period optimum N supplies primarily serve to improve the quality and have been proved to have a significant effect on thousandkernel mass, wet gluten content and on various gluten quality parameters (Ragasits, 1992; Varga et al., 2007). The more accurate determination of the active agent quantities required to achieve various quality categories and the incorporation of this information into sustainable fertilisation recommendations continues to be a major task facing wheat scientists (Csathó et al., 2007). Among the methods available for determining N top-dressing rates, estimation based on the mineral N (Nmin) content of the soil became the most widespread method in Hungary in the 1990s (Németh, 1990). Among the various forms of mineral N, the importance of NO3-N was stressed by Németh (2006), while Hoffmann (1988) and Balázs (1993) reported that both NH4-N and NO3-N should be given equal consideration. Materials and methods Top-dressing experiments on winter wheat were set up on soils with loam (Balatonkenese, Egyházashetye) and clay (Jászboldogháza, Törökszentmiklós) texture in years in which the winter was wetter (2006) and drier (2007) than the many years’ mean (Table 1). The effect of five rates of N active agent (0, 50, 100, 100+50, 100+100</p><p id="Pg207">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 208 kg ha–1) was measured on 0.5 ha plots. The first treatments were applied in late winter, at the beginning of tillering, while the second portion of the split rates (Treatments 4 and 5) was applied prior to heading. Before the first top-dressing the NH4-N, NO3-N, AL-soluble P and K contents were analysed at two soil depths (0–30, 30–60 cm) on bulk samples taken from 15 points in each plot. The correlation between the combined mineral N and fertiliser N quantity and the yield was described by fitting a quadratic polynomial curve, while that between N and the protein content was described with a linear function.

In the dry year of 2007 the correlation was only significant on the clay soils (B), which had better water retention. On these heavy soils above-average rainfall did not give higher yields than in the dry year even in the case of intensive N fertilisation. The steepness of the curves illustrates the relationship between water supplies and the specific efficiency of fertilisation. During the rising section of the functions this means that in the wet year there was a greater yield surplus per unit active agent. Figure 1. Relationship between N nutrition and grain yield in top-dressing experiments on winter wheat. A – loam soil, B – clay soil Figure 2. Relationship between N nutrition and protein content in top-dressing experiments on winter wheat A – loam soil, B – clay soil In these experiments, set up using the same genotypes, a moderately close correlation significant at the P=5% level of probability was detected between the N quantity and the wheat protein content on the given soils in both years (Fig. 2). The year effect is demonstrated by the fact that the protein content was higher in the dry year on both loam and clay soils. The quantity of N required to achieve a protein content of 12.5% was calculated to be 191 kg ha–1 in the wet year and 0 kg ha–1 in 2007 on loam soils, while these figures were 157 and 24 kg ha–1 on clay, indicating that lower quantities of N active agents were required to overcome the quality deterioration caused by year effects on heavier clay soils. y2006 = -0,0276x 2 + 25,653x + 1067,1 R 2 = 0,5527* (n=10) y2007 = -0,0116x 2 + 8,2733x + 3249,4 R 2 = 0,1461 ns (n=10) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Soil (0-60 cm) nitrate-N + top-dressing N (kg ha -1 ) Y ie ld k g h a-1 2006 2007 A y2006 = -0,1574x 2 + 89,114x - 7355,2 R 2 = 0,8713** (n=9) y2007 = -0,0103x 2 + 14,287x + 2277,4 R 2 = 0,7602** (n=10) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Soil (0-60 cm) nitrate-N + top-dressing N (kg ha -1 ) Y ie ld k g h a-1 2006 2007 B y2007 = 0,0111x + 13,124 R 2 = 0,4146* (n=10) y2006 = 0,0086x + 10,859 R 2 = 0,4988* (n=10) 0 5 10 15 20 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Soil (0-60 cm) nitrate-N + top-dressing N (kg ha -1 ) P ro te in % 2006 2007 A y2007 = 0,0112x + 12,937 R 2 = 0,5154* (n=10) y2006 = 0,0176x + 9,7529 R 2 = 0,4720* (n=9) 0 5 10 15 20 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Soil (0-60 cm) nitrate-N + top-dressing N (kg ha -1 ) P ro te in % 2006 2007 B</p><p id="Pg209">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 210 Conclusions In agreement with the data reported by Németh (1996) in model incubation experiments, the results of field experiments set up on diverse types of soil confirmed that the soil moisture content, combined with other environmental conditions, exerted an effect on the rate of mineralisation, the extent of nitrification and thus on the mineral N content of the soil. The analysis of yield responses in terms of the quantity of mineralised N measured before the intensive spring development stage of wheat, combined with the N active agents applied to the stand, clearly proved the reliability of the Nmin method in wet years. Irrespective of the year, however, the quality response of wheat exhibited a significant, moderately close correlation with the N supplies.

HYBRIDS Zoltán BERZSENYI – Quoc Lap DANG Crop Production Department, Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 2462 Martonvásár, e-mail: berzseny@mail.mgki.hu Abstract: The classical method of growth analysis was used to examine the effect of N fertilisation on the growth dynamics and growth parameters (RGR, NAR, LAR, LWR, SLA, RLGR, LAD and BMD) of maize hybrids. The grain yield was found to be correlated with RGR and its components. Keywords: maize, N fertilisation, plant growth analysis, RGR, NAR, LAR Introduction There is a strong relationship between relative growth rate (RGR) and plant productivity. A major cause of differences in growth rate is the variation in nitrogen (N) availability (Nagy, 2007). Plant growth analysis can be used to analyse the causes of variation in growth rate. Classical growth analysis factorises RGR into leaf area ratio (LAR) and net assimilation rate (NAR). LAR can be further divided into leaf mass ratio (LWR) and specific leaf area (SLA) as follows: RGR = NAR · LAR = NAR · SLA · LWR. The NAR and LAR parameters contribute to a different extent to the RGR, depending on the genotype and the environmental conditions. The aim of the research was (i) to use growth analysis to study the effect of N fertilisation on the growth and growth parameters of maize hybrids and (ii) to reveal correlations between RGR (and its components) and the grain yield. Materials and methods The effect of N fertilisation on the growth and growth parameters of maize hybrids was studied in a long-term experiment set up on chernozem soil with forest residues in the institute nursery by Győrffy in 1961. The main plot in the split-plot design, set up in four replications, was the N treatment, with the maize hybrid in the subplots. The N fertiliser rates were as follows: 0, 80, 160, 240 kg ha–1 (denoted by N0, N80, N160, N240). The P and K fertiliser rates were the same in all the treatments (160 kg ha–1). The investigations were made in 2001 and 2002 on three maize hybrids with different vegetation periods: Mv 272 (FAO 280), Mv 355 (FAO 390) and Maraton (FAO 450). The rainfall quantity on the experimental area during the vegetation period (Apr.–Sept.) was as follows: 2001: 296 mm, 2002: 326 mm. The rainfall distribution was more favourable in 2001. Plant samples for growth analysis were taken from the 35th–38th day after sowing (in the 4–5-leaf stage) until physiological maturity. In both years the samples were taken on a total of eight occasions at 13–15-day intervals. The leaf area was determined using a laboratory leaf area meter of the Delta-T type. The effect of N fertilisation on the growth of maize plants was characterised using the RGR parameter and its components (NAR, LAR, LWR, SLA), the relative growth rate of the leaf area (RLGR) and the duration of leaf area and biomass (LAD and BMD) (Berzsenyi, 2000). The growth parameters were calculating using the growth analysis program of Hunt et</p><p id="Pg211">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 212 al. (2002), which also carries out statistical analysis. Correlations between the growth parameters and the grain yield were evaluated using correlation analysis. Results and discussion The effect of N fertilisation on the dynamics of dry matter accumulation in the whole maize plant and in the grain yield, and on the seasonal dynamics of the leaf area is illustrated in Figure 1. It is clear that the maximum value of biomass production was highest in the N160 and N240 treatments and lowest in the N0 treatment. In all three hybrids the biomass production of the N0 treatment differed significantly from that of the other treatments over most of the growth period. A similar tendency was observed for the dynamics of dry matter accumulation in the grain yield in the various N treatments. The total dry matter production and grain yield were greater in 2001, which had favourable rainfall distribution, than in 2002. The biomass production was well expressed by the BMD parameter, the cumulated value of which (103 g day) was 13.6 in 2001 and 10.8 in 2002. The grain yield was 8.41 t ha–1 in 2001 and 6.38 t ha–1 in 2002, averaged over N treatments and hybrids. Hybrids with longer vegetation periods had higher BMD values (Mv 272: 10.67, Mv 355: 13.93, Maraton: 12.06 103 g day) and higher grain yield (Mv 272: 6.95, Mv 355: 7.93, Maraton: 7.97 t ha–1). The following cumulated BMD values (103 g day) were recorded in the various treatments: N0: 8.99, N80: 12.25, N160: 14.23, N240: 13.41. Averaged over hybrids and years the maize grain yield increased significantly up to an N rate of 160 kg ha–1, with the following values (t ha–1) in the individual treatments: N0: 4.91c, N80: 7.87b, N160: 8.91a, N240: 8.77a. Table 1 contains the mean values of the RGR, NAR and LAR parameters in 2001 for each N treatment and hybrid during the vegetative and generative growth phases. There was a tendency for the RGR and NAR values to rise with improvements in the N supply, while that of LAR declined. It is also clear that these parameters indicate greater growth during the vegetative period, when the mean values of RGR and NAR were highest in the N80 treatment. By contrast, the value of LAR gradually dropped. In the generative phase the RGR and NAR values, characteristic of grain yield development, consistently increased in response to N fertilisation, while that of LAR exhibited a slight decrease. The increase in the leaf area per plant and its decrease after flowering were characterised by the relative growth rate (RLGR) and expressed as a percentage. The mean daily values of RLGR (%) during the growth phase in the various N treatments were as follows: N0: 3.5, N80: 3.9, N160: 3.8, N240: 3.7, while the daily % reduction in RLGR during leaf withering amounted to: N0: –4.6, N80: –4.2, N160: –2.8, N240: –3.3. N fertilisation could be seen to promote an increase in the RLGR during the vegetative phase, while after flowering it reduced the withering of the leaf area. The size and duration of the leaf area were described well by the cumulated LAD values, which did not differ significantly in 2001 and 2002. In both years hybrids with longer vegetation periods had higher LAD values (m2 day): Mv 272: 28.5, Mv 355: 32.2, Maraton: 37.6. The cumulated LAD values in the various N treatments were as follows (m2 day): N0: 23.8, N80: 32.8, N160: 37.5, N240: 36.9. The values of both BMD and LAD increased up to the N160 level, after which there was no further significant change.</p><p id="Pg212">VII.

The mean and cumulated values of growth parameters can be used to describe the effects of agronomic treatments over the whole of the growth period.

Abstract: The tolerance of three Martonvásár maize hybrids to herbicides applied post-emergence was tested in 2006 and 2007. In treatments given twice the normal dose, visible phytotoxic damage did not exceed 20% in 2006, while it was less than 15% in 2007. The herbicide treatments caused changes in the protein and starch content but had no modifying effect on the oil content. Extreme weather conditions aggravated the effect on quality. Keywords: maize, quality, herbicide tolerance, post-emergence Introduction The rapid decline in reserves of fossil fuels and the increasingly obvious signs of global warming have focussed attention on the use of renewable energy sources. Technologies are already available for using raw materials originating from agriculture, such as rapeseed oil, sugar beet, potato and maize, as sources of bioenergy. Thanks to its high starch content, maize is ideal for the manufacture of bioethanol, which is being increasingly used as an energy source throughout the world. As it is renewable, it could be used to partially replace petroleum-based fuels. The starch, protein, oil and crude fibre contents of maize kernels are influenced not only by the genotype, but by numerous environmental factors. The location, the plant density and the rate of mineral fertilisation all affect these quality parameters (Hegyi et al., 2001, 2006; Izsáki, 2006; Svečnjak et al., 2007). Breeding aimed at improving the protein content has resulted in improved maize germplasm known as quality protein maize (QPM), but this is more sensitive to environmental effects (insect pests, fungal and bacterial diseases, herbicides) than conventional lines (Aguado-Santacruz et al., 2007). The effect of pesticide treatments on the grain yield quality of cereals has been reported by many authors (Jolánkai et al., 2006; Szentpétery et al., 2005). The relationship between herbicides and grain quality has been studied to a lesser extent in conventional maize. The present paper discusses the results of quality analysis and grain yield measurements on samples from herbicide tolerance experiments set up in Martonvásár. Materials and methods Investigations were made in 2006 and 2007 on the tolerance of three maize hybrids grown on chernozem soil (Calciustoll) in Martonvásár to herbicides applied postemergence. In both years the rainfall supplies were below normal for the location, being 66 mm less than the 30-year mean in 2006 and 47 mm less in 2007. In the first year the rainfall deficiency was recorded during maize flowering and in the autumn and winter months, while in 2007 it occurred at the beginning of the year and during the early part of the vegetation period. Summer rainfall quickly evaporated due to maximum daily temperatures of nearly 40°C, causing the plants to dry up. The experiment was set up in</p><p id="Pg215">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 216 a two-factor split-plot design with two replications, with an untreated control plot for each treatment. The active agents in these herbicides were as follows: mesotrione, mesotrione + terbutilazine, tembotrione, foramszulfuron + isoxadifen ethyl + iodosulfuron-methyl Na, foramszulfuron + isoxadifen ethyl, rimsulfuron. The treatments are presented in Table 1. The herbicides were applied post-emergence, in the 6–7-leaf stage of 3 Martonvásár maize hybrids (Tisza – FAO 470, Mv 500 – FAO 510, Mv Koppány – FAO 420) using the maximum dose permitted in the licence and double this dose. During the course of the vegetation period, visible phytotoxic damage was scored 22 (in 2006) and 17 (in 2007) days after the treatment using a 0–100 scale on which 0 indicated undamaged and 100 killed plants. The phytotoxicity percentage combines the number of killed plants and the extent of leaf damage due to scorching in a single parameter. The grain yield was recorded at harvest and a near infrared (NIR) spectroscope was used to determine the protein, starch and oil contents of the samples. Table 1.

The normal rates applied in crop production did not cause more than 15% damage in either year, while the damage caused by the double rates was also less than 25%. In 2006 Treatment 6 (rimsulfuron) was responsible for the most severe symptoms, amounting to 11.7% for the single dose and 15.8% for the double dose, but these symptoms became masked as the growing season progressed.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 217 In 2007 no phytotoxic damage was observed on the hybrids in this treatment. The reason for the discrepancy between the two years was probably the heat shock induced by 14 days with maximum temperatures in excess of 30°C following spraying in 2006, which prevented the hybrids from neutralising the rimsulfuron active agent. In 2007 the temperature during the period following spraying was around 25°C, thus allowing the herbicide to be decomposed. The results of quality analysis are presented in Figures 2 and 3. Both diagrams demonstrate the effect of the herbicide treatments as the difference between the values recorded for samples from control and treated plots. The horizontal axis represents the control value and the columns the deviations from this value. The grain protein content (Fig. 2) was not significantly modified by any of the treatments in 2006. During the extremely hot summer of 2007 the double doses of Treatments 1, 2 and 3 tended to reduce the protein content of the hybrids, but the differences were not significant. Both rates of Treatment 5 (foramsulfuron + isoxadifen ethyl) caused a significant reduction in the protein content, while Treatments 4 (foramsulfuron + isoxadifen ethyl + iodosulfuron-methyl Na) and 6 (rimsulfuron) resulted in a slight increase in the protein content. The starch content exhibited substantial changes as a function of year and treatment. In 2006 the single rate of Treatment 1 (mesotrione), both rates of Treatment 5 (foramsulfuron + isoxadifen ethyl) and the double rate of Treatment 6 (rimsulfuron) led to a significant rise in the starch content. In 2007 the fluctuations in starch content were considerably smaller than in the previous year. Both rates of Treatment 5 caused a significant increase in the starch content. The oil content of the grain was not influenced by either the normal or double rates of the herbicides. The treatments caused no changes in either year, though a year effect could be observed. The average oil content of the kernels was 0.12% higher in 2006 than in 2007. The grain yield was harvested at the end of the vegetation period, but the yield data could not be evaluated from the agronomic point of view in either year due to the drought. Figure 2.

Various active agents may induce positive and negative effects in maize quality parameters. These changes may be aggravated by extreme weather conditions. References Aguado-Santacruz, G.

Among the environmental factors, the growth and yield responses of three diverse genotypes to the nutrient supply level were investigated. In 2007 the dry matter production of winter wheat was found to depend primarily on the N supplies, with similar responses being given by all the varieties. Differences were observed, however, between the reproductive (spike) mass and the leaf area index (LAI) as a function of both N supplies and variety. Under the given experimental conditions the early maturing variety Mv Palotás had the most favourable fertiliser response. With rising N rates there was an increase in LAI and dry mass, while the reproductive yield (dry spike mass, grain mass per square metre) was highest at the 160 kg ha –1 N level. Key words: genotype, N nutrient supplies, dry matter accumulation, leaf area index (LAI) growth analysis. Introduction Although the fertiliser response and the maximum yield are both genetically determined characters (Balogh et al., 2007), they may be influenced to a considerable effect by environmental and agronomic conditions. The yield of winter wheat depends both directly and indirectly on numerous growth parameters, which in turn are fundamentally determined by the environment and the genetic background of the varieties. One of the most important environmental factors for winter wheat production is the nutrient supply. Pepó (2005) demonstrated that dry matter production and LAI were chiefly responsible for the yield of the genotypes examined, and found a strong correlation between crop fertilisation and LAI in winter wheat. A close correlation between the yield and the leaf area were also demonstrated in winter wheat by Lönhard et al. (1988). The size of LAI was also influenced by the biological traits of the varieties (Petr et al., 1985). Materials and methods Experiments involving growth analysis and growth dynamics studies were carried out on a winter wheat stand grown on chernozem soil with brown forest residues in Martonvásár during the unusually mild winter of 2006/2007. In the two-factor longterm experiment the effect of fertilisation and genotype on the dynamics of dry matter accumulation and leaf area and on the spike number and grain mass per square metre was studied in a crop rotation where winter wheat was grown after pea. In the split-plot design the N treatments (0, 80, 160, 240 kg ha–1) were in the main plot and the variety (Mv Toborzó – extra early, Mv Palotás – early, Mv Verbunkos – medium early) in the subplot. Samples of three plants per plot were taken at weekly intervals. Leaf area was measured with LI-3100 and AM300 Area Meters. The data were statistically evaluated using the MSTAT-C program and growth parameters were calculated (Berzsenyi, 2000).</p><p id="Pg219">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 220 Results and discussion Spring development began extremely early in the extremely mild winter of 2006/2007, but differences were observed in the time course of growth and phenological phases for varieties with different growing periods. The dry matter production and leaf area index (LAI) were determined primarily by the genotype (Fig. 1) and significant differences could be observed at all the sampling dates (P=0.1%). The significant effect of mineral fertilisation on the two parameters of growth dynamics was also perceptible throughout the experiment for all three varieties, though the level of significance varied in the course of the growing season (P=0.1–5%).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 221 The dry matter accumulation and its dynamics over time differed with the fertilisation level. At all the N fertilisation levels the dry matter content reached its maximum value earliest (May 22nd) in the extra early variety Mv Toborzó, after which it declined until harvest due to grain shedding. In the early variety Mv Palotás the maximum dry matter accumulation was recorded at different dates for the different fertilisation levels (May 29th–June 19th). On the control plots and on those given excessive (240 kg ha–1) N supplies the dry matter production exhibited a slight decrease prior to harvest. Plots treated with 80 kg ha–1 N fertiliser exhibited maximum dry matter content in early June and no substantial decrease was observed up to harvest. The most favourable treatment proved to be the 160 kg ha–1 N level, where the greatest dry matter production was recorded at harvest. In the case of the medium early variety Mv Verbunkos the date of maximum dry matter production again differed with the N level. This variety continued to respond to additional N supplies up to the 240 kg ha–1 level, but the 160 kg ha–1 rate was the most favourable for the grain yield. Here, too, the untreated plots exhibited losses by harvest. There were no substantial differences between the three genotypes in the maximum value of dry matter production per square metre, but the ratio of productive to reproductive dry matter varied for the three varieties. Mv Palotás had the greatest grain mass per m2 (780 g), followed by Mv Verbunkos (723 g), while that of Mv Toborzó was far smaller (594 g) (Fig. 2). All three varieties produced the maximum values at the 160 kg ha–1 N level. The grain mass per m2 differed significantly at all four N levels, the values recorded for Mv Palotás and Mv Verbunkos considerably exceeding that of Mv Toborzó. Due to the exceptional weather conditions the LAI values reached their maximum values 2–3 weeks before flowering, as the withering of the lower leaves began very early. Differences between the values of LAImax were observed for both the genotypes and the N levels. (Table 1). There was no significant difference between the 160 and 240 kg ha– 1 levels, but both were far higher than the values recorded in the control and 80 kg ha–1 plots. Mv Verbunkos exhibited lower values than Mv Toborzó and Mv Palotás. The growth parameters biomass duration (BMD) and leaf area duration (LAD) were determined for the sampled plants. The cumulative values of these parameters increased with a rise in the N rate and also differed between the varieties (Table 1).

All three varieties exhibited similar dynamics and the maximum values did not differ significantly at the same nutrient levels. Considerable differences were observed between the varieties in the case of LAI and reproductive parameters (dry spike mass). The growth parameters having the greatest influence on yield (dry matter production, LAI) were most favourable at the 160 kg ha–1 N fertiliser level, while only a much smaller increase was caused by the 240 kg ha–1 rate. This excessive rate led to losses in dry matter (Mv Palotás), spike mass (Mv Palotás and Mv Verbunkos) and grain mass (all three varieties) compared with the 160 kg ha–1 rate. Reproductive growth (dry spike mass) was fundamentally determined by the genotype. From this point of view Mv Palotás gave the best fertiliser response to the 160 kg ha–1 N supply level, which was optimum for all three varieties.

Strossmayer University of Osijek Abstract: Nematode communities were used as bioindicators of changes in agroecosystems caused by anthropogenic factors. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of chemical disturbances on nematode communities in the soil in winter wheat fields. The sampling was done three times, before disturbances, after fertilization and third time was after insecticides applications. Number of genera significantly decreased after disturbances caused by chemical application, while total number of nematodes did not change significantly in numbers. Maturity index (MI) showed significant differences between first and last sampling, as well as PPI/MI. Plant parasitic index (PPI) did not differ significantly between sampling periods. Keywords: nematode community in the soil, bioindicators Introduction In numerous studies, nematode communities showed possibilities to be good indicators of different kind of disturbances in ecosystems. Some groups of nematodes can survive under disturbed environmental conditions such as global climate change which also in the last decades influenced the water regimes of soil, which is crucial for a nematode survival (Mikulec &amp; Stehlova, 2006, Vago et al., 2006). There are differences in feeding behavior (Yeats et al., 1993), and predominantly, omnivore and predators have great sensitivity to disturbances. Nematodes can be classified upon many different criteria, but the development of Maturity index (MI) (Bongers, 1990) presents a significantly advanced tool for predicting ecological processes in soil ecosystems what is very important, since the soil health is the most important national resource (Várallyay, 2006). Above that, they play a great role in soil nutrition cycle, especially free-living nematodes. For those reasons nematode communities have potential to serve as very good biotic indicators of soil processes (Sohlenius &amp; Wasilewska, 1984). Structure of nematode communities can reflect differences in agroecosystem conditions (Ivezic et al., 2000; Brmez, 2007), organic adding (Goede, 1993), heavy metal compounds (Korthals, 1997), soil tillage system (Freckman &amp; Ettema, 1993), air pollution (Zullini &amp; Peretti, 1986) river pollution (Zullini, 1976), and different kind of environmental monitoring (Bongers &amp; Ferris, 1999). The objective of this investigation was to determine if the nematode communities in the soil could serve as bioindicators of chemical inputs into the soil. Materials and methods Research was conducted in 2001, in Kneževo, Baranya County, Croatia (45o32”N, 18o44”E). The nematode communities in the soil were investigated in winter wheat field which was sampled three times, before and after disturbances caused by chemical input into the soil. Each sampling was done in four replications. 1. Sampling was done on 12 of March 2001, before any chemical disturbances in soil. 2. Sampling was done on 24 of April 2001, after KAN application (KAN was applied on 6 of April, 2001 in dosages of 100 kg ha-1).</p><p id="Pg223">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 224 3. Sampling was done on 17 of May 2001, after KAN and herbicide Sansac application (against Oulema melanopus L). Herbicides were applied in recommended dosage of 1 l ha-1. The soil type was caltic chernozem, with the following characteristic: pH(H2O) = 8.6; pH(KCl) = 7.53; Al(P2O5) = 18.7mg/100 g of soil; Al(K2O) = 28.42 mg/100 g of soil; CaCO3= 2.12 and an organic content of 2.61%. The arable treatments had been in place for at least 50 years before nematode sampling began, and all received similar fertilizers applications. Standard tillage regimes included deep plowing on 30 cm and harrowing. Sampling was done using a corer Ø 2 cm, to a depth of 20 cm. Nematodes were extracted from 100 g subsamples of soil by the Seinhorst method (Seinhorst, 1956), at the Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek, in Laboratory of Entomology and Nematology. Identification was done according to Bongers (1994), Mai &amp; Lyon (1975) and Andrassy (1984). Total number of nematodes and number of genera were determined and compared between sampling periods, as well as Maturity index (MI), Plant parasitic index (PPI) and PPI/MI (Bongers, 1990). Trophic structure was determined according to Yeates et al. 1993. The data were analyzed statistically, using ANOVA and LSD test on computer program Statistica by Vukadinović (Vukadinović, 1985) Results and discussion Nematode communities in the soil showed statistically significant differences between numbers of genera occurred in each sampling period, while total number of nematode did not differ significantly between treatments (Table 1.).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 227 COMPARATIVE STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF FARMYARD MANURE AND MINERAL FERTILISER ON THE GROWTH PARAMETERS OF MAIZE IN DIFFERENT YEARS Györgyi MICSKEI – Nóra TAKÁCS – Quoc Lap DANG – Zoltán BERZSENYI Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences H-2462 Martonvásár, P.O. Box 19, Hungary, micskei@mail.mgki.hu Abstract: The effect of farmyard manure and mineral fertiliser on the dynamics of dry matter production and leaf area index was studied for three years (2005–2007) in a long-term continuous maize experiment set up on the active agent equivalence principle. The most favourable dry matter production and leaf area index dynamics were recorded for high rates of NPK fertiliser in wet years and for farmyard manure in dry years. Keywords: maize, long-term experiment, dry matter accumulation, leaf area index, growth analysis Introduction The long-term experiment on continuous maize was set up in 1958 with various nutrient levels, provided as farmyard manure (FYM), FYM+mineral fertiliser (NPK) or NPK on the active agent equivalence principle. The original aim of the experiment was to determine whether the NPK nutrients in FYM could be replaced partially or entirely by inorganic NPK fertiliser (Berzsenyi and Lap, 2004). Good nitrogen supplies promote a rapid initial growth in the leaf area index of maize, allowing optimum LAI values to be maintained with good biomass duration. This is favourable for the flow of assimilates into the grain (Berzsenyi et al., 2007). The aim of the experiment was to use the data from a long-term fertilisation experiment set up on the active agent equivalence principle to determine the extent to which various levels of FYM and NPK influenced the yield of maize grown in a monoculture in different years. Materials and methods The long-term experiment was set up in a Latin square design on eroded chernozem soil with forest residues in Martonvásár. The treatments were as follows: 1. Control; 2. 35 t ha–1 FYM; 3. 17.5 t ha–1 FYM + N½P½K½; 4. N1P1K1; 5. 70 t ha –1 FYM; 6. 35 t ha–1 FYM + N1P1K1; 7. N2P2K2. The total quantities of active agents (kg ha –1) applied each year were N: 66, P2O5: 38, K2O: 75 in Treatments 2–4 and N: 132, P2O5: 76, K2O: 150 in Treatments 5–7. Of the three experimental years the weather in 2005 was very favourable for maize as regards both rainfall and temperature. In 2006 only half the normal quantity of rainfall was received during the sowing period, leading to yield losses, while 2007 was an extremely hot year with 58 heat days and uneven distribution of precipitation, resulting in poor fertilisation and severe yield losses. The total rainfall quantities during the vegetation period (Apr.–Sept.) were 525 mm in 2005, 246 mm in 2006 and 315 mm in 2007. The destructive (direct) and indirect methods of growth analysis were applied from the 3-4-leaf growth stage until physiological maturity. The destructive analyses involved measurements on the wet and dry mass of the plant organs, the leaf number and the leaf area, while the indirect method was used to record the area and chlorophyll content of the leaf next to the ear and the leaf area of the stand. Indirect methods are often more useful in that they involve negligible sampling errors (Berzsenyi, 2000). From the agronomic point of view dry matter accumulation is of the greatest importance, so this</p><p id="Pg227">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 228 is generally used as an indicator of growth dynamics. The biometrical evaluation of the data was performed according to Sváb (1973) and the data were processed using the MSTAT-C program. Results and discussion Yield data. In all three years the yield was significantly the lowest in the control treatment. Similar tendencies were observed in 2005 and 2006, with the significantly highest yields (9.8 and 7.9 t ha–1) in Treatment 7, where the whole of the 70 t ha–1 FYM was replaced by NPK, while in 2007 the highest yield (3.4 t ha–1) was obtained in Treatment 5, when 70 t ha–1 FYM was applied, indicating the positive effect of FYM in dry years. In 2007 the yield achieved with high rates of mineral fertiliser (2.4 t ha–1) did not differ significantly from the control. In the first two years the effect of FYM+NPK (Treatments 3 and 6) on the yield was significantly better than that of FYM (Treatments 2 and 5), but could not compete with that of NPK alone (Treatments 4 and 7). In 2007 the experimental treatments had little or no measurable effect on the yield, demonstrating the yield-limiting effect of severe rainfall deficiency. The effect of the treatments on the maize yield between 2005 and 2007 can be seen in Table 1. Table 1.

The dynamics of dry matter incorporation could be described with a sigmoid curve, the course of which was similar in 2005 and 2006, but differed greatly in 2007 (Fig. 1). The effects of the various treatments were quite distinct in 2005 and 2006, allowing three groups to be distinguished. The greatest dry matter production (278–289 g day–1) was achieved in Treatments 6 and 7 and the lowest (149–192 g day–1) in the control and after the application of 35 t ha–1 FYM, while intermediate values were obtained for Treatments 3–5. In 2007 no further dry matter incorporation was recorded after the 8th sampling date in Treatments 1, 2 and 6, while accumulation continued in Treatments 3, 4, 5 and 7. In 2005 and 2006 the lowest growth rate and duration were exhibited by the control and the highest by the high rates of NPK, while in 2007 the high rate of FYM gave the best results. A long period of linear growth was observed in 2005 and 2006, while due to the high mean temperature the growth curve reached its maximum value within a short time in 2007. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the treatments in all three years.</p><p id="Pg228">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 229 Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 230 between the LAI values of the treatments were smaller and four groups could be distinguished: Treatment 1 (control) gave the lowest values, followed by Treatments 2 and 5, while Treatments 3, 4 and 6 formed the third group, and Treatment 7 had the significantly highest LAI values. In 2005 the LAI values remained constant in all the treatments between sampling dates 4 and 7, ensuring ideal conditions for yield formation. In 2006 the LAImax values were only maintained for two weeks in the control and the FYM treatments (2 and 5), while in the other treatments this period was six weeks. In 2007 the greatest leaf area index values were obtained in Treatments 1–3 (3.8–4.1 m2 m–2), but this had very short duration, dropping sharply after the maximum was reached. The LAI curve of Treatments 4, 6 and 7 exhibited smooth dynamics and the LAImax values were maintained until the 7 th sampling date. A study of leaf area duration revealed that due to the severe rainfall deficiency in summer 2007 there was a substantial reduction in leaf area in Treatments 1, 2, 3 and 5, which had a serious effect on yield formation. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the LAI values in the different treatments in all the years. Conclusions The results of analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences between the treatments in all three years as regards total dry matter production and leaf area index. It could be proved by growth analysis that different levels of FYM and NPK application had a substantial influence on the dynamics of dry matter accumulation and on the growth of the leaf area. An analysis of the year effect showed that rainfall deficiency was an important yield-limiting factor (yield declines of 4.57 and 2.91 t ha–1 in 2007 compared with 2005 and 2006, respectively), as a consequence of which the experimental treatments had little or no effect on the yields, while the effect of the year could be described well by means of the diverse dynamics of dry matter production and the leaf area index.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 231 SOIL-PLANT INTERRELATIONS AND VEGETATION BOUNDARIES ALONG AN ELEVATION GRADIENT IN A HUNGARIAN SODIC GRASSLAND Márta. ZALATNAI 1 – László KÖRMÖCZI 1 – Tibor TÓTH 2 1 Department of Ecology, University of Szeged, Közép fasor 52., H-6726 Szeged, Hungary, e-mail: zalatnai@bio.u-szeged.hu 2 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agrochemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest Abstract: In a 30 m transect soil-plant interrelations and vegetation boundaries influenced by edaphic factors were studied with moving split window (MSW) techniques. Boundaries between vegetation patches were sharp lines on the basis of both visual observation and MSW analysis but the boundaries between the different soil sections separated by MSW analysis were wider. Factor analysis showed that in the four vegetation sections separated by MSW the correlation coefficients were significant between plant and soil at p&lt;0.01. Keywords: moving split window, transect, solonetz Introduction The soil-plant interrelations have great importance for both ecology (Begon et al., 1986) and agriculture as well (Nagy et al., 2007). The zonation of plant community patches and the establishment of their boundaries are closely related to the edaphic factors (Begon et al., 1986, van der Maarel, 1975). Following the need of improved automatic boundary detection between plant communities (Kent et al., 1997) we studied a series of typical Hungarian edaphic grasslands. In this paper we describe the soil-plant interrelations and the establishment of vegetation boundaries in the zonation of sodic grassland communities along an elevation gradient. Our hypotheses were: (1) each boundary of plant communities, visible in a field observation can be verified with numerical methods, (2) each boundary between sodic grassland communities is narrow. Materials and methods We established a 30 m long transect at Csikós-puszta (46°17'21"N, 20°38'8"E, Kőrös– Maros National Park) along an elevation gradient from Bolboschoenetum maritimi to Salvio nemorosae-Festucetum rupicolae plant communities, where elevation, soil salinity and soil moisture as well as the temporary water logging constituted the background gradients (Fig.1.A.). Vegetation and soil samples were taken in 300 contiguous quadrats, 10  20 cm size each. Percentage cover of the plant species was recorded in the quadrats three times in 2002. Soil samples were collected from the centre of quadrats from 0-10 cm depth. The laboratory analysis of the soil samples - soil moisture (w%), pH, soil organic matter content (SOM), soluble Na+ ion content - was carried out according to Buzás (1988) except electrical conductivity (EC) that was measured in 1:2.5 soil:water suspension with conductometer. The moving split window technique (MSW; Webster, 1973) was used to detect and characterise the boundaries between communities and between the soil of the communities along the transect as described by Zalatnai and Körmöczi 2004, Körmöczi 2005. Squared Euclidean Distance (SED) function and the complement of Renkonen similarity index (DREN) were used to compare the two halves of the windows to make clear which factor is decisive in the development of the boundary zone in the transect.</p><p id="Pg231">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 232 The significance of the peaks was tested with the Z-score transformation of the values of the two functions (Cornelius and Reynolds, 1991). Plotting the average Z-score transformed values of the SED and DREN functions vs. the window midpoint position resulted in a profile diagram where a significant peak is identified as a vegetation boundary. We computed the values of the function in several scales (half window sizes) from 1 to 20. Average Z-scores greater than 1.65 are considered significant at p&lt;0.05. The seasonal results were averaged in the profile diagram. The measured abiotic parameters (elevation, pH, organic matter, soil moisture, soluble Na+ ion content, EC) were also analyzed by MSW using SED function, but before the analysis they were standardized by the range. In the four vegetation sections separated by MSW (Fig.1.E.), we examined the relationships between the above abiotic parameters and the abundance values of plant species via factor analysis (Tóth et al., 1995). In each section we computed the Pearson-correlation coefficient between the respective first factors of abiotic parameters and of the frequency values of plant species with SPSS11. Results and discussion The peaks of MSW analysis (both vegetation and soil data) coincided well with the three visual boundaries of the plant community patches (Fig 1. A, D, E). The boundaries were sharp lines between the plant community patches on the basis of both visual observation and MSW analysis (Fig.1.A,E) while the boundaries were wider between the different soil sections on the basis of the MSW analysis (Fig.1.D). The pair-wise correlations were significant (p&lt;0.01) between the measured abiotic parameters except between w% and soluble Na+ ion content and between w% and EC (data not shown), indicating that the sodic grassland had very strong organization. The primary factor was the elevation, along which two basic segments can be delineated: the area of temporary waterlogging (also determining soil moisture content), covered by Bolboschoenetum maritimi and the “dry” sodic segment starting with ArtemisioFestucetum pseudovinae community. Puccinellietum limosae community was covered only occasionally by standing water. The secondary factors of soil salinity, sodicity and alkalinity were very strongly correlated in this solonetzic soil, showing minimum mean values in the dry community of Salvio-Festucetum rupicolae, maximum in the Pucccinellietum limosae and smaller mean in Bolboschoenetum maritimi. Soil organic matter was limited by salinity, consequently showed the minimum in the Puccinellietum limosae and maximum in the highest part (Fig.1.B). The results of the factor analysis showed that in the four vegetation sections separated by MSW the correlation coefficients were significant (p&lt;0.01) between the soil parameters and the abundance values of the plant populations (data not shown). At the first boundary, between the Bolboschoenetum maritimi and Puccinellietum limosae there was significant peak only with DREN function (Fig.1.E). Because DREN is more sensitive to the changes of the species composition than SED (Körmöczi, 2005) it seemed that in this point the compositional change was larger than the abundance change (Fig 1.E) due to the few species (4-5 species per communities). At this boundary the analysis of the soil parameters did not show significant boundary because only the</p><p id="Pg232">VII.

At the second boundary between Puccinellietum limosae and Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae the MSW analysis showed significant peaks of both compositional and abundance changes (Fig.1.

The MSW analysis of the soil parameters (Fig1.D) showed significant twin peaks (between 7 and 8 m), which showed a wider boundary according to Körmöczi 2005. At the twin peaks there were abrupt changes in the values of each soil parameter but between the two peaks there were continuous changes. At the third boundary between the Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae and SalvioFestucetum rupicolae there were significant peaks with both SED and DREN in the same position (19.5 m) (Fig.1.E), which coincided well with the visual vegetation boundary. In the MSW profile of the soil parameters significant twin peaks emerged</p><p id="Pg233">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 234 (between 20 and 21 m) which can be considered as wider boundary (Körmöczi 2005). In this position of the transect at the first peak (20 m) all soil parameters changed together, at the second peak (21 m) only the values of the soil moistures increased in great extent while the others remained unchanged. The change in moisture widened the boundary. It is because the soil moisture is very sensitive to the elevation differences (Mile et al. 2001). In this section of the transect there was a small basin (5 cm elevation difference) (Fig.1.A) where the precipitation accumulated that was shown by the abundant occurrence of the mesophilous plant species, Alopecurus pratensis, which is unusual in this plant community. Conclusions All boundaries visible during the field observations could be verified with MSW analysis. The boundaries between the community patches were sharp lines on the basis of both visual observation and MSW analysis while the MSW-boundaries between the different soil sections were wider. Soil-plant interrelations are strong and both the species composition and the values of soil parameters are sensitive to the relief differences in this solonetz soil.

Soils in the pots (10 kg Dw/V) were treated annually by the increasing amount of sludge, i. e. 0, 2.5-, 5-, 10- and 20 g kg -1 (i.e. 0, 7.5-, 15-, 30- and 60 t ha -1 d.w.) for 4 consecutive years. Those amounts are representing a 16-years of application within a 4-year-period. The abundance (M%) and functioning (A%) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was studied at the reproductive phase and the element allocations in the shoot biomass of pea. Starting from a rather low mycorrhizal status at the 1 st and 2 nd vegetation periods, an enhanced colonization rates of the AM fungi was found at the 3 rd - and 4 th years. This fact can highlight the importance of the soil-nutrient-availability and also the abundance of indigenious AM fungi on the symbiosis. At the 3rd sampling (i.e. after a 12-years of usual application), the deleterious effect of the overloaded, accumulated heavy metals was found on the AMF values at the highest (10- and 20 g kg -1 ) rates at both types of sludge. Those rates of the municipal sludge has resulted 10-times greater Zn-uptake, in comparison with the Cr-content from the industrial waste. Metals effect on mycorrhizosphere assumed to be highly dependent on their biological role, and also on the final outcome of macro-microsymbiont interactions. Reduction of microsymbiont activities was fastened by the overestimated rates and application frequencies. Keywords: mycorrhiza fungi, heavy metals uptake, sewage sludge, long-term effect Introduction Sewage sludge, more particularly of the municipal origin, can be frequently used as organic soil-amendments in the sustainable agriculture by enhancing the soil-qality and soil-fertility. After the long-term application on the other hand, the adverse effects of the toxic elements are also known in the soil-food chain (Simon et al. 2000) and in the soil-biological properties (Biró et al., 2007; Szili-Kovács et al., 1985). Microbial processes, are key factors in the biogeochemical cycles of the ecosystems (Polgári et al., 1991), which needs attention. During a long-term application of heavy-metalscontaining sludge, the development of metal-adapted microbes was found. Those microbes may efficiently tolerate the toxicity and potentially protecting their hosts (Vivas et al., 2006). The positive impact of the mycorrhizal fungi was also reported in other stressed environments (Füzy et al., 2006). Considering the symbiosis, however both the enhanced nutrient- and also the toxic metals can reduce the colonization rates. Questions arise, how and when the soil-nutrient status and the accumulating metals can affect the symbiotic activity? What is the dynamism of the colonization during the repeated sludge applications? Is there any difference between the sewage sludge types and among the heavy metals or toxic elements involved? How the soils (physical, chemical and biological properties) can react for those applications? Materials and methods Effect of municipal (Zn) and industrial (Cr) sewage-sludge-types and increasing application rates were studied in a pot experiment, so as to assess the rhizobiological properties and the element allocation of the greenpea (Pisum sativum L. var. „Rajnai</p><p id="Pg235">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 236 törpe”) test plant. Four Hungarian soils were used in the pots (10 kg Dw/V), but only average results are considered here. Soils in the pots were annually treated by increasing amount of sewage sludge doses, i. e. 0, 2.5-, 5-, 10- and 20 g kg-1 (0, 7.5-, 15-, 30- and 60 t ha-1 d.w.). Those amounts are representing the usual agricultural quantities and also the four-time higher doses, resulting a 16-years of “application practice” within a 4years periods. The municipal sludge of (Gödöllő) with high (6157 mg kg-1) Zn-content and an industrial sludge of (Debrecen leather factory) with high Cr (5225 mg kg-1) content were used. The colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rhizosphere of the greenpea was studied, by investigating the abundance (mycorrhiza intensity, M%) and the functioning (arbusculum richness, A%) at the ripening of pea. A five-class system of Trouvelot et al. (1986) was used at the microscopic assessment after an anylin-blue staining. The element allocation in pea was followed by ICPspectrometry. Data on the AMF are shown (in %) with LSD5% calculations (Fig. 1). Results and discussion Mycorrhiza colonization in sewage sludge treated soils Colonization of AM fungi is shown in the rhizosphere of greenpea during three consecutive years at increasing rates of Zn- and Cr-contaning sludge. Total colonization of the fungi was found to be quite low (not higher than 30%) at the 1st and 2nd sampling (year 1), including both fungal parameters (M%, A%). A much greater values of AMF colonization could be recorded, however at the following two years. This fact can show the importance of the initial inoculum production of AMF for the development of the successful symbiosis. It is assumed, that during the 1st and 2nd vegetation periods the fungal growth was enhanced by the hostplant, which has resulted a further positive „after-effect” in the 3rd and 4th years of pea cultivation. Among the final two samplings, however there were no real differences found, showing the potential impact of the nutrient availability in the mycorhiza formation. It can be also considered, that the inoculum potential of the fungi can reach its maximum value, when further organics are added to the soils. Comparing of the effect of two different sludge types, the less toxicity of the Cr-containing industrial sludge could be recorded. The greatest differences were found at the higher doses, ie. at the 10 and 20 mg kg-1 metal rates. The adverse effect of the Zn-type of municipal sludge was already developed in the 2nd year of application and the colonization was further reduced, below 10% at the 3rd and 4th years of investigations. At that time the AMF colonization was found to be three-times greater at the 20 mg kg-1 Cr-metal rates. No adverse effect below the 10 mg kg-1 Crcontaining sewage sludge was found. The necessity of AM fungal symbiosis was also reported more particularly at the low-soil-nutrient-status (Vivas et al., 2006), or other environmental stress conditions (Füzy et al., 2006). Heavy metals, Zn and Cr in the shoot biomass of greenpea Zn- and Cr-content of the shoot biomass of greenpea is being shown in the Figure 2, sampled at the end of the three vegetation periods. An increasing amount of the heavy metals, tested was found as a function of the sewage sludge rates in each years. Regarding the quantity of metals, a much greater amount, about 10-times more of the Zn-content was recorded in the shoot-</p><p id="Pg236">VII.

Differences between the sludge-(metal)-types are also highlighted. Rates beyond the „usual” agricultural practice can be avoided on a long-term level. The reduced activity of soil (rhizo)biota was fastened by the overestimated rates and application frequency.

P.O. Box 14 Abstract: Cadmium is very toxic for all living organisms, including plants due, among others, to the inhibition of photosynthesis and the Cd induced oxidative stress. In spite of many experiences exact molecular mechanism of Cd action and Cd inducible defence processes are not known. Therefore, we followed changes in photosynthesis under long-term Cd treatment to clarify when defence mechanisms appear and how plants acclimate to Cd stress at available Cd concentration. Experiments were performed on hydroponically cultured four-leaf poplar plants treated with 10 M Cd(NO3)2. Leaves, developed during the first week of treatment, have been monitored for three weeks. In the first week, all investigated physiological or structural parameters showed a strong decay – including chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a/b ratio, actual photosynthetic efficiency (F/Fm’), carbon assimilation and defence mechanisms, while malondialdehyde content increased. In the following treatment period, however, an improvement of the values of all these parameters could be observed. Malondialdehyde content decreased strictly anti-parallel to the increased ascorbate peroxidase activity. However, no rise was found in the level of carbon assimilation. Keywords: heavy metal, cadmium, photosynthesis, poplar, fluorescence induction, ascorbate peroxidase, lipid peroxidation Introduction Cadmium, a very toxic heavy metal for all living organisms, occurs in industrial/urban wastes (galvanic batteries, dyes), and due to the application of chemical fertilizers also in soil (Lakatos et al., 1999; Coga et al., 2007; Várallyay, 2007). In plants, Cd was shown to disturb ion-balance (Wallace et al., 1992; Clemens, 2006) and water budget (Barceló and Poschenrieder, 1990), and to influence diverse metabolic processes, including photosynthesis (Misliwa-Kurdziel et al., 2002). Cd inhibited the synthesis of chlorophylls (Padmaja et al., 1990), decreased variable fluorescence and activity of photosystem II, and increased thermal energy dissipation of excess light energy (Oláh et al., 2003; Sigfridsson et al., 2004). Causing stomatal closure (Perfus-Barbeoch et al., 2002) and inhibition of activity of Calvin-cycle enzymes Cd also disturbed carbon assimilation thereby inducing oxidative stress (Benavides et al., 2005; Szarka et al., 2006). In spite of the accumulated information, and having ideas on general inhibitory effects of Cd, such as binding to important SH residues/replacing essential ions at active sites of enzymes (van Assche and Clijsters, 1990) or acting through disturbance of water and ion homeostasis (Siedlecka and Krupa, 1999), its exact molecular mechanism of action in vivo is still not understood. Particularly little is known about the acclimation of photosynthetic processes under long term Cd treatment. Therefore, we followed the changes in photosynthesis under long-term Cd treatment to clarify when defence mechanisms occur and how plants are able to tolerate Cd stress.</p><p id="Pg239">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 240 Materials and methods Plant material and growth conditions: Experiments were performed on micropropagated poplar (Populus glauca Haines, 1906 var. Kopeczkii) plants, grown and treated with 10 μM Cd(NO3)2 in Hoagland solution of ¼ strength with 10 μM Fecitrate as iron source, in climatic chamber with 12/12 hours light (100 µE m-2 s-1)/dark periods, 20/18 °C and 70/75% relative humidity. Plants were treated from their four-leaf stage for three weeks, and the photosynthetic performance of new leaves developed under the treatment, were followed. Measurements of the different parameters were repeated 2-3 times. Chl content was determined in 80% acetone extracts according to Porra et al. (1989). CO2 fixation was estimated by a radioisotope method (Láng et al., 1985). Fluorescence induction measurements of leaf samples were performed using a PAM Chlorophyll Fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Parameters were determined by the following formulas: ΔF/Fm’=(Fm’-Ft)/Fm’; NPQ=(Fm-Fm’)/Fm’. The activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX, L-ascorbate: H2O2 oxidoreductase) was measured by the method of Nakano and Asada (1981). Lipid peroxidation was measured according to Heath and Packer (1968). Results and discussion The growth of stem apex of Cd treated plants was retarded and the newly developing leaves were chlorotic. However, after about two weeks, the youngest leaves became a little greener in the same time when new root apexes began to develop. Cd treatment caused a strong inhibition of photosynthesis, including Chl synthesis, in a week time (Table 1). Henceforward, the Chl content slowly decreased, whereas that of the corresponding control leaves increased during the whole experimental period. The inhibition of Chl biosynthesis might be due to the direct Cd inhibition of the activity of 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Padmaja et al., 1990). More probably, however, it was connected with Cd induced iron deficiency (Siedlecka et al., 1999) as the synthesis of Chls is dependent on the availability of iron (Spiller et al., 1982), and the inhibition could be recovered by higher iron supply to plants showing well-pronounced Cd symptoms (Solti et al., 2007). The Chl a/b ratio of treated leaves, which also showed a strong decrease during the first week of treatment, however, began to increase from the second week, and its value became higher than the control by the end of third week (Table 1). The Chl a/b ratio of developed control leaves was around 3.5, and it did not show any changes except if they became shade leaf due to stronger growth of plants in the third week. The increased Chl a/b ratio refers to the reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus: to the accumulation of reaction centres at the expense of the antenna Chls. The actual efficiency of photosystem II (F/Fm’) was strongly lowered under a week of Cd treatment, but thereafter a slight but continuous increase could be noticed (Table 1), whereas the control plant did not show any changes. It could be the result of the same process that caused an increase in the Chl a/b ratio, but further experiments are needed to clarify if the amount of PSII complexes increased under long-term Cd treatment. The photosynthetic carbon assimilation also decreased under Cd treatment (160.000 ± 10.000 cpm in control), but in this case no improvement could be observed (Table 1). It</p><p id="Pg240">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 241 can be the result of disturbed stomatal closure induced by Cd (Perfus-Barbeoch et al., 2002), the decreased amount RUBISCO in Cd treated plants, and the direct inhibition of the Calvin cycle enzymes by Cd (Siedlecka and Krupa, 1996). The consequence of this inhibition is the development of oxidative stress (Benavides et al., 2005). The amount of malondialdehyde (MDA), the end product of lipid peroxidation, showed an increase during the first and second week of Cd treatment (Table 2), the maximum intensity of oxidative processes being observed between the 10th and 14th day. The protection against Cd induced oxidative stress is one of the most important abilities that have to develop under Cd treatment in surviving plants. The level of MDA showed a decrease in the third week of treatment, which was strictly anti-parallel to the increasing activity of APX (Table 2), the important oxidative stress protective enzyme in chloroplasts (Edreva, 2005).

This time the control plants did not show significant changes, except a little decrease toward the end of the third week. Interestingly, the recovery of PSII efficiency was accompanied with a higher non-photochemical quenching showing the induction of protective mechanisms. This may be connected with the fact that net photosynthesis did not recover under long-term Cd treatment. However, the regeneration of ascorbate needs reductive capacity, which is produced by the photosynthetic electron transport, explaining the measured recovery of actual PSII efficiency without a rising of carbon fixation activity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to clarify the relation of the increased protection and the activity of other defence enzymes under long-term Cd treatment.

Abstract: The soil water regime assessment is important for the development of prognosis of soil water regime changes in consequence of technical intervention and also for water balance in certain areas. Many classification systems are possible to use for the evaluation of the soil water regime, but with respect to creating optimal conditions for plants the modified agronomic classification for which water storage in the active root zone is needed seems to be applied. This method is good for soil water regime evaluating on the base of characteristics assigned by simulation with mathematical model. And it was applied for the Malé Leváre area witch is situated in Morava Basin and for years 1971-2005. Keywords: soil moisture, water storage, soil water regime classification Introduction Soil water represents an important water source which is a nonalternative in an agricultural country and in the production process and it also sensitively reacts to climate changes and anthropogenic activities (Šútor, Štekauerová, 2001). For this reason the regulation of the soil water regime represent a bigger socio-economical problem which is related to the stability of agricultural systems, the hydrological cycle of the country, the outproduction functions of agriculture and forestry, the protection of urban and natural countryside and landforming. And we have to know the course of soil water regime. Materials and methods The soil water regime is the summary of all changes of volume, physical state and relocation of the water in the soil for a certain time period and is the typical long time behaviour of the average values of these characteristics. The soil water regime (SWR) significantly affects the production ability of soil. For evaluation and classification of the SWR, and also of water balance in a certain area, the possibly of developing a prognoses of SWR changes in consequence to technical action it is suitable to use the data obtain from field measurements. From this data we can formulate important characteristics of the SWR. Long time measurements of soil moisture within Slovakia are sporadic, mostly for research purposes (Šútor, Majerčák, Štekauerová, 2001). Therefore we use mathematical modelling to determine the behaviour of SWR characteristics for a longer period of time, which presents a progressive research method of quantitative data about the processes occurring in system groundwater - zone of aeration - vegetation cover - atmosphere. Mathematical models are an important tool for planning proceedings to the protect environment for more than two decades. The soil water regime can be assessed on the three basic criterions from which we determine the name of classification: 1. According to the direction and intensity of water circulation in the soil in the hydrological year – hydrological classifications.</p><p id="Pg243">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 244 2. According to the predominant moisture in the soil over a longer period of time – ecological classification. 3. According to the relation between real and potentially accessible water for plants in the active root zone of grown agricultural crops – agronomical classification. The most suitable classification for evaluating the SWR from the view of optimal state for evolution of root system grown crops seems to be the agronomical classification. We distinguish 10 types of soil moisture regime in active root zone at agronomical classification (Šoltész, Benetin, 1988): The soil moisture is the background for this classification. Among important characteristics of the SWR, which are standard outputs from models, belongs also water content in selected layers of the soil profile calculated on the basis of moisture - water storage (Skalová, 2007). So the soil moisture in equation of Šoltész, Benetin (1988) is possible to change for water storage and the equation will get the form (1) and than we can speak about types of soil water regime (table 1):      n i WFC Wi WW WW n A 1 1 [m.m-1] (1) where: Wi – water storage of active root zone of soil profile in i-day of balance period calculated from real Θi WW – water storage equal to moisture for wilting point ΘW WFC – water storage equal to moisture for field water capacity ΘFC n -number of days in balance period Table 1. Types of soil water regime according to agronomical classification Types of soil water regime in the evaluated period A Total deficit of the soil water for the plants Total dry &lt; 0.01 Deficit of the soil water for the plants Very dry Considerable dry dry 0.01 – 0.20 0.21 – 0.30 0.31 – 0.40 Optimal content of the soil water for the plants Rotate dry Rotate moist Moist Considerable moist Wet 0.41 – 0.50 0.51 – 0.60 0.61 – 0.75 0.76 – 0.90 0.91 – 1.00 Overflow of the soil water Over wet &gt; 1.00 Value A &gt; 1, it means overflow of water in soil profile we calculate when Θi &gt; ΘFC, then is also Wi &gt; WFC. Deficit of soil water (the case A &lt; 0.01) will be, when Θi is near ΘW in majority of evaluated days, subsequently Wi will be near to WW. If Θi = ΘW then also Wi = WW and the value A will be equal to 0. In case if Wi &lt; WW the value A will be negative. It means that it is going about total deficit of soil water for plants for both examples, which prefigures critical situation for plants. For that reason it would be good to show these facts in the agronomical classification of types of soil water regime, as they are in tab. 1.</p><p id="Pg244">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 245 Results and discussion The shown method of soil water regime evaluating was applied to the Morava Basin in Záhorská Lowland, concretely in area of Malé Leváre. The period of years 1971–2005 and active root zone with thickness 50 cm were evaluated, the evaluated vegetation was grass (Skalová 2007). Characteristics of the SWR were determined by the simulation of the model Global (Majerčák, Novák, 1992). Equation (1) and table 1 were used for agronomical classification of the SWR and whole years and also the vegetation period were evaluated. The results are in figure 1 for years and also vegetation period in chronological order.

Cereal Research Communications 246 On the base of these results, we can establish that the deficit of soil water in the root zone – SWR type „dry“ were detect by evaluating whole years and by the vegetation periods of years 1978, 1983, 2001, 2003, and also by evaluating the vegetation period of year 2001. The most unfavourable state during the whole evaluated period 1971 – 2005 documented the lowest value coefficient A (A = 0.289 SWR type ”considerable dry”), during the vegetation period of the year 2003. By evaluating whole years the biggest deficit of water soil were determined in the year 1978, when A=0.333. The deficit of the soil water is caused mainly by very small amounts of precipitation in these years (fig.2). The overflow of soil water is also extreme, which has an unfavourable influence on the growth of the root system. This situation occurred in the years 1995, 1998, 1999 (whole year and vegetation period), when the amounts of precipitation were also higher. It must be said that a deficit or overflow of soil water is extreme and installs critical conditions for the growth of vegetation. During the evaluated period it was the optimal water storage in root soil zone, which creating good conditions for the growth of cultural crops. Conclusions Soil water regime assessment is important for developing a prognosis of the SWR changes caused by technical actions in landscape and also by water balance in certain areas. Many different classification systems can be used for SWR evaluating. With respect to keeping optimal conditions for plants it seems to be as the best agronomical classification, which is applied in this paper. The listed method is good for SWR evaluating in cases when we don’t have measurements of soil moisture. Then we can use characteristics determined by mathematical models, because the base for modified agronomical classification is water storages in the active soil layer, which are one from the model outputs.

In our paper we investigated the extent of soil structural modification affected by N mineral fertilizer with a wet sieving method. We observed the dispersion of the larger aggregate fractions into smaller aggregate fragments and primary particles. According to our results application of N mineral fertilizer may cause disaggregating of larger size soil units. Keywords: winter ploughing, soil aggregate, water stability, N fertilizer Introduction Qualifying soil structure is essential because this soil property affects crop production by determining several important factors (Hermavan et al., 1993). Cultivated plants require structured soil in a defined, homogenous depth, when soil mass consists of mainly 2000-3000m sized single soil units (i. e. aggregates (Nikiforoff, 1941; in Kemper et al., 1986) which retain their structure in wet conditions, too (Di Gléria et al., 1957). This soil structure is created by soil management practices. Unfortunately all tillage practices disrupt the original structural units of soil degrading them into smaller particles and alter their natural distribution in aggregate size and therefore cause decline of soil structure. Furthermore rapid wetting of aggregates could be severely disruptive, because it may cause the decomposition of aggregates into fragments and primary particles (Emerson, 1977). Therefore quality and stability of soil structure depend much on the stability of aggregates in water. This property is often investigated by wet sieving. Soil aggregates are differently resistant to degrading effects of tillage and water. The structural stability of &gt;2000 m large macroaggregates is affected by agricultural practices, and resists rapid wetting in a low extent. In contrary, 53-250 m microaggregates are stable to rapid wetting and are not destroyed by agricultural practices (Tisdall et al., 1982). Fertilizer applications though enhancing plant growth increase the quantity of plant residues and below-ground plant growth and therefore increase the quantity of aggregate-stabilizing organic matter. This generally improves soil aggregation but ammonium fertilizers can have an adverse effect. When NH4 + ion accumulates in large amounts in soils, it may be a dominant exchangeable cation, and like Na+ it favours dispersion of soil colloids. This could happen in unfavourable conditions, like low soil pH, or low soil moisture content (Haynes et al., 1998). Intensive tillage may cause soil degradation, and therefore low quality for crop management which in turn reduces agricultural productivity. In this paper our aim was to evaluate the soil structure modifying effect of N mineral fertilizer and quantify the changes in aggregate size distribution. Because wetting of soil structural units may be harmful to a high extent, we used a wet sieving method to quantify the water-stability of soil aggregates.</p><p id="Pg247">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 248 Materials and methods Site description Soil samples were taken in 22-23. 05. 2006, from the Látókép Experimental Station the Centre of Agricultural Sciences, of Debrecen University. The experimental site is located in the north-eastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain (Megyes et al., 2007). In this long-term field experiment, which was established in 1983, four different tillage factors were investigated (irrigation, tillage, fertilization, plant density). The investigated tillage treatments were winter ploughing (WP) to a depth of 27 cm, spring plowing (SP) to a depth of 22 cm and disk tillage (DT) to a depth of 12 cm. The soil of the experimental site was a lowland pseudomyceliar chernozem (Calciustoll or Vermustoll, silt loam; USDA taxonomy), which is one of the major soil types of the region. The climate is subhumid temperate continental, with a mean annual precipitation of 566 mm of which approximately 60% (345 mm) occurs during the growing season (from April to September). In this paper the winter ploughing – irrigation – use of N mineral fertilizer (Mineral fertilizer) combination has been investigated and compared to the winter ploughing – irrigation – without mineral fertilization (Control) combination. The site has been tilled by winter ploughing to 25-27 cm depth in 18. 11. 2005. Soil samples were taken from two different depth layers (0-25 cm and 25-35 cm) according to the depth of investigated tillage. Crop rotation was maize – maize – winter wheat – winter wheat. Samples were taken from the winter wheat field. In the case of mineral fertilizer addition 120 kg * ha-1 N mineral fertilizer was added. Method The wet sieving method was proposed by Six et al. (2000). Air dry soil were dry sieved in a 7mm sieve, parts bigger than this size were manually broken with a mortar to reach this size. Two different pre-treatment methods were investigated. (1) ± 300 g-s of air dry soil was rapidly immersed in tap water for 5min (Slaking (S)). (2) ± 300 g-s of air dry soil was capillary wetted to field capacity and left overnight till weight equilibrates (Capillary (C)). After the pre-treatment each sample was wet sieved for 2 min in an analytic sieve shaker machine with the following aperture sizes: 2 mm, 250 μm, 53 μm. Therefore we got 4 fractions: (1) the &gt;2000 m large macro- (2) the 250-2000 m small macro-, (3) the 53-250 m microaggregates, and (4) the &lt;53 m silt and clay fraction. All fractions were dried at 60 oC and weighted (Huisz et al. (2007)). Results and discussion Soil samples were taken from four plots of each treatment and depth layer. Different pre-treatment methods were done in triplicates. Number of replicates was 12 (with 4 outer and 3 inner replicates). Data were analysed as an F-probe and with 2 sampled Tprobe. Statistical significance was determined at P &lt; 0.05. Figure 1-4. show the amount of soil dry matter in the isolated fractions for each treatment and depth layer respectively.

In their study, Haynes et al. (1998) presented disaggregating effect of ammonium fertilizer mainly in the larger sized aggregate fractions. In our experiment, our results showed the same tendency in both soil pre-treating method and in both sampling depth. The amount of the macroaggregate fractions have decreased and with the stepwise disintegration (Oades et al., 1991) they have dispersed to smaller size aggregate fractions, the same time increasing their amount. In the case of the Slaking pre-treatment (Fig. 1, 3.) the disaggregating effect of N fertilizer is remarkable in the 250-2000 m small macroaggregate fraction, the amount of which has decreased. This fraction has dispersed mainly to 53-250 m microaggregates, but the &lt; 53 m silt and clay fraction has increased, too. Because of the high aggregate disrupting effect of this pre-treatment, the whole &gt; 2000 m large macroaggregate fraction has totally dispersed which is in parallel with the results of Emerson (1977). In the case of Capillary pre-treatment (Fig. 2, 4.) the disaggregating effect is remarkable at the &gt; 2000 m large macroaggregate fraction. Because of the less aggregate disrupting effect of this pre-treatment, compared to the former one, the &gt; 2000 m large macroaggregate fraction was detectable, and more 250-2000 m small macroaggregate fraction rest stable than in the case of the Slaking pre-treatment.

The only exception from the tendencies written above is detectable in the case of the Capillary pre-treatment, in the lower layer. There the 250-2000 m small macroaggregate fraction decreased, i. e. has disrupted, in contrary to the results of the upper layer. This may be caused by transportation and accumulation of the N fertilizer to this depth, that disperses both the &gt;2000 m large macro- and 250-2000 m small macroaggregate fractions. Conclusions Disaggregating, therefore disadvantageous effect on soil structure of N mineral fertilizer was demonstrated. The larger aggregate fractions, being responsible for convenient soil structure for cultivated plants, have dispersed into smaller forms; therefore deterioration of soil structure was proved. In order to increase the yields the effect of soil structure on crops must be considered. A possibility is to apply N fertilizers with bivalent cations.

Bacterisation statistically significantly affected the yield level and the protein content in the grain. Furthermore, the highest values of the observed parameters were determined in the fertilising variant with 80 kg N ha –1 , which is very important from the aspect of the system sustainability. If wheat, as a non–legume species, could accomplish a successful association with a compatible type and strain of nitrogen fixing bacteria, a possibility that wheat satisfies a part of its needs for nitrogen by nitrogen fixation could be achieved, and in such a case the application of N fertilisers would be reduced. Keywords: nitrogen fixers, nitrogen fertilization, protein contents, wheat grain, chernosem soil. Introduction According to the data of the Bureau of Statistics, wheat production per area unit has been decreasing in Serbia, as well as, the area cultivated with wheat, which is not the case in the neighboring countries and model–countries (UK, Germany and France). The essential reason for this is lower investments into the production and a significant departure from growing practices. In recent years, multidisciplinary sciences such as soil microbiology and results obtained within the field of biological nitrogen fixation have been included into the studies on the production of filed crops together with wheat. All this is important from aspects of sustainability and protection of agroecosystems (Pepó, 2007; Kádár, 2007). Gained results point out to a wide distribution of associative nitrogen (N) fixers in the wheat rhizosphere, indicating to a selective advantage of this plant species over other rhizospheric microbial population (Sharma et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2007). It was established that a protein fraction in the wheat root exudates is capable to attract associative N fixers and to increase their N fixing capacity. This fact points to a potential possibility of N fixation increasing by selection of plants and effective N fixers within the plant–compatible bacterial species association. Materials and methods The trials were carried out on slightly calcareous chernozem in the experimental filed of the Maize Research Institute, Zemun Polje, in the 1999–2001 periods. The cropping practices were performed qualitatively and on the optimum dates. Prior to sowing, Urea was applied: N1–without fertilisation, N2–80 kg N ha –1, 60 kg P2O5, 40 kg K2O, N3–120 kg N ha–1, 90 kg P2O5, 60 kg K2O; N4–150 kg ha –1, 120 kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O. A spring wheat variety Leda was sown at the density of 600 plants m–2. Seed nitrogenisation with a liquid inoculum encompassing a mixture of different strains of associative N fixers (Azotobacter chroococcum, Azospirillum lipoferum and Beijerinckia Derx and Klebsiella planticola) was done prior to sowing. Depending on a strain, a cell number ranged from 10 to 25 x 108 ml–1. The elements affecting a yield level and grain protein</p><p id="Pg251">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 252 content were established at the end of growing season. Total proteins were determined by the method micro–Kjeldalh (Jones, 2001). The yield was calculated on 13% grain moisture basis. The data were analysed by Students’t–test (Mead, 1996). Results and discussion In the recent twenty years, a great number of researchers have been engaged in seed bacterisation with diazotrophs, as well as, in selection of both diazotrophs and genotypes. Wheat bacterisation with diazotrophs does not always show expected results, and a complexity of interrelation of the wheat plant and the bacterium is a reason for it (Németh, 2006). Bacterisation with different strains of diazotrophs expressed different effects related to some morphological traits, yield. A 1000–kernel weight (TKW), computed to dry matter, and presents the TKW absolute weight. Although it is defined by the genetic material, it also depends on agroecological conditions, applied cropping practices and ranges over a wide interval (Josipovic et al., 2005; Bertic et al., 2007). According to obtained results, it is observable that the three–year TKW average amounted to 36.1 g in the variant with bacterisation vs. 33.3 g in the variant without bacterisation, i.e. it was higher by 8.41% in the variant with than in the variant without bacterisation. As it is known that it depends on hydrothermal conditions, variations over years were observed. The detail analysis showed that the TKW in all three years was the highest in the variant with bacterisation and fertilisation with 80 kg N ha–1. More over, the dependence of mineral N rates and bacterisation (Figure 1) was analysed, and on the basis of the analysis it can be concluded that correlation r=0.98* was at the significance level of 5%. The regression line shows a trend of reduction of the TKW over higher mineral N rates in the variant with bacterisation. The coefficient of correlation was not at the level of statistical significance in the variant without bacterisation. y = -0.0003x 2 + 0.0496x + 35.532 r 2 = 0.98* y = -6E-05x 2 + 0.0102x + 33.124 r 2 = 0.081 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 0 30 60 90 120 150 Mineral nitrogen rates kg.ha –1 r = 0.98* – coefficient of correlation in the variant with bacterisation r = 0.081 – coefficient of correlation in the variant without bacterisation Figure 1. 1000–kernel weight in dependence on mineral nitrogen rates and bacterisation Although the yield depends on the complex genetic control, its level is affected not only by hydrothermal conditions (Hernandez–Fernandez et al., 2007), but also by the application of cropping practices, especially of fertilisation. Based on obtained results, it can be concluded that bacterisation significantly affected the yield increase over the three–year investigation period. The three–year average yield in the variant with bacterisation amounted to 2.78 t ha–1, which was higher by 11.64% or 290 kg ha–1 than the yield recorded in the variant without bacterisation.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 253 performing studies on effects of bacterisation, as an indirect method of stimulatory effects on plants, obtained the wheat yield in field trials higher by 14.1%. Furthermore, performed studies show that the yield reduction occurred with high fertiliser rates and under conditions of bacterisation. Considering that the higher mineral N rate is the lower efficiency of diazotrophs is, the analysis of the dependence of the wheat yield on the mineral N rate shows the correlation of yield at the significance level of 5% and in the variant without bacterisation.

Wheat yield in dependence on bacterisation and mineral N rates The application of mineral fertilisers and other chemicals is very important from the aspect of both, the environmental protection and the production of organic, healthy food (Tanács et al., 2005; Németh, 2006).

Cereal Research Communications 254 Therefore, in recent times, measures have been taken in order to supplement or replace the application of chemicals. Hence, bacterisation has significantly affected the grain protein content (Table 1). Besides contents of carbohydrates and starch, the protein content of wheat grain is also very important for wheat utility in bread production, as 75% of human population use bread in their diet (Jolánkai et al., 2006; Pepó and Győri, 2007). Studies performed on bacterisation of wheat with Azotobacter (Singh et al., 2007), and on bacterisation of wheat with Azospirillum (Sharma et al., 2007), show the protein increase in grain. During the three–year studies, bacterisation and fertilisation significantly increased the protein content, while their interrelation did not affect it at the level of statistical significance (Table 1). Conclusions Bacterisation statistically significantly affected the yield level and the protein content in the grain. Furthermore, the highest values of the observed parameters were determined in the fertilising variant with 80 kg N ha–1, which is very important from the aspect of the system sustainability. If wheat, as a non–legume species, could accomplish a successful association with a compatible type and strain of nitrogen fixing bacteria, a possibility that wheat satisfies a part of its needs for nitrogen by nitrogen fixation could be achieved, and in such a case the application of N fertilisers would be reduced.

Soil substrate was arable lands (total 10) of vertisol type (in Serbian smonica) collected from Central Serbia and Kosovo. Two kg of air-dried soil was weighed for each plastic pot and homogenized with 1.06 kg of fertilizer NPK 15:15:15 (equivalent of 800 kg ha -1 of the fertilizer or 120 N : 120 P2O5 : 120 K2O ha -1 ). Than four additional fertilization treatments (in sulphate form; three replicates) with iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) sulphate form) were created as follows: a) the control; b) Fe (8 mg Fe pot -1 ); c) Mn (8 mg Mn pot -1 ) and Zn (8 mg Zn pot -1 ). Differences in chemical properties among ten vertisols were mainly in wide ranges from 4.64 to 6.87 (pH in 1n KCl), from 2.69% to 3.99% (humus contents), from 0.6 to 28.0 P2O5 mg 100 g -1 , from 19.0 to 46.0 K2O mg 100 g -1 (AL-method) from 0.04 to 0.23 mg Fe kg -1 , from 3.1 to 9.7 mg Mn kg -1 , and from 0.6 to 1.9 mg Zn kg -1 . (0.005 M DTPA extraction). In general, soil properties considerably higher influenced on Fe, Mn and Zn status in top of oats (harvesting 45 days after emergence). For example, the ranges among soils were from 1.7 to 78.9 mg Fe kg -1 , from 37.6 to 165.8 mg Mn kg -1 and from 18.4 to 24.8 mg Zn kg -1 . As affected by Fe fertilization oats Fe was increased for 8% compared to the control, while due to Zn fertilization oats Zn was increased for 35%. Possible application of fertilization of vertisols with micronutrients could be indicated by previous soil testing. Keywords: fertilization, vertisol, iron, manganese, zinc, oats, pot experiment. Introduction Vertisol characterizing heavy texture with domination of montmorilonite clay and high capacity for absorption of cations and their imobilization for field crops. It is estimated that vertisol area in Serbia is about 700,000 ha or 25 % of agricultural land of the country (Živković and Djordjević, 2003). Aim of this study was testing of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) status in vertisols of Serbia and response oats (Avena sativa L.) to fertilization with these elements. Materials and methods Oats (Avena sativa L. cultivar Slavuj) was grown in pot experiment. Soil substrate was represented by 10 arable lands of vertisol (in Serbian smonica). Total 90 plastic pots were used in the experiment. Two kg of air-dried soil was weighed for each plastic pot and homogenized with 1.06 kg of fertilizer NPK 15:15:15 (equivalent of 800 kg ha-1 of the fertilizer or 120 N: 120 P2O5: 120 K2O ha -1). Than four additional fertilization treatments with iron, manganese and zinc: sulphate form) in three replicates were created as follows: a) the control; b) iron (8 mg Fe pot-1); c) manganese (8 mg Mn pot1); (8 mg Zn pot-1). The experiment was carried out under glashouse conditions with temporary transfer on open conditions during the warm period. Oats was sown in term 10.5.2005). Total 15 seed were sown per each pot. After emergence ten plants per pot were given up to tasseling stage (45 days after emergence). Destiled water was added according to need to level of optimal soil moisture.</p><p id="Pg255">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Plant samples were digested by wet-ashing procedure by conc. HNO3+HClO4 and addition of 30% H2O2 (Krishnamurty et al., 1976). Fe, Mn and Zn in the solution were determined by atomic absorption (VEB Carl Zeiss, 1985). Statitstical calculation of the data (analyses of variance and correlation coefficients) was made according Mead (1996). Vertisols (in Serbian smonica) were collected from arable lands (total ten sites) of Central Serbia and Kosovo as follows: L1=Milutovac, L2=Pristina, L3=Trnava, l4=Rekovac, L5=Vranje, L6=Zaječar, L7=Bela Crkva, L8=Salas, L9=KragujevacI, L10=KragujevacII. Mobile fractions of phosphorus and potassium were determined by the AL-method (Egner et al., 1960), while for estimation of Fe, Mn and Zn nutritional status soil extraction with 0.005 M DTPA (Lindsay and Norvell, 1978) was used.

Three soils were in the group of the lowest Mn concentrations in oats (less than 50.0 mg Mn kg-1: L8 L3 and L4) while in three soils (L7, L9 and L10) it was higher than 115,0 mg Mn kg-1. Four soils were in the group with low Zn status in oats (less than 20.0 mg Zn kg-1: L6, L7, L5 and L1), while in two soils (L10 and L8) it was above 23.5 mg Zn kg-1. Influences of fertilization on field crops were studied with different aspects and soil effects were mainly higher compared to the fertilization effects (Győri, 2007; Kádár, 2007; Kovačević et al., 2006). Conclusions In general, soil influences on iron, manganese and zinc status in oats were higher than the applied fertilization with these elements. Possible application of fertilization of vertisols with micronutrients could be indicated by previous soil testing on available micronutrient status in soil.

Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, aeded@pfos.hr Abstract: The genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI), which is the differential response of genotypes to the varied environmental conditions, results from the genetic differences among varieties. The statistical analysis should provide estimates for parameters that indicate both how well genotypes perform on average across the environmental range and how well they perform in specific environmental conditions. AMMI models separates genotype, environment and genotype-environment interaction before applying singular value decomposition to GE for least-squares, low dimensional visualization, and they are one of foremost statistical methods in multi environment trials (MET). Keywords: genotype-by-environment interaction, multivariate methods, AMMI, MET Introduction A major objective in many advanced plant breeding programs is to assess yield increase, quality and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. To this purpose plant breeders perform so-called multi environment trials. In a multi-environment trial, a set of genotypes is evaluated across a number of environments that hopefully represent the environmental range across which the genotypes should partially (specific adaptation) or wholly (wide adaptation) perform well (van Eeuwijk F.A. et al., 2004). A cultivar grown in different environments will frequently show significant fluctuation in yield performance relative to other cultivars. These changes are influenced by the different environmental conditions and are referred to as genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) (dos S. Dias &amp; Krzanowski, 2003). According to Kaya (2006) GEI is differential response of genotypes evaluated under different environmental conditions. It is complex phenomenon as it involves environmental (agro-ecological, climatic and agronomic) conditions and all physiological and genetic factors that determine the plant growth and development. MET produce genotype by environment interaction data matrix. There are many statistical methods for assessing, studying and interpreting GEIs. These include partitioning of variance, the traditional stability regression model, nonparametric statistics and multivariate techniques, particularly the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model. Therefore aim of this paper was to describe principles of multivariate methods for assessing genotype-by-environment interaction with emphasis on Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model. Advantages and limitation of these methods were also taken in consideration from the aspect of agronomists and plant breeders. Materials and methods A systematic and comprehensive literature search was undertaken and identified literature was closely reviewed. Scientific on-line databases were searched using the following keywords in any part of text: “genotype by environment interaction”, “GEI”,</p><p id="Pg259">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 260 “multivariate methods”, “AMMI”, “biplot”, “plant breeding”, “MET”. Where possible “Related records” searches were also undertaken within the database when suitable papers were identified. Google Scholar search with keyword “genotype by environment interaction” showed about 99 100 results and after narrowing the search to “Recent articles” it came out about 24 000 results. Similar was with keyword “multivariate methods”, about 5 420 results came out and keyword “AMMI model” resulted with 208 search results. Most recent articles were reviewed. Results and discussion Most of the data collected in agricultural experiments are multivariate in nature because several attributes are measured on each of the individuals included in the experiment. Multivariate statistical methods are originally developed for other fields, but lately they have been widely applied in analysis of field trials data. Increased appliance of computers in data analysis facilitates analysis of large data sets and usage of computationally complicated statistical analysis. There are three basic situations when multivariate statistical methods are needed: (i) when we want to explore each one of multiple individual variables; (ii) when we have a set of variables that we want to examine as a set and (iii) when we want to use a combination or a subset of raw variables rather then examine themselves. According to Crossa (1990) multivariate analysis in field trial data has three main purposes: (i) to eliminate noise from the data pattern (i.e. to distinguish systematic from systematic variation); (ii) to summarize the data; and (iii) to reveal a structure in the data. Randomized complete block and incomplete block designs are usually used in METs (Ferreira, 2006). The interest of plant breeders has focused on modeling the genotype means estimated in the jth environment. General form of MET results is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Estimates of the i genotype means in each of the j environments.

Hundred of papers have used AMMI to analyze agricultural experiments. General purpose of AMMI model is to visualize data, clarify GEI and to improve accuracy of yield estimates. This model combines two statistical procedures: analysis of variance (ANOVA) which partitions the variation into the row main effects (G), column main effects (E), and row x column interaction effects (GE), and singular value decomposition (SVD), which is also sometimes called principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is the most frequently used multivariate method (Crossa, 1990). Its aim is to transform the data from one set of coordinate axes to another, which</p><p id="Pg260">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 261 preserves, as much as possible, the original configuration of the set of points and concentrates most of the data structure in the first principal component axis (Alberts, 2004). AMMI model separates G, E, and GE before applying SVD to GE for a least-square, low dimensional visualization. Hence AMMI applies SVD to the matrix of residuals from the additive model, that is, the interaction (Gauch, 2006). The AMMI model was developed about 50 years ago and it's consider as most suitable SVD-based method for yield-trial analysis (Gauch, 2006). The model equation is:    m k ijjkikkjiij sregY 1 where: ijY is the ith genotype mean observed in the jth environment;  is grand mean; ig is the fixed effect of the ith genotype; je is fixed effect of the jth environment; k is the eigenvalue of the PCA analysis axis k; ikr and jks are the genotype and environment principal component scores for axis k; m is number of retained components and ij is the error term. The interaction is explained in the form of a biplot graph where, each genotype and each environment have a point or marker. According to Gauch (2006) there are two kinds of AMMI biplots that are common in the literature: AMMI1 biplot has main effect for its abscissa and PC1 for its ordinate and AMMI2 biplot that has PC1 for its abscissa and PC2 for its ordinate. A possibility of graphical representation of AMMI results in easily interpretable and informative biplot is considered as a great asset of this model. Beside this AMMI offers couple other advantages: (i) AMMI can focus on relevant variation in the data and ignore irrelevant variation; (ii) AMMI can reduce noise; (iii) provides an integrated understanding of the genotypes and environments; (iv) is flexible regarding the structure of available yield-trial data. In the other hand AMMI also has some disadvantages: (i) it is difficult to describe the GEI effects if number of components retained in the model is large (m ≥ 3); (ii) environmental response pattern can not be estimated directly from AMMI model. If we take all this in consideration and according to Gauch (2006) AMMI is analysis that completely separates G, E, and GE as required for most agricultural research purposes, and further more it also separates signal from noise as well as any other method for the purpose of gaining accuracy. Such gains may be used to reduce testing cost by reducing the number of replications, to include more treatments in the experiments, or to improve efficiency in selecting the best genotypes. Conclusions Evaluation of genotypic performance in multi environment trials is the main activity in any plant-breeding program. Understanding and predicting of crop response to environment is very important. Over the past few years AMMI models has been extensively used to analyse and understand genotype x environment interaction in various crops, and also they achieved great success. The results of AMMI analysis can be graphically represented in an easily interpretable and informative biplot that shows</p><p id="Pg261">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 262 both main effects and GEI. Although it is invented over 50 years ago, AMMI model still can be consider as a most suitable SVD method for yield-trials.

Pasture of a low productivity was under-seeded with three plant species (Lolium perenne, Bromus inermis, Phleum pratense) in a larger plot experiment while the original sward was retained as the control. Treatment with liquid manure formed the basis of the organic system (30 m 3 ha -1 y -1 cattle liquid manure) while artificial fertilizer was used for the conventional one (50 kg ha -1 y -1 nitrogen). There was no nutrient input to the extensive system. The production of forage and the energy value of forage produced as well as other forage quality parameters were examined. Keywords:, liquid manure, artificial fertilizer Lolium perenne, Bromus inermis, Phleum pratense Introduction In Hungary the extent of grasslands has been decreasing in the last few decades as agricultural areas of good-quality have been taken up by tillage farming (Barcsák and Kertész, 1986). Grasslands located on soils of lower productivity produce on average 1.5 t hay ha-1 y-1 (Szemán, 1994). Increases in yield have been realised by applying artificial fertilizer. Barcsák et al. (1981) determined that, in case of NPK rate of 1:0.4:0.4, one kg nitrogen will result in 20 kg increase in dry matter production. The appropriate quantity of nutrients required to raise the yield of different grasslands has been examined by many experts (Kádár, 2007; Nagy, 1989; Nagy J., 2006; Szemán, 1991a and 1991b; Szemán, 1994). Overuse of artificial fertilizers has resulted in not just the increase in production but also in soil degradation (Cowling, 1981; Láng, 1983; Sipos and Patócs, 1975) and loss of biodiversity (Müller, 1994). Szemán (1998) has determined that there was a greater variety of species of Fabaceae and that their yield was higher on those grasslands that were not supplied with artificial fertilizer. The crude protein content of grasses also increases with nitrogen supply (Bánszky, 1988; Szemán, 2003). New, eco-friendly grassland management methods such as organic and extensive approaches appear to be interesting alternatives (Ángyán at al., 1997; Magyar et al., 2005; Opitz et al., 2006; Szabó et al., 2007; Szemán, 2007; Tasi, 2000; Tasi, 2007). Materials and methods The experimental site is located in Central-Hungary, 60 km to the east from Budapest at the elevation of 250 m. Average yearly rainfall is 600 mm. Plots were established in a pasture sown in 1994 on chernozem soil. This run down pasture was under-sown with three grass species (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense and Bromus inermis) in October 2000 while original the sward was retained as the control. Four different plots were thereby established. In these plots different grassland farming methods were examined (extensive - no fertilizer or manure; organic - 30 m3 ha-1 y-1 liquid manure; conventional - 50 kg N ha-1 y-1 artificial fertilizer). The sward was harvested in late May. Aspects of sward nutritive value were determined based on Weender-analysis after dehydration. Results were analysed using the MINITAB statistical method.</p><p id="Pg263">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 264 Table 1. Set up of the experiment.

According to these data it is apparent that there was no significant difference between the estimated energy values for liquid manure and artificial fertilizer treatments. Energy value estimates were based on the crude fibre content. Lower energy value of nonfertilized plots was due to the higher crude fibre and lower crude protein content. Table 2.

According to the overall yield of the species, Lolium perenne (8.53 t ha-1) and Bromus inermis (8.26 t ha-1) provided significantly more forage than Phleum pratense (6.94 t ha-1) or the non-under-sown control (5.98 t ha-1). Increased production from Lolium was attributed to its aggressive growth characteristics while Bromus inermis could have significantly better results due to its drought tolerance. Yield of the moisture-loving Phleum pratense was less than expected because of the drought and the dry location of the pasture. Based on this experiment plots under-sown with Lolium perenne and Bromus inermis and treated with liquid manure seem to provide more</p><p id="Pg264">VII.

Szalai.Daniel@kti.szie.hu 2 Institute for Animal Breeding and Nutrition, Research Group for Bee Breeding and Bee Biology, Gödöllő, Hungary Abstract: Recent land use changes in some specific areas in Hungary has generated good conditions for the milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). The milkweed provides good quality and quantity of nectar in addition it is attractive to bees. The importance of organic honey is quite high since it has got special status and role in the markets. Our aim was to get site specific information on the plants’ nectar production and honey quality. The relation of soil water content, nectar quantity, quality and the most important physicochemical characteristics of Asclepias and multifloral organic honeys were determined. Keywords: Asclepias syriaca, sandy soils, nectar production, organic apiculture, honey analysis, Introduction The Hungarian flora provides a good source for bees to collect nectar. In the recent years the number of organic beekeepers has increased though their number is still low compared to the conventional colleagues (Szalai, 2005). Beside the classical robinia honey the milkweed (ASCSY) honey as an organic product is becoming popular. The plant that provide the nectar is spreading mainly in the areas of abbandoned homesteads (mainly in the territory of Kiskunság). The spread of the weed is also influenced by the climate change; the extensively and intensively managed sites and the land use patterns have direct impact on the environmental balances. The extensive areas have a drought tolerant character (Várallyay, 2007; Dobó et al., 2006). Beside these threats organic agriculture can be defined as a production system that relies on natural products and encourage biodiversity (Husti, 2006). These different impacts form the actual landscape in many areas of the central part of Hungary. Materials and methods Twenty-two samples of unheated honey from the center part of Hungary (harvested in 2004-2005) were examined. The selected apiaries were organic certified according to the EU Reg. 2092/91. Samples originated from the same nine organic apiaries in 2004 and 2005. Apiaries migrated to the bee pastures of Bács-Kiskun county in the central part of Hungary. For the examination two sites were determined in each year. Site no. 1 was near to Szank, can be characterised with low humus content (0,1-0,5%) of moving sand and site no. 2 was in the district of Jakabszállás with sandy soil of higher humus content (0,7-1,2%). Soil samples were collected three times during blooming in 2005, dried on 105 °C to determine water content and bulk density. Plant nectar weight gain was determined in the same intervals in 2005 via colonies and nectar sugar content was measured with Abbey refractometer. Determination of HMF was made according to method of Winkler (1955). Invertase activity and sugar content were measured with the harmonized method of the European Honey Commission (Bogdanov et al., 1997). The results are expressed as an invertase number which indicates the amount of sucrose per g an hour hydrolysed by the enzymes contained in 100 g of honey.</p><p id="Pg267">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 268 The diastase activity was determined photometrically (Schade et al., 1958). The results are expressed as a diastase number in Schade units. Results and discussion Honeys originated from Asclepias syriaca (Table 1.) showed the lowest deviation in Fructose/Glucose ratio, however other values may have been influenced by site specific and technology factors as well. In the asclepias honey harvested in 2005 the mean value of inveratase and diastase activity were the highest among the samples (10,48 and 22,58). According to the EU Honey Directive (CE, 2002) the minimal level of diastase activity is 8 on Schade scale. In 2004 (Table 5) there were more multifloral samples which could be characterised by organoleptic methods as milkweed honey. Because of higher various pollen content these samples belong to the wider multifloral group. The effect of the year (2004) may also had influence on fructose-glucose content compared to the results of 2005. Table 1.

The asclepias honey had higher mean values for diastase (23,58), for invertase (13,56), for fructose (46,63) and for glucose (36,33) (Kasper-Szél et al., 2003). Another result for diastase has lower values (15,8) (Széles et al., 2006). The transition and land use change of agricultural areas in this central part of Hungary in one hand promoted the unwanted propagation of this perennial deep rooting weed, however created a widely used bee pastures for the beekeepers. Milkweed is easily propagated from seed too. Tóth and Lehoczky (2003) studied the growth characteristics of the first year of the weed. The highest intensity of relative leaf growth rate, the net assimilation rate and the leaf area ratio were during 4-12 June. The characteristic of the</p><p id="Pg269">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 270 soil determines the average soil moisture and the blooming period. The blooming and the nectar production depends on the precipitation but the plant tolerates drought in sandy soils too. The nectar production of milkweed had positive correlation with soil water content in 2005 especially on Site No. 1 however the larger nectar weight gain resulted in higher water content in the nectar as well. This case in 2005 the soil plant relation was disturbed by the phenological of ASCSY during the blooming period. In case of the end product (honey) the variation of soil humus content did not show significant differences in the main sugar contents, however site and soil specific relation may influence invertase and diastase activities, but probably due to the factors of the physiological state of the colonies had higher impact on it. The effect of the year might also influence the fructose-glucose content. It needs a complex overview to estimate the pros and cons of ASCSY in different territories. Within this study we focused on it as a nectar source. Acknowledgements We express our thanks for the participation to the beekeepers and Biokontroll Hungária Nonprofit Kft. in this survey.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 271 MACROELEMENT, HEAVY METAL AND SELENIUM CONTENT OF GRASS SPECIES AND DICOTYLEDONS Julianna TASI Department of Grassland Management, Crop Production Institute, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Szent István University, Gödöllő, Hungary, e-mail: Tasi.Julianna@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: Data on the composition of fodder from pastures (grass, meadow-hay) can be frequently found in literature, but data on the element contents of the grass or non-grass species composing natural grasslands are scarce. In order to analyse the element contents of plants, samples were collected over 3 years (1998-2000) from different types of natural grasslands. On non-fertilised grasslands, the dominant species was Festuca pseudovina. The dominant species on the fertilised grasslands were Poa pratensis, with Bromus inermis or Elymus repens being dominant at some sites. The results showed that leguminous plants had the highest contents of four of the five macroelements, while the highest level of K was found in dicotyledonous plants. The Na and Ca contents of the plants were higher on non-fertilised grasslands, while the level of all other macroelements was higher in plants from fertilised grasslands. Since the Se contents showed a high dispersion, only a trend was observed, indicating that the Se content of grass species is not significantly lower than that of other grassland plants. On non-fertilised grasslands, grass species contained the most Cr and Pb, while leguminous plants contained the most Cd. In fodder from fertilised grasslands, the highest quantity of Cd and Cr was found in grass species, and the most lead in non-leguminous dicotyledons. Keywords: grass species, dicotyledons, macroelement content, heavy metal content Introduction Data on the composition of fodder from pastures (grass, meadow-hay) can be frequently found in the literature. Analyses have been carried out to compare regions (Köles et al., 1997), or species (Centeri et al., 2007; Kádár, 1995). The effect of fertilisation and changes in the composition of grasslands utilised at different times have also been examined (Bajnok et al, 2000; Magyar et al., 2005; Penksza et al., 2005; Póti et al., 2007; György et al., 2007 ). The above studies generally refer to sown grass species, or in certain cases to sown dicotyledons (Opitz v. Boberfeld et al., 2006). Data relating to the element contents of the grass or non-grass species composing natural grasslands are either scarce or inadequately summarised. Materials and methods To analyse the element contents of plants, samples were collected over 3 years (19982000) from different types of natural grasslands. The botanical composition of the sampling sites was determined by Balázs's quadrat method (Balázs, 1949). In 1999 and 2000 the plants in all the green samples were divided into groups of grass species, leguminous species and other dicotyledons. The Cd, Cr, Pb and K, Na, Ca, Mg, P and Se contents of each group were measured using a spectrometer. Soil characteristics are presented by Table 1. The sampling sites can be divided into two categories: fertilised and non-fertilised. The non-fertilised grasslands received no mineral fertilisers, and as these sites were under grazed, manure from sheep grazing was of insignificant quantity. In these grasslands, the dominant species was Festuca pseudovina.

Average heavy metal content of fodder (mg kg-1) on non-fertilised (a) and fertilised (b) grasslands The analysed grasslands showed a high variation in the heavy metal contents of the plant groups. On non-fertilised grasslands the most Cd was found in leguminous plants, while on fertilised grasslands the most Cd was found in grass species. In general,</p><p id="Pg272">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 273 fertilised grasslands contained more Cd. The toxic standard of 0.5 mg kg-1 in fodder was exceeded in each plant group, on both types of grassland. Grass species contained the most Cr on both grassland types. The lowest Cr content was found in leguminous plants on fertilised grasslands. Clover species in the fodder from non-fertilised grasslands accumulated more Cr than the other dicotyledons. The Cr content was higher in the total fodder from fertilised grasslands and exceeded an average plant quantity of 1 mg kg-1. The greatest quantity of lead was absorbed by grasses on non-fertilised grasslands, and by non-leguminous dicotyledons on fertilised grasslands. Except for the grass species, the plants on fertilised grasslands contained more lead than the plants on non-fertilised grasslands. A lead content of 10 mg kg-1 or more is considered toxic in grass fodder, but this level was not approached by any of the grassland plant groups. Table 2 shows the average macroelement content of grass species, leguminous species and other dicotyledons. As expected, these average data showed that grass species contained fewer macroelements than other grassland plants. Leguminous plants contained the highest quantity of four of the five macroelements examined, while K accumulated mostly in other dicotyledonous species. The macroelement content on nonleguminous grassland species was many times that of grasses, but the difference between leguminous and other grassland species was insignificant. The Na and Ca content of the fodder from non-fertilised grasslands exceeded that of the fertilised grasslands. The elements K, Mg, and P were found in greater quantities in fodder from fertilised grasslands than in fodder from non-fertilised grasslands. The macroelement content of the sampled grass fodders was sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of sheep. Table 2.

Leguminous plants on non-fertilised grasslands contained more Se than on fertilised grasslands, and there was no significant difference in Se content between grasses and non-leguminous dicotyledons. On fertilised grasslands non-leguminous dicotyledons</p><p id="Pg273">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 274 contained more Se than leguminous plants and grass species. The desirable quantity of Se in bulk fodders is 0.05-2 mg kg-1. The grassland fodders proved to be neither deficient in Se, nor to reach the toxic level of 5 mg kg-1. Conclusions The botanical composition of natural grasslands was 70 % of grass species, and 30 % of leguminous species and other dicotyledons in a three years study. Highest accumulation rate of Na, Ca, Mg, P, Se and Cd was found in leguminous species in case of high fertility soils/sites. Other dycotiledonous species were also proved to contain higher concentration of these elements in comparison with grass species. From among the 3 heavy metals examined higher amounts of Cr and Pb were accumulated in grass species. As a consequence of that these pastures provide poor quality fodder only. Since these sheep pastures are located far away from industrial plants and high traffic roads, therefore soil of the site itself – in respect to the values of soil acidity and the high Cr values of toxicity range (Table 1.), and/or the mineral fertilizer, if applied (especially in case of Cd) can be the source of pollution.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 275 THE EFFECT OF EXTREME SOIL CONDITIONS ON YIELD AND UTILIZATION OF MEDICAGO SATIVA, MEDICAGO SATIVA VARIA AND BROMUS INERMIS IN HÁRSKÚT Walter WEIDEL – Ferenc PAJOR – Edina LÁCZÓ – Péter PÓTI Department of Cattle and Sheep Breeding, Szent István University, H-2103, Gödöllő, Páter Károly u. 1. e-mail: weidel@freemail.hu Abstract: The Medicago sativa planted clearly or mixed with Bromus inermis is suited to plant lea. It provides a square harvest, and it has a good drought-tolerance thanks to its deep roots. It bears treading and chewing very well, the livestock use it up without problems; its content indexes are favourable. Thanks to all these, the nutrition state of the livestock is around the optimal value during the pasturage season. In addition, the examined forages are suitable to make haylage and hay. Their values are approximately as good as the values of the Medicago sativa varia, although they never exceed them. It is not a negligible benefit from the aspects of economy, environmental protection and harvest safety that planting of M. sativa. – clearly or mixed with Bromus inermis - is for 10-15 years. Keywords: pasturage, haylage, goat, acid soil, shallow soil, Alfalfa Introduction We are hearing more and more about weather extremities from the news, and many of these phenomenon originate from the greenhouse effect caused by the pollution of the environment. (Barholy and Co., 2004; Németh, 2004; Várallyai, 2004). There are two strategies getting rid of the weather end values, which we can use at the ruminant breeds apropos of the animal keeping and mass-forage. Either of them is the mass forage farming fitted in the plough-land cultivation of plants, which requires water-getting up (underground-water diverting, flood-prevention). This causes contradictory situation in many occasions, because the diverted water could be sufficient in a drought period. In such a case water-saving tilling and the farming of drought-resistant genus’s which have a short breeding season and give large green quantity (eg. Sorghum sudanense) can have a favorable result as watering in such conditions is not economical. All this demands intensive farming, like nutrition supply and tilling (Gyuricza and Birkás, 2000; Birkás and Gyuricza, 2004, Birkás et.al. 2007). The adequate curing and storage of the produced mass-forage raise the safety and the profitability of the forage supply. Another opportunity in the mass-forage farming is based on the non-ploughland mass-forage. For instance the grass based, conventional lea-farming, the extension of the pasturage season, just as farming such species and breeds of plants which raise the harvest safety and the out-turn, are suitable for pasturage (Bedő and Póti, 1999, Tasi and Barcsák, 2001, Tasi, 2007). According to Szemán et.al. (2004). M. sativa and Bromus inermis are the most adopted plants for this purpose. For that very reason in the previous years (2004-2007) we have analysed the harvest safety and the livestock maintaining ability, in addition to the different pasturage methods’ effects on the lea-livestock relationship. Materials and methods We have analysed the application in goat-foraging of the clear-planted M. sativa, the mixed-planted M. sativa and Bromus inermis, and the Medicago sativa varia. Excluding M. sativa varia we also have analysed the pasturage possibility provided by the vegetation. The base of comparison has been provided by the primeval grass of the</p><p id="Pg275">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 276 given field. Harvest estimation and botanical consistence statement has been done on the allotted fields. We also have stated the possibility to make hay and haylage from the fodder plants of the analysed areas. The weendei analysis of various fodders has been defined: volotile fatty acid-, net energy-, and absorbable protein (MPE, MPN) content according to the operative Hungarian standard. We made soil surveys too, which showed the acidity of the surface soil, beside strong erosion. The various fields’ livestock maintaining ability, the milk content, the shape and the goatling nursing ability of the mother goats has been stated. The average soil composition is displayed in (table 1). Table 1.

There was no significant difference between the overgrazing of the clear planted and with the Bromus inermis mixed M. sativa and the primeval grass after the familiarization. The pasturing livestock overgrazed the closed parcels in accordance with the produce-yield proportional time period. There was not demonstrable deflection in the animals’ behaviour between the pasturing of the various vegetations. The impact of the favourable condition reveals itself at the increment indexes of the livestocks. (table 3.)</p><p id="Pg276">VII.

The animal stock which had pastured Bromus inermis mixed M. sativa had the most favourable separation litter gross, nearly equal outcome was indicated by the clear planted M. sativa. The same impact looked at the milk-production of the goats (table 4.) Table 4. Milk yield of the mother-goats kept in various way Not only the milk quantity was higher but also the lactation was more square. The various meadows did not take statistically justifiable deviation on the content of the milk. After trimming the clear planted and with the Bromus inermis mixed M. sativa dried nearly in the same measure, but in both case dried faster and more uniformly than the M. sativa varia. Thanks to its thinner branch the M. sativa transmitted the moisture faster, and the trussing was easier. The whirling deficit of the two lucerne breeds was almost the same.

NEl) By the comparison of the hays’ energy- and nutrient content is provable, that in the regard of protein (rawprotein, absorbable protein: MPN and MPE) M. sativa varia has given the best hay. The M. sativa hay contained 18% less, the M. sativa and Bromus inermis mixture hay contained 31% less raw protein than the M. sativa varia hay. The tendency was similar in the way of lactation net energy; M. sativa varia contained the most net energy. But we have to mention that the difference between them was minimal. The M. sativa hay’s and the M. sativa and Bromus inermis mixture hay’s raw fibre content exceeded the M. sativa varia hay’s raw fibre content. Between the raw fibre content of the M. sativa hay and the mixture hay was only a minimal deviation. We did not experience significant distinction between the fermentation of the two lucerne type (based on the samples of haylage net and absorbable protein content), but in the case of M. sativa the fermentation shifted in unfavourable way. Conclusions -The soil and weather extremities make reasonable to place emphasis on the formerly less analysed vegetable races and forage-utilization methods in the processing of the ruminants keeping and feeding technology. -The clear planted and with Bromus inermis mixed planted M. sativa is suited to plant lea, since the harvest’s uniformity, quality, just as availability as forage is better than the primeval grass’s.

Csaba GYURICZA 1 – László NAGY – Apolka UJJ 1 – Péter MIKÓ 1 – László ALEXA 2 1 Szent István University, Institute of Crop Production, H-2103 Gödöllő, email: gyuricza.csaba@mkk.szie.hu 2 Profikomp Ltd. Gödöllő Abstract: Cultivating woody energy crops on arable land opens up new possibilities for agriculture in Hungary. In Gödöllő, through experiments with different willow species, a technique adapted to cultivation site was elaborated. In our research, we examined the impact of various willow species and different forms of nutrients (compost, artificial fertilizer, and control without nutrient) on the development of plants as well as on soil condition characteristics. In the present study our results for heavy metal content are introduced based on measurements taken from the soil and the plants. Our research results indicate that the heavy metal content of plants is influenced by the form of the nutrient the soil was treated with; however, at the same time, for certain heavy metals our results varied. Nevertheless, results obtained for the dry substance were always below the critical pollution threshold limit. Keywords: compost, energy willow, heavy metal Introduction About half of the territory in Hungary, approx. 4.5 million hectares, is utilized for arable crop production. It is estimated that on several hundred thousand hectares the profitability of cultivating traditional crops cannot be guaranteed with current support systems (Barczi et al., 2006). These areas are often covered by water and are prone to flooding by inland water; furthermore they are sand or sandy loam, low cultivation site assessment grade soils with extreme water and nutrient management properties. Since these cultivation areas can often also be found in socially and economically disadvantaged regions, agriculture is going to play an essential role in the future. Thus, removing the land from cultivation or switching to other cultivation methods (e.g. from arable land to grassland or forest) cannot be considered as viable solutions (Dobó et al., 2006). Planting arboreal energy crop plantations can contribute to retention of the rural population and become a profitable agricultural sector in the future. Broadly speaking, all agricultural areas in Hungary can be utilized for cultivating fast-growing tree species (Gyuricza, 2007). As these tree species can generally tolerate unfavourable growing conditions, they can also be planted on fields prone to flooding by inland water and flood plains, where other crops cannot be grown. Certain plant species (e.g. salix species) can be safely cultivated on especially dry, drought-prone areas. About 60% of the arable land in Hungary is prone to erosion or deflation, so planting short-cuttingrotation plantations on these areas could provide excellent soil protection as the soil will be covered almost all year round (Farkas et al., 2005). In the case of woody energy crops – just like with other arable land cultures – great emphasis needs to be placed on nutrient supply. From this aspect, using composts derived from different types of waste can be especially beneficial as in addition to their ability to provide nutrients, they also reduce evaporation to a great extent as well as help overcome weeds due to the soil cover they provide. Numerous research projects study the heavy metal content of composts and their impact on food and fodder raw materials. The objective of the present study is to compare the use of composts to that of artificial</p><p id="Pg279">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 280 fertilizers and untreated soil (control) based on soil and plant heavy metal content measurement results. Materials and methods The woody energy plant experiment was set up in the Szent István University Demonstration Farm for Plant Cultivation on April 12, 2007. The area is situated in the Gödöllő Hills micro-region, 323 m above sea level. The climate is continental, thus extremities in weather are typical both in terms of precipitation and temperature. The average precipitation of many years is 550 mm, almost two thirds of which falls in the vegetation period (in a dry period less than half of it). The average temperature of many years is 9.1 C. The soil of the experimental plot is mostly rusty brown forest soil formed on sand according to the genetic soil classification system used in Hungary. As a result of degradation processes a slightly humic soil with medium surface soil has been formed. The area is in risk of erosion and is susceptible to compaction, a factor that is important from the point of view of cultivation. The nutrient supply of the soil is adequate, in those profiles that are not eroded the nitrogen and phosphorus content is average, potassium provision is good. Prior to the experiment, the land was cultivated using turning and without turning cultivation alternately while producing traditional arable crops (corn, winter wheat and winter barley). The experiment was carried out in two-factor random block arrangement repeated three times. Five different willow species or clones (Sven, Inger, Tordis, Tora, and Csala) were used. For each species three different nutrient supply levels were set: 1; surface cover with compost (50 t/ha), 2; nitrogen fertilizer applied in the spring (50 kg/ha), 3; control treatment with no added nutrient. The compost and the artificial fertilizer were transferred to the soil in the rows at the beginning of May. The technique applied was twin-row with 70 cm row width with 2.5 m between the twin rows in order to leave space for machinery. Cuttings were planted with a 40 cm stand distance. Cuttings were 25 cm long, one-year-old shoots without roots. Planting was done by hand in the middle of April. During the vegetation period chemical weed control was applied in the rows; while in between the rows mechanical weed control was carried out two times using rotary cultivator. No chemical control was needed to deal with pests and pathogens. During the vegetation period phenological measurements (plant height, number of lateral branching, shoot thickness and biomass weight) were taken and soil condition analysis (soil resistance; soil moisture, nutrient and heavy metal content) was carried out. In the present study the results for heavy metal content are introduced. To determine heavy metal content, samples were taken from plants as well as the soil for each treatment. Soil samples were collected from the top 10 cm of the soil. Heavy metal content was determined in the laboratory of KVI Plusz Ltd. Results were analyzed statistically applying one factor analysis of variance (Baráthné et al., 1996). Results and discussion The heavy metal content of soils suitable for agricultural production is continuously increasing due primarily to anthropogenic impacts. According to Cambell et al. (1983), because of this 15 times more cadmium, 13 times more copper, 21 times more zinc is deposited in the soil than would be through natural decay processes. Based on Ferguson (1990), the larger part of chromium, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium is transferred</p><p id="Pg280">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 281 into agricultural soils through the use of sewage sludge, compost, organic manure and artificial phosphate fertilizers. From the soil, heavy metals can easily enter into cultivated plants where they can be accumulated in toxic concentrations. From among the heavy metals occurring in soils and plants, in our study we concentrated on chromium, copper and nickel content. No significant differences were found in heavy metal content between the various willow species, so data were averaged, and as a result only the differences between the different nutrient supply levels were compared. The left-hand side graph in Figure 1. shows the cadmium content measured in soil and plant samples. From the point of view of environmental pollution, cadmium is the most dangerous element, not only for humans and animals but also for plants (Debreczeni and Sárdi, 1999). In the top layer of the soil, cadmium content did not exceed 0.2 mg.kg-1 measured in dry matter, which is not more than 20% of the pollution threshold limit. At the same time, the amount taken up by plants was 250-270% more than that measured in the soil, which, in the case of energy crops, does not pose food administration risk. According to data in the literature, in horticultural and arable crops, it does not exceed the 0.3 mg.kg-1 dry matter content. Chromium is fairly often found in the soil, most of it is absorbed in the top 10 cm layer. The right-hand side graph in Figure 1. shows the chromium content measures in soil and plant samples. Based on our experiment, in the case of the compost-treated soil chromium content was significantly larger than in the artificially fertilized or control plots. However, even this larger chromium content was far below the pollution threshold limit (75 mg.kg-1). In various plant parts, measured chromium concentration was exceptionally low. This indicates that the metal cannot easily be transferred to the shoots of the willow. Based on data in the literature, nearly 98% of the chromium taken up by plants is accumulated in the roots. Figure 1. Cadmium and chromium content in the soil and plant for different nutrient supply levels (Gödöllő, 2007) Copper is taken up by most plants only in very small quantities; however, it performs very important biochemical functions. It can be transferred to the soil in large quantities with sewage sludge, not properly treated organic manure as well as compost. The lefthand side graph of Figure 2. shows copper content measures in soil and plant samples. There are significant differences between the various treatments; however, even the highest amount shown for compost-treated plots is considerably below the pollution threshold limit (75 mg.kg-1). There was no statistically verifiable difference in the plant LSD5%= 0,13 mg.kg -1 soil LSD5%= ns plant LSD5%= ns soil LSD5%= 1,67 mg.kg -1</p><p id="Pg281">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 282 amount of copper taken up by plants. A similar tendency can be observed in the case of nickel; however, its take-up is much more difficult for plants (Köles et al., 1997). Figure 2. Copper and nickel content in the soil and plant for different nutrient supply levels (Gödöllő, 2007) Conclusions The cultivation of woody energy crops can induce both favourable and unfavourable environmental impacts. Under controlled circumstances, it can be an important utilization area for composts generated from various waste types. As the product is neither used for animal nor human consumption, it can only pose risks for the soil. Based on our experiments, transferring 50 t.ha-1 compost to the soil did not raise heavy metal concentration to harmful levels. If transferred to the soil every other year, significant change can be kept below soil pollution threshold levels. Based on our results, willow grown for energetic purposes can also be utilized for fitoremediation as it makes the up-take of considerable amounts of cadmium possible.

With the help of this, two pollution sources, green waste and sewage sludge can be neutralized and utilized in an environmentally friendly way. Our experiments were set up with winter wheat in small experimental plots in Gödöllő. The impact of different forms of nutrients on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the yield were examined as well as the impact of organic material based yield enhancing substances on the physical condition of the soil. In the present paper our results for the gluten and protein content of the wheat are presented as a function of the different forms of nutrients. As a result of our research it can be concluded that applying organic materials does not have a negative impact on the internal constituents of the plant. Keywords: compost, energy raw material, winter wheat Introduction As a result of lack of capital in agriculture in recent decades, the negative impacts of production and cultivation technologies can be detected on about 70% of arable land (Várallyay et al,. 2007). Besides harmful compaction, the majority of Hungarian soils are in risk of erosion or deflation (Barczi, 2005), and the structure of soils and their organic material balance have both become worse. Extreme weather conditions (extra precipitation and drought) also have unfavourable impacts, and, at the same time, bad soil condition makes climate-related economic damage worse (Gyuricza et al., 2006). Apart from the deterioration of the physical and biological condition of soils, an additional reason for production losses can be found in the decrease of their productivity. In certain regions, on soils with inappropriate plantations, these problems are aggravated. Improving the general condition of soils is desirable not only from the economic but also from the environmental aspect. As due to decrease in livestock numbers, there is less manure available, new materials and methods need to be found for the improvement of the raw material balance and through it the physical and biological condition of soils. Recycling the organic by-products generated at the production site as well as transferring the living or dead material of plants grown specifically for this purpose could be potentially important methods for improving soil condition. In parallel to the problem of soil degradation, the other most important environmental issue today is that of waste. For a long time, deposition in landfills appeared to be the cheapest and most appropriate solution for dealing with municipal waste. In contrast to this, in EU countries today legislation regulates the treatment and composting of waste types containing more than a few % of organic matter. (Alexa – Dér, 1999) At the same time, numerous waste types are generated in agriculture, the food industry and the communal sector that can be utilized in arable crop production for energy raw material production following their biological decomposition. Following a</p><p id="Pg283">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 284 microbiological process, the amount of organic material and heavy metals accumulated in sewage sludge can be decreased. In the thermophilic composting stage occurring as a result of the degradation of ligno-cellulose, those microorganisms that are harmful or pose environmental danger are destroyed. Thus, as waste materials are neutralized this way, the compost can be used to provide nutrients for plants. Materials and methods The energy raw material experiment was set up in Szent István University Demonstration Farm for Plant Cultivation in October 2006. The area is situated in the Gödöllő Hills micro-region, 323 m above sea level. The climate is continental, thus extremities in weather are typical both in terms of precipitation and temperature. The average precipitation of many years is 550 mm, almost two thirds of which falls in the vegetation period (in a dry period less than half of it). The average temperature of many years is 9.1 C. The soil of the experimental plot is mostly rusty brown forest soil formed on sand according to the genetic soil classification system used in Hungary. As a result of degradation processes a slightly humic soil with medium surface soil has been formed. The area is in risk of erosion and is susceptible to compaction, a factor that is important from the point of view of cultivation. The nutrient supply of the soil is adequate, in those profiles that are not eroded the nitrogen and phosphorus content is average, potassium provision is good. Prior to the experiment, the land was cultivated using turning and without turning cultivation alternately while producing traditional arable crops. 7 treatments were repeated 3 times during the experiment. The area of each plot was 40 m2. 2 different types of composts were used in the treatments. One of them had materials from communal waste (inoculated compost), the other was untreated (noninoculated) compost. Following the examination of the nutrient content of the soil, the experiment was set up with winter wheat (Buzogány) test plants. Numerous characteristics were examined for the following treatments: Treatment 1: (compost (inoculated) + mixed artificial fertilizer): 5 t/ha compost was transferred to the soil which was supplemented with 0.112 t/ha artificial fertilizer. Treatment 2: (compost (non-inoculated) + mixed artificial fertilizer): 5 t/ha compost was transferred to the soil which was supplemented with 0.115 t/ha artificial fertilizer. Treatment 3: (compost (inoculated) + a minimum dose of complex artificial fertilizer): 5 t/ha compost was transferred to the soil. It was supplemented with 0.1 t/ha artificial fertilizer. Treatment 4: (compost (non-inoculated) + mixed artificial fertilizer): 5 t/ha compost was transferred to the soil. It was supplemented with 0.1 t/ha artificial fertilizer. Treatment 5: (compost (inoculated): 10 t/ha compost was transferred to the soil. Treatment 6: (mixed artificial fertilizer): 0.38 t/ha mixed artificial fertilizer was transferred to the soil. Treatment 7: (minimum dose of complex artificial fertilizer): 0.1 t/ha artificial fertilizer was transferred to the soil. Gluten and protein content was examined using NIR analyser in laboratory conditions. Results were analyzed statistically applying one factor analysis of variance (Baráthné et al., 1996).</p><p id="Pg284">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 285 Results and discussion The primary objective of wheat production is to satisfy human nutrition needs. In Hungary, most of the wheat is grown for domestic food provision. Besides, a great amount of wheat is used for fodder (Antal et al., 2004). In both cases, it is essential to ensure adequate protein and gluten content. Following harvest in June and after laboratory tests were conducted, it was concluded that as for gluten content, there is no statistically verifiable difference between the various treatments applied (Figure 1). As it is shown in Figure 1, the results for gluten content in wheat from plots treated with compost containing organic matter from the decomposition of municipal waste (treatments 1 and 3) is well over 34%, which is classified as corrective quality A1 or A2 flour (Jolánkai, 2005). Figure 1. Gluten content of wheat in % for the different nutrient supply scenarios (Gödöllő, 2007) Treatment 7 is an exception, in which case only a minimum dose of complex artificial fertilizer was added as nutrient supply to the soil. Here gluten content did not even reach 27%, so the wheat harvested from this plot is only suitable for making fodder quality C flour (Jolánkai, 2005). The examination of protein content results leads to similar conclusions (Figure 2.). Figure 2. Protein content of wheat in % for different nutrient supply scenarios (Gödöllő, 2007)</p><p id="Pg285">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 286 The protein content of wheat from plots treated with compost containing organic residues from municipal waste (treatments 1 and 3) exceeds 16% just as well as that from plots where usual nutrient supply was applied. Treatment 7, where a minimum dose of complex artificial fertilizer was used, is again an exception. In this case, protein content is 11.7%, which means medium level quality grading (Jolánkai, 2005). Conclusions Utilizing composts in arable crop production is advantageous from the point of view of the environment as well as beneficial impacts on the soil. Through the use of the decomposed organic matter from communal waste, it could also be an important step in terms of environmental protection. Based on our experiments, utilizing composts treated with this technology for nutrient supply does not have any negative impacts on the gluten and protein content of wheat. Thus, it could be applied instead of other nutrient supply methods. As the ultimate aim is using wheat for human or animal nutrition, further research is needed to examine the heavy metal content of soil and plant.

In recent years the trade demands for partly substitutional drug (dried capitulums) of considerably easier cultivated American arnica, A. chamissonis has been greatly enlarged. The research objective is to determine agronomic traits of A. chamissonis in two pedo-climatically different regions of Croatia (hilly-mountainous and continental), along with growing from transplants produced by two different methods (pricking, without pricking). Sowing into polystyrene 209-cell trays was done on April 21, pricking into 40-cell trays on June 14, and planting in the open on July 20, 2005 (6 planting places·m -2 ). Flower-head harvests and morphological analyses were carried out three times in 2006 (June 8 and 20, July 5). It was found that A. chamissonis could not be grown in the continental region without irrigation. In the hilly-mountainous region, fresh flower-heads yield (121.8 g·m -2 ), number of runners (44.5 per planting place), root length (32.9 cm), herbage and root mass (66.6 and 88.2 g per planting place, respectively) were significantly higher in plants grown from pricked out transplants. Outputs of dry flower heads, herbage and roots were equal in both treatments (on average 20.8, 28.1 and 31.4 %, respectively). Further investigations of fertilization should be undertaken. Keywords: transplants cultivation method, pricking, morphological characteristics, yield components Introduction Medicinal plant species Arnica montana L. (family Asteraceae) is an indigenous European species, whose flowers, herbage and roots contain active ingredients with anti-inflammatory and analgesic action. As degradation of natural habitats has greatly declined its natural population, many European countries have banned its collecting from wild. Its cultivation on arable areas is still uneconomical due to its slow initial growth and lack of adequate growing areas (soils too rich in nutrients; excessively high pH). For these reasons, there has recently been an increase in market demand for the drug (dry capitulums) of American arnica (Arnica chamissonis Less.), which is regarded as a substitute species for A. montana (Cassels et al., 1999). American arnica is a perennial herbaceous plant originating from North America, which grows wild at altitude of 820 to 3500 m (Barkley, 1993; Klinkenberg, 2004). It tolerates absolute minimum temperatures to -35oC, and requires at least 90 frostless days a year. According to Anonymous (2006), it grows best on soils with pH from 6 to 7.2. It is adapted to soils of coarse to medium texture, exhibits high tolerance of anaerobic conditions and low drought tolerance, and has high moisture requirements. It needs 350 to 600 mm of precipitation in the growing period. Similar ecological conditions exist in Croatia, but the high degree of climate variability is one of the highest risk factors of the open-field production (Nagy, 2007). Frequent alterations of extreme drought or flush rainfalls are present in recent years, with significant influence on soil water storage (Stekauerova and Nagy, 2007). Successful production depends not only on the soil water content, but also on the characteristics of soil and field crop (Tall, 2007). Favourable soil conditions enable crops to utilize the winter rainfalls stored in the soil, even in the drought conditions during the vegetation period (Hunyadi Borbéli et al.,</p><p id="Pg287">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 288 2007). Recent literature abounds in data on the chemistry of A. chamissonis but only few studies explore the technology of its cultivation. Recommended plant density varies from 17,500 (Anonymous, 2006) to 44,000 plants·ha-1 (Davis and Cox 2004). Roki et al. (2001) state that fertilization with N, P and K improves fresh flower yields for 3.9 to 26.3%, and high flavonoid yields can be obtained by fertilization with 50 kg/ha each of N, P and K. Davis and Cox (2004) obtained a significantly higher fresh inflorescence yield by growing on bare soil (299.5 g·m-2), as compared with black and white polyethylene mulches (164.7 and 188.5 g·m-2, respectively). The goal of this research was to identify the agronomic traits of A. chamissonis grown in two pedo-climatically different regions (hilly-mountainous and continental) for the purpose of selecting a region favourable for its introduction into agricultural production in Croatia. Another objective was to determine the influence of the transplant production method (pricking out, without pricking) upon its morphological, biological and agronomic traits. Materials and methods Monofactorial field trials were set up in 2005 on the experimental field at Stara Susica (hilly-mountainous region, altitude 790 m) and Zagreb (continental region, altitude 128 m) according to the randomised block scheme with four replications. Major indicators of soil chemical status are given in Table 1, while main meteorological factors are shown in Figure 1. Table 1.

Seeds were sown on April 21, 2005 into polystyrene 209-cell trays, filled with the</p><p id="Pg288">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 289 Klasmann potgrond H substrate. Three to 5 seeds per cell were sown in order to obtain 2–3 plants per planting place. Seedlings emerged on May 2 (50%), were pricked out on June 14 into 40-cell trays, and were planted in the open field on July 20, 2005. Planting spacing was 1.1 m × 0.15 m (6 planting places·m-2, with 1-3 plants each); the inter-row spacing was determined in dependence on the available cultivation-machine; the plot size was 5.5 m2. Crops were grown without irrigation, fertilization and plant protection agents. If necessary, weeds were controlled by inter-row cultivation or by manual weeding. Morphological and agronomic traits analysed are shown in Table 2. Flower heads were picked manually at the full blooming stage in both treatments (June 20 and July 5), when the number and fresh yield of flower heads were determined, while dry capitulums output and yield were assessed upon drying under the ambient conditions of a polyethylene greenhouse. Chemical composition analysis is still under process. Results and discussion The continental region (Zagreb) is not favourable for A. chamissonis growing without irrigation. Insufficient winter precipitation that did not provide enough soil moisture, extreme spring drought with precipitation below the biological minimum for A. chamissonis, high evapotranspiration caused by high soil and air temperatures along with unavailability of nutrients are the reasons for unavoidable depression of plant development and failure of flowering. Since it was impossible to analyse the crop from this location according to schedule, only the results of the trial set up in the hillymountain region (Stara Susica) are presented here (Table 2).

On the other hand, the length of the largest leaf and root did not change much during the observing period, which means that they had reached their maximum prior to the onset of flowering. The number of flower heads per planting place in pricked plants (9.7) was significantly higher (p0.01%) even at the first observation date on June 8 (non-pricked 3.1). Pricked plants surpassed non-pricked plants not only in morphological characteristics but they also started flowering earlier</p><p id="Pg289">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 290 (around June 1). They reached full flowering stadium around June 20, while anthesis of non-pricked plants occurred 15 days later. Outputs of dry flower heads, herbage (without inflorescences) and roots were approximately equal in both trial treatments (on average 20.8, 28.1 and 31.4 %, respectively). Dry flower-head output was slightly higher compared to that reported in the year 2004 by Davis and Cox (17.3 to 18 %), which may be due to the plant species genotype, but also to no application of irrigation. The total number and mass of flower heads per planting place as well as yields of fresh and dry flower heads from two harvests were twice higher in pricked plants. Yields on bare soil reported by Davis and Cox (2004) are twice higher compared to total yield obtained from pricked plants in this trial. This may be due to several reasons: crop age, genotype, omission of fertilisation and irrigation, pedo-climatic conditions. Conclusions Owing to good pedo-climatic conditions, the hilly-mountainous region of Croatia is favourable for A. chamissonis cultivation, whereas it cannot be grown without irrigation in the continental region. Pricking of transplants prior to planting in the open has multiple positive effects upon the biological, morphological and agronomic traits of plants. Compared to non-pricked plants, plants grown from pricked transplants flower and reach harvest maturity two weeks earlier, give a two times higher number and yield of fresh and dry flower heads, have a larger number of runners, stalks and roots, longer stalks and roots, and larger fresh and dry herbage and root mass. On the contrary, transplant pricking has no significant effect upon the output of particular plant parts and on the rosette leaf size. Further investigations of fertilization should be undertaken.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 291 EVALUATION OF SWEET POTATO GROWING IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS OF CROATIA Bruno NOVAK – Ivanka ZUTIC – Nina TOTH – Bozidar BENKO – Sanja FABEK Vegetable Crops Department, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: bnovak@agr.hr Abstract: Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), a vegetable species of high nutritional value, is being introduced into the agricultural production of Croatia. Research was done in 2005 in Mediterranean (Porec) and continental regions (Varazdin, Zagreb) with the aim to assess the influence of plant density (3.3 and 2 plants·m -2 ) and cultivar ('Bat-1' and 'Boniato') on yield components of roots intended for the green market. Field trials were set up according to the randomized block scheme with 6 replications. Approximately equal marketable yields were obtained in both climate regions, but the period of marketable roots formation was a month shorter in the Mediterranean region. While the total number of roots per plant (5.2 to 6.2) was about the same, the orange-flesh cultivar 'Bat-1' gave a significantly higher marketable yield on all locations (3.31 to 3.40 kg·m -2 ) compared to the white-flesh cultivar 'Boniato' (2.27 to 2.70 kg·m -2 ). Significantly higher marketable yield (3.53 to 3.70 kg·m -2 ) was obtained at higher plant density compared to lower density (2.1 to 2.4 kg·m -2 ), with about equal, to fresh market acceptable, average root mass (294 to 377 g). In the continental region, the amount of unmarketable roots may depend on the attack of pests such as mice. Keywords: climate region, cultivar, plant density, root yield components Introduction Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is a perennial tropical plant species of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae), which is grown for its thick tuberous roots of high nutritional value and medicinal properties, and also for its young leaves. Since the optimal sweet potato culture requires at least 90 days with minimum air temperatures above 15 C, the recent global warming has allowed its cultivation to spread into temperate climate regions, where it is grown as an annual plant. Croatia possesses sweet potato production potentials on fairly large agricultural areas in different climate regions (Mediterranean, continental). But, certain meteorological indicators have been lately assuming extreme characteristics, significantly deviating from the long-term mean. Thus, precipitation can vary from abundant showers to long droughty periods, whereby it can, in dependence on soil type, more or less significantly affect soil water supplies (Stekauerova and Nagy, 2007; Hunyadi Borbéli et al., 2007). Successful production depends not only on the soil water content, but also on the characteristics of soil and field crop (Tall, 2007). Sweet potato is a drought-tolerant crop, but extremes in soil water availability may be reflected on yields (Thompson et al., 2002). In continental Croatia, multiple positive effect was recorded of soil mulching with black polyethylene film upon yield and average mass of sweet potato roots compared to cultivation on bare soil (Novak et al., 2007). Statistically the same root yields can be obtained without and with N-P-K (50-100-100) fertilizer (Main et al., 2003). On the contrary, according to Tsuno (1970), the yield indices for no fertilizer, no N, no P and no K applied, are 60, 84, 90 and 74, respectively, against 100 for the NPK treatment, showing that K nutrient exerts the greatest influence on yield. On fertile soil, the application of little N with much K is desirable. The peak in nutrient absorption occurs after the air temperature reaches 25 ºC. Sweet potato is mainly grown from transplants, produced in heated greenhouses, by rooting of separated root sprouts. Costs of transplants production are a significant item in sweet potato production, especially in case of higher plant density common in manual</p><p id="Pg291">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 292 planting (2.9 to 4.8 plants·m-2). Such density renders root masses of 150 to 300 g, which pursuant to standards are suitable for fresh consumption. On the other hand, on large production areas sweet potato is usually grown at standardized spacings of 1.2 m × 0.3 - 0.5 m, which enable use of mulch-film laying and planting machines, and give a plant density of 1.7 to 2.8 plants·m-2. The said spacings, however, favour formation of higher mass roots, which are usually intended for industrial processing (Burdine et al., 2002). The purpose of this research is the introduction of sweet potato into agricultural production in climatically different parts of Croatia. The goal is to assess the influence of cultivar, along with plant density, achievable by using standard planting machinery for vegetable crops, upon yield components of thick sweet potato roots intended for the green market. Materials and methods The field trial was set up in 2005 on three locations situated in two pedo-climatically different regions: Mediterranean (Porec) and continental (Varazdin, Zagreb). Trial soil types are: terra rossa in Porec, alluvial soil in Varazdin, and cambisol luvic in Zagreb. Major indicators of soil chemical status are given in Table 1. Soils of all locations are sufficiently humous, well supplied with nitrogen and potassium, and medium to well supplied with phosphorus. Fertilization with 20, 80 and 120 kg·ha-1 N, P2O5 and K2O was applied on all locations, and soil was mulched with black polyethylene film. Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 293 mechanized planting: 3.3 plants·m-2 (1 m × 0.3 m) and 2 plants·m-2 (1 m × 0.5 m). Transplants of both cultivars with a root lump were grown from root sprouts, in heated greenhouse, at a temperature of 25oC and 85 % relative air humidity. They were planted by a tractor-drawn two-row planter for vegetable transplants on May 20 in Varazdin, May 25 in Zagreb, and not until June 6 in Porec because of adverse weather conditions (unusually low temperatures and abundant rainfall in May). Crops were not irrigated (except immediately after planting, 0.3 l per plant) and no pesticides were applied. Weeds were eradicated manually only before plant density was established. Harvest was done using a balance plough and roots were hand-collected (Porec on September 27, Varazdin on October 11, Zagreb on October 14). The number and mass of marketable and unmarketable roots per plant were determined at harvest and average root mass and marketable yield were calculated. Damaged roots (mainly bitten by mice or slugs) and roots with mass below 100 g were regarded as unmarketable. F-test was used for statistical data analysis. Results and discussion Thick roots of sweet potato were harvested 16 weeks after planting in Porec, and after 20 weeks in Varazdin and Zagreb. Larger total number of roots per plant (marketable + unmarketable) was formed on locations in the continental region (Varazdin 6.1, Zagreb 6.5) than in the littoral part (Porec 4.5); significant differences between cultivars were recorded only at the location Varaždin. The highest percentage of unmarketable roots in the total number of roots per plant was also recorded in the continental region (Zagreb 48%, Varazdin 36%), while it was below 30% in Porec. This is attributed to the attack of mice, a great problem of the production in this region. Table 2.

For the</p><p id="Pg293">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 294 same reasons, the higher yielding potential of 'Bat-1' was not manifested, and was observed only in the littoral region. Plant density generally had no significant effect on the properties discussed to this point (Table 2). Marketable root yield was approximately equal on all locations, but it was significantly higher in 'Bat-1' (3.31 to 3.40 kg·m-2) compared to 'Boniato' (2.27 to 2.84 kg·m-2). Plant density had a significant effect on marketable yield on all locations as well, and it was significantly higher at higher density (3.53 do 3.98 kg·m-2) compared to lower density (2.10 do 2.40 kg·m-2). The obtained yields are in agreement with literature data (Workatyehu, 2002; Hartemink, 2003; Main et al., 2003; Saiful et al., 2006; Novak et al., 2001 and 2007). Conclusions Croatia possesses high sweet potato production potentials in climatically different regions. Approximately equal marketable yields can be obtained in continental and Mediterranean regions, while the period required for formation of roots intended for the green market (root mass &lt;350 g) is one month shorter in the littoral region. With about equal total number of roots per plant, the orange-flesh cultivar 'Bat-1' produced a significantly higher marketable yield on all locations. Significantly higher marketable yield was obtained at higher plant density (3.3 plants·m-2), with approximately equal average root mass acceptable to the green market. In the continental region, sweet potato roots may be damaged by mice, whose intensive attack is expected before the harvest. Percentage of unmarketable roots depends on the intensity of that attack.

Drought reduced significantly the leaf mass increment of Quercus petraea in the dry year (2003). SLM was lower in 2003 than in 2004. Chlorophyll content showed inter-annual and within-canopy variability. As indicated by the low values of the Fv/Fm chlorophyll fluorescence parameter the photosynthetic apparatus exhibited high susceptibility to abiotic stress factors in early spring. Carotenoid content and VAZ cycle pool per chlorophyll basis was 1,5-2 times larger in spring than in summer. In summer of 2003 VAZ pool was larger especially in sun leaves than in 2004. Values of Fv/Fm were lower in 2004 than 2003 which indicated lasting drought effects on the photochemical activity of leaves of sessile oak. Keywords: Quercus petraea, chlorophyll fluorescence, drought, carotenoids, specific leaf weight Introduction Numerous current scenarios on future climate change in Central Europe predict elevated temperatures and simultaneous reduction of rainfall in growing seasons which will increase the frequency and duration of summer drought (IPCC, 2001). Climatic change and prolonged summer drought stress have been suggested as major contributing factors to the decline of central European forests in recent decades (Jakucs et al., 1986, Mészáros et al., 1993). Severe summer drought such as that which occurred in 2003 may have long-term consequences for the forest condition by making the trees susceptible to other abiotic and biotic stresses appearing simultaneously or in subsequent growing seasons (Rennenberg at al., 2006). The climate projections for Hungary predict a reduction in the total area of natural climate-zonal forests and a gradual shift of transition between forest-steppe and forest zones (Mátyás, Czimber, 2004). Drought and the co-occurring heat stress influence directly and indirectly the main plant metabolic processes, photosynthesis and respiration (Balla et al., 2006) that are the basis of tree and forest productivity (Flexas et al., 2004; Mészáros et al., 2001). Reduced soil water availabilty are also shown to stongly affect the water relations and nutrient uptake of trees (Gessler et al., 2004; Mészáros et al., 1993). Tree species show a wide range of physiological adaptations to drought including the protective mechanisms of photosynthetic apparatus, accumulation of different compatible solutes and antioxidant systems which vary greatly among the species and ecotypes (Mészáros, 1984; Demmig-Adams, Adams, 1992). The aim of this study was to characterize the physiological responses of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) to drought by monitoring the changes in the quantum yield of PSII and photosynthetic pigment in the canopy of adult trees in two subsequent dry (2003) and humid year (2004).</p><p id="Pg295">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 296 Materials and methods The investigations were performed in the Sikfőkút Research site established in 1972 in the Bükk Mountains, North Hungarian Central Range at 320-340 m A.s.l. and is covered by a 85-90 year-old stand of sessile oak-turkey oak forest community (Jakucs et al., 1986; Mészáros et al., 1981). The mean annual temperature of the site (50 years) is 9.9oC and the annual precipitation is 601 mm. The bedrock is miocenic pebble and the soil is deep brown forest soil. Climatic factors were monitored by means of automatic sensors with dataloggers (Onset Co., USA) at the top of a tower above the tree canopy. Gaussen-Bagnouls’ xerotherm index calculated on the basis of monthly rainfall and temperature reflected serious drought (0.21-0.78) during the whole growing season in 2003 with the exception of July (2.3) due short heavy rains. However, in growing season of 2004 the values ranged between 1,1-2.3. Field measurements and leaf samplings were performed from the canopy of four trees growing close to the meteorological tower. Leaf area was measured by an AreaScope leaf area meter, leaf dry mass was measured after drying at 85oC. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm was measured with a PAM 2000 fluorometer (WALZ, Germany) after 1 h dark acclimation. Photosynthetic pigments were measured in 80 % acetone extract. Carotenoids was measured by reversed phase HPLC method (UV/VIS HPLC, Jasco, Japan). Results and discussion Concerning the same stage of leaf area development (&lt; 30 %, and 100 %) in the two years, the persisting drought in 2003 resulted in a large reduction of leaf mass in both canopy layers of Q. petraea (Table 1).

Chlorophyll content per dry mass was smaller in sun leaves than in shade leaves and increased from spring until summer in both canopy layers. Fully developed leaves of sessile oak in summer contained higher concentrations of chlorophylls and carotenoids per dry mass in both canopy layers in 2003 than in 2004. Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 298 late growing seasons appeared to be closely correlated with the changes in the total content of pigments taking place in the photoprotective VAZ cycle pool (Violaxanthin, Antheraxanthin, Zeaxanthin). Protection against excess light of young leaves can be achieved by down-regulation of PSII activity which takes place partly through the xynthophyll cycle ((Demmig – Adams; Adams, 1992). Young leaves of both species accumulated VAZ cycle pigments (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin) by 1,5-2,5 times higher than fully developed leaves. Our results show that sun leaves were always characterized by more depressed Fv/Fm and larger VAZ cycle pool than shade leaves during the whole growing season of both years.Unexpectedly leaves showed larger impairment of maximal photochemical efficiency and lower Fv/Fm in the wetter year (2004) than in 2003. This indicated lasting drought effects on the photochemical activity of leaves of sessile oak in the investigated site which contributed to the weakened vitality and increased susceptibility to phytophagous insects in the subsequent year.

Saplings showed the highest chlorophyll content per dry mass, and the smallest specific leaf weight and carotenoid pool in the forest understory. Chl a/b increased with increasing growth irradiance. Photosynthesis rate (Pn) was low in the forest understory and increased in the forest edge and clear-cut area. During the period of light saturation of photosynthesis around midday the depression of potential photochemical efficiency Fv/Fm (10 %) appeared in the latter habitats but the decline of Fv/Fm was more rapidly reversible in the forest edge than in the forest area. Light responses of the actual photochemical efficiency (F/Fm’) of saplings were different in the three habitats. F/Fm’ declined with the light intensity at smaller extent in the forest edge and clear-cut area than in the forest interior. Keywords: beech, chlorophyll fluorescence, clear-cutting, SLM Introduction From both ecological and economic aspects, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is an important climax forest tree species of temperate regions in Europe. Beech covers a significant part of mountainous areas where it can be found in clear or mixed forests with other deciduous or coniferous species. In closed forests, beech regenerates properly in the understory, and shows a typical shade tolerant character (Kozlowski et al., 1991). Canopy openings by thinning or clear-cutting of mature beech forests induce severe abiotic stress conditions (Mészáros – Miklánek, 2006) for the previous understory vegetation and the regeneration process of beech seedlings. For the survival in the stressful environment, light tolerance of beech seedlings is an important element of post-harvest succession, and determines the rate of forest regeneration (Küppers and Schneiders, 1993; Mészáros, 1990). The capacity of the photosynthetic apparatus for acclimation to high-light conditions, as well as the change of shade-adapted physiology to a sun-adapted one are crucial factors in this process (Björkman – Demmig – Adams, 1994). In this work we studied the physiological plasticity and behaviour of saplings of beech regenerating under contrasting light conditions. The investigations were performed along a forest understory/forest edge/clear-cut area transect. These results are expected to constitute an ecophysiological basis for the explanation of the survival potential, as well as for the performance of beech seedlings after canopy openings and during natural forest regeneration. Materials and methods The study site is located in Bükk Mountains (Rejtek Research Site, NE Hungary) at 550 m above the sea level (Mészáros, 1990). Until 1981 the site was covered by an 80-year-</p><p id="Pg299">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 300 old mature beech forest stand. In 1981 a part of the forest was clear-cut. Three experimental plots were established in the forest interior, in the clear-cut area and in the transitional forest edge. In each plot 5 saplings of beech were selected for the study. Field measurements and samplings were performed in July 1999. Chlorophylls and total carotenoid content were determined in 80% acetone extracts according to Wellburn (1984). CO2 assimilation rate was estimated by LCA2 infrared gas analyser (ADC, UK). Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (in dark adapted leaves: Fv/Fm, in light adapted leaves: ΔF/Fm’=(Fm’-Ft)/Fm’; NPQ=(Fm-Fm’)/Fm’) were assessed in the attached leaves using a PAM 2000 fluorometer (WALZ, Germany). Results and discussion In the three habitats beech saplings showed clear differences in the leaf growth parameters. Parallel to increasing light intensity leaf area decreased from 16±0.85 cm2 and the leaf mass increased from 0.052±0.003 g measured in the forest interior to 11±0.75 cm2 and 0.094±0.009 g in the clear-cut area. The specific leaf mass (SLM) was low (0.33 g dm-2) in the forest understory and showed 20% increase in the forest edge and 100% increase in the clear-cut area. Concentrations and ratios of photosynthetic pigments showed clear differences in the contrasting light environments of the forest understory, forest edge and clear-cut area. The leaves of beech seedlings contained the highest chlorophyll concentrations on dry leaf weight basis in the forest understory (Table 1). The chlorophyll content decreased with 30% in the forest edge, and with 70% in the clear-cut area. Chl a/b ratio was the lowest in the forest interior. Clear lightinduced increase of chl a/b was found in the forest edge and clear-cut area, as compared to the forest interior. Similar plastic responses to the environmental conditions were recorded for beech seedlings of diverse climatic origins (García-Plazaola, Berrecil, 2000). Significant increases were observed in the carotenoid pool on chlorophyll (a+b) basis in the clear-cut area as compared to forest interior. Table 1.

As compared to the low light grown seedlings, there were 3 and 5 times larger photosynthesis rates in the forest edge and clear-cut area, respectively. Similarly to other late successional tree species (Bassow and Bazzaz 1998), saplings of beech showed relatively low CO2-assimilation rate even under high-light conditions in the clear-cut area and never reached the values measured in the leaves of early successional species e.g. Rubus s. (data not shown). The potential photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) exhibited midday depression (10 %) in the clear-cut area and forest</p><p id="Pg300">VII.

The recovery of Fv/Fm was complete in the forest edge as early as by the evening, but it took place partially in the clear-cut area during the measurement period. These changes reflect the ability of beech saplings for short-term acclimation to the fluctuating irradiance and light stress. The transient down-regulation of PSII allows the electron transport capacity and CO2-assimilation rate of beech leaves to be finely counterbalanced, when the light is excessive. Moreover, when down-regulation of PSII occurs, the possibility of photodamage to the leaves of high light seedlings is significantly reduced. In the down-regulation of photochemical efficiency of PSII, the xanthophyll cycle pool plays a crucial role contributing to thermal de-excitation of PSII centres (Björkman and Demmig-Adams 1994). Figure 1. Diurnal change in photosynthesis rate (Pn) and potential photochemical activity (Fv/Fm) of leaves in the three habitats In a previous study it was shown that beech saplings regenerating in clear-cut area had large xanthophyll cycle pool and the degree of transiently reduced PSII efficiency showed correlation to the extent of violaxanthin deep oxidation and the accumulation of zeaxanthin (Mészáros et al. 1995). Light responses of the actual photochemical efficiency (F/Fm’) of seedlings were different in the three habitats. F/Fm’ declined with the light intensity at smaller extent in the forest edge and clear-cut area than in the forest interior. In the leaves of shade-adapted saplings of the forest interior, the actual Figure 2.

This reflected a severe extent of PSII over-reduction for these saplings. This phenomenon was not found for seedlings in the forest edge and clear-cut area. The non-photochemical quenching parameter (NPQ) indicating the capacity for photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus increased with the actinic light intensity for every group of saplings. At lower light intensity, it was much more enhanced in shade-grown beech saplings, but at high actinic light the NPQ was 20% larger for saplings grown in clear-cut area indicating larger capacity for non-radiative dissipation. It also corresponds to the larger VAZ pool and the capacity for accumulating zeaxanthin in these saplings (Mészáros et al 1995).

In the present study we investigated the responses of sessile oak seedlings grown from seeds to supplementary UV-B radiation and water stress. Seedlings of sessile oak showed rapidly developing susceptibility to the enhanced UV-B radiation which appeared in lowering the chlorophyll content and potential photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (F/Fm’). UV-B radiation caused slight changes in leaf water relations. Water withdrawal from the plants resulted in very low leaf water content and water potential. When plants were simultaneously exposed to UV-B and water stress leaf water relations of seedlings were improved and increase in flavonoid accumulation was observed. However, values of Fv/Fm, F/Fm’ and RFD were the lowest in these plants as compared to control and those exposed to separately to enhanced UV-B or water withdrawal. Both UV-B radiation and water stress increased non-photochemical quenching with a parallel enhancement of zeaxanthin formation. Keywords: UV-B radiation, water stress, sessile oak, chlorophyll fluorescence, water potential, flavonoids Introduction Increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation due to depletion of stratospheric ozone, is an increasing potential damaging factor to vegation (Caldwell et al., 1995). UV-B radiation is an important stress factor for plants which may result in damage to the genetic system and cell membranes, and affect several metabolic processes (Björn, 1996; Láposi - Mészáros, 2005). The ecological consequences of the increase in UV-B radiation are also important as UV-B-induced alterations in plant physiology and morphology determine the growth and competitive ability of plants, with a resultant impact on the composition of plant communities (Hunt - McNeil, 1999). Plants under enhanced UV-B radiation often display low photosynthetic rates due to the decrease in Rubisco activity and the impairment of functions of photosystems especially PSII (Bornman, 1989,Urban et al., 2006). In the field, plants exposed to the whole spectrum of solar radiation often experience photoinhibition and photodamage to the photosynthetic apparatus induced by visible light (Eskling et al., 1997; Láposi et al., 2002; Mészáros et al., 2005) which may be accelerated under stress conditions including the enhanced UV-B radiation. In many habitats water shortage is the main limiting factor of plant productivity which has come into the focus of research as a consequence of global climate change (Farkas et al., 2005; Tesar et al., 2007). The long-lived trees are likely endangered by the environmental changes at much higher degree than annual crops and other herbaceous plants because the effects may accumulate and even small changes in the environment factors will have detrimental influence over the life time of trees (Mátyás, 1994). In this work we studied the separate</p><p id="Pg303">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Materials and methods One year old seedlings were grown from seeds in phytotronic chamber supplied with white light of 300 mol m-2 s-1 in 14/10 hours light/dar periods, temperature of 20/18oC. Supplementary UV-B radiation of 150 W cm-2 was supplied by fluorescence tubes (UV-B 313, Q-Panel, Cleveland, OH) for 8 hours centered into the middle of the 14 hour light period. The tubes were wrapped with 0.1mm cellulose acetate film (Courtaulds, Chemicals, Derby, UK). The experiments were performed for 6 weeks. One set of seedlings were grown under the chamber light and temperature conditions and were well-watered (control plants), the second set of seedlings were exposed to UVB radiation (UV-B+), the third set of seedlings was exposed to water stress by withdrawal of water (W-) , and the fourth group was exposed simultaneously to UVB and water stress (UVB+, W-). Chlorophyll florescence parameters (Fv/Fm, F/Fm’), RFD, NPQ) were measured by means of PAM 2000 fluorometer (WALZ, Germany). Chlorophylls were measured in 80 % ecetonic extract after Wellburn (1994) Xanthopyll cycle pigments were mesasured by reverse phase HPLC method (JASCO UV/VIS, Japan). Leaf water content was calculated after drying samples at 85oC, leaf water potential was determined by HR33T dew point microvoltmeter (Wescor, USA) using leaf disc chamber. Mesophyllum succulence index was calculated as the ratio of water content to total chlorophyll content (g H2O mg -1 chl (a+b)). Results and discussion Neither supplementory UV-B nor water withdrawal influenced the specific leaf mass and flavonoid accumulation significantly (Fig. 1). It points to different reaction of plants from those grown in natural environmental conditions which generally respond to both factors with elevated flavonoid content and increase of SLM (Láposi – Mészáros, 2005). Figure 1. Leaf flavonoid content expressed as absorbance of leaf methanolic extract measured at 300 nm per unit leaf area and specific leaf mass of oak seedlings under UV-B and water stress treatments Exposure of sessile oak seedlings to UV-B for six weeks reduced the total chlorophyll content (from 4,8 to 3,2 mg g-1 per dry mass) but water stress induced only a slight reduction of total chlorophylls (Mészáros et al., 2001).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 305 relatively stable under the UVB treatment the decrease of chlorophylls can be described as direct damages by UV-B to photosynthesizing pigments and/or enzymes involved in their synthesis under the experimental conditions (Strid – Porra, 1992). Supplementary UV-B had very slight effect on leaf water relations (Fig. 2) as compared to the water withdrawal causing a 50 % reduction in water content and Sm and a 250 % decrease of leaf water potential. When plants experienced both UVB exposure and water stress, UV-B did not aggravate these changes, even it moderated the dehydration of leaf tissues. UV-B treatment reduced the Fv/Fm values of dark adapted leaves by 20 % as compared to the control seedlings (Fig. 2). Under UV-B the actual photochemical efficiency (F/Fm’) of light aclimated leaves exhibited larger (40%) decrease and RFD reached also lower values (by 20 %) than in control plants. As compared to UV-B exposure, the decraeas of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters F/Fm’ and RFD became more severe when seedlings were subjected to water stress. Fv/Fm was influenced similarly under water withdrawal as under UV-B exposure. Simultaneous UV-B exposure and water stress resulted in further reduction in all fluorescence parameters, but those measured in light acclimated leaves were reduced at larger extent. Both UV-B radiation and water stress induced 50-70 % increase of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ). Figure 1. Relative values of parameters of leaf water relations and chlorophyll fluorecence and dep-epoxidation index under enhanced UV-B radiation (UVB+) and water stress (W-) and their combination (UVB+, W-) When seedlings were exposed to simultaneous UV-B and water withdrawal the increase of NPQ was low as compared to the control which is an unexpected result and points to the appearance of other photoprotective processes. The saturation in de-epoxidation state (DEEPS) of photoprotective xanthophyll cycle also indicated the former processes when plants were exposed jointly to enhanced UV-B and water stress. DEEPS index shows the relative proportion of de-epoxi-xanthophylls (zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin) formed from violaxanthin to the total violaxanthin cycle pool (Demmig-Adams, Adams, 1992) and may reflect the down-regulation of PSII and partly the appearance of nonphotochemical quenching. Under enhanced UV-B and water stress DEEPS changed in positive correlation with NPQ. However, when UV-B radiation and water withdrawal were simultaneously applied there were no further increase in DEEPS rather it remained close to the value experienced under water stress.

Cereal Research Communications 306 Conclusions Comparing the changes in leaf physiological traits it can be stated that seedlings of sessile oak showed relatively high and rapidly developing susceptibility to the enhanced UV-B radiation and water stress. Although the leaf water relations were also seriously impacted by water stress, in plants exposed simultaneously to UV-B the changes of water content and water potential were somewhat slighter. Alteration in leaf structure and composition induced by UV-B might help in preventing the dehydration of leaves if seedlings and moderate the effects of water stress on physiological processes.

Valuable differences between the soil water content values were found at some locations. Our results indicate that characterisation of the soil water regime at sub-regional scale operating with spatially mean values of soil hydraulic properties can lead to avoiding the effects of extreme water regime situations. Keywords: soil water retention curve, soil hydraulic conductivity function, floodplain area, spatial variability, soil water regime, simulation modelling Introduction Transport processes occurring in the soil-plant system play important role in water and energy exchange between the surface and atmosphere. Their knowledge is essential when solving different ecological, hydrological, agricultural and land use problems (Hermann et al., 2006; Tóth et al., 2006(1)). Storage and movement of water and nutrients in the soil-plant system are strongly influenced by soil hydraulic properties. Vegetation cover, soil management, land use, weather conditions and surface hydrological processes have an effect on these properties to different extent (Birkás et al., 2004; Nemes et al., 2006; Tóth et al., 2006(2)). Hence, the spatial and temporal variation of soil hydraulic properties can be considerable even in areas with relatively homogenous soil cover (Lichner et al., 2007). In certain cases this variation causes huge variability in flow and transport processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Due to climate change predictions and land use change requirements the demand on knowledge towards sustainable flood plain management has increased during the last years. To introduce a sustainable land management (Hermann et al., 2005) adopted to local natural conditions knowledge of soil water regime of different flood plain areas is required (Horváth et al., 2007). The standard approaches of evaluating the soil water regime at sub-regional scale consider only mean values of soil hydraulic properties of reference floodplain areas, while the occurrence of extreme events is of special interest (Farkas and Bakacsi, 2007). Consequently, it is important to know to which extent spatial variation of soil hydraulic functions can affect the variation in soil water regime. This paper presents a study on spatial distribution of soil water retention curves and soil hydraulic conductivity functions of a floodplain area in Slovakia and Hungary and its influence on the spatial variability of soil water regime. Materials and methods Six different locations, representing dissimilar soil patterns of two floodplain areas, the Rye Island in Slovakia and Bodrogköz in Hungary were examined. The main soil properties of the study locations are given in Table 1. In Slovakia, measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were performed in 15 replicates at three different</p><p id="Pg307">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 308 locations: near Kalinkovo (RI_1), Macov (RI_2) and Jurová (RI_3) during the growing seasons of 2000–2003 (Nagy et al., 2003). The infiltration rates, measured using a double ring infiltrometer were evaluated using Philips equation as described by Kutilek and Nielsen (1994). The main points of the soil water retention curves at each of the locations were determined in four replicates as described by Šútor (1986). Table 1.

The Ks values were derived from double ring infiltrometer measurements using similar approach as for soils of the Slovakian site. Detailed description of the study areas and the soil water retention curve measurement technique is given in Horváth et al. (2007). Statistical evaluation of the soil hydrophysical database was performed by the STATISTICA software (StatSoft, 2003) and concerned the topsoil layer. At each of the six locations, data of three measurement points were chosen to represent the whole range of spatial variation of the soil water retention (pF-) curves and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Table 2), resulting in 18 reference functions. The Van-Genuchten – Mualem analytical expression (Van Genuchten, 1980) was fit to each of the representative pF-curves and corresponding Ks value to generate soil hydrophysical input data for the SWAP model (Van Dam, 2000). For the BD_2 sites, where the soil water content was not sensitive to the pF input data the effect of spatial variability of the pF-curves was studied individually and as combined with variations in Ks. The sensitivity of the SWAP soil water balance model outputs was analysed by validating the model with the same parameter set but different soil physical input data derived from the 18 reference curves. Model validations were performed for 2004 assuming grass crop with a previously calibrated to the BD sites parameter set (Farkas and Bakacsi, 2007). The spatial variability of the soil water content dynamics of different layers (i) and total soil water in the upper 0.5 m layer (TSW(0.0-0.5m)) were compared based on the simulation results. Results and discussion Statistical evaluation of the soil hydrophysical database proved that the spatial variability of Ks is much stronger than that of pF-curves (Table 2). Thus, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the Ks varied between 42.4 – 70.7 % and 8.7 – 29.8 % for the BD and RI sites, respectively. In Bodrogköz, the strongest variation in the pF values was found for the BD_1 site, which might be due to uncertainties of soil hydraulic property measurements of soils from that site due to their high clay and organic matter content.</p><p id="Pg308">VII.

Differences between the maximum and minimum values of TSW, simulated for the whole year were 21 and 25 mm, respectively.

The net and gross-balance calculation methods allowed us to identify the place of biogas production in between the diverse energy resources based on a lifecycle approach involving the agricultural production and soil handling techniques in the whole model too, that gives an entire picture about the sustainability of the system. It resulted in the conclusion, taken the ‘biogas CHP plant with DH use’ as reference, that the emitted CO2 of the whole system, incorporating all factors of the product chain is the lowest when using biogas instead of any other newly built fossil or nuclear power plant when adequately handling the risks associated with the utilization of this system. Keywords: CO2 balance, energy balance, biogas production, bio methane, lifecycle analysis, Introduction The balance of carbon-dioxide and energy when producing biomass can be quantified in different ways. The CO2 balance of burning biomass can be expanded with the same balances of its production, logistics and R&amp;D activity to get an entire look of the CO2 balance for the whole lifecycle of the product. The balances of a lifecycle analysis, a combination of the energy and material flow, can be measured in 3 different levels: direct impact of the industrial flows (the energy), indirect impacts of the accessoryinputs (logistics) and the indirect impacts of the production of processed materials (raw materials) in all flows of the construction. The lifecycle analysis links these levels and pays attention to all interaction among them (Öko-Institut, 2007). The CO2 balance of different type of energies based on the lifecycle approach can be seen in the Table 1. Table 1.: CO2 balance when producing electricity based on the net- balance approach Energy production system CO2 ekv.

Materials and methods The quantification is based on the so called „net-balance”, when in the joint system of electricity-heat only the electricity is taking into account, and the utilized „waste-heat” is financially rewarded. Having a look at the power plants using fossil energy, there the</p><p id="Pg311">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 312 mining for raw materials, their transportation, construction of the power plant and imported inputs of the system are usually taking into account. In the case of renewable energy, the GHG emissions and energy efficiency highly depends on the CO2 balance of the production of the power plant (solar panels, wind turbined etc.) but biomass also has additional CO2 balance, originated from other joint lifecycle flows. The biogas fed CHP power plant has a negative CO2 emissions value, because the reward on the heat in the electricity-heat production is higher, than the entire emission of the power plant, which uses CO2 neutral biogas. In this way, it produces better figures than the anyway CO2 neutral nuclear power plant. The gross-balance approach takes the comparison, the ratio of produced electricity and heat into account, where in the system there is no reward after the waste-heat. Since the heat and CHP power plants produce electricity and heat in different proportion, the smallest CHP power plant should be taken as a reference, where 2 kWhth heat production and 1 kWhel electricity is produced. In all other system the smaller quantity of utilized heat is substituted by fossil based heat production quantification. It can be seen, that the values of biogas CHP power plants lie well under the values of classical power plants (Table 2.).

By analysing the costs of electricity production, some type of renewable energies are competitive with the fossil and nuclear power production. In some certain cases, taking the German example, if the green electricity support system is in use, the costs of renewable energy production will be almost equal, and therefore competitive with the fossil energy (Table 3.).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 313 When analysing the GHG mitigation costs, an average new-built coal or natural gas power plant is taken as a reference to compare the diverse energy production ways. The already existing brown coal, coal and natural gas power plants’ costs – and also their emissions values – are lower, than the reference. The wind energy is close to the nuclear energy in mitigation costs, while the biogas plant shows the lowest values in this aspect. It can be stated, that the renewable energy production and the applied efficiency methods (inclusive the natural gas CHP plants) are the most competitive on the field of GHG emissions mitigation costs. These results can be applied to other developed and developing nations too, since the lifecycle of these investments don’t differ, and the costs are determined by world market trends. Results and discussion During analysing the lifecycles of different electricity production systems becomes clear, that the vitality and application of a system is strongly influenced by the lifetime of the diverse production systems, the kind of the applied technology and way they enjoy support covering costs or deducting costs during taxation. It can be stated, that all those systems examined in this paper have the feature of being influenced by the economical policy, which means that the existence or lack of some regulations in a sector determine an economical policy goal. Therefore our opinion is, that the economical vitality or invitality of the renewable energy systems is determined by a political will in an economical arena. Conclusions If one would like to analyse the biomass-bio methane product chain that is linked with the agricultural production from energetic or emissions-efficiency view, then the system’s life expectancy must be measured by definite technological solutions. If we take the sociological and environmental measures into account, these norms linked to the food production also apply when talking about energetic utilisation, because the energetic use of agricultural products and by-products are not always determined or necessary. The food production has not only to fulfil environmental friendly technological requirements, but receives other financial sources for topping up income or keeping an eye on the environment, these conditions all influence the supply side of biomass feedstock for energetic use. The model of the product chain has a basic feature, it would like to follow a strategy to mitigate the maximal available CO2 mainly through energy efficiency techniques in the different steps of the product chain. The agricultural CO2 mitigation strategies are already used in the practise, they can be applied too. The key element of the maximal emissions mitigation strategy in the biomass-bio methane product chain is, that the produced green energy should be utilized locally or close to the production site with low transportation costs, otherwise both the CO2 balance by higher emissions and the energy balance by higher energy use of the steps would harm the sustainability of the system. By not knowing the technological conditions of each biomass-bio methane steps, we haven’t specified figures for the energy or CO2 balance, but indicated in the different stages, how much the energy consumption or the CO2 balance is likely to go positive (+), meaning that the certain stage of the chain incorporates higher risk to fail in energy and CO2 balances.</p><p id="Pg313">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

My lecture presents how to qualify the environment of a biocoenosis synbiologically, in other words, on the supraindividual level. In this case, qualifying the environment in practice means that both the quantitative and qualitative composition of the biocenosis, and also the factors responsible for their distribution in space and time are considered and evaluated as characteristics. The ultimate goal of examining conditions is to evaluate, in other words, to determine relevancy and significance in a given biocenosis. We are facing the problem that in Hungary at present the biological survey methods are not standardized, and they are highly varied. An environmental information system however cannot function before appropriate methods of biological survey are created. The lack of such methods would result that one of the three major, organically complementary sources of information (i.e. the abiotic sphere, the biosphere, and human society) is completely missing. From a different aspect, ecological survey studies are different from the rest of environmental survey studies, inasmuch as they study living organisms and their communities, thus inevitably utilizing the results of other environmental survey studies that evaluate different components. This indicates that the ecological section of all environmental survey studies is vitally important due to its complexity, and should be considered primarily decisive. Keywords: The quality of an environment, biologically qualified environment, ecologically evaluated conditions Introduction: How to determine the quality of an environment Basically, there are two approaches. One makes the classifications based on certain indicators relevant to the method of utilization (e.g. the parameters of drinking water, industrial waste water, irrigation water, sewage water), and the data is interpreted according to the appropriate range of standards. This approach is oversimplified, and consequently not quite operative. It is evident that a component of the environment does possess a "quality" even if it is not utilized for any purpose. The concept of quality is not the same as the concept of expediency, (bonitas) or appropriateness. The second approach evaluates the quality of an environment as the sum of all characteristics. This means the quality is not determined based on a single method selected, favouring one particular angle (such as temperature, light conditions, the level of phosphorus, etc.) If one wants to determine the actual quality of any given component of an environment, one cannot be limited to measuring such individual factors separately. The quality junctions of a material system cannot be solely or even primarily characterized by the number and level of these elements, but rather by their specific structure, i.e. the particular interrelations of the components within the domain of the entire system. As opposed to the individual characteristics of a particular component, it is essentially more complex and complicated to interpret and analyze the totality of the specific characteristics created by their interrelations.</p><p id="Pg315">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 316 Consequently, the quality of an environment can be defined as the condition determined by actual values measured in all of the characteristics of the given environment in a given time. The characteristics-complex that determines the quality of an environment has three basic components as follows:  the abiotic sphere (the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere comprising the glosphere)  the biosphere (living organisms)  the human society (noosphere). Biologically qualified environment The biological quality of an environment is defined as the condition reflecting the quantitative representation of living organisms in a given space and time. The object of our examination can be a living being, a single individual, or a single part of an individual (e.g. an organ, a cell, a gene), or a single characteristic of the individual (e.g. its metabolism, its perception.) In the latter case, the biological environment qualification deals with the infraindividual, or "below" the individual level. The object selected can be a population of a single species, or a group of populations. A population is an isolated group of individuals of the same species, existing together in space and time, thus creating an actual reproductive community. A group of different populations existing together in space and time is called a biocenosis. My lecture presents environment qualification in a biocenosis synbiologically, i.e. on the supraindividual or "above" the individual level. Characteristics of ecologically evaluated conditions The research survey examines both the quantitative and qualitative composition of the biocenosis, and also the factors responsible for their distribution in space and time as characteristics: basic data, condition characteristics, and qualitative indicators are registered and analyzed. Basic data: A list of species is compiled, summarizing the specific species involved in the given biocenosis. The quantitative characteristics are determined, such as the values of abundance, i.e. the number of individuals, and the values of dominance, i.e. the frequency and the size of the area covered. Condition characteristics: The symbiotic relations, the number of species representing different levels of frequency, and the number of individuals are determined, the dominant and characteristic species are distinguished. The status of designated nature conservation area, and diversity can be considered as qualitative indicators. Diversity is increased by the variety of environmental factors, and the relative stability of living conditions. The main advantage of diversity is to provide genetical variety. The more genetically different the living organisms are in a given area, the more increased the probability is that several species will be able to adapt to</p><p id="Pg316">VII.

Condition characteristics are registered and analyzed The survey of ecological effects can be divided into three successive phases. In the first phase, the ecological quality and condition of the given area is evaluated. My lecture focuses primarily on this phase, applying the results of field exercises performed by our environmental engineer students. In the second phase, the potential environmental changes that might be created by a given land development project must be analyzed as relevant to the biosphere.In the third phase, the operations of the completed project must be monitored, and the results of observations and measurements taken must be continuously evaluated and analyzed.</p><p id="Pg317">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Abstract: By various methods we assayed the effects of chromium (VI) on axenic Lemna gibba L. cultures and compared the sensitivity of different parameters to treatments in short-term (48 h) tests. Most of chlorophyll fluorescence induction parameters indicated disordered functioning of plants. Non-photochemical quenching (qN) showed extremely high sensitivity to heavy metal exposures. Biomass and proportion of photosynthetic pigments proved to be at least such a good indicator of heavy metal stress. Amounts of main pigment groups decreased in by the 48 th h. On the other hand zeaxanthin levels exceeded control values many times in accordance with increased qN reflecting damaged photosystems. Elevated -carotene content of treated plants also indicated oxidative stress.

Being widely used and strongly toxic elements heavy metals constitute a particularly harmful group of contaminants (Biró and Takács, 2006; Coga et al., 2007). Chromium due to its high toxicity to living organisms and because of its large amounts being released into biogeochemical cycles is especially in the focus of interest. Oxidation form of Cr varies between 0 and +6 and it could be readily changed depending on redox circumstances. Under normal conditions only Cr (III) and (VI) forms are stable. Hexavalent chromium - the most toxic Cr-form - usually exists as chromate (CrO4 2-) or dichromate (Cr2O7 2-) ion (Cervantes et al. 2001). Following the uptake of chromate ion which is similar to that of other chemically homologous ions destroying effects take place within short time period (Appenroth et al., 2001). Likewise other heavy metals (Szarka et al., 2006) Cr (VI) triggers oxidative burst and causes several damages in functioning of plants by alterations in biological membranes and by consequent disorders (Cervantes et al., 2001; Artetxe et al., 2002) which triggers decrease in pigment content and photosynthetic capacity (Appenroth et al., 2001). Duckweed species (Araceae) are free-floating small plants which are widely spread in natural waters (Lakatos et al., 1993). They reproduce themselves vegetatively very rapidly. This character makes them suitable organisms for phytoremediation. Duckweeds can be grown axenically very easily in suitable medium which made them widely used test-organisms in scanning the potential effects of contaminants to plants. The toxic compounds can enter directly into the assimilating tissues of duckweed avoiding the compartmentation or chemical alteration in contrast with terrestrial plants. Duckweed test methods use various growth parameters or physiological and biochemical changes to estimate possible toxic effect of contaminants. Although these methods offer a rapid way of knowledge about general toxicity of chemicals,</p><p id="Pg319">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 320 biomarkers used in these tests may respond differently and show differences of sensitivity in the case of various chemicals (Geoffroy et al., 2004). The present paper focuses on the effects of chromium (VI) on photosynthesis comparing the sensitivity of different parameters in short-term Lemna-tests. Materials and methods Axenic Lemna gibba L. cultures were maintained in ½ strength Hutner’s medium (pH 6.3) in growth chamber (Conviron E7/2 phytotronic chamber, continuous white illumination with PFD 200 mol m-2s-1, temperature 20±2 0C). For toxicity tests 10 healthy colonies consisting of three fronds (approx. 0,023g fw) were transferred into 100 cm3 Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 cm3 of growth medium. Cr (VI) was applied in final concentrations of 0, 0,25, 0,5 and 0,75 mM. Treatments with every concentration were performed in 3 replications under static conditions. Other culturing conditions correspond to the maintenance of stock cultures. Effects of Cr (VI) were monitored by different ways at the 48th hour of tests: Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured with PAM 2000 chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ Gmbh, Germany) (Mészáros et al., 1998). Potential photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm after 30 min dark adaptation), actual photochemical efficiency (F/Fm’), photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (qN) of light adapted plants (Schreiber et al. 1994) were calculated. Plant material was centrifuged by 2000 rpm for 5 min to remove excess water. Fresh weights were measured with 0,0001g accuracy. Photosynthetic pigment content of plants was measured from 80% acetonic extract after Wellburn (1994). Carotenoid composition was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC by using the same acetonic extracts. Results and discussion Standardized duckweed test methods (e.g. USEPA, OECD) express the toxicity of contaminants by growth inhibition or growth rates. Having strong growth potential Cr (VI)-treated L. gibba cultures showed concentration-dependent reduction of growth within 48 h. Even 0,25 mM Cr (VI) caused considerably lower fresh weights with a 30% decrease in comparison to control values (0,056g per culture). Higher concentrations resulted in further decrease in plant growth (40 and 50% fall to control values in the case of 0,5 and 0,75 mM Cr (VI) 1 respectively). In plants Cr (VI) disturbs various physiological processes including photosynthesis (Appenroth et al., 2001; Ali et al., 2006; Hörcsik et al., 2007). On the base of chlorophyll fluorescence induction Cr (VI) strongly affected the function of chloroplasts explaining the drastic inhibition of growth. Potential photochemical efficiency characterized by Fv/Fm ratio is the most commonly used index for estimating the vitality of plants (Hörcsik et al., 2007). Even the smallest applied Cr (VI) concentration lowered Fv/Fm ratio of plants and higher doses induced accelerated reduction of values (Figure 1.). Fluorescence parameters of light adapted plants showed high sensitivity to Cr (VI). In Cr (VI) treated plantsF/Fm’ ratio responded more sensitively to every Cr (VI) concentration than Fv/Fm (Figure 1.).</p><p id="Pg320">VII.

Cr (VI) affected strongly both photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (qN) parameters, but opposite trends of changes were observed (Figure 2.). qN proved to be more sensitive with an increase of nearly 200% at 0,5 and 0,75 mM Cr (VI) treatments compared to control values. Although photochemical quenching (qP) was also affected by heavy metal treatments resulting in slight decrease, reduction in qP/qN ratio is mainly due to the increase of qN reflecting the lowered efficiency of photosynthesis and growing number of damaged photosystems (Figure 2.). Results show that different chlorophyll fluorescence parameters responded very differently to Cr (VI) in L. gibba.

At higher concentrations of Cr (VI) both total amount of chlorophylls, amounts of chl a and chl b separately, and total amount of carotenoids decreased in the end of treatments (Table 1.).

The following soil characteristics were also measured during the study: soil temperature, moisture, pH, respiration, bacterial and fungal count, carbon and organic matter content. The study site is in North-East of Hungary (Síkfőkút Project). The long-term litter manipulation field experiment is part of ILTER Detritus Input and Removal Treatments (DIRT) Project. Soil samples were taken 16 times during the five-year experimental period. Our results suggested that the various treatments influenced the enzyme activity. We found significant differences in the enzyme activity of the treatments after three years. The lowest average activity was measured in the No Root plots, the highest in the Double Wood plots. The soil organic matter and carbon content was more important factor than the temperature. Keywords: litter manipulation, phosphatase, β–glucosidase Introduction During the last few decades the Síkfőkút forest climate became dryer and warmer (Antal et al., 1997), which might be related to the global climate change (Várallyay, 2007). Due to the recent changes in the forest’s structure and species composition the litter production also have been changing (Kotroczó et al., 2006). The litter input quantity and quality are important factors under most scenarios of global climate change. However, the resulting effects on soil organic matter (SOM) stability cannot be predicted accurately. The effect of climate change on the SOM level and soil processes was studied in the framework of ILTER DIRT (International Long-Term Ecological Research, Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) project. Soil enzyme activities are greatly affected by organic matter content of the soil (Ajwa et al., 1999). Soil enzymes play an essential role in catalyzing processes required for organic matter decomposition and nutrient turnover. Most organic C and N compounds are too large to be absorbed by microbes or plants, so bacteria and fungi deploy enzymes extracellularly to break down organic matter into assimilable forms. Therefore, soil enzymes are good indicators of microbial activity and soil fertility (Knight and Dick, 2004). We measured the activities of selected extracellular soil enzymes to determine changes in response to detrital inputs. Materials and methods The study area (Síkfőkút Project) comprises 64 ha in the south part of the Bükk Mountains in North Eastern Hungary (GPS coordinates N 47°90' E 20°46'), 320-340 m at see level. The mean annual temperature is 10 °C, and means annual precipitation is 553 mm (Antal et al., 1997). It is covered by a turkey-oak forest (Quercetum petraeae-</p><p id="Pg323">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 324 cerris), with no active forest harvest or management since the early 1900s; the forest is approximately 100 years old. Soils are classified as Cambisols. Six treatments were established according to ILTER Detritus Input and Removal Treatments (DIRT) concept (Neilson – Hole, 1963) in 2000. Each of the 7-by-7 meter plots is located beneath an intact forest canopy. The plots are placed between trees so that no stems are rooted in them, and the ground vegetation is removed as needed by clipping and occasional herbicide applications. Aboveground litter of leaves, twigs, and other fallen material is collected and excluded from No Litter (NL) plots. This collected material is then added to the Double Litter (DL) plots in order to augment normal inputs. Root growth is prevented in the No Roots (NR) treatment by excavating 1meter-deep trenches around the plots, lining them with plastic barriers, and then backfilling the trenches with soil. The No Inputs (NI) treatment is a combination of the NL and NR treatments. Aboveground wood inputs are doubled on Double Wood (DW) plots. On the Control (C) plots normal litter inputs are allowed. Treatments are replicated three times. The soil samples were taken randomly, from the top 15 cm layer, using an Oakfield soil sampler. Samples were homogenized and transported to the laboratory. The phosphatase and β–glucosidase activity was measured 16 times under laboratory conditions from April 2001 to March 2006. The measurement was carried out according to Sinsabaugh et al. (1999). This assay is based on the release of the colored product (p-nitrophenol) from the synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate or p-nitrophenyl-βglucopyranoside, by enzymatic hydrolysis. Result and discussion There were no differences in the soil phosphatase and β–glucosidase activity in different treatments in the first two years (Figure 1, 2). After this period, since 2003, the phosphatase and β–glucosidase activity of NL, NR and NI treatment decreased. In case of both enzymes the lowest average activity measured in the NR plots. The decrease of glucosidase activity (38.3%) was more considerable than decrease of phosphatase activity (22.1%) compared to Control. Roots with its rhizosphere are an important control of extracellular enzyme and microbial community (Brant et al., 2006). Figure 1. Change of the soil phosphatase activity</p><p id="Pg324">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 325 Figure 2. Change of the soil β-glucosidase activity At the same time enzyme activity of DW treatments increased not significantly (phosphatase – 13.7%, glucosidase – 3.5%). In case of the other input doubled treatment (DL) both enzyme activity were nearly the same as the Control (phosphatase increased 6.5%, glucosidase decreased 3.4%). The reduced litter input has stronger effect on soil enzyme activity than the increased input. The litter treatments influence on the soil physical and chemical properties. Therefore, besides enzyme activity, other soil characteristics were also measured and compared to activity (Table 1). Under the conditions of Síkfőkút forest in five-yearscale there were no significant relationship between soil enzyme activity and soil temperature and moisture. In case of other enzymes effect of soil temperature on the enzyme activity was slightly (Fekete et al., 2007). Some authors reported stronger relationship between enzyme activity and soil moisture (Dick, 1992; Varga-Helmeczi, 2004). Table 1.

Probable additional litter not enters into the soil, so we predict the litter layer became thicker. Conclusions The effects of litter manipulation treatments on the examined enzyme activity showed significant differences, after three years of treatment. The reduced litter input has stronger effect on soil enzyme activity than the increased input. In the studied temperature scale the soil organic matter and carbon content is more important factor than the temperature.

Besides source-related emissions reductions, agriculture is also expected to help slowing down the CO2 increase in the atmosphere by sequestering part of it in soil organic matter, and by producing suitable biomass material as a substitute for fossil fuel. Biomass, similarly to other renewable energy sources, has a low power density and that alone would not be expected to contribute significantly to climate stabilization. The biomass can be used to produce C-neutral fuels to power the transportation industry. Biomass fuels are C-neutral because they release recently fixed CO2, which does not shift the C-cycle. However, the potential for biomass pyrolysis to produce liquid biofuels and a bio char co-product returned to the soil can be C-negative. Conservation practices that help prevent soil erosion, may also sequester soil C and enhance CH4 consumption. Managing N to match crop needs can reduce N2O emission and avoid adverse impacts on water quality. Manipulating animal diet and manure management can reduce CH4 and N2O emission from animal agriculture. All segments of agriculture have management options that can reduce agriculture's environmental footprint, management strategies are needed to assure that the soil resource does not lose its ability to provide food, feed, fiber, and fuel. Keywords: emission management, land use, CO2 mitigation, CH4 mitigation, NOx mitigation. Introduction Half of the European Union's land is farmed. This fact alone highlights the importance of farming for the EU's natural environment. Farming and nature exercise a profound influence over each other. Farming has contributed over the centuries to creating and maintaining a variety of valuable semi-natural habitats (EEA, 2007). Today these shape the majority of the EU's landscapes and are home to many of the EU's richest wildlife. Farming also supports a diverse rural community that is not only a fundamental asset of European culture, but also plays an essential role in maintaining the environment in a healthy state. Pollution of soil, water and air, fragmentation of habitats and loss of wildlife can be the result of inappropriate agricultural practices and land use. Agriculture is a source for three primary greenhouse gases (GHGs): CO2, CH4, and N2O. It can also be a sink for CO2 through C sequestration into biomass products and soil organic matter. We reviewed the GHG emissions and C sequestration, providing a perspective on how agriculture can reduce its GHG burden and how it can help to mitigate GHG emissions through conservation measures. Impacts of agricultural practices and systems on GHG emission are investigated as a mitigation option. The agriculture contributes 9 % to the total EU-15 GHG emissions, making it the second largest sector after the Sector Energy. The most important GHGs from agriculture are N2O and CH4 accounting for 5 % and 4 % of the total GHG emissions respectively. The emissions from this sector decreased by 11 % from 434 Tg in 1990 to 386 Tg in 2005. In 2005, the emissions decreased by 1,4 % compared to 2004. The lower N2O emissions come from agricultural soils (-4,0 million tonnes) mainly in Spain, Italy and Germany. The reduction from N2O emissions from agricultural soils is partly due to a reduction in synthetic fertilizer use in Spain and Italy, and the reduction of the use of nitrogen fixing crops in Germany (EEA, 2007). In the United States the agriculture contributes 6,3 % to total GHG emission. A little bit lower than in the EU’s most developed countries. A</p><p id="Pg327">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 328 recent inventory of the USA economy GHG emission put major emitters into categories: (1) energy (86,6%), (2) agriculture (6,3%), (3) industrial (4,5%), (4) waste (2,7%) and (5) solvent and product use (&lt;1%). Land-use changes and forestry were treated as a sink, offsetting emission by about 12%. Emission of CO2 from on-farm energy use was included in the energy category (US EPA, 2007). Agricultural related activities contribute about one-third of the global net CO2 emissions mostly from deforestation and burning; however, drainage of wetland and tillage also contribute. There are differences noted among emission sources, caused by inconsistency in categorical definitions (Jane M. et al., 2007). Within the agricultural sector, CO2, CH4 and N2O are the gases considered to be of primary concern. The greatest contributions to CH4 emission are enteric fermentation (21%) and manure management (8%) with minor contributions from rice paddies and agricultural burning (US EPA, 2007). Application of nitrogenous fertilizer and cropping practices are estimated to cause 78% of the total N2O emission in the United States. In the European Union, it was estimated that about 10% of the GHG emission is due to CH4 and N2O of which 49 % and 63%, respectively, have been attributed to agriculture. These estimates can be improved as the magnitude of gas flux from the agricultural sector still has large knowledge gaps. Nonethe-less these are sizable contributions, which can be modified through management (Franzluebbers-Follett, 2005). Materials and methods Sequestration of Carbon from plant biomass into soil organic matter is a key sequestration pathway in agriculture. Within a given soil and climatic regime, a linear relationship exists between biomass Carbon inputs and Soil organic matter. Maximum Carbon sequestration within a given ecosystem occurs once the inputs and the outputs reach steady-state or dynamic equilibrium. Some experts noted that apparent differences among management systems are a function of time, suggesting terminology such as attainable max Carbon level when addressing management effects on soil C levels (Ingram-Fernandes, 2001, ). There are multiple benefits to sequestering Carbon in forest and agricultural soils, beyond the obvious benefit of offsetting CO2 emissions. The collateral soil Carbon sequestration benefits on improved soil quality, increased soil productivity, reduced risk of soil erosion and sedimentation, decreased eutrophication and water contamination (Ligetvari, 2007). Soil organic matter is about 58% C with a C:N ratio between 10 and 12. Many physical, chemical, and biological characteristics associated with productive soil are due to high soil organic mater content (Jane M. et al., 2007). In the next list we are showing some factors association with strategies for increasing the Carbon contents of existing agricultural soils (Cole et al., 1996): Increasing the level of organic matter inputs  increasing crop productivity, e.g. by fertilization  diversified crop rotation, higher cropping frequency  enhanced return of crop residues, green manure crops  increased use of organic amendments, inclusion of perennial forage crops  cropping of deep-rooted tropical grasses, use of winter cover crops  improved irrigation</p><p id="Pg328">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 329  agroforestry. Decreasing the rates of soil organic matter decomposition  reduced soil tillage intensity  mulch farming technologies  control of soil erosion  reducing bare fallow periods. Results and discussion According to the experimental data, the changes in soil Carbon should be below 30 cm, and preferably throughout the rooting zone. In a review of long-term cropping studies, the impact of No-tillage management on Carbon sequestration and global warming potential (GWP) was significant at the end of 20 years, but not earlier (Six et al., 2004). The summary of these results suggest that Carbon sequestration due to No-tillage or conservation/reduced tillage depends on depth of soil sampling, crop management, and duration of continuous low-intensity tillage system. There are many benefits in reducing tillage beyond Carbon sequestration. No-tillage management is an effective method to control erosion. In addition to erosion control, No-tillage and reduced tillage (e.g., ridge tillage) also save energy by reducing fossil fuel needs (Birkás, 2006). From a wholefarm simulation of the relative contributions of various agricultural components to soil organic content in concluded manure contributes a relatively small proportion of the Carbon to soil compared to crop roots and residue, especially in swine systems, unless straw bedding is included (Szalai, 2007). All management systems – like residue management – require energy expenditures. Analysis of total direct and indirect energy consumption is one method for comparing systems. Direct consumption is linked to field operations including tillage, amendment application (e.g., manure, fertilizer, etc.) and harvest. Indirect consumption is linked to the production of amendments, and transportation and storage of these and other products to and from the field (Jane M. et al., 2007). Conclusions The energy sector is the largest contributor to GHG emission. It is essential to reduce consumption of fossil fuels if progress is to be made in curtailing GHG emission. Carbon-neutral – causing no net change in atmospheric C concentration – and/or Cnegative – causing atmospheric Carbon concentration to decline – fuels are needed. There has been a lively debate in the literature on the pros and cons of bioenergy – from corn grain, cellulosic ethanol fermentation, biomass gasification, and biodiesel. The debate focused on valid concerns about energy efficiency, environmental ramifications and potential competition of food crops (e.g., corn and soybean) for bioenergy feedstock. Energy balance estimates for grain ethanol production range from negative to positive and concluded grain ethanol could have a small positive energy balance, such that 5–26% of the energy could be considered truly renewable and reduce GWP by about 13% (Farrell et al. 2006). Technology is rapidly advancing to utilize crop biomass, perennial grasses, woody perennials and forest products for the production of</p><p id="Pg329">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 330 ethanol via a cellulosic platform and/or utilizing pyrolysis to generate syngas and other products/co-products. As the new technology is developing it is important to avoid negative environmental consequences such as accelerated soil erosion or loss of soil organic content. Many estimates on the amount of crop biomass that can be harvested are based primarily on erosion risks (Johnson et al., 2007). The potential Carbon offset resulting from different soil treatments and their combinations was originally assumed to range from 0.16 to 0.21 Gt C yr-1 (Sauerbeck, 1994), corresponding to a cumulative 50 years value between 8 and 10 Gt Carbon. However, this estimate decreased considerably if the biofuel-producing treatment afforestation on 30% former cropland was not included. After a more refined data evaluation and with more realistic assumptions on substrate and land availability and on practical feasibility, we have lowered the original predictions. A new agricultural CO2 emission management practices that promotes good land stewardship appears to minimize or reduce GWP. Such practices include reducing tillage, which helps prevent soil erosion and has the potential to increase soil organic content and may enhance CH4 consumption, even though in some instances it may be partially offset by N2O emission and eliminating fallow and keeping the soil covered with residue, cover crops or perennial vegetation, which have the potential to increase soil organic content.

The highest total content was determined for Fe, and the lowest for Cu and Ni regardless to soil pH. Soil pH have significant impact on available fraction of analysed micronutrients and significantly lower available fraction of Fe and Mn was determined in calcareous soils. The soil properties as humus content and pH could be sufficient for plant available micronutrients prediction using regression formulas, but such models are more appropriate for acid soils comparing to calacreous, for Fe and Mn comparing to Zn, Cu and Ni and for EDTA extracted comparing to HCl extracted fraction of micronutrients. Keywords: micronutrients, heavy metals, EDTA, acid soils, calcareous soils Introduction The concentration of microelements in soils are associated with biological and chemical cycles and influenced by activities such as agricultural practices and industrial activities. Intensification of agriculture production pointed out the role of micronutrients. Increase of fertilization may cause some negative effects because of changes in micronutrient availability (Györi, 2006). Most micronutrients availability is impacted by soil pH. Boron and molybdenum become toxic in high alkaline soils, and iron and manganese become toxic in highly acidic soils. Osztoics et al. (2005), also reported that high Mn concentration was found in extremely acidic soils. Soil extraction techniques to measure the status of available micronutrients for plants are important in the diagnosis of deficiency or toxicity (Garcia at all, 1997). The aqua regia microwave acid digestion techniques produced the fastest, safest and accurate analytical results with precision better than 5% for determination of microelements in soil (Melaken et al, 2005).Furthermore, variations in the pH of the extraction solution from 7.1 to 7.5 can be critical for acid soils, but the best results for the soils were determined by keeping the extraction solution pH at 7.3 (Abreu at all, 1997). The aim of this paper was to compare three extraction methods (EDTA, 0,1 M HCl and aqua regia) in determination of micronutrient contents on acid and calcareous soils of continental part of Croatia. Materials and methods The 40 soil samples were collected on arable and vineyard soils on depth 0-30 cm in continental part of Croatia. All the samples were analyzed on basic chemical properties such as soil pH (ISO 10390), soil organic matter by sulfochromic oxidation (ISO 14235) and plant available P and K extracted by ammonium-lactate (Egner et al., 1960). In addition the heavy metals micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and Ni) and Cd were extracted by aqua regia (ISO 11466), by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and by 0.1 N hydrocloric acid (Jones, 2001). The concentrations of extracted heavy metals</p><p id="Pg331">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 332 were conducted by AA flame method and by ICP-OES. The statistic analyses for all data were done using PC applications Microsoft Excel and StatSoft Statistica. Results and discussion The results of basic soil properties (Table 1) showed that analysed soils differed in all chemical properties from very acid to calcareous soils (pH, Hy and CaCO3), from extremely low to medium humus content and from very low to high plant available phosphorus and potassium content. The range of showed properties includes most of arable soils in Croatia. Table 1.

In general, all the elements were in highest concentration measuring after extraction by aqua regia, as it was expected. There weren’t differences measuring total heavy metals contents impacted by soil pH. However, the total content of measured heavy metals differed very significant in decreasing averages Fe (23110 mg kg-1) &gt; Mn (512) &gt; Zn (62) &gt; Cu (20) = Ni (20) &gt; Cd (0.29 mg kg-1). On the other hand, the extraction of plant available heavy metals by EDTA or by HCl solution showed very significant impact of soil pH on available portion of total contents. Comparing heavy metal micronutrients, the highest available concentration was determined for iron and the lowest for nickel (Table 2), but the ratio of available and total concentration was strongly impacted by soil pH. All the elements have higher plant available concentrations in acid soils comparing to calcareous soils regardless to extraction by EDTA or HCl. Only exception was Cu extracted by EDTA and possible explanation are four ex-vineyard soils among calcareous samples. The highest level of available concentration was determined for Fe, followed by Mn, significantly lower were plant available concentrations for Cu and Zn and the lowest availability was determined for Ni. Jurković et al. (2006) reported for acid croatian soils highest level of available Fe and Mn and significantly lower Zn and Cu. Table 2.

Comparisson of total and extracted Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu amounts impacted by soil pH On the other hand, the lowest ratio of availability calculated as a part of total concentration was determined for iron (0.003-0.49%) in acid and calcareous soils, and the highest for manganese in acid soils (16.4 %). There weren’t correlations between amounts of heavy metals extracted by aqua regia and EDTA or HCl, but comparing EDTA and HCl extraction the correlation was very significant for Mn (r2=0.96), Fe (r2=0.90), Zn (r2=0.81) and Ni (r2=0.56). The extracted heavy metals by EDTA and by HCl are especially comparable in acid soils (Figure 1), but HCl extraction showed inefficient for calcareous soils (Jones, 2001) with exception of manganese extraction. The results showed that soil pH reaction influenced on available metals. Regression analyses using available micronutrient as dependent variable and soil pH, humus and total micronutrient content as independent variables confirmed statistically significant soil properties impact on micronutrients availability. The significant regressions were determined for all EDTA extracted elements: Fe (r2=0.67 and 0.92 for calcareous and acid soils, respectively), Mn (r2=0.76 and 0.82), Zn (r2=0.88 and 0.90), Cu (r2=0.91 and 0.87) and Ni (r2=0.84 and 0.86). At the same time, the regressions were very significant for all HCl extracted elements in acid soils, but just for Zn and Mn in calcareous soils. Those regressions could be used for prediction of plant available micronutrients using data of total heavy metal content, soil pH and humus. The obtained formulas for Fe are: - acid soils: EDTA-Fe (mg kg-1) = 0.001×total Fe – 11.7×pHKCl + 87.6×humus(%) - calcareous soils: EDTA-Fe = 0.00007×total Fe – 3.36×pHKCl + 28.2×humus(%). The predicted EDTA-Fe will be higher by increasing humus content and total Fe, but the increasing of soil pH (decreased soil acidity) will decrease EDTA-Fe predicted value. Since it’s rather likely that total heavy metals data would not be available, other regression for prediction the level of available micronutrients in soil could be calculated using just soil pH and humus content data: - acid soils: EDTA-Fe (mg kg-1) = – 7.26×pHKCl + 90.9×humus(%); (r 2=0.92) - calcareous soils: EDTA-Fe = – 3.19×pHKCl + 28.6×humus(%); (r 2=0.67) .</p><p id="Pg333">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 334 Showed regression formulas are suitable for Croatian soils with humus contents in range 0.5-3.0 %. Conclusions Among micronutrient heavy metals, the highest total content was determined for Fe, and the lowest for Cu and Ni regardless to soil pH. Plant available fraction of the same elements was relatively lowest for Fe and Ni and highest for Mn and Cu. However, the concentration of available micronutrients in soil was highest for Fe and lowest for Ni. Soil pH have significant impact on available fraction of analysed micronutrients and significantly lower available fraction of Fe and Mn was determined in calcareous soils. Although there was significant correlation between results obtained by EDTA and HCl extraction, the results showed that HCl should not be used for Zn, Cu and Ni extraction in calcareous soils since values were significantly lower than values obtained by EDTA extraction. The basic soil properties as humus content and pH could be enough information for plant available micronutrients prediction using regression formulas (in humus contents range 0.5-3%), but such models are more appropriate for acid soils comparing to calcareous, for Fe and Mn comparing to Zn, Cu and Ni and for EDTA extracted fraction comparing to HCl extracted fraction of micronutrients.

Keywords: organic agriculture, cereals, costs, fertilizers, producers’ opinions Introduction Croatian socio-economic development is based on ecologic and economic orientation in farm business. Croatian agriculture tries to follow organic movement in Europe in last 15 years due to increasing demand for healthy food related to negative externalities of industry-like production which turned public attention to organic farming (Takacs, 2007). In line with that, Croatian agriculture has some competitive advantages because of abundance of uncontaminated land and water resources. In spite of evident growth of organic agriculture it participated only 1,7% of agricultural land (Ministry of agriculture, 2006). Like in other transitional countries, Croatian agriculture is in crisis and Croatian conventional farmers are faced with serious problems in their production: unorganized market with constantly present redemption price problem, lack of competition on input market what affects high input prices (especially seed, fertilizers and pesticides), limiting factors for higher productivity and profitability: land-owner structure, old agricultural machinery, etc (Petrac et al., 2007; Loncaric et al., 2006). Mentioned problems in conventional agriculture are reflected in organic agriculture as well. The main reasons for that are lacks in logistics between governmental institutions and organic producers, slow legislative, inadequate supports, present but unrealized demand. This paper is aimed to compare conventional and organic agriculture from economic point of view and to highlight the current situation in Croatian organic agriculture as basis for founded decision making. Materials and methods Paper is consisted of few data basis in order to present realistic situation of organic agriculture in Croatia as much as possible. In first part of paper are used data for creating economic analysis of cereals production (wheat, maize, barley, rye and oat). Those data are collected within EU-CARDS project (2007) as evaluation based on objective comparison between Croatia and some EU countries (Spain, France and Italy)</p><p id="Pg335">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 336 related to costs, yields, income and profit in conventional and organic agriculture. Differences between organic and conventional agriculture in terms of incomes, costs and financial production results are conducted by applying differential calculation (Karić, 2006). Starting data are based on theoretical approach predicting optimal production situation and the corrected regarding to actual situation and problems in Croatian agriculture. Of course, actual situation means decreasing economic efficiency comparing to optimal scenario. Furthermore, data for presenting concrete situation in Croatian organic agriculture concerning mostly economic issues are conducted via questionnaire from 2004. All producers announced in 2004 official Croatian organs are contacted by phone followed by letter questionnaire regarding technological, fertilization and economic issues of organic production. Only 17 registered organic producers out of 62 responded to survey. Survey is statistically analyzed by help of Microsoft excel and Statsoft statistica. Results and discussion Organic production in Europe in spite of lower yields, in general, is more profitable and perspective than conventional as a consequence of higher prices, adequate subsidies, increasing demand and positive public perception. Similar situation could be in Croatia. Economic indicators are presented in table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 337 Shown indicators revealed lower yields in organic agriculture (15-22%), significantly higher incomes due to higher subsidies (212 vs. 410 € since 2005) and higher (premium) prices (from 43% for maize to 70% for wheat). Costs in absolute value are considerably higher, mostly as a result of higher labour (45% relatively) and fertilization costs (33%), while on conventional side fertilizers and plant protection costs participate the most (figure 1). In this analysis fertilizer cost are calculated according to market price, not as farm by-product. It is in line with fact that Croatian farms, especially organic, are very small and fragmented (2.7 ha is Croatian average in general) and mostly not sustainable enough. 2 1 ,1 8 2 1 ,1 5 4 2 ,7 8 3 ,7 4 1 1 ,2 5 3 3 ,8 5 6 ,3 0 4 5 ,2 8 3 ,3 1 1 1 ,1 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 seed fertilizers plant protection labour costs overheads % conventional organic Figure 1: Relative cost structure (average for all crops) in conventional and organic agriculture (%) Consequently, profits could be more than 1000€ per hectare. So, it’s not surprising that break even points are more favourable in organic farming and amounts from 38 (barley) up to 50 percent (oat) of expected yields. So, other survey, the letter questionnaire, revealed many problems and limits for organic farmers in Croatia. As it’s mentioned before, the examinees response was more than unsatisfactory (17 out of 62 organic farmers) although the reword for fulfilled questionnaire was offered (free soil analysis or licensed calculator for fertilizer recommendation). Polled farmers cultivate about 350ha distributed on 1090 fragments what is not in accordance with productive farming. Most of them have only basic chemical soil analysis for their areas, but not the analysis for heavy metals (only 2 examinees). In average farmers cultivate 2.2 cultures per farm (fruits, vegetables and maize were most frequent cops). Problem in data processing was precise economic analysis because most of farmers don’t carry on accounting books. On the other hand, farmers were more cooperating analyzing their motivations for organic farming. Health (28%), environment protection (19%), better price and market position (19%), as well as personal persuasion (16%) were marked as major reasons, what is partly in accordance with findings of other authors (Kis, 2007). When take into consideration problems in organic farming, the most frequent answer is inadequate institutional</p><p id="Pg337">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 338 (government) support (30%), then lack of expert literature and further education regarding organic agriculture (16%), unorganized market (14%) and pest management (9%). Finally, respondents are generally satisfied with their farming (64% answered yes), they plant to do it in future (100%), they mostly (53%) don’t plan to extend their cropping area, but they are ready to introduce some new crops (vegetable mostly). Conclusions Theoretical comparative analysis according to Croatian comparative advantages, revealed very favourable economic results in organic agriculture. Yields are expectedly lower (15-22%), while costs are significantly higher compared to conventional agriculture. Organic production is more profitable as a result of possible higher prices for organic products and support,. However, other analysis find out that organic farmers have many problems in their management (small and fragmented farms, lack of ecologically friendly fertilizers and pesticides on domestic market, weak institutional support and absence of expert literature). Health, environment protection, better price and market position, as well as personal persuasion were marked as major reasons to step into organic farming. Although organic agriculture is inchoate and suffering “child diseases”, farmers are generally satisfied with their occupation. To improve situation on Croatian organic market it is necessary to improve input market, to educate public as well as farmers and to ensure better logistics between government and producers.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek,, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: drastija@pfos.hr 2 Faculty of Agriculture Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: The effect of liming and different rates of mineral fertilizers upon the changes in the soil chemical properties were monitored on two sites in the eastern Croatia. After liming (10 t ha -1 carbocalc with total Ca content 344 g kg -1 ) the plots were fertilized for maize and in second year for winter wheat with three different nutrient amounts. Liming increased base saturation level and soil pH raised for approximately 1.2 pH units while hydrolytic acidity were decreased for 1.3 cmol (+) kg -1 . Liming also significantly increased phosphorus availability for 17.1 mg kg -1 . As a result of mineral fertilization nutrients availability raised for 25 mg P2O5 kg 1 and 50 mg K2O kg -1 at NPK treatment and for 54 mg P2O5 kg -1 and 70 mg K2O kg -1 at doubled mineral fertilization treatment, respectively. Results indicated that the effects of low liming rates in intensive crop production were short termed implying that more frequent or higher lime application is necessary in order to improve soil chemical properties and increase crop yields Keywords: liming, mineral fertilization, soil chemical properties, nutrients availability Introduction Soil acidification is a slow, continuous natural process resulting in acid soils being common in areas where soil development continued for long, geological periods of time and under climatic conditions which rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration (Rengel, 2002). The process of soil acidifications aided by water leaching base cations to lower horizons is main characteristic of luvisol. Luvisols are widespread in the Eastern Croatia with acidity as limiting factor of the field crops yield (Rastija, 2006). Human activities may intensify and speed up the acidification process. The widely accepted ameliorative measure for acid soils is liming with goal to increase soil pH. The aim of the investigations is to determine the effects of different rates of mineral fertilizer and carbocalc as liming material on the changes in the soil chemical properties. Materials and methods The effect of liming and different rates of mineral fertilizers upon the changes in the soil chemical properties was monitored on two sites in the eastern Croatia (Zelčin and Donji Miholjac). The field trials laid out on district luvisol in a randomized block design in three replicates. In the autumn of 2002 both soils were limed with 10 t ha-1 carbocalc (total Ca content 344 g kg-1) to the soil depth 30 cm. Afterwards, the plots were fertilized for maize and in second year for winter wheat with three different nutrient amounts what resulted in five different treatments: no fertilization and no liming – O, liming – Ca (10 t ha-1 carbocalc), mineral fertilization – NPK (200:150:300 kg ha-1 for maize and 160:150:200 kg ha-1 for wheat, N:P2O5:K2O), liming with mineral fertilization – Ca+NPK and liming with doubled mineral fertilization – Ca+N2P2K2 (300:300:450 kg ha-1 for maize and 240:300:300 kg ha-1 for wheat). The soil samples were collected to 30 cm depth prior to setting up the trial and after harvest in both years. The soil pH (H2O and M KCl, 1:5 v/v) was determined according</p><p id="Pg339">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 340 to ISO (1994), plant available phosphorus and potassium by ammonium-lactate extraction (Egner et al. 1960) and soil organic matter content by sulfocromic oxidation (ISO, 1998). Hydrolytic acidity was determined by Na-acetate extraction and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K and Na) by ammonium-acetate extraction (Jones, 2001). Effective cation exchange capacity (CEC) was calculated from exchangeable cations and hydrolytic acidity, while base saturation (BS) was calculated as ratio of base cations and effective cation exchange capacity. The plots size measured 70 m2. Grain yield were calculated on 14% moisture basis. Statistical analyses for all data were performed by analysis of variance using PC applications Microsoft Excel and Stat Soft Statistic. Results and discussion Crop yields The lowest maize and winter wheat yield was on plots without fertilization and without liming, while the highest yield was realized on a treatment with liming and mineral fertilization in doubled amount (earlier published by Rastija et al., 2007.). The differences among treatments in the first year were less than expected because of dry conditions during growing period. Mineral fertilization impact on winter wheat yield was more marked in a favourable 2004. Standard fertilization increased wheat yield (from 2.74 to 6.27 t ha-1) more than liming (Table 1). Table 1.

Silty loam texture with 12.8% to 15.0% of clay and about 1.3% of organic matter were related to low cation exchange capacity. Data given in Table 2 indicate significant differences in the soil chemical properties in both investigation years. As it was expected, the changes in soil pH, hydrolytic acidity and base saturation level were recorded for all liming treatments. Application of 10 t ha-1 carbocalc raised pHKCl value in the first year for approximately 1.2 pH units, and decreased hydrolytic acidity for 1.3 cmol (+) kg-1. The mineral fertilization influenced to soil pH in the second year of investigation. Combinations of liming and mineral fertilization resulted with lower soil pH, but the differences compared to liming treatments were insignificant. Furthermore, results indicated that the effects of low liming rates were short termed as reported by Lončarić et al. (2007). Table 2.

Mineral fertilization significantly increased phosphorus availability with highest value on liming and doubled fertilization combination treatment. Liming also significantly increased phosphorus availability for 17.1 mg kg-1 in the first year, but in the second year differences between control (0) and liming (Ca) treatments were lower. Similar effect regarding available phosphorus was observed by Rahman et al. (2002), Zhang et al. (2004.) and Zsigrai and Öri (2006). Mineral fertilization significantly increased potassium availability with the highest value as a result of doubled fertilization treatment (Ca+N2P2K2). Besides soil reaction and hydrolytic acidity (Hy), base saturation level (BS) of cation exchange capacity (CEC) was very useful indicator of soil acidity (Lončarić et al. 2005). Lime application increased base saturation levels, as it was expected and the highest influence was in the first investigation year. In the opposite, mineral fertilization resulted with decreasing of BS especially on doubled fertilization treatment (Figure 1). Figure 1.

The growth, persistance of alfalfa and the benefits of symbiotic relation are impaired in moderately acid soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of inoculation with different rhizobial strains and application of two liming materials (limestone and Agrarvital) on alfalfa production on acid soil. The results of field experiment clearly showed positive effect of inoculation and liming on alfalfa dry matter yield and crude protein yield. Significant differences among S. meliloti strains were also determined, suggesting that rhizobial strains differ in their ability to tolerate soil acidity. Liming also significantly improved alfalfa dry matter and crude protein yield compared to control plots without liming. The results of this study suggest that liming and inoculation with suitable rhizobial strains may improve alfalfa production on acid soils. Keywords: alfalfa, inoculation, Sinorhizobium. meliloti, strains, liming, yield Introduction Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most important forage crop. As a perennial crop, alfalfa has long period of persistance in the field and high biomass production which provides the fundation for profitable feeding programs for dairy and other livestock (Maćešić et al., 2007). Furhtermore, alfalfa is also energy-efficient crop, that could produce high quantities of protein by utilizing process of biological nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixing bacteria are important components of the various soil-plant ecosystems (Biro, 2005; Singh et al., 2007) and biological nitrogen fixation process is completely in accordance with the concept of sustainable agriculture (Redžepović et al., 2007). Alfalfa forms symbiotic relation with nitrogen fixing bacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti. Nodulation and symbiotic efficiency of S. meliloti strains is determined by individual genotype (Bradić et al., 2003), compatibility to the alfalfa cultivar (Mačešić et al., 2007) and also influenced with the biotic and abiotic environmental stress-factors (Ködöböcz et al., 2007). Production and long term sustainability of alfalfa is limited by soil acidity because alfalfa is considered to be sensitive to soil acidity (Segundo et al., 1999; Grewal and Williams 2001; Karalić et al., 2007; Popovic et al., 2007). Since soil acidity and problems assosiated with it are in many cases limiting factor of crop yield (Kovačević et al. 2006), liming is a commonly used practice for soil pH correction. S. meliloti is among the more acid sensitive rhizobia (Segundo et al., 1999) and some authors (Glenn and Dilworth 1994; Segundo et al., 1999) proposed the selection of acid tolerant S. meliloti strains as a possible aproach for establishment of effective symbiotic relationship with alfalfa on acid soils. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of inoculation with different rhizobial strains and application of two liming materials on alfalfa production on acid soil.</p><p id="Pg343">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 344 Material and methods Two-year field trial was established on luvisol at location Višnjevac in central Croatia. The chemical characteristics of the soil were as follows: pH 5.2 (M-KCl), humus 1.9%, available phosphorus and potassium 29.7 mg and 94.6 mg per kg soil, total nitrogen 0.24%, hydrolytic (nonexchangeable) acidity y1 11.3 mmol(+)kg -1 and base saturation (V) 71.7%. Field trial was established in completely randomized block design with four repetition. Basic experimental plot was 12.5 m2 (2.5 x 5). Trial factors were as follows: 1. inoculation of alfalfa seed with different S. meliloti strains- D 469, D 528, 2011 and uninoculated variants. S. meliloti strains used in this investigation were obtained from the Culture Collection of Rhizobium – Praha (strains D 469 and D 528) and Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research in Dyfed (strain 2011). 2. materials for acidity removal – limestone (CaCO3) in amount of 10 t ha -1, special natural amendments based on zeolite tuff, the product available under the commercial name Agrarvital (AV) in amount of 2 t ha-1 and control variants without liming materials. Preparation of trial design, liming and fertilization was performed in spring 2003. Based on the results of the soil samples, 40 kg ha-1 of N, 114 kg ha-1 of P and 171 kg ha1 of K were applied. The alfalfa seed (cv. Osječka 88) was inoculated with peat-based inoculant just before sowing in August, 2003. Dry matter yield as well as total nitrogen content in aboveground part of the plant were observed during the trial. During the year 2004 and 2005 crop was harvested four times, in May, Juny, August and October. Subsamples of fresh herbage (cutting area 4 m2) were taken to determine percent of dry matter (DM). At harvest, shoots were clipped to leave a 5 cm stubble. The content of total N in plant tops was determined by the standard Kjeldahl procedures. Crude protein content was calculated by multiplying the determined nitrogen value by 6.25. DM yield and crude protein (CP) yield obtained from each plot were calculated per ha. Data were subjected to ANOVA using the statistical analysis system SAS (SAS Institute, 1997). Means of all treatments were calculated and the differences were tested for significance using the LSD test at the 0.05 level. Results and discussion Dry matter yield In both experimental years it was found that rhizobial inoculation and application of liming as well as their interactions had significant effect on DM yield (Table 1). In response to inoculation by individual sinorhizobial strains, the highest DM yield was determined on plots inoculated with strain 2011 compared to plots inoculated with strain D528 (only in 2004) and uninoculated plots. Significant differences in DM yield obtained by inoculation with different S. meliloti, point to the importance of strains selection used for alfalfa inoculation. Application of limestone significantly increased DM yield in both experimental years compared to plots without liming material and application of AV (only in 2004). Data presented in Table 1 also showed increasing of DM yield on inoculated plots after application of different liming material. Significantly the lowest DM yield was determined on uninoculated plots without liming material. In</p><p id="Pg344">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 345 the first experimental year application of limestone significantly increased DM yield on all inoculated plots regardless of strains used in comparison to uninoculated plots with or without liming. Alfalfa plants inoculated with strain 2011 did not react to the liming in 2004, since differences in DM yield were not significant compared to plots inoculated with strain 2011 without liming.

So, AV application has slowly liming effect compared to limestone. That could be explained by fact that main issue of zeolite tuff based material is to prevent harmful fixation and retrogradation of soil plant nutrients rather than how to neutralize soil acidity (Butorac et al., 2002). Advantage of</p><p id="Pg345">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 346 AV is that application in much lower rates can be equally efficient than conventional liming material. In the first experimental year, significantly higher CP yield was determined on inoculated plots with applied limestone and plots inoculated with strain 2011 (with and without liming) compared to uninoculated plots with or without liming. In the second experimental year, inoculation and liming significantly increased alfalfa CP yield compared to yield of uninoculated plots with or without liming. Conclusions The results of this research indicate that alfalfa production could be established on acid soils with application of liming material and rhizobial inoculation with suitable S. meliloti strain which is tolerant to acid soil conditions. Our results suggest that strain 2011 could be acid tolerant strain and could be used for inoculation of alfalfa on acid soils. Application of limestone on inoculated plots, irrespective of the strain used, had significantly positive effect on DM and CP yield in both experimental years while AV showed slowly liming effect.

The testing of the indicators with the recommended ENVASSO methodology was carried out on the Szent István University Experimental Farm pilot area. The results of the field scale measurements with the national ones were compared. Strong correlation between organic matter content, soil types and microbial respiration was found on national and field scale as well. Based on the TIM data national threshold values were determined. Keywords: soil monitoring, organic matter, microbial respiration, bulk density, indicators, TIM, ENVASSO Introduction The purpose of soil monitoring is to record temporal and spatial changes of soil properties. Official frameworks for soil monitoring exist in most member states of the European Union (Morvan et al., 2007, Várallyay, 2007). The use of a harmonized methodology is essential to provide data which is comparable among sites and between countries. On European level the Environmental Assessment of Soil for Monitoring (ENVASSO) Project targeted to develop detailed harmonized methodology to follow up changes in soil properties. The selection of indicators was based on the eight threats defined in the 2002 Communication „Towards a Thematic Strategy on Soil Protection” by the EC (European Commission, 2002). Organic matter decline and loss of biodiversity were among these threaths. The „top three” selected indicators for soil monitoring networks at European level for these properties are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Organic matter content (%) is determined in many</p><p id="Pg347">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 348 European countries, however for organic matter stock (t ha-1) calculation bulk density is missing from the measured indicators in most countries (Figure 1.). The Hungarian Soil Information and Monitoring System (TIM) is among the best performing monitoring systems in Europe, providing valuable data especially related to organic matter, bulk density, and biodiversity. The same unique situation exist for nationwide microbiological respiration measurement. Figure 1. Coverage of area with appropriate data for monitoring of organic carbon content and stock in Europe and in Hungary (Morvan et al., 2007) The objective of this study was to test the ENVASSO recommended methodology and to compare the results with existing data from the national monitoring system for organic matter and microbial respiration, and the relationship between these indicators. Materials and methods TIM is a national soil conservation program with the purpose to determine and monitor changes in soil quality. The basic chemical, physical and biological measurements have been carried out since 1992 on 1237 sites of which 865 are in agricultural land; 183 are in forested areas; and 189 are on problematic (special) areas (TIM, 1995). In TIM soil organic matter (SOM) content and soil microbial respiration are measured every 3rd year. SOM content was determined by the Tjurin based Székely method (MSZ-08 0210 77, 1978). For microbial respiration soil moisture content was determined at field-moist state and samples were analyzed with infrared analyzer after aerobic incubation (ISO 16072:2002(E) 5.4, TIM, 1995). The Hungarian pilot area selected for the ENVASSO Project was the Experimental Farm of Szent István University in Northern Hungary (Józsefmajor), which is</p><p id="Pg348">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 349 representative of the Eastern Central European loess areas and is experiencing decline of organic matter, biodiversity and degradation of soil structure due to natural and tillage erosion (Szegi et al., 2004). Sampling was carried out in three replicates in May of 2007. SOM content was determined by Walkley-Black titrimetric method. For microbial respiration soil moisture content was determined at field-moist state and determination of CO2 release was carried out by pressure measurement in a static system (ISO 16072:2002(E) 5.6). Results and discussion Figure 2. Microbial respiration (mg CO2 100gr soil -1 hr -1 ) on TIM sites versus soil types and soil organic matter categories (%) The Székely determination method of SOM used by TIM is different from the ENVASSO suggested dry combustion method, however the studies on the comparison of methodologies on the projects samples showed that the TIM results are convertible (Hegymegi et al., 2007). The strong correlation between soil organic matter content and soil microbial respiration was proven also on a smaller scale at the pilot area, which results show the same trend as data from TIM database.

Based on the results from the TIM database we can conclude that a strong correlation exist between organic matter content and microbial respiration, which is shown also at the field scale experiment.

H-2103 Gödöllő, Hungary, dobolyi.csaba@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: Wastes of oil refineries contain potentially dangerous chemicals for the environment. The toxicity of these wastes, beside chemical analytical methods, should be described by comprehensive ecotoxicological tests as well. We carried out the characterization of the very toxic waste spent caustic stems from the desulphurization process by investigating the effects of spent caustic on the growth of a special eucaryotic symbiosis. The untreated spent caustic was shown to be highly toxic while the catalytically treated liquid proved to be toxic only by our ecotoxicological test method. The results are consistent with those of conventional Pseudomonas test in case of the primary and catalytically treated samples as well. Introduction The role of ecotoxicological tests in the qualification of industrial, agricultural and communal wastes has increased in recent years. The liquid waste spent caustic, which forms in desulphurization processes in petroleum refineries, contains a lot of inorganic compounds extremely toxic to the environment. And the results of catalytically treatment of the waste to reduce its risks are also questionable. Therefore, we attempted to increase the reliability of the result of the traditional ecotoxicological method of Pseudomonas test with simultaneous application of a newly developed mycorrhiza test (Barna et al., 2006). The introduction of a test based on the growth of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) promised a step forward towards the optimal testing of environmental toxicity because AM, with its growth and development, integrates the physiological processes of a higher plant and an eukaryotic microbe, the fungus Glomus in a real symbiosis (Simon et al., 1993; Villányi et al., 2006). The arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis can be resistant to some environmental stresses, e. g. drought (Füzy et al., 2007) and salinity (Füzy et al., 2006; Juniper and Abbott, 1993). On the other hand this symbiosis is very sensitive to some toxic factors (Criquet et al., 2000; McGonigle and Fitter, 1990). Moreover, in some cases, drought and salinity have a symbiotic effect on mycorrhizal growth and development (Rozema et al., 1986; Ruiz-Lozano and Azcon, 2000). Materials and methods Refinery wastewater The chemically treated spent caustic is a liquid waste of Duna Refinery of MOL corp. in Százhalombatta. It is the end-product of a heterogeneous catalytic oxidation. Due to NaOH extraction applied for sulphide containing compounds removal from fuels, the untreated spent caustic contains corrosive components (mercaptans), so sodium sulphides (Na2S) are performed in wet conditions. This waste is treated by the above mentioned catalytic oxidation to the value of 5000-10000 mg/l chemical oxygen</p><p id="Pg351">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 352 demand (COD) and pH: 12. The treated spent caustic contains surplus alkalic, the sulphates from sulphide oxidation and residual sulphide. Odor derives from the non transformed mercaptan H2S and (NH4)2S. The heavy metal content is not noticeable. The COD burden of this highly alcalic (pH: 12.4) wastewater was 11840 mg/L. Test plant For the production of mycorrhiza, we used 1 month old tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) previously grown under sterile conditions. The experiment was performed at 20 C°-on, in 60 % humidity with daily 12 hours illumination in climate chambers (Pék et al., 2007). Preparation of wastewater extract Samples of 100 ml wastewater was combined with 900 ml 1 % DMSO and shaked for 15 minutes. Preparation of plant experiments Sterilized peat and perlit were mixed at a ratio of 9:1, dried. We added 200 g of the mixture into each of the pots. Then, Knopp solution was given to produce saturated humidity. The Knopp solution also contained the appropriately diluted toxic extract as well. Mikorrhiza-free tomato plants grown from seeds were planted into these pots. Inoculation of soil with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus The inoculation material was soil mixed with cropped stem of tomato, in which AM fungi were previously grown (Trouvelot et al., 1986). Thus, inoculation was performed from infective propagula (intraradical and extramatrical micelium, arbusculum, vesiculum, spore). The advantage of this method is its simplicity because no spores are to be isolated repeatedly. Results and discussion The dilutions of 5x and 10x of the untreated spent caustic totally inhibited the mycorrhizal growth. These results were completely same to those of Pseudomonas tests. The 25x dilution of this extract also strongly inhibited the growth of mycorrhiza, i. e. the intensity of mycorrhizal growth (M %) was strongly repressed, either the arbuscularity was totally inhibited. In the presence of 50x dilution both the intensity and the arbuscularity appeared but they were strongly repressed. The growth and development of the symbiosis affected by 100x and 250x dilutions of the untreated wastewater showed to be totally same as that of the control organisms. These two dilutions did not inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas either (Table 1.).</p><p id="Pg352">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 353 Table 1.

The 5x dilution of this mixture totally inhibited the mycorrhizal growth concerning both symbiotic parameters. On the effect of 10x dilution the intensity of the mycorrhiza was strongly repressed and the arbuscularity was totally inhibited. In the presence of 25x dilution of the treated spent caustic both the intensity and arbuscularity did not have any inhibitory affect on the mycorrhizal intensity. The dilutions 100x and 250 x rates did not inhibit the arbuscularity either, while in the case of 50x dilution some 70 % of arbuscula developed in the tomato roots (Table 2.). The results of the experimental tomato-mycorrhiza test showed a definite correlation with those of the standard Pseudomonas fluorescens test. Exception was found only in the effect of 10x dilution on the intensity of tomato-mycorrhiza symbiosis. Table 2.

Of the measurable physiological parameters, the intensity of mycorrhiza is</p><p id="Pg353">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 354 reliable for its reproducibility. The advantage of the other examined parameter, arbuscularity, is its higher sensitivity.

The respiration of root and rhizomicrobial component was higher than basal respiration in most of the growing period, the ratio increased from 0.24 to 3.39 following the temperature and vegetation’s activity. Root respiration gave a very steep gradient response to changes in soil water content (SWC) range, characteristic under droughts, showing optimum response in SWC range, seldom occurring in the field. On the other hand, roots can access soil water in deeper layers during dry periods, therefore the strong dependence of root respiration on root water content could explain significant part of variations in respiration by drougth stressed ecosystems. Keywords: carbon balance, soil respiration, root respiration Introduction Soil respiration is the second largest part of the ecosystem carbon balance (Kuzyakov, 2006) and a large part of this CO2 efflux is released by roots. Soil respiration used to be modelled as a function of the soil temperature (Lloyd – Taylor, 1994), but more factors could have effect on it, depending on climate and vegetation type. In some cases water shortage could be the most limitation factor on respiration processes, especially in dry ecosystems, where droughts are frequent in the vegetation period, like in temperate grasslands in Hungary (Murakeözy et al., 2003; Fekete et al., 1988; Tuba et al., 1996). Long-term dry periods can turn from sink to source activity the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 in dry grasslands (Nagy et al., 2005), because water shortage is more effective in decreasing CO2 assimilation than soil respiration. This carbon loss may originate at least partially, from the „old” carbon content, providing a positive feedback between soil respiration and increasing frequency and severity of drought events caused by global change. Other abiotic and biotic factors also can influence SR, as soil physical properties, CO2 uptake by leaves, or the soil management in the case of agricultural soils (Kristóf et al., 2007; Zsembeli – Kovács, 2007). Soil respiration is a compounded process, in spite being often interpreted as a onecomponent source of CO2, depending primarily on temperature. According to Kuzyakov (2006), we can separate five main parts of soil respiration as root, rhizomicrobial respiration, microbial respiration of dead plant residues, SOM derived basal respiration and priming effect. These parts have different response to the environmental factors and it is difficult to find appropriate methods to separate them. In this study we investigated the ratio of root and rhizomicrobial respiration and basal respiration in soil respiration and the effect of water shortage on root respiration. Materials and methods Soil respiration measurements were made in Bugacpuszta, root respiration was measured in the lab of Szent István University (SZIU), Gödöllő. Bugacpuszta</p><p id="Pg355">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 356 (46°41’31”N, 19°36’06”E, 113 m a.s.l.), Hungary, represents one of the westernmost occurrence of the Eurasian steppe zone. The climate is temperate continental and the soil is a chernozem type sandy soil. The annual precipitation is 562 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10.4 C. The vegetation is semi-arid sandy grassland, main species are Festuca pseudovina, Carex stenophylla, and Salvia pratensis. The study site is a part of the Kiskunság National Park and has been under extensive management (grazing) for the last 20 years. For investigating the effect of the temperature, soil respiration was measured on bare soil (without roots, SRbare) and rooted soil (SR) occasionally from November 2005 to May 2006 about midday by using a LI-6400 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) and a soil respiration chamber. Soil collars were not used. Grass was cut from every plot two hours before starting the measurements. SR was measured on three different plots each time. Small grassland monoliths (10*10*15 cm in size) were transplanted and kept under controlled light (12 hours long and at 400 mol m-2 s-1 light intensity) and a temperature of 25°C for one month in the lab of SZIU, Gödöllő. Soil water content of the samples was maintained in the range of 0.15-0.2 m3m-3. The same gas analyzer was used for the root respiration measurements. From the beginning of the measurements, 3 samples were kept unirrigated, stopping the irrigation by 2 days intervals over the 10 days period thereby producing a series of soil water content ranges. Soil particles were removed from the roots on a sieve before the measurements. Root water content was calculated using the fresh and dry weight of the samples by thermogravimetric method, similarly to the leaf water content of the semidesert grassland species (Maróti et al., 1984). Soil water content was measured by TDR reflectometer (ML-2, Delta-T Devices Co., Cambridge, UK). The main aim of the root respiration measurements was to know the effect of the drought on root respiration. Results and discussion Average SR and SRbare values of the growing season 2006 followed that of Ts (Fig. 1.), minimum values of SRbare and SR during the study period were 3.1767 mol CO2 m -2 s-1 on 16/05/2006 and 9.67 mol CO2 m -2 s-1 on 16/05/2006, maximum values of SRbare and SR were 0.826 mol CO2 m -2 s-1 on 28/04/2006 and 0.212 mol CO2 m -2 s-1 on 03/03/2006, respectively. Ts ranged from -1.49 to 26.64 oC. SR and SRbare were fitted against Ts using an exponential function: SRbare= 0.565331*exp(0.0596707*Ts) r 2= 0.57 SR= 0.7*exp(0.123015*Ts) r2= 0.69 On the base of these equations SR and SRbare values were estimated for five different temperatures (Fig. 1), and root and rhizomicrobial respiration (RRMR) was calculated from modeled SR by subtracting modeled SRbare (basal respiration, BR) values. The ratio of the root and rhizomicrobial/basal respiration was changed during the growing period following the increase in temperature and root and above ground biomass. In winter, when soil temperature was low (~0°C) the basal respiration was higher than root and rhizomicrobial respiration, the RRMR/BR ratio was 0.24, while at 20°C the ratio was 3.39. Moyano et al. (2007) found different ratio between the rhizosphere and basal</p><p id="Pg356">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 357 repiration, in their study the basal respiration accounted for more then 60% of the total soil respiration during the vegetation period. Figure 1. Modeled root and rhizomicrobial respiration and basal respiration Root respiration Minimum and maximum values of root respiration were 0 and 15 nmol CO2 g d.m. -1 s-1 , respectively. Fig. 2. shows the measured root respiration values as a function of the root water content (RWC) and soil water content (SWC). The root respiration is strongly depended on water content. A linear relationship was fitted in the first case (y = 0.9423+3.7917*x, r2=0.5831) and a cubic polynom in the second (y= 0.131597+78.137*x+(-60.354*x2)+( -266.827*x3), r2= 0.5839). Both of them increasing rapidly at low water contents, but at high soil water content (above 0.3 m3 m-3) the root respiration decreasing with the SWC after a plateau. This high SWC means that soil pores are filled with water, perhaps the decreasing respiration is caused by the low oxygen concentration of soil. Soil water content values at the Bugac site ranges between 0.4-0.16 m3m-3 in during the vegetation period and root respiration could change by a factor of 5 in this range. Figure 2. Root respiration vs. root water content and soil water content Conclusions Partitioning soil respiration and information on its component responses to different environmental drivers is important for modeling ecosystem carbon balance. Generally,</p><p id="Pg357">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 358 soil respiration is estimated as a function of soil temperature, but our result suggest that models of soil respiration should also use other factors like soil water content and daily photosynthetic input for achieving better predictions. Strong dependence of root respiration on soil water content has been shown, suggesting this component as the one changing most dynamically and thereby probably responsible for significant part of variation in respiration of frequently drought stressed ecosystems. Root and rhizomicrobial respiration is a determinig fraction of soil respiration during the growing period. Variations in root respiration rate due to water shortage, or changes in NPP can cause diurnal fluctuations in ecosystem respiration processes and it can explain the often observed weak relationship between the soil respiration and soil temperature. Further, it may also partially account for the increased respiration activity after rain events.

Calcareous and dolomite mould and rocky karst terrain are the most common soil types on the island’s pastures. Large areas of pastures on these soil types are exposed to vegetation succession with species of genus Juniperus, which lead to macchia domination. Because of inappropriate grazing management and abandonment of traditional sheep farming models, pastures on island are endangered habitats. Research of dynamics of rocky pasture vegetation was carried out by remote sensing technique. Vegetation dynamics research showed that rocky pasture area on the island of Pag in period from 1963 to 2004 has reduced by 25.08 km 2 . Key words: GIS, remote sensing, land use, pastures, rocky soil Introduction Pastures are habitats of extremely high biodiversity, landscape importance and value because they are home for many rare and endangered plant and animal species. Because of inappropriate grazing management and abandonment of traditional sheep farming models, pastures on island are endangered habitats. Calcareous and dolomite mould and rocky karst terrain are the most common soil types in pastures on the island of Pag. Large areas of pastures on these soil types are exposed to vegetation succession with species of genus Juniperus, which lead to macchia domination. This could have impact on change in land use (Szirmai and Czóbel, 2006). Abandonment of agricultural production caused sequential loss of traditional patterns of rocky pastures (Gurevitch et al., 2002). Change in stocking rate leads to succession and loss of agricultural land (Biondi et al., 2005). Process of pasture degradation is the case in other Mediterranean areas (Saïd 2001). According to applicability of GIS technology and remote sensing techniques on the assessments of Earth surface on many levels (Tamás et al., 2007; Yuan, 2008), they are used in research of sheep grazed pastures on the island of Pag. Same techniques are used for optimal natural resource management (Neményi and Milics, 2007; Tóth et al., 2007). Research results contribute to improvement of agricultural production, and conservation of environmental, as well as biological and landscape diversity on the island of Pag. Materials and methods The island of Pag (285 km2) is situated on transition between eu-Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean climate zone (Figure 1). On sub-Mediterranean rocky pastures on the island of Pag, plant alliance Chrysopogoni-Satureion Horvat i Horvatić is the most prevalent, and includes two dominant communities: Asphodelo-Chrysopogonetum</p><p id="Pg359">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 360 Horvatić (As.-Ch.) and Stipo-Salvietum Horvatić (St.-Sa.). Both plant communities are developed on limestone rocky and soil poor land. Research of dynamics of rocky pasture vegetation was carried out by remote sensing technique. Figure 1. Research area and classes of land cover on the satellite image SPOT-5. In process of exploration of succession stages of macchia, maps from three different periods from years 1963, 1997 and 2004 are used. Starting point is set from vegetation map on the island of Pag (Horvatić, 1963) which was digitized and georefferenced in the 5th zone of Gauss-Krüger coordinate geosystem. Areas of analysed vegetation type’s were visually interpreted and polygonised in a vector form prepared for spatial analysis. Spatial analysis of data included calculations of areas of specific plant association and its succession stage and additional analysis of its change. Further succession changes of mentioned plant associations were interpreted on analysis of orthophoto image from 1997, and satellite image SPOT-5 acquired 2004. Orthophoto image with spatial resolution 0.5 m was acquired in proportion 1:20,000. Using method of visual interpretation of orthophoto from 1997, areas of different succession stages and overgrown plant communities were polygonised as change in time shift of 34 years. Spatial resolution of SPOT-5 image is 5 m, and spectral resolution of 6 bands; panchromatic 0.49-0.69µm, VIS (for vegetation) B0 0.43-0.47 µm, VIS B1 0.50-0.59 µm, VIS B2 0.61-0.68 µm, VIS B3 0.78-0.89 µm and SWIR 1.58-1.75 µm. For the following time period of 7 years, succession change has been recorded, and sub-classified into two succession intensities: SI1 and SI2. Succession stage SI1 represents higher succession level (more overgrown) and SI2 represents lower succession level. Software Erdas Imagine 8.7 (Leica) was used for raster data analysis. Vector data was analyzed with ArcView 9.0 (ESRI) software. Sample check “ground truth” was obtained in the field survey and included in photo documentation, botanical determination and GPS positioning of characteristic representative places of importance, what is common praxis in supervision of point and polygon field data (Németh et al., 2007). Results and discussion Data acquired by digital interpretation were analysed based on area calculation and change detection. Same method was performed in vegetation succession quantification on the west part of Sao Paulo in Brasil (Durigan and Ratter, 2006). In 1963, rocky pasture community As.–Ch. area was the size of 79.38 km2 or 28.12% of total Pag island area. Further, area of both pasture communities was the size of 122.30 km2 or</p><p id="Pg360">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 361 43.33% of total island area. On some parts of rocky pasture communities, shrub areas under Juniperus sp. and Quercus ilex L. were classified (Table 1). Table 1. Proportion of shrub area under Juniperus sp. and holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) on rocky pastures on the island of Pag (1963). Within community Stipo-Salvietum Within community AsphodeloChrysopogonetum Within rocky pastures (both communities) Part of total island area Juniperus sp. 1,59 km2 (3,70%) 0,18 km2 (0,23%) 1,77 km2 (1,45%) 14,72 km 2 (5,21%) Quercus ilex L. 9,59 km2 (22,34%) 0,53 km2 (0,67%) 10,12 km2 (8,27%) 10,12 km 2 (3,59%) Areas overgrown by Juniperus sp. and holm oak shrubs are more spread in community St.-Sa. than in As.-Ch. Further, area under rocky pastures (includes two communities) in 1963 was without influence of progressive succession and amounted to 110.41 km2 or 39.12% of the island area (Figure 2). Interpretation of orthophoto from 1997 disclosed that in 34 years, progressive succession had significant impact where 37.36 km2 or 13.24% of the island area was covered by succession stage of macchia. Within rocky pasture borders, 24.08 km2 were covered by succession stage of macchia (Figure 3). Total area of succession free rocky pastures was 91.32 km2 or 32.35% total island area (Figure 2). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 rocky pastures succession maquis forest/maquis other vegetation p e rc e n ta g e o f co v e r (% ) 1963 1997 2004 Figure 2. Proportion of total area of rocky pastures and succession stage of macchia on the island of Pag (1963, 1997 and 2004). Digital interpretation of satellite image SPOT-5 from 2004 obtained and classified two intensity stages of macchia where 9.17 km2 or 3.25% of the island area was covered with SI1 (more overgrown) and 37.40 km2 or 13.25% of the island area with SI2 (less overgrown) macchia. Both succession stages (SI1 and SI2) overtook 46.57 km2 or 16.50% of total Pag island area (Figure 2). Within rocky pasture borders, 7.18 km2 were overgrown by SI1, while 22.60 km2 by macchia succession stage SI2 (Figure 3). Areas of pasture plant communities, not overtaken by succession processes (SI1 or SI2), amounted to 85.33 km2 or 30.23% of total Pag island area (Figure 2). The area of</p><p id="Pg361">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Conclusions Vegetation dynamics research showed that rocky pasture area (AsphodeloChrysopogonetum Horvatić and Stipo-Salvietum) on the island of Pag in period from 1963 to 2004 has reduced by 25.08 km2. Area of macchia succession stage on rocky pastures (As.-Ch. and St.-Sa.) has increased by 17.89 km2, while forest area takes 7.19 km2. Anthropogenic activity and impact on rocky pastures descends; thus, large areas are under the influence of progressive succession which can lead to a loss of indigenous habitats and biodiversity.

We investigated the correlation between the types of farms and their agreement on the prohibition on the acquisition of ownership over agricultural and forest land by foreign physical person and by corporate farmers. Keywords: transitional restriction, land market, foreign land ownership, land turnover Introduction The Hungarian land market is in the process of development; the prices of land are times lower compared to land prices in EU Member States. Because of their lower income Hungarian farmers do not have substantial possibilities to acquire ownership over land like EU farmers. In order to preserve the socio-economic agricultural structure from shocks that might arise from the differences in land prices and income with the rest of the Union, Hungary during the accession negotiations received a period of 7 years exemption from EU rules with respect to the free movement of capital for the purpose of purchasing agricultural land1 (Fehér, 2003). Materials and methods Analysis of the official resources showed the lack of updated data on the land market in Hungary. The authors made a significant effort to collect latest information on the agricultural land market in Hungary. In December 2006 a questionnaire was developed and tested with some farmers. Based on the first tests some modification were made and discussed with representatives of two main farmer’s organization types (individual and corporate farms). On April 2007 438 usable questionnaires were returned from the seven Hungarian regions and data was entered into SPSS 14.0 for Windows, the statistical analysis software package. The Chi-Square test was used for hypothesis test of independence between types of farms and agreement on the prohibition the acquisition of ownership over agricultural and forest land by foreign physical person. The Cramer’s contingency coefficient was used to determine strength of the relationship between two variables. For the analysis we used Wilcoxon test to explore the relationship between characteristics of land turnover between 1994-2004 and following the enlargement. 1 According to the Act LV of 1994 on Agricultural Land, neither legal entity (domestic and foreign), nor domestic organizations without legal entity nor foreign private person can own land in Hungary.</p><p id="Pg363">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 364 Results and discussion An analysis on farmer’s opinion concerning the ban on foreign land ownership revealed that less than 8% did not agree with the prohibition of foreigners. The opinion about corporate farms were more positive than about individual ones (figure 1.). These results clearly reflect the general public opinion towards the liberalization of the land market. Nowadays in Hungary, it seems that there is no political acceptance of foreign land ownership.

Arguments for and against prohibition on acquisition of land by corporate farmers Arguments Farm’s category against the prohibition for the prohibition Individual farms  Due to the private persons, i.e. members of corporate farms, corporate farms can also purchase land actually, being obliged to put it in rent for the enterprise afterwards;  Because of unequal opportunities;  Only if certain regulations on size and obligations on functioning are established.  The owner is unknown, and can change easily.  Acquisition of land by corporate farms makes small farms go bankrupt;  No need for “latifundias” but the viability of rural areas must be maintained. Corporate farms  The ban contradicts the principal of capital and land concentration, and conserves the unviable economic size;  Because of livestock farms not having land, they cannot have safety in activity conditions;  Land leasing means retiring capital from agriculture;  The current regulation favours private investors, distorts land market, and repels the most important customers.  Companies strong in capital (owned by banks or having foreign interests) are able to “knock out” easily national ones, which are known for not being extremely capitalist in their “mission statement”;  Revenues of joint ventures do not provide enough funds for acquiring land. If there is so, it is probably financed by common resources;  With the ban abolished, farms can be owned by foreigners.

Land turnover before and after EU accession Generally, the land market is still inactive presently in Hungary. The proportion of land sold in Hungary now is 1,7% (Kapronczai et al., 2005). It shows that the agricultural land mobility has mainly decreased during the last 10 years. Conclusions More than 92% of the respondents agreed with the prohibition on foreign land ownership. Arguments against foreign ownership seemed to be based more on emotion and spirituality than on aspects of economics. One of the several arguments against foreign land ownership is for example to avoid speculation, although prohibition of land sale to foreigners is against of the Union basic four freedoms. The three-fourth of the managers of corporate farms and less than one-fourth of the heads of private farms disagreed with the prohibition on the acquisition of ownership over agricultural and forest land by corporate farmers. According to the respondents, there was almost no significant change in the dynamics of land turnover between 1994-2004 and following the enlargement. The majority of Hungarian farmers have been unable to buy land. Meanwhile the agriculturally unskilled, “compensated” landowners unable to cultivate their land, became interested in selling or leasing of their land.

Consequently, the export chances are in many cases endangered. The heterogeneity of crop quality and quantity is first of all due to the diverse features and nutritive contents of our soils even within one plot. The farmers have to find the appropriate technology and means by which the problem can be solved. The application of precision crop growing can be reasonable on heterogeneous soils. The aim of the present large-scale experiment is to examine the impact of precision nutritive deliveries on crop quality and quantity and to determine up to what extent the opportunities offered by precision method crop farming testify our hopes in practice. Keywords: precision method crop production, crop quality and quantity, soil heterogeneity, crop year impact Introduction The mainly dry, continental weather of our country is ideal for winter wheat growing. Our accession to the EU forces an even harder competition on the agricultural producers, state Töth et al. (2006). Only high quality Hungarian wheat can be exported to the grain markets of the West- and South European countries. According to Marton (2006) the Hungarian average wheat crop is low due to the inadequate nutrient deliveries. In his opinion the 5 t/ha average crop can be surely marketable only in case of outstanding quality. The bakeries demand a more and more homogeneous and high quality raw material only. The success of winter wheat prodduction depends both on crop quantiy and quality. Considering the efficiency of production Pepó (2002) thinks it important to harmonize ecological, biological and agrotehcnical factors. Besides wheather conditions the soil is of vital importance among the abiotic environmental factors determining crop quantity and quality (Szabó et al., 2005). Statistically significant differences for traits were found among genotypes (G), environments (E) and for interaction term GxE, except for the grain yield and wet gluten content (Drezner et al. 2007). According to Tamás (2001) the crop quantity of a cultivated plant is the collective result of genetical, ecological and technological factors and can vary notably even within a given parcel depending on the conditions of the production area. The application of precision method nutrition delivery is first of all grounded by the diversity of the production area. In Hungary composite soil-scientific conditions are characteristic. Due to Marton (2006) the significance of the precision technology lies in the handling of diverse nutrition provisions within a parcel. Materials and methods The site of the experiment, Gyöngyöspata is situated at the foot of the Mátra, 12 km from Gyöngyös. The production area characteristics of the farm examined regarding wheat growing can be considered good on the whole, but the diverse relief, microclimate and type of soil make the farming difficult. The aim of the large-scale experiment is to find out if the location-specific crop production is able to reduce the</p><p id="Pg367">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 368 intense heterogeneity of crop quantity and quality of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) due to the diverse production areal conditions experienced so far. The experiment has been conducted by field splitting method, on two parcels divided by a road. Thanks to this fact the climate conditions can be considered constant. The parallel examination of the two fields was necessary as the winter wheat can be sown no longer than two years to the same place without substantial crop reduction. 50 ha area has been marked out on each field so the experiment is conducted on 100 ha. The same production technology has been applied on the splitted experimental area except for nutritive delivery only in order to avoid too many variables. On the field part regarded control an equal quantity of fertilizer has been distributed by the traditional method while on the other part the location-specific nutritive delivery method has been applied. Only one variety, the Mv Magdaléna which is wide-spread in the area has been used in the experiment in order to ensure that the quality parameters can be compared annually. In the first year preparations for the experiment have been carried out, the contours of the fields have been recorded by GPS and the nutrition-content charts of the areas have been prepared on the basis of soil analysis. In the second year winter wheat has been grown on the parcel called Ebhát only. A crop chart of the harvest has been prepared. Besides quantitative data data concerning crop quality have been collected by random sampling, with given GPS co-ordinates. The data of the first year have been analysed. Results and discussion According to the results of the analysis (Table 1) among the quality parameters the relative deviation remained below 10 % in each case in the year 2006/2007. The quality can be considered homogeneous within parcel in this year. During the vegetation period of 2006/2007 the quantity of rainfall was not more than 307 mm. There is a negative correlation between the gluten and protein contents of the crop and the dry vintage, the good quality parameters are most probably due to this fact. The relative deviation of crop quantity within parcel was 27%. During the analysis of maps showing the nutrition-ability of the plot the quantity of two nutritives – P2O5 and Cu – has been found critical in respect of successful production. The deviation of P2O5 within plot is 42,86 % which can notably influence the crop.

Cereal Research Communications 370 In order to identify the connection between crop quantity and the nutrition-ability of soil correlation calculations have been made (Figure 1-2). In the case of phosphorous and crop quantity the correlation coefficient is R=+0,74 which means a very strong connection. In the case of copper and crop quantity only a moderately strong relationship has been found (R=+0,61). Conclusions The precision charts drawn on the nutritive content of soil have proved the heterogeneity of the experimental area in respect of P2O5 and Cu. When analyzing the 2007 yield map of winter wheat it has been stated that the average crop of the experimental site is 3,38 t/ha. The relative deviation of crop quantity is 42 %. The quantity of rainfall in the vegetation period of 2006-2007 is 307 mm. The dry vintage had a positive effect on the quality parameters examined in the experiment, the relative deviation of the quality parameters did not exceed 10 % this year. Examining crop quantiy and the P2O5 correlation coefficient a very strong (R=+0,74), while in case of Cu only a limitedly strong (R = +0,61) connection could be stated. After the harvest of the first year of the experiment it can be stated that further basic information is needed for learning the processes taking place in the area. The analysis of the genetical soil map and the weededness can lead to further conclusions. The analysis of crop quality can be completed by including further quality parameters – W value, Hagberg falling number – in the survey.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 371 INFLUENCE OF NITROGEN FERTILIZATION ON SUGAR BEET ROOT YIELD AND QUALITY Suzana KRISTEK1 – Andrija KRISTEK1 – Martin EVAČIĆ2 1 Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: skristek@pfos.hr 2 CBA International, Koturaška cesta 69, Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: During 2006 and 2007 we studied influence of growing nitrogen quantities in fertilization of sugar beet on root yield and quality. The experiment was set up in 5 different variants of fertilization: G0 – 54 kg N ha-1 (fertilization based on the soil analysis to obtain 70-80 t ha -1 root yield); G1 – 81 kg N ha -1 ; G2 – 108 kg N ha -1 ; G3 – 135 kg N ha -1 ; 162 kg N ha -1 (increase by 27 kg ha -1 for each further variant). In the terms of climate investigation years were significantly different. First year was level with multiyear average, and the second one was dry and hot. In the year that climatically do not vary from multiyear average, average root yield and sugar yield were increasing significantly by the variant G2, with stagnation and decrease afterwards. Sugar content started decreasing significantly even from the variant G1. In dry and warm season root and sugar yield started decreasing from the variant G0, and sugar content after variant G2. Hybrids similarly reacted to nitrogen fertilization increase. Keywords: sugar beet, nitrogen fertilization, yield, quality Introduction Importance of nitrogen in nutrition of sugar beet is found to be crucial. Nitrogen is a yield carrier, and element that influence root quality. Sugar beet absorb nitrogen in considerable quantities, but optimum quantity is set within limited range. In increased nitrogen supply sugar beet absorb nitrogen wastefully, with negative effect to production results. Due to the facts nitrogen fertilization should be accurate to compensate supplies in the soil. The highest nitrogen quantities (above 85%) sugar beet absorb in short time, which brings up an issue of type of fertilization (Westermann, 1980; Ungai and Győri, 2007), influence of weather conditions, and soil conditions too (Lauer, 1995; Houba et al., 1995; Birkás et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2007; Rutkoviene et al., 2007). Factor that question determination of nitrogen fertilization according to early Nmin analysis (before sowing) is impossibility to exactly anticipate mobility of nitrogen from organic matter in the soil due to extremely long period between optimum time for fertilization and time for sugar beet digging. Due to the nitrogen fertilization that is in practice often too extensive we intended to determine influence of increased fertilization to root yield and quality by new genotypes of sugar beet. Materials and methods Investigations were conducted by setting up trials in 2006 and 2007 on Eutric Cambisols. According to chemical analyses the soil contained 2,39% humus, pHKCl = 5,22, with low phosphorus content (AL-P2O5=6.0 mg per 100 g soil), and high potassium content (AL-K2O=26.6 mg per 100 g soil). Required fertilization was calculated from 150 kg ha-1 P2O5 and K2O, and 156 kg ha -1 of nutrients were added by fertilization. By taking up samples in spring from the layer of 0-30 and 30-60 cm in depth for sugar beet yield of 70-80 t ha-1 required nitrogen fertilization of 54 kg ha-1 (G0) was determined and presowingly added by use of 200 kg ha -1 KAN (27% calcium amonium nitrate). In variants G1, G2, G3 i G4 the first top dressing was done by adding nitrogen in 2-4 true leaves phase (different KAN quantities). Second top dressing was</p><p id="Pg371">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 372 done in 6-8 true leaves phase of sugar beet development, in variants G3 and G4 applying different KAN quantities. Variants of nitrogen fertilization according to nitrogen quantities and application time: G0 – 54 kg N ha -1 (presowingly); G1- 54 kg N ha -1 (presowingly) + 27 kg N ha-1 (first top dressing); G2 - 54 kg N ha -1 (presowingly) + 54 kg N ha-1 (first top dressing); G3 - 54 kg N ha -1 (presowingly) + 54 kg N ha-1 (first top dressing) + 27 kg N ha-1 (second top dressing); G4 - 54 kg N ha -1 (presowingly) + 54 kg N ha-1 (first top dressing) + 54 kg N ha-1 (second top dressing). Five sugar beet hybrids were assessed in the trials. The trials were set up by completely randomised block design in 4 repetitions with basic plot while digging of 10 m2. After digging root yield was determined. In «Venema» laboratory of Kandit Premijer d.o.o. (Osijek, Croatia) sugar content, K, Na content and alpha amino N (AmN) were determined following standard methods. On the basis of these indicators pure sugar yield per hectare was calculated by Braunschweiger formula. Weather conditions in the years of investigation differed significantly. Precipitation values in 2006 were level with multiyear average which was favourable for sugar beet growth and development, whilst in 2007 drought with high temperatures prolonged to September. Results and discussion Root yield, sugar yield and sugar content were influenced by nitrogen fertilization, genotype and weather conditions. Higher root yield (Table 1.) and sugar yield (Table 2.) were obtained in climatically more favourable 2006. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 374 Weather conditions also influenced efficacy of added nitrogen doses. In 2006 increase in fertilization significantly increased average root yield by G2, then stagnated. In 2007, the highest root and sugar yield was obtained with G0 fertilization. As we stated, increase in fertilization caused yield decrease. Sugar content (Table 3.) in 2006 by increasing fertilization above G1 showed significant decrease. In the year of 2007, characterized by long-term drought with high temperatures, decrease in sugar content above G2 fertilization was recorded. In both investigation years the highest sugar content was obtained with the variant G0. Similar results were reported by Lauer (1995) and Houba et al. (1995). Conclusions On the basis of the studies we conclude that different levels of nitrogen fertilization were influenced both sugar beet yield and quality. Similarly, weather conditions in the period of sugar beet vegetation indicated a significant influence. In the first year of investigation (climatic parameters were level with multiyear average) the highest root and sugar yield were obtained in G2 fertilization variant, and in the second one (drought, high temperatures) in variant G0. Further increase in fertilization was really caused yield level stagnation or yield decrease. The highest sugar content in both investigation years was obtained in variant G0, although fertilization increase produced decrease in sugar content, and the lowest sugar content was assessed in the variant G4.

Andrija KRISTEK1 – Suzana KRISTEK1 – Stjepan GALOVIĆ2 1 Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: skristek@pfos.hr 2 Đakovština d.d.., Električne centrale 12, Đakovo, Croatia Abstract: During two-year studies we investigated influence of genotype and protection against pathogenic fungi Cercospora beticola Sacc. on root yield, sugar yield and sugar content. The experiments were set up on Eutric Cambisols in conditions of natural infection by cercospora in two variants: without application of fungicides, and with two-time fungicide application. In both trial years in all tested parameters significantly better results were achieved in the variant treated with fungicides. Keywords: sugar beet, Cercospora. beticola Sacc., fungicides, root yield, quality Introduction Leaf spot of sugar beet that is caused by fungi Cercospora beticola Sacc. regularly occur on our fields with more or less serious consequences. Intensity of infection and damage in production differ depending on ecological conditions in summer that are more or less favourable for development of the fungi, crop rotation, and hybrid sensitivity. Besides, condition of sugar beet plant also influence development of disease. Thus, plants with lower vigour being caused by irregular and disbalanced nutrition (Pytlarz-Kozicka, 2005; Kádár, 2007; Máthé-Gáspár et al., 2007), by drought, or by a root disease faster and more extensively become infected by cercospora. Due to the development of the fungi Cercospora beticola Sacc. assimilation surface and assimilation could be diminished up to 10 times, root yield up to 60%, sugar content 3 - 7%, with increase in K, Na and AmN, causing decrease in pure sugar yield by 42% (Matić and Đurđević, 1970; Smith and Campbell, 1996; Kristek et al., 2003, 2006; ). Infection also induces changes in portion of certain sugar beet parts, where intensive infection means higher sugar beet crown with larger portion in total yield. Furthermore, root of infected plants is kept from digging to the processing with more difficulties. Materials and methods Investigations were carried out in 2006 and 2007 to determine damages in sugar beet production by pathogenic fungi Cercospora beticola Sacc. depending on sensitivity – tolerance of single hybrids. 15 hybrids of plant breeders that put seeds on domestic market have been chosen for this experiment. The trials were set up on Eutric Cambisols in conditions of natural infection by cercospora in two variants. One variant without application of fungicides showed serious leaf damages, and the other that included fungicide application preserved leaves in vegetation preriod. First treatment was done when approximately 5 % plants became infected by disease (spots) in the third decade of July with combination of fungicides, as follows: Alto combi 420 SC – 0,5 l ha-1 (30% karbendazim + 12% ciprokonazol) and Fado – 0,5 l ha-1 (50% fentinhydroxide). Second treatment was done 20 days afterwards in the second decade of August with fungicide Artea 330 EC – 0,5 l ha-1 (25% propikonazol + 8% ciprokonazol). Digging (basic plot - 20 m2) was carried out in mid - October, and root</p><p id="Pg375">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 376 yield was determined. In «Venema» laboratory of Kandit Premijer d.o.o., Osijek, purity, sugar content, content of K, Na and alfa-amino N (AmN) were determined according to standard methods. On the basis of these indicators pure sugar yield per hectare was determined by Braunschweiger formula. Results and discussion Root and sugar yield, and sugar content were significantly influenced by application of fungicides and weather conditions. Higher root yield (Table 1.), sugar yield (Table 2.) and sugar content (Table 3.) were achieved in climatically more favourable 2006 (temperatures and rainfall corresponded to multiyear average). 2007 relative to 2006 was characterized by long-term drought with extremely high temperatures (June and July), with 31.8% lower root yield in treated variants, as well as 39.94% lower sugar yield and 11.06% lower sugar content. Difference between the years was also observed in non-treated variants. Thus, in 2007 relative to 2006 in non-treated variants root yield, sugar yield and sugar content were lower, as follows, 26.62%, 32.08%, and 6.19%. In both years of investigations in treated variants, relative to non-treated ones average root yield, average sugar yield and sugar content were higher, as follows 14.70%, 26.83%, and 8.68%.

Weather conditions also significantly influenced root and sugar yield, and sugar content. In the year 2006, climatically more favourable for sugar beet growth, significantly better results were achieved in all tested parameters in treated and nontreated variants. All hybrids achieved better production results in 2006 in treated variant. Production differences between hybrids were result of genetic diversity.

Investigations were carried out to determine genetic potential of fertility of tolerant hybrids on both, health soil, and soil infected with BNYVV virus. The trials were set up on Eutric Cambisols, on the plot with no BNYVV viruse detected, and on the plot infected with the virus. We used 10 tolerant and 2 sensitive hybrids during three yearinvestigations. On the basis of the triennial results all investigated parameters of sugar beet yield and quality on infected soil were found to be significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) in hybrids tolerant to rhizomania relative to the sensitive hybrids. The differences between the hybrids obtained on health soil were exclusively result of genetic diversity between the hybrids. Keywords: sugar beet, BNYVV virus, yield, quality Introduction Rhizomania is the most important disease of sugar beet worldwide, caused by beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), as described by Tamada and Baba (1973). This furovirus is transmitted by zoospores of the soil-borne fungus Polymyxa betae (Keskin, 1964). Severe rhizomania infections lead to reductions in root yield of 50% or more, whilst the sugar content and processing quality can be badly affected also (Paul et al., 1992; Heijbroek et al., 1999). Investigation results of many authors (Bürcky and Büttner, 1991; Paul et al., 1993; Koenig et al., 1994) showed that sensitive hybrids on infected soil had 40-65% lesser leaf mass, 65-67% lower chlorophyll content in leaves, and about 6% lower sugar content. Rhizomania infection depends on presence of Polymyxa betae in the soil. Adequate chemical, physical and microbiological soil properties influence required fertility, high share of high-quality agricultural products (Birkas et al., 2006; Várallay, 2006), and also presence of pathogenic microorganisms in soil (Tuitert, 1990; Blunt et al., 1991; Peng et al., 1997). Materials and methods Investigations were conducted by setting up trials in 2004, 2005 and 2006 on Eutric Cambisols. According to chemical analyses the soil contained 2,68 % humus, pHKCl = 6.03, with high phosphorus content (AL-P2O5=23.04 mg per 100 g soil), and high potassium content (AL-K2O=24.20 mg per 100 g soil). 12 sugar beet hybrids were included in the trials. 10 sugar beet hybrids were tolerant, and 2 were sensitive to the virus of rhizomania. The trials were set up by completely randomised block design in 4 repetitions with basic plot while digging of 20 m2. One trial-plot was not infected by the virus, while the other, only 500 m far, showed virus infection. In all three investigation years sowing was conducted in the second decade of March. The row spacing was 50 cm, with 20 cm within row. After digging root yield was determined. In «Venema» laboratory of Kandit Premijer d.o.o. (Osijek, Croatia) sugar content, K, Na content and alpha amino N (AmN) were</p><p id="Pg379">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 380 determined following standard methods. On the basis of these indicators pure sugar yield per hectare was calculated by Braunschweiger formula. Results and discussion Mean sugar beet root yield in tolerant hybrids in all three years of investigations, did not show significant differences referring to the health or infected soil (Table 1.). Differences between the hybrids were result of genetic diversity. No significant differences were found in sugar beet root yield between sensitive and tolerant hybrids on health soil. Mean sugar beet root yield in sensitive hybrids on infected soil in all three years of investigations, was significantly lower (p&lt;0.01) relative to the yield of tolerant hybrids. On both, health and infected soil differences in mean sugar yield values (Table 2.) in tolerant hybrids were result of genetic diversity between the hybrids, and not in different tolerance degree to BNYVV virus. On infected soil tolerant hybrids obtained, averagely, 9.44 t ha -1 or 402 % higher sugar yield than sensitive hybrids. Mean sugar content in sensitive hybrids (Table 3.) on infected soil was lower 6.63 % (rel. 42 %) relative to the tolerant hybrids. Paul et al. (1993) and Koenig et al. (1994) reported similar results. Table 1.

The best results were obtained by inoculation of sugar beet seed with the bacterium B. megaterium. Keywords: sugar beet, B. megaterium, P. ultimum, P. debarianum, yield Introduction Agronomists are faced with a growing problem of evolving resistance of soil pathogens to chemical fungicides. Also, there is an increasing sensitivity to the importance of health food production and rising awareness for environmental protection. Namely, all pesticides which are not biodegraded in the soil are being washed out in deeper layers causing eutrophication of underground waters. Therefore, natural resources and processes in the soil are widely used as an alternative to chemical fungicides. Sugar beet is a crop which is from the phases of emergence and germination to the first 2 - 4 true leaves phase (most sensitive phase) attacked by numerous pathogenic fungi that cause root decay of young sugar beet plants. Seed inoculation by the bacteria showing antagonistic activity against pathogenic fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani, P. ultimum, P. debarianum, Phoma betae and Aphanomyces cochlioides account for an alternative to chemical fungicides and an option of solving problem of disease control, not only in sugar beet, but in other, mainly vegetable crops. Many authors (Asaka and Shoda, 1996; Walker et al., 1998; Hýsek and Vach, 2006; Kristek et al., 2007; Baličević et al., 2007) studied control of these pathogens by benefit bacteria Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas fluorescens, as well as, benefit fungi Trichoderma harzianum which showed pronounced antagonistic activity against the aforesaid fungi. Since the benefit bacteria do not express sensitivity to the low fungicide doses (Pedersen et al., 2002), on the soils infected with the fungi – the root decay agents on sugar beet, positive effect was accomplished by combining seed inoculation with the benefit bacteria and the seed treatment with low doses of fungicides. Pathogenic fungi P. ultimum and P. debarianum are found to be the most serious issue, so the influence of the bacterium B. megaterium to the pathogenic fungi has been investigated. Materials and methods The experiment was set up on two soil types – Mollic Gleysols and Calcaric Fluvisols, with the presence of pathogenic fungi P. ultimum and P. debarianum detected from 2001 – 2005. In 2005 and 2006 the experiment was set up by completely randomised</p><p id="Pg383">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 384 block design in 4 repetitions and 4 various seed treating variants: 1. untreated seed; 2. Dithane S - fungicide treated seed (60% Mancozeb, 800 g 100 kg-1 seed); 3. seed treated with fungicide Dithane S (60% Mancozeb, 400 g 100 kg-1 seed) + inoculated with Bacillus megaterium (0.6 x 1010 bacteria ha-1); 4. seed inoculated with Bacillus megaterium (1.2 x 1010 bacteria ha-1). Soil analyses (Table 1.) were carried out by standard methods: organic matter content was determined by bichromate method, pH in H2O and KCl, phosphorus and potassium content by ammonium-lactate method according to Egner-Riehm-Domingo (Page, 1982). Table 1: Soil properties Type of soil Investigated field properties Mollic Gleysols Calcaric Fluvisols pH (H2O) 7.19 7.04 pH (KCl) 6.49 6.27 Humus (%) 3.38 2.31 P (mg per 100 g soil) 23.00 20.72 K (mg per 100 g soil) 25.88 19.95 Bacteriological culture (B. megaterium) applied in the experiment are from German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ). B. megaterium No 2894 was transferred from lyophilised into vegetative form, and multiplied on nutrient agar of the following composition: peptone 5.0 g, meat extract 3.0 g, agar 15.0 g, MnSO4 x H2O 10.0 mg, distilled water 1000.0 ml. Hybrid of Georgina (KWS) sugar beet was used in the sowing. In both investigation years sowing was conducted in the second decade of March. The row spacing was 50 cm, with 20 cm within row. Percent of the plants infected with pathogenic fungi P. ultimum and P. debarianum were stipulated in 2-4 true leaves phase. Sugar beet digging conducted in the mid October was followed by determination of root yield (t ha-1) and sugar content (%). Results and discussion The least number of infected and decayed plants in the 2 – 4 true leaves phase, on both soil types and in two years of investigation (Table 2.) was obtained with the variant 4. The remaining variants obtained statistically very significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher number of infected and decayed plants by pathogenic fungi P. ultimum and P. debarianum. The results obtained are in agreement with those of Whipps (2001) who reported that the plants inoculated with the benefit bacteria were characterized with rapid initial growth that enabled fast undergoing through the most vulnerable phase when the damage of the pathogen affecting was the most pronounced. Due to the pronounced antagonism of the bacterium to the root decay agent of sugar beet – fungi P. ultimum and P. debarianum high survival percentage of inoculated plants was obtained in comparison to the noninoculated ones and decrease in the damage of infected plants, which consequently, influenced sugar beet root yield. Root yield (Table 3.) showed highly significant positive correlation with sugar content values (r = 0.947). On both soil types and in both investigation years the highest average root yield values were obtained with the variant 4, while all remaining variants (except</p><p id="Pg384">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 385 variant 3 in the second year of investigation on Calcaric Fluvisols soil type) recorded statistically very significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower yield values.

E-mail: attila.muranyi@rissac.hu. Abstract: The goal of our research was to develop the phytoremediation technology by testing different treatments under field conditions. The experiment was based on the integrated improvement of physical, chemical and biological conditions of Gyöngyösoroszi spoil. 18 different phytoremediation treatments were tested. The highest chemical risk of Gyöngyösoroszi mine waste was found in case of Pb, Zn, Cd and As. The plots could be successfully vegetated. The biomass production of different treatments was largely different. Multi-level revitalization not only had high impact on the biomass production, but also reduced the heavy metal uptake of plants. The concept of the integrated phytoremediation technology proved to be an efficient tool to stabilize the surface of spoils by plants. Keywords: heavy metal uptake, phytoremediation technology, multi-level revitalization, rhizosphere soil. Introduction Mine wastes represent significant environmental hazards due to their heavy metal content (Komnitsas and Modis, 2006) as well as they are potential Chemical Time Bombs (Murányi, 2000). The uncovered surfaces of spoils are easily transported away by wind erosion. As a consequence of all these, it is important to stabilize the surfaces of mine wastes and to reduce the transport and mobilization of their heavy metal content. Phytostabilization is one of the best available technology to cover the bare spoils with plants (Bíró and Takács, 2007; Farsang et al., 2007). The goal of our research was to develop phytoremediation technology by testing different treatments and to test them under field conditions. Materials and methods The field experiment was carried out on the ground of Gyöngyösoroszi mine. This mine (Pb and Zn mine) has been closed a long time ago, but the problem of mine wastes has not been solved yet. This mine waste was used to develop the phytoremediation technology by integrated improvement of physical, chemical and microbiological conditions. Three large parcels were established. The oxidation of pyrite content of Gyöngyösoroszi mine waste resulted in pH values about 2.5. No plant can survive such a pH, therefore the mine waste was mixed with fly ash to increase the pH and to improve the physical status of the parcels. Fly ash was supposed to increase the pH up to the range where different plants can exist. One of the three large parcels was also treated with lime to decrease the mobilization of heavy metals and to prevent their plant uptake. The large parcels were divided into two parts: control part and treated part. On the treated part multi-level revitalization was applied to increase the efficiency of phytoremediation. Multi-level revitalization included nutrient application combined with microbial inoculation. Nutrient application covered inorganic nutrients (NPK fertilizer) as well as organic nutrients (molasses) (Barkóczi et al., 2007). The treated plots were inoculated with a complex inoculant as well (Petrisor et al., 2004).</p><p id="Pg387">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 388 Three productive plants were selected to stabilize the surface of Gyöngyösoroszi mine waste: grasses (mixture of selected species), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense). Altogether 18 different phytoremedation treatments were tested. I. parcel: Mine Waste without Fly Ash (FA). Control and untreated plot. 3 test plants. II. Mine Waste (MW) + Fly Ash (FA) without liming. Control and untreated plot. 3 test plants. III. Mine Waste (MW) + Fly Ash (FA) + Liming (L). Control and untreated plot. 3 test plants. Results and discussion Chemical risk assessment On Parcel I (without fly ash mixing) the surface did not vegetate, there was not a single plant, which could germinate. The surface remains totally uncovered, because phytoremediation could not be realized below pH 3. Phytoremediation on Parcel II and III was successful, the surface could be vegetated. In these parcel we could assess the chemical risks. The chemical risk of heavy metals to enter the food chain was characterized by the heavy metal content of rhizosphere soil samples, analyzed by different methods. Aqua regia digestion characterized the total content, Lakanen-Erviö method characterized the reactive, easily available fraction, acetate extraction simulated the acid rain and distilled water extract corresponded to water soluble fraction of heavy metals. Total heavy metal content of rhizosphere soil sample indicated As, Cd, Mo, Pb, Zn pollution in each treatment. The reactive, easily available fraction detected Pb pollution in each treatment, and Cd pollution in some treatments. Acetate extract showed Cd, Pb, Zn pollution in each treatment, and As, Ni pollution in some cases. Water soluble fraction identified As, Cd, Pb, Ni, Zn pollution in some cases. Mine waste of Gyöngyösoroszi represents high chemical risks due to its Pb, Zn, Cd and As content. Biomass production in different treatments The plants of Parcel II and Parcel III were sampled after harvest and the biomass production was estimated (Figure 1). The treatments resulted in large differences. The effect of lime application on the yield can be best estimated in case of control plots. Lime increased the yield of each plant. For instance the biomass production of grasses was very little in MW + FA control plot, and very high in MW + FA + L control plot. The deviation is caused by the pH difference of rhizosphere soils. The pHKCl in Parcel II (without liming) was 4.6 (grasses), 3.9 (sorghum), 3.9 (Sudan grass), while in Parcel III (with liming) pHKCl was 7.7 (grasses), 7.7 (sorghum), 7.8 (Sudan grass). Liming was efficient to increase the biomass production in the control parcels. The effect of multi-level revitalization is clearly demonstrated if the control plot is compared to the corresponding treated plot. In Parcel II (without liming) the biomass production was increased from 2 g m-2 to 501 g m-2 (grasses), from 45 g m-2 to 344g m-2 (sorghum), from 44 g m-2 to 437 g m-2 (Sudan grass). In Parcel III (with liming) the biomass production was increased from 336 g m-2 to 728 g m-2 (grasses), from 194 g m-2 to 270 g m-2 (sorghum), from 78 g m-2 to 546 g m-2 (Sudan grass).</p><p id="Pg388">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 390 Heavy metal uptake of different plants The heavy metal content of harvested plants were determined and large differences between different treatments were found. Figure 2 shows the lead concentration of plants as a function of phytoremediation treatments. The highest concentrations were measured in case of control treatments without liming. Mixing fly ash into mine waste did not prevent lead uptake by neither of plants that is Pb content of mine waste was not stabilized from chemical point of view. In the control treatments Pb concentration was 92 mg kg-1 in grass, 122 mg kg-1 in sorghum, and 106 mg kg-1 in Sudan grass. These high concentrations were reduced by applying multi-level revitalization: Pb content decreased to 65 mg kg-1 in grasses, to 30 mg kg-1 in sorghum and to 38 mg kg-1 in Sudan grass. Low Pb concentrations were measured in Parcel III, where lime was applied. Pb concentration of control parcels could be further decreased when multi-level revitalization was applied, but the effects were much smaller than in Parcel II. Application of lime efficiently reduced the Pb uptake of each plant. Conclusions The chemical risks of the Gyöngyösoroszi spoils were assessed. The major contaminants of the waste mine were identified: Pb, Zn, Cd, As. The concept of the integrated phytoremediation was successfully applied to vegetate Gyöngyösoroszi spoil. The biomass production was different, depending on the technology variant. The highest biomass production was achieved, when multi-level revitalization was also applied. The integrated phytoremediation treatments not only produced high biomass, but also decreased the heavy metal content in the plants.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 391 BROCCOLI AND LETTUCE YIELD COMPONENTS AS AFFECTED BY ORGANIC FERTILIZATION Sanja FABEK1 – Božidar BENKO1 – Nina TOTH1 – Bruno NOVAK1 – Karmela DELONGA2 1 Vegetable Crops Department, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: sfabek@agr.hr 2 Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, University of Zagreb, Pierottijeva 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: Biological activity and organic matter content of soil can be improved by the application of organic fertilizers. As the EU legislation restricts the time and doses of N added with stable manure, the need and possibility have arisen to apply industrially processed organic fertilizers. For this reason, investigations were carried out at the trial field in Zagreb with the aim to determine the effects of applying pelleted organicbiological fertilizer “Bio Univerzal” upon broccoli and lettuce yield components. In the spring-summer period, all broccoli cultivars grown on plots on which organic fertilizer was applied produced higher mass and yield of marketable top inflorescences compared to plots fertilized with mineral fertilizer only. Depending on the broccoli cultivar, organic fertilizer application led to increase of marketable top inflorescence mass by 3 to 12%, resulting in marketable yield increase from 3 to 22%. Organic fertilizer application in the summerautumn lettuce growing period resulted in a 7 to 12% increase of marketable rosette mass and yield of all four cultivars studied. Keywords: Brassica oleracea var. italica, Lactuca sativa, yield, organic fertilization Introduction Fertilization with organic fertilizers has decreased in Croatia in recent years, notably on family farms engaged in field crop production. Mineralization in soil leads to a decrease in humus content, i.e. its organic matter. The same problem arises on farms engaged in vegetable production where humus-rich soils are desirable, namely, on ecological farms on which application of mineral fertilizers is disallowed. A possible way of improving the biological activity in soil and its organic matter content is the application of pelleted organic biological fertilizer. For this reason, investigations were carried out at the experimental field of the Vegetable Crops Department of the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb with the aim to determine the effects of the application of pelleted organic biological fertilizer "Bio Univerzal" on broccoli and lettuce yield components. In 2005, the fertilizer was awarded the European certificate CE 1774-2002, which certifies that the production process proceeds in compliance with the Environmental Protection Act. Nemeth (2006) reports that fertilization calculations based on weather conditions, nitrogen soil supplies and plant requirements enable assessment of limited nitrogen surpluses in the soil-water system after the growing season. Concentration of nitrogen compounds in lysimeter water will also depend on the origin of fertilizer (mineral or organic) and on the rates applied (Rutkoviene, 2007). Materials and methods Two field trials (broccoli, lettuce) were set up at the Vegetable Crops Department in Zagreb during the year 2007. Broccoli was grown in the spring-summer, and lettuce in the summer-autumn period. Trials involving four cultivars were laid out according to the randomized block scheme with three replications. Basic fertilization with 35, 100 and 150 kg·ha-1 N, P2O5 and K2O was applied on the basis of soil chemical status analysis (Table 1). Initial fertilization with 62 kg ha-1 N was applied for broccoli. On</p><p id="Pg391">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 392 plots with organic fertilization, besides N, 1000 kg ha-1 of organic fertilizer "Bio Univerzal" was added with initial fertilization for broccoli. Initial fertilization of lettuce was applied only on plots with organic fertilization, at a rate of 1000 kg ha-1 of organic fertilizer "Bio Univerzal". Table 1.

Broccoli transplants were planted on May 14 at a 0.6 m × 0.5 m spacing, resulting in plant density of 3.3 plants m-2. Harvests were done on July 12 and 20, i.e. 59 and 67 days after planting, respectively. Top inflorescence mass and marketable yield of broccoli were measured at harvest. Lettuce transplants at the 3 true leaf stage were planted on August 29, at 0.25 m × 0.25 m spacing, resulting in plant density of 16 plants m-2. Harvest was done 49 days after planting, on October 17. At lettuce harvest, marketable rosette mass and marketable yield were measured. Results and discussion Weather conditions (air temperature and soil moisture) during production affected both plant growth and development as well as nutrient dynamics in soil. Total precipitation during the broccoli growing period amounted to ca 255 mm while the mean monthly temperature ranged from 15.6 °C in May to 20.7 °C in July (Figure 1). Toth et al. (2007) maintain that optimal temperatures for broccoli culture are from 20 to 24 °C post planting and from 15 to 18 °C during growth, precipitation requirement being 400 mm. As can be seen, temperatures were too high at the time of top inflorescence development, and moisture deficit in the growing period had to be compensated by irrigation. Optimal temperatures for lettuce growth and development are between 12 and 20 °C, and 140 to 160 mm water is required (Lešić et al., 2004). Mean monthly temperatures between 10.8 and 20.0 °C were recorded in the summerautumn growing period from August to October while average precipitation amounted to ca 248 mm (Figure 1). Nagy et al.

In the spring-summer period, all broccolli cultivars grown on plots where organic fertilizer was applied produced higher marketable top inflorescence mass and marketable yield compared to plots fertilized with mineral fertilizer only (Figures 2 and 3). The highest top inflorescence mass (404 g) and marketable yield (1340 g m-2) were achieved by cultivar Captain with organic fertilization. Cultivar Heraklion produced the lowest top inflorescence mass (311 and 293 g) and marketable yield (910 and 817 g m-2) in both fertilization treatments. ab ab ab b a ab ab b aab ab b n.s. n.s. 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 O M H G M I C O H O G M O I O C M H M G M M C M I Fertilization Cultivar Interaction g ra m s ab abc bc c a ab abc c a a ab b n.s. n.s. 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 O M H G M C I O H O G M O I O C M H M G M M C M I Fertilization Cultivar Interaction g ra m s m -2 Fertilization: O – organic; M – mineral; Cultivar: C – Captain; GM – Green Magic; H – Heraklion; I - Ironman Figures 2 and 3.

Organic fertilizer application in the summer-autumn lettuce growing period brought about an increase in marketable rosette mass and yield by 7 to 12% in all four cultivars studied.

Use of polymer materials, however, increases inputs into production and poses a serious environmental pollution problem. Different organic surpluses – residues from the processing industry and agricultural production are singled out as alternative, promising mulching materials for vegetable crops. The research goal was to determine the effect of degradable organic mulches on agronomic traits of iceberg lettuce. Field trials with organic mulches (hay, straw, chopped up maize cobs and stalks), white/black PE-mulch, paper and uncovered soil were conducted in the continental climate zone of Croatia, in the spring-summer and summer-autumn growing periods of 2006. Daily fluctuations of air (5 cm above ground) and soil (10 cm depth) temperatures were monitored in each treatment throughout the lettuce growing period. Yield components were analyzed at harvest that is head biomass, number, mass, diameter and height of marketable heads, and were used to calculate marketable yield. The studied parameters of lettuce grown on PE-film and paper were in the rank of statistically highest values in both growing periods. Hence, a possible alternative to PE-film is paper mulch, while chopped up stalks and straw are promising organic mulches. Keywords: organic degradable mulch, PE-film, soil temperature, Lactuca sativa L., yield components Introduction Lettuce and some kinds of vegetables are conventionally produced on undegradable polyethylene (PE) mulches, whose advantages involve higher yields and earlier harvests. PE-mulches, however, increase significantly the production costs and directly pollute the environment because merely 7% of used PE-films from horticultural production are recycled, 50% are burnt, and 43% are deposited in soil (Farias-Larios et al., 2001). To include vegetable corps production into the global trend of environmental conservation, alternative mulches are currently extensively explored for their expected positive effects on the environment, soil and plants. Searching for ecologically acceptable replacements for undegradable PE-film, besides living organic mulches (Abdul-Baki, 1999), different organic surpluses – residues from agricultural production and processing industry can be utilized for energy purposes (Dobó et al., 2007) and for mulching or composting instead of being burnt or deposited as wastes. Owing to lower evaporation, the amount of irrigation water can be appreciably reduced on mulched areas (Adetunji, 1990), leaching of nitrogen and other nutrients into deeper soil layers is reduced, soil pollution, degradation and erosion risks are diminished (Romic et al., 2002; Várallyay, 2007; Vasary et al., 2007). Use efficiency of N, P and K is significantly higher on mulched areas (Acharya and Sharma, 1994), resulting in higher yields. As organic mulches contribute to heat storage, soil temperature is higher compared to uncovered soil, with smaller daily variations (Sarkar et al., 2007). The research aim was to assess the influence of degradable, organic mulches upon the growth dynamics and yield components of iceberg lettuce in spring-summer and</p><p id="Pg395">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 396 summer-autumn growing periods. Due to differences in soil temperature under the studied mulches, differences can be also expected in lettuce agronomic traits. Materials and methods Research was done in Zagreb and its surroundings (45o49' N, 16o02' E) in 2006, in the spring-summer and summer-autumn growing periods; planting was done on 9 May and 1 September and harvests took place on 26 June and 26 October. The field trial was set up according to the randomized block scheme with four replications. The trial included seven treatments: 4 organic mulches (straw, hay, chopped up maize cobs and stalks), PE-film (white/black), paper and uncovered soil with two weed controls. Iceberg head lettuce was used as trial crop (’Mariola’ in the spring-summer and ’Floreal’ in the summer-autumn growing period). Transplants with a root lump were produced in polystyrene multi-cell trays. The basic plot size was 5 m2; plant density was 16 plants·m-2. The crop was supplied with 100, 40 and 200 kg·ha-1 N, P2O5 and K2O, and was drip irrigated. Daily air (5 cm above ground) and soil (10 cm depth) temperature fluctuations were monitored in each treatment during the lettuce growing period. Lettuce agronomic traits (head biomass, diameter, height and mass of marketable heads, marketable yield) were analyzed. Data on the studied parameters were analyzed using the SAS 8.2 program. Results and discussion Soil temperature under organic mulches showed lower and more uniform daily fluctuation compared to PE-film, paper and uncovered soil. In the spring-summer growing period, at the mean decade air temperature from 12 to 18 oC, the temperature of uncovered soil and under organic mulches was by 0.1 to 1.2 oC higher compared to soil temperature under white/black PE-film, while it was by 0.1 to 0.9 oC lower under paper (Figure 1). When air temperature rose to 25 oC in the fifth decade of the growing period, uncovered soil and soil mulched with organic mulches were by 0.5 to 1.6 oC cooler than under PE-film, while it had the same temperature under paper. -2,0 -1,5 -1,0 -0,5 0,0 0,5 1,0 1,5 1 2 3 4 5 o C 0,0 5,0 10,0 15,0 20,0 25,0 30,0 o C Stalk Cobs Hay Straw Uncovered soil Paper Air D e c a d e s Soil Air Figure 1.

Decade air temperatures at 5 cm above ground and soil temperature deviations from temperatures under PE-mulch, in the summer-autumn growing period In the lettuce summer-autumn growing period, decade values of air and soil temperatures generally decrease towards the end of the growing period (Figure 2). At the decade air temperature from 18 to 20 oC, all treatments had by 0.1 to 0.9 oC higher soil temperature compared to white/black PE-film. When decade air temperatures dropped below 18 oC, uncovered soil and straw mulched soil were by 0.1 to 0.5 oC cooler compared to soil under PE-film, while other treatments retained the upward trend (0.3 to 0.7 oC). In the spring-summer growing period, more heat was accumulated (633 heat units) during the shorter lettuce growing period (48 days) and higher values of major yield components were achieved (17% biomass, 28% marketable head biomass, 23% marketable yield) compared to the summer-autumn growing period (607 heat units, 55 days).

Cereal Research Communications 398 In both growing periods, the highest values of the studied parameters were achieved in lettuce grown on PE-film and paper. This is in agreement with the results of Jenni et al. (2004), showing that these mulches lead to by 7 to 25% higher iceberg lettuce yield compared to the uncovered soil. Fontanetti-Verdial at al. (2001) attribute higher lettuce head biomass on PE-film to higher nitrogen uptake, which may be influenced by an increase in soil temperature and moisture, while Romić et al. (2002) maintain that, along with causing higher pepper yield, PE-film reduces nitrogen fertilizer leaching. Among organic mulches, only maize stalks had values of all parameters in the rank of highest values achieved on paper, PE-film and uncovered soil. In the summer-autumn growing period, advantage of PE-film and paper application in lettuce mulching was statistically confirmed by comparison with organic mulches and uncovered soil for all major yield components. Among organic mulches, straw and maize stalks led to marketable head mass and marketable yield statistically equal to those achieved on uncovered soil. Conclusions The presented research has confirmed the advantages of PE-film application for soil mulching by the highest values of yield components in the spring-summer and summerautumn lettuce growing periods. Owing to statistically equal values of the studied parameters in both growing periods and its positive economic and ecological aspects, paper mulch is singled out as an alternative to PE-film. Among organic mulches, maize stalks and straw are proposed as promising alternative materials to replace undegradable polyethylene. References Abdul-Baki 1999.

The first solution is the officially used Hungarian extractant and the other two are internationally used extractants. 215 agricultural soil samples from Soil Information and Monitoring System (SIMS) with various physical and chemical properties were collected for the study. For both Cu and Zn the KCl –EDTA extracted amounts were significantly correlated with the extracted amounts of the other two extractants. We calculated conversion factors between KCl-EDTA and the other two extractants. Keywords: soil extractant, micronutrient, CaCl2-DTPA, KCl-EDTA, LE Introduction Cu and Zn are essential for plant growth, but the demand of the various plant species are different (Racskó et., al. 2005; Vágó et. al., 2007). Internationally environmental literature gives usually the total micronutrient content of the soil. These values do not indicate the plant available micronutrient content. Only those extractants can be appropriate for soil tests which solubilize a proportionate part of labile forms of micronutrient cations from different soils. To select these for certain soils is in the focus of research. Micronutrients soil extractants used in the last decades often contains DTPA and EDTA as supplements. Chelates bind part of the microelements in soil solution as metalchelate complexes. Thus adsorption desorption equilibrium is shifted in direction of desorption, which promotes dissolving of larger amounts. It proves on the one hand the measurability of micronutrients and on the other hand it reflects the ability of soil to replenish micronutrients into the soil solution. In Hungary the development of Plant Nutrition Recommendation System continuously raised (Csathó et al., 2007). Our officially used micronutrient extractant is KCl-EDTA, that is unfortunately not used in other countries. Therefore comparing Hungarian results with the international ones is encountered difficulties. Molnáros et al. (2000) made investigations for the comparison of KCl-EDTA and Lakanen Erviö (LE) solutions with soils from five west Hungarian counties. Our aim is to extend their studies and compare KCl-EDTA extractant with two internationally accepted extractants that are CaCl2- DTPA and LE solutions. Formally we made prestudies for the comparison with 27 soil samples (Kremper et al., 2007). The extractant concentration of the three methods showed good correlation in spite of the small number of samples. Now we extended our investigations for 215 soil samples. Materials and methods 215 soil samples from Soil Information and Monitoring System (SIMS) of Hungary were used. The soils varied greatly in their physical and chemical properties (Table1.).

Results and discussion Both for Cu and Zn the extractability (in mg/kg soil) decreases in the following order: LE&gt; KCl-EDTA&gt; CaCl2-DTPA. LE and KCl-EDTA were acidic (pH 4.6 and pH 4.36) therefore they solved such Zn and Cu forms that can not be solved by CaCl2-DTPA at pH 7.2. The different extracted quantities can be attributed to the various soil-extractant ratio and the different characteristics of the extractants. For Cu the extracted concentrations were larger than for Zn. Figure 1. represents the results of regression analysis. The extracted amounts of copper and zinc gives significant correlation for each cases. For copper we got better correlation coefficients than for zinc.

Cereal Research Communications 402 the samples were more homogeneous. The extracted Zn averages does not show tendency with texture. For clay and for loamy soils we measured similar Zn values. Although the micronutrient content of clay soils is larger, part of the micronutrient bind very strongly to the soil clay content which can not be dissolved by the investigated extractants. Sandy soils contain less micronutrients, but these forms are soluble for the extractants. We calculated conversion factors between KCl-EDTA and the other two extractants. We made calculations for the whole sample and the sorted samples as well. The soils were sorted by texture and carbonate content. The conversion factors were very similar for the sorted samples, therefore we recommend the following unique values: 1 mg KCl-EDTA extacted Zn/ kg soil = 0,51 mg CaCl2-DTPA Zn/kg soil 1 mg KCl-EDTA extacted Cu/ kg soil = 0,51 mg CaCl2-DTPA Cu/kg soil 1 mg KCl-EDTA extacted Zn/ kg soil = 1,28 mg LE Zn/kg soil 1 mg KCl-EDTA extacted Cu/ kg soil = 1,43 mg LE Cu/kg soil Conclusions On the basis of the relationship-examinations for the three Cu and Zn extractants we came to the following conclusions: - the investigated extractants can be substituted with each other, - By means of the calculated conversation factors the results can be converted, - Thus the internationally not used KCl-EDTA results can be compared to the widely used CaCl2-DTPA and LE results.

During this study the distribution of cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc was studied within a plant. Sampling was carried out in the same period of subsequent three years between 1995 and 1997. Our hypothesis was that the individuals of the same species has similar physiological answer for the same environmental properties. In this study we found no significant differences among the different plant’s parts and years. Our results can reveal that the ecological indication of plants could be major driver of agro-environmental studies to recognize unusual patterns of soil attributes. Keywords: heavy metal, winter wheat, plant uptake, distribution Introduction Related to the heavy metal moving in the soil-plant system it is important how much heavy metal is uptaken by the plants from a particular soil type and how these metals distribute in the plants. The uptaking of the heavy metals by different plants have been studied many times (Csathó 1994, Kádár 1995, Szalai 1998, Prokisch et al. 2006, Szalai et al. 2006). The most reliable results come from field experiments, but the small pot experiments provide important data as well (Bíró and Takács 2006, Pál et al. 2006). The stress-experiments are also very instructive (Szabó and Szegedi 2006, Rékási and Filep 2006, Rékási 2006, Schmidt and Szakál 2006), a lot of questions could be answered only by these ones, at the same times the studies in natural circumstances pretty important as well. This kind of experiment is shown in our study, in its framework the heavy metal uptaking of the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is studied on Ramannbrown forest soil. The individuals of a species has adapted to similar environmental properties this adaptation can provide causes to refer the similar group of biological entities (individuals) as species. We suppose that, the individuals of the same species have similar physiological answer for the same environmental properties. These general approaches were summarized in the following hypothesis: we suggest that the environmental factors have consistent influence on the development of individuals. The individuals of a population can reflect the same level of environmental properties, we expect that all studied individuals have similar distribution of heavy metals. We called this individual consistency hypothesis (ICH). The aim of this paper to present the effects of soil and climatic properties on the winter wheat using the heavy-metal content as a marker of variation among the individuals of the same population. Materials and methods The wheat-samples were collected from 1995 to 1997 in the south forefront of the Bükk Mountain near Cserépfalu. The samples were collected during the 2nd week of July every year. The organs of the collected and dried plants were homogenized and then 2</p><p id="Pg403">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 404 grams of them were being cremated at 500 C during 16 hours. The ash were dissolved in 10 ml 20% HCl by heating at 50C for 30 minutes. The solution was diluted with deionized water to 20 ml. The soil samples were taken from the root-zone of the wheat. Cc. HNO3-H2O2 digestion were applied and measured by Perkin Elmer F-AAS both in the case of the soil and the plant samples. Besides the pH of the soil the organic content (by Tyurin method), CaCO3-content (by Scheibler-method) and the particle composition were measured by Köhn-pipette. The precipitation data were taken from hydro-geography year-books. In order to portray the overall trends of data, we used multipanel dotplots using Trellis/Lattice package (Becker et al. 1996). In order to study the relationship between the amount of studied elements and their distribution among the parts of the plant, we applied Redundancy Analysis (RDA) (Palmer 1993, Ter Braak, 1986). Finally, we applied an ANOVA like permutation test to reveal the trends and the model. The analyses were carried out in R 2.6.0. using Vegan package (Oksanen et al. 2007). Results and discussion Table 1 gives information about the heavy metal content and the studied attributes of the soil samples. There is not significant difference in point of the organic content whereas there is in the particle size composition. In the samples collected in the first year the rate of the clay fraction were very high (over 40%), while it were much lower (approximately 20%) in the second and third years. However the soil samples with the highest clay content were characterized with the lowest pH value. There was difference in the precipitation among the years. In the first studied year the depth of rainfall was 701 mm, while the third year was rather dry with 460 mm precipitation. Table 1.

At cobalt, iron and nickel the lowest concentrations were in the grain crops, but at manganese and copper it were in the leaves. In the RDA (Figure 2), metal elements changes remarkably among the plant's parts. In the RDA ordination, the most of the studied metal elements were located in the center left indicating their accumulation associated in the roots and leaves.

St. 16. Hungary, mako@georgikon.hu Abstract: We present a study on the impact of soil and climatic variability on the yield of winter wheat in Hungary. The study was based on the use of National Pedological and Crop Production Database (NPCPD). The analysis was performed using the data of two climatic soil zones (17 selected climatic districts). The brown forest soil area was represented by Lessivated brown forest soils and the chernozem area was characterized by Chernozem soils. Statistical classification methods were used to distinguish significantly different climate categories and winter wheat yield groups. The calculated climate sensitivity factors described the aggregated effects of soil and climate heterogeneity on the crop production. Keywords: climate sensitivity, crop modelling, soil variability, winter wheat Introduction The potential impacts of climate change on agriculture are highly uncertain. There have been numerous studies aimed at understanding the extent of production changes for particular crops, soils and scenarios of climate change (Brown &amp; Rosenberg, 1997; Tóth et al., 2006; Stekuerova &amp; Nagy, 2007). There are different tools to evaluate crop response to climate change. Parts of studies are based on expressions from statistical regression techniques and these expressions are used to estimate the sensitivity of crops for discrete changes in temperature and/or precipitation (Debreczeni et al., 2006). Recently the emphasis shifted to use of complex mechanistic models that simulate key physiological processes. These crop models are designed to be run at specific sites with specific soil and climate characteristics (Landau et al., 1998; Eitzinger et al., 2003.; Farkas et al., 2005). Attempts were made to extend this approach to land evaluation modelling based on large scale soil maps (Debreczeni et al., 2003). The studies dealing with statistical or model analysis of climate change impacts on crop production pay only little attention to the role of soil properties (most of the crop models use only soil water regime and nutrient level data as input soil parameters). At the same time the knowledge of the aggregate soil and climate effects is essential for the spatial extension of the crop simulation results or for the accurate regional or national crop estimations (Oelsen et al., 2000; Tóth &amp; Máté, 2006). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of climate and soil parameters on winter wheat yield at two dissimilar soil zones using a national pedological and crop production database. Materials and methods The National Pedological and Crop Production Database (NPCPD) was used to perform a statistical analysis focused on the climate sensitivity of the most dominant Hungarian soils. The database was compiled in the 80s and the Plant and Soil Protection Service, Budapest made it available for the research. In addition to give the meteorological region (Hungary can be divided into 75 meteorologically homogeneous region), the</p><p id="Pg407">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 408 database also contains pedological and yield data of 5 consecutive years (1985-1989) for an average of 80,000 cultivated plots covering about 4 million ha of arable land each year. The soil parameters of the database are originated from the topsoil horizons (collected at a depth of 0-20 cm). The impact of soil properties and climate on wheat yields was analysed for the most dominant soil types of two climatic soil zones (17 selected climatic districts) (Fig. 1) . Lessivated brown forest soils (soil name in the WRB: Luvisol; the most common prefixes: Haplic; suffixes: arenic, siltic, clayic) represent the brown forest soil area and Chernozem soils (WRB: Chernozem; the most common prefixes: Vermic, Siltic, Calcic, Gleyic, ; suffixes: Clayic) characterize the chernozem area (Fig. 2). K-means cluster analysis was carried out to separate 5 average annual temperature and 5 annual rainfall amounts climate categories (scenarios). Classification tree (CHAID) method was used to distinguish significantly different winter wheat yield groups (the soil type, soil texture, temperature and precipitation categories were the grouping variables). Climate sensitivity factors were calculated for the two soil types separately dividing the mean yield of the groups by the mean yield of the soil types. GLM univariate analysis was performed to estimate the climate sensitivity factors of the texture, temperature and precipitation scenarios. The statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 13.0 package. Results and discussion In lack of space, winter wheat climate sensitivity factors are shown only for selected warm or droughty scenarios because of prognosticable climate change result the dominance of these kind of years in Hungary (Figure 3). Figure shows the temperature and precipitation categories generated by K-means analysis. The estimated marginal means of climate sensitivity factors are plotted separately for soil types at all occurent soil texture categories. Figure 1.

There are indicated different number of climate and texture categories on the plots because of the soil texture variability of selected soil types are different and the climate variability of the climatic soil zones represented by the soil types are dissimilar. The plots illustrate how the winter wheat production changes follow the climate (annual rainfall and average temperature) changes at altered soil conditions. Parallel lines indicate that there is no interaction between soil texture and climatic (rainfall or temperature) scale, which means that we can investigate the levels of only one determinant. Conclusions The climate sensitivity of the soils is expressible with yield responses of crops to different climatic conditions. The calculated climate sensitivity factors describe the aggregated effects of soil and climate heterogeneity on the crop production.

Hungary, toth.brigitta@georgikon.hu 2 Dipartimento di Ingegneria Idraulica Ambientale, Infrastrutture Viarie e Rilevamento, Politecnico di Milano Abstract: We explore the information associated with soil water retention included in the large scale soil maps of Hungary. We employed factor analysis to investigate the role of different commonly measured soil properties - namely sand and clay content, organic matter content, pH and CaCO3 content - on determining soil water retention at different pF values (pF0, pF2.5, pF4.2 and pF6.2). Analyses were performed on all the samples of the database, that contains 3821 soil horizons of diverse soil types, as well as a selection of the horizons belonging to Chernozem soils of the database. Results show considerable differences of water retention characteristics of Chernozems, mainly at pF0. This suggests that a separate analysis for different soil types might be appropriate in order to characterize the impact of measured soil properties on water retention. Keywords: soil water retention, factor analysis, soil map information Introduction Soil hydraulic properties are key determinants of the soil-plant interrelations. Therefore, the information on these properties are essential for the planning of sustainable utilization of the soil’s biomass production function (Tóth et al., 2006). The stability of plant production can be secured by management of the soil physical characteristics (Farkas et al., 2005; Várallyay, 2005). Most commonly used hydraulic properties include the hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention capacity. Measuring these soil properties is costly, labour and time intensive. Thus, these are often estimated on the basis of readily available soil properties. Parameters which are most frequently used for estimating soil water retention include the soil particle size distribution, the organic matter content and the bulk density (Rajkai &amp; Várallyay, 1992; Wösten et al., 2001). Multivariate statistics offers a convenient framework within which one can analyze the structure of data matrices and the possible cross-correlations between variables (Pachepsky &amp; Rawls, 2005). In the context of principal component analysis, a set of socalled components is formed, allowing to quantify the internal variability of the data set analyzed by means of a reduced set of variables. Lin et al. (1999) used factor analysis to determine the relative importance of quantities defining the structure of their sampled data. Vereecken et al. (1989) used principal component analysis to study the relationship between moisture retention characteristic and measured soil properties. Hungary offers a unique opportunity for this type of analyses, in that detailed soil properties maps with 1:10 000 scale for 60 % of the Hungarian agricultural areas are available (Tóth &amp; Máté, 2006). The distinctive aim of this paper is to analyze the amount of information included in these maps and relate these to the soil water retention at pF0, pF2.5, pF4.2 and pF6.2. We do so by employing factor analysis to investigate the role of different commonly measured soil properties on determining soil water retention recorded at different pF.</p><p id="Pg411">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 412 Materials and methods Dataset In our study we used 3821 Hungarian soil horizons with varying soil subtype, physical and chemical properties. The database contains information on the soil type and subtype (according Hungarian soil classification), sand (0.02-2 mm), silt (0.002-0.02 mm), clay (&lt; 0.002 mm), organic matter and calcium carbonate content, pH(H2O) and water retention values at pF0, pF2.5, pF4.2 and pF6.2. The soil feature determinations have been measured as reported by Búzás (1993). Statistical analysis Multivariate statistical analyses were performed with the statistical package SPSS 14.0 (Norusis, 1994). We performed a Factor Analysis and obtained estimates of the initial factors from principal component analysis. The number of factors to be retained is chosen on the basis of the relative proportions of the variance explained. To simplify the interpretation of the results, VARIMAX rotation with Kaiser normalization was used. On the basis of the rotated component matrix it was then possible to identify the most significant variables within the group of components and the degree of inter-relationship between these. We started by performing Factor Analysis with reference to the whole dataset. The Chernozems main soil type was then analyzed separately, to identify the sensitivity of the analysis to a single main soil type. Silt content of soil was not included as a control variable, since it can be calculated from clay and sand content. Results and discussion Factor analysis of the whole database Three factors were extracted from the nine variables, accounting for about 78.22 % of the variance. Factor I (FI) retains information about 49.66 % of the total variance; Factor II (FII) and Factor III (FIII) respectively explain 18.61 % and 9.95 % of the total variance (Table 1). Table 1.

FII accounts for (0.8922) = 79.5% of the variance of calcium carbonate and (0.8492) = 72% of that of pH. FIII explains (0.8142) = 66% of the variance of organic matter and (0.7072) = 50% of that of water retention at pF0. Water retention at pF2.5, 4.2 and 6.2, clay content are positively related to the first Principal Component, while sand content is negative related to it (Table 1.). The calcium carbonate content and pH are related to FII. The organic matter and water retention at pF0 are related to FIII. On the basis of these results, it is clear that pH and calcium carbonate content do not have significant effects on soil water retention. On the other hand, the analysis suggests that the water retention at pF0 is slightly associated with organic matter content. Factor analysis of Chernozems Our database contains 733 soil samples which are Chernozems. Within these samples, three factors were extracted from the nine variables examined, accounting for about 74.57 % of the total variance (i.e., the analysis is 74.57% complete). Factors FI, FII and FIII respectively explain 43.43 %, 20.83 %, 10.30 % of the total variance. Factor FI accounts for (-0.772) = 59% of the variance of sand content, (0.8552) = 73% of the variance of clay content, (0.8642) = 74.6% of the variance of water retention at pF2.5, (0.8172) = 66.7% of the variance of water retention at pF4.2 and (0.8562) = 73% of that of water retention at pF6.2. Factor FII explains (0.7822) = 61% of the variance of calcium carbonate, (-0.82) = 64% of that of organic matter and (0.8162) = 66.7% of that of pH. Finally, factor FIII explains (0.92) = 81% of the variance of water retention at pF0. Similarly to what observed for the complete dataset, water retention at pF2.5, 4.2 and 6.2, clay content are positively related to the first Principal Component, while sand content is negative related to it (Table 2).

Conclusions We used factor analysis to explain the relative importance of different measured quantities on soil water retention values at pF0, pF2.5, pF4.2 and pF6.2. Our aim is to explore the type of information which can be extracted by performing factor analysis of variables which are available from the detailed (1 : 10 000) soil maps of Hungary. In the analysis we used sand and clay content, organic matter content, pH and calcium carbonate content next to the water retention values. We started by analyzing the whole database and then treated separately the Chernozems main soil type. The analysis reveals that there are peculiarities of the Chernozems main soil type which are obscured when all samples are lumped into a single dataset. We believe this is associated with the fact that the water content at pF0 is influenced by the presence of macropores. The presence of the latter is strongly associated with the considerable biological activity and the extent of soil degradation (disaggregation, compaction) which is caused by the intensive cultivation of the Chernozems. This suggests that a separate analysis for different soil types might be appropriate in order to characterize their internal variability.

E-mail: hornikm@ucm.sk Abstract: Foliar fertilization is considered as an efficient supplementary method when fertilization via root system is not possible or not acceptable. In our paper Zn foliar uptake by tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and ivy (Hedera helix L.) leaves submerged in solutions spiked with 65ZnCl2 was studied by gamma-spectrometry. The increase of the nutrient concentration in contact solutions caused the decrease of Zn uptake via leaf surface but the increase of Zn translocation to other part of plant organs, e.i. to non-submerged leaves and in some extents to roots of tobacco. Similarly, complexing ligands EDTA and NTA diminished total Zn absorption by detached ivy leaves as a consequence of Zn 2+ cations binding to negatively charged Zn-ligand complexes. However, zinc entering the leaves in the presence of complexing ligands is more efficiently translocated outside the treated area of ivy leaves. The total Zn uptake will depend on the concentration ratio [Zn] : [ligand]. This method can serve as a useful tool for optimizing of fertilization procedures and for prediction of microelements behavior in the products designated for foliar application in practice. Keywords: foliar fertilizers, vascular plants, 65 Zn, uptake, translocation, complexing ligands Introduction The efficiency of foliar fertilizers depends on many factors. The total effect influences species characteristics, the amount of fertilizer applied, leaf wettability, cuticular water permeability and time of application in relation to age and stage of plant growth. Leaf water repellency of adaxial or abaxial surfaces is a main limiting factor in spray application processes (Watanabe and Yamaguchi, 1991; Holder, 2007). Zn fertilization can increased the yield and quality of cereals (see e.g. Schmidt and Szakál, 2007). Our previous papers were oriented to bioaccumulation and translocation of 137Cs and 60Co in vascular plants from defined solutions (Hornik et al., 2005; 2007). The objective of the present study was to determine efficiency of microelement foliar uptake in short term laboratory experiments not requiring spraying and not requiring wetting agents. Two vascular plants differing considerably in the leaf surface structures and water permeability: tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and ivy (Hedera helix L.) were used for the study of Zn uptake by leaves submerged in foliar solutions spiked with 65ZnCl2. Materials and methods Seeds of tobacco (N. tabacum L.) were germinated and grown at 22°C in pots filled with granulated perlite watered with diluted Hoagland medium (Hoagland, 1920), pH 6.0 at light/dark period 12/12 h and illumination with 2 tubes (2 000 lx, Brilliant daylight and Tropic sun, SERA, D). After 8 weeks plants were transferred into Erlenmeyer flask with 25% Hoagland medium (HM). The second youngest well developed leaves were bend down and partially submerged in diluted foliar fertilizers (Gabona-S, PHYTO-MED, HU) spiked with 65ZnCl2 in triplicate series. Nonsubmerged leaf surfaces provided transpiration and respiration. Ivy branches (H. helix L.) were picked up from freely grown garden vegetation. Approx. 15%</p><p id="Pg415">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 416 of the surface of detached leave was submerged into the solution of foliar fertilizers in triplicate series. At the end of experiments, leaves were shortly washed by deionized water and the amount of 65Zn in plant tissues was determined by the well type NaI(Tl) scintillation gamma-spectrometer (Scionix, NL) with data processing software Scintivision32 (Ortec, USA). Standardized 65ZnCl2 solution (0.88 MBq.cm -3, 50 mg.dm-3 ZnCl2, 3 g.dm -3 HCl) was obtained from CMI (CZ). Composition of foliar fertilizers was determined by ICP-AES (Leco, USA) after digestion with 65% HNO3 in microwave mineralizator Multiwave 3000 (Anton Paar, AT). Results and discussion Disadvantage of spraying methods is the problem of determination of contact area leafdroplet, which depends on many variables such as an average diameter of droplets and contact angles. In our experiments, defined contact area was obtained by submersing of the apexes of leaf blades into the solution of fertilizers. Table 1.

On the other hand, translocation of Zn from submerged part of leaves into nonsubmerged part of the same leaves as well as into neighboring transpiring leaves increases with increasing concentration of mineral nutrients in foliar fertilizer (Fig. 1A).

Cereal Research Communications 418 up cations is related to some properties such as molecular weight of the complex and stability constants at various conditions (Reed et al., 1988). Our study of the foliar uptake of Zn by detached ivy leaves showed that the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) or nitrilotriacetate (NTA) decreased foliar uptake comparing with the control (Tab. 2). This effect is the consequence of the decrease of Zn2+ form in the contact solution, due to the formation of negatively charged complexes [Zn-EDTA]2- or [Zn-NTA]- (Tab. 3). However, zinc entering the leaves in the presence of EDTA and NTA is more efficiently translocated outside the treated area of ivy leaves. In the presence of EDTA about 80% of retained Zn (1.4% of total Zn uptake) was translocated outside the treated area (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2). Conclusions Experiments with tobacco (N. tabacum L.) and ivy (H. helix L.) showed that Zn absorption by both intact and detached leaves was dependent on nutrient concentration and presence of EDTA and NTA in the contact solution of foliar fertilizers. Nutrients decreased Zn uptake and increased translocation outside contact leaf area. Complexing ligands EDTA and NTA in the same experiments showed similar effect. Used radiotracer method is able to give quantitative data characterizing the efficiency of foliar uptake and translocation of metals by plants in short term laboratory experiments. The method can be recommended as a starting method for the development of new formulation of foliar fertilizers and their evaluation in long term field studies.

Concentration equilibrium of Co biosorption was reached within one hour at 22°C, and the process was not pH dependent within the range pH 4 to 7. Cobalt biosorption capacity Qmax = 14.5 mg.g -1 (d.w.) was reached from the Co 2+ solution ≥1 mmol.dm -3 . Biosorption is diminished in the presence of complexing ligands. The efficiency of ligands to suppress Co biosorption increased in the order: citrate &lt; NTA &lt; EDTA. Because Chlorella genus is a common autochthonous green algae population of shallow fresh waters, it can play a decisive role in decontamination of waters polluted with cobalt in inorganic Co 2+ form originating from chemical or nuclear wastes. Keywords: 60Co, biosorption, Chlorella, Co-EDTA, Co-NTA, Co-Citrate Introduction The removal of toxic metals and radionuclides from wastewaters is of great importance from an environmental and industrial point of view. Biosorption of toxic or radiotoxic metals is an alternative technology in water treatment using different kinds of biosorbent including bacteria, fungi and algae (Romera et al., 2006). Cobalt-60 is formed in nuclear reactors by (n, γ) reaction of the Co present as an impurity in the metals used in the nuclear reactors and can be present in the wastewater effluents, and is also widely used in research and medical applications. The complexing ligands increase the aqueous solubility of heavy metals and enhance transport in the subsurface relative to the case where the ligands are absent. On the other hand, complexing ligands dramatically influence interactions of metals and metalloids with biota of polluted waters. Our previous papers dealt with 137Cs and 60Co uptake and distribution in fresh water plants and in components of fresh water system (Hornik et al., 2007a; 2007b). The objective of this paper is biosorption study of cobalt by unicellular green alga Chlorella sp., as a representative of phytoplankton of shallow water systems. Materials and methods Green alga, identified as Chlorella sp. was isolated from leaf surface of water plant Bacopa monnieri and maintained on slant Algal Culture Agar (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C. Algal biomass was obtained by 14 day aseptic cultivation in aerated glass cylinder (80x450 mm) at 22°C, under continuous illuminations with 2 Eurolite fluorescent tubes (2 x 600 lm and 2 700 K). Biomass harvested by centrifugation (5 min, 3 500 min-1) and washed three times with deionized water for 10 min showed the following elemental composition (mg.kg-1, dry wt.): Ca – 4 490; Mg – 8 850; P – 22 640; S – 7 560; Fe – 745; Cu – 12; Mn – 510; Zn – 249; K – 17 740 (determined by ICP-AES). For experiments algal suspension in deionized water or 20% Hoagland medium (Hoagland, 1920), was used. Experiments were carried out in test tubes filled with 6 ml of algal suspension spiked with 60CoCl2 in triplicate series at agitation on reciprocal</p><p id="Pg419">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 420 shaker (300 min-1) at 22°C. Aliquots were centrifuged (5 min, 3 500 min-1) and clear supernatants were taken for estimation of the remaining radioactivity in solutions by gamma-spectrometry using the well type scintillation detector NaI(Tl) (Scionix, NL) with data processing software Scintivision32 (Ortec, USA). Standardized 60CoCl2 solution (5.18 MBq.cm-3, 20 mg.dm-3 CoCl2, 3 g.dm -3 HCl) obtained from CMI (CZ) was used in all experiments. Speciation of cobalt in solutions was calculated using software Visual MINTEQ ver. 2.52. Results and discussion Biosorption kinetics of Co2+ ions by biomass of Chlorella sp. is shown in Fig. 1A. Biosorption of Co2+ ions by algae is rapid process and equilibrium is reached within one hour. The dependence of biosorption on biomass concentration (cs) within the range 0.5 to 2.9 g.dm-3 (d.w.) is shown in Fig. 1B. Total amount of cobalt sorbed onto algal biomass (in %) increased with biomass concentration (cs), the distribution coefficient (P) decreased with increase in biomass concentration. Many authors explain the decrease of distribution coefficient with biomass concentration by limited availability of metal, increased of electrostatic interactions, interference between binding sites and reduced mixing efficiency at higher biomass concentrations. Distribution coefficients, expressed as the concentration ratio of cobalt in biomass to the cobalt concentration in solution in equilibrium (mg.g-1 / mg.cm-3) calculated from the data in Fig. 1B within the range 700 to 1 400 cm3.g-1 (d.w.) were observed. The relationship between distribution coefficient (P) and biomass concentration (cs) can be described by a power form: P = a(cs) -b, where a = 1 083, b = 0.38 and R2 = 0.950. Similar relationship between Zn, Pb and Ni distribution coefficient (P) and biomass concentration (cs) was observed also for fungal biomass Rhizopus arrhizus (Zhou, 1999). We can suppose that biomass concentration of green algae such as Chlorella in natural conditions can be rather high mainly in a form of biofilms attached to solid surfaces. However, biosorption can be limited by diffusion processes. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 0 2 4 6 8 10 C o 2 + b io s o rp ti o n [  g .g -1 ]; d .w .

(2001) in biosorption study of Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Cd2+ by Chlorella vulgaris found, that carboxyl groups play a decisive role in Co2+ uptake. The maximal cobalt sorption capacity Qmax = 14.5 mg.g -1 (d.w.) for algal biomass of Chlorella sp. in dependence on the equilibrium Co2+ concentration in solution using Langmuir equation of isotherm was found and biosorption of Co2+ ions was not dependent on pH within the range pH 4.0 to 7.0 (data not shown). The pH range for most cultured algal species is between 7 and 9, with the optimum range being 8.2-8.7, though there are species that dwell in more acid or basic environments (Barsanti and Gualtieri, 2006). However, our calculation showed that molar fraction of free Co2+ ions sharply decreases above pH 8, due to the increase of CoOH+ and Co(OH)2 forms and cobalt bioavailability therefore decreases. 0,0 0,5 1,0 1,5 2,0 2,5 3,0 3,5 0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1,0 [Q x /Q 0 ] [ligand]/[CoCl 2 ] Molar ratio CAEDTA NTA 0,0 0,5 1,0 1,5 2,0 2,5 3,0 3,5 0 20 40 60 80 100 0,01% 3,19% C o 2 + a s f re e i o n [ % ] [ligand]/[CoCl 2 ] Molar ratio CA EDTA NTA 20,65% Figure 2.

The percentage of cobalt in the form of Co2+ ions in the presence of complexing ligands at pH 6.0 and 22°C calculated by the computing software Visual MINTEQ. Ligand-metal complexes are in equilibrium with free cationic form given by stability constants. The increase of the molar ratio [ligand] : [CoCl2] in the algal suspension causes the decreases of the total amount of cobalt biosorbed, compared with control experiments without ligands. Molar ratio [ligand] : [CoCl2] required for the decrease of cobalt uptake by 50% of the control were: 0.7 for ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA); 1.6 for nitrilotriacetate (NTA) and 2.4 for citric acid (CA) (Fig. 2A). It means that the efficiency of complexing ligands to suppress cobalt biosorption increases in the order: citrate &lt; NTA &lt; EDTA. This order corresponds with the stability constants Co-ligand complexes, expressed as log β = 15.7 (for EDTA-Co), 10.4 (for NTA-Co) and 4.7 (for Citrate-Co) at μ = 0.1 and 20°C. At initial concentration C0 = 50 μmol.dm -3 CoCl2 and equimolar EDTA, NTA or citrate concentration, cobalt biosorption 53, 75 and 85% of the control, respectively were observed.

Cereal Research Communications 422 practically entirely as Co2+ cations. Both citric acid and EDTA are frequently used for cleaning of pipe systems in power plants and their presence in water recipients will suppress cobalt uptake by autochthonous green algae population. Desorption efficiency of cobalt from algal biomass by washing with 50 μmol.dm-3 solutions of complexing ligands and inorganic salts for 30 min at 22°C decreased in the order: EDTA (78%) &gt; NiCl2 (52%) &gt; CoCl2 (40%) &gt; ZnCl2 (22%) &gt; water (5%) (data not shown). This percentage represents the amount of the exchangeable cobalt bound on the surface of the algal cells. Desorption by NiCl2 or EDTA is considered as a measure of the amount of surface-bound bivalent metals (Branquinho and Brown, 1994). Deng et al. (2006) showed that EDTA was as an efficient agent for the recovery of Cu2+ from green alga C. fascicularis. Conclusions Chlorella sp. isolated from leaf surface of water plants shows considerable capacity for cobalt binding from water solutions. Concentration equilibrium is reached within one hour at 22°C, and the process was not pH dependent within the range pH 4 to 7. Cobalt sorption capacity Qmax = 14.5 mg.g -1 (d.w.) was reached in dependence on the equilibrium Co2+ concentration using Langmuir equation of isotherm. Cobalt sorption is diminished in the presence of complexing ligands and the efficiency of complexing ligands to suppress cobalt biosorption increased in the order: citrate &lt; NTA &lt; EDTA. Because Chlorella genus is a common autochthonous green algae population of shallow fresh waters, it can play a decisive role in decontamination of waters polluted with cobalt in Co2+ form originating from chemical or nuclear wastes.

The effect of N fertiliser treatment (control, KNO3, NH4Cl), soil moisture, maize variety and year effect was studied on the dry matter and N content of maize grain analyzed by analysis of variance. The fertilizer treatment (control, KNO3, NH4Cl) was the most intensive factor at dry matter and N content of grain also in each year. The effect of KNO3 treatment was significant contrast with NH4Cl in 1993. The effect of soil moisture on dry matter of grain was significant only in the years of 1993 and 1994, and the 80%WHC was more advantageous, but grain N-uptake was not influenced significantly by soil moisture. The genotype effect of maize hybrids had no significant influence on dry matter and N-content of maize grain in any year. The effect of year (the different temperatures and number of sunny hours) was significant although the experiments were performed in greenhouse at the same production conditions. Keywords: N fertiliser forms, soil moisture, maize hybrids, effect of year Introduction Yield of crop production depends on genetical, ecological and technological factors, therefore the examination of these factors is very important separately and jointly in the agricultural research. The individual plant production factors contributed to yield increase in the following percentages: fertilisation - 48%, irrigation - 28%, soil cultivation - 18% and plant density - 6% in the experiment of Nagy (1995). These factors were not independent of each other. In a ten-years long experiment the grain yield was 6,1 t ha-1 without N fertilisers, the relative yield 79% and the surplus yield after N fertilisation was 1,35 t ha-1(Izsáki 2007). Those factors that change the weight of the maize kernels also have influences on protein content and amino acid composition. The year-effect, which modulates the effect of fertilisers, had a greater influence on the protein content than the N supplies (Izsáki 2006). Higher yield (over 10 t ha-1) always accompanied with higher precipitation, while droughty years decreased the yield 2-3 t ha-1 (Nagy 2007). The year effect was also significant on the dry matter of maize grain (Volga SC hybrid) in a five years field experiments (Dobos and Nagy 1998). In irrigated farming the effect of the year is moderated with a reduction in yield fluctuations (Nagy 1996). In the recovery of fertiliser-N is the most important factor the water supply. The interaction between the dry matter mass of maize and soil moisture level was also proved in a pot experiments by (Szlovák 1996). In the case of optimum water supplies the dry matter mass was almost twice that produced by water-stressed plants. The N-uptake of maize genotypes is different. Hegyi et al. (2007) compared the effect of variety and production field location on the yield and yield components of maize hybrids. It was found that the variety type was more responsible for protein content of the kernels than the location. In most maturity group the highest yield averages were associated with the greatest average starch contents of the kernels. More starch was incorporated at wetter locations,</p><p id="Pg423">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 424 where the protein content of the samples was lower. The effect of N fertilisation and year on the grain-yield and N fertiliser-reaction in maize hybrids (Pioneer) proved the significant effects of examined factors (year, N fertiliser, hybrid) by three factor variance-analysis in long-term trial (Berzsenyi 1993). Materials and methods In the three greenhouse pot experiments (set up in 1993-94-95) brown forest soil with clay eluviation from Keszthely (pHKCl =7.7, C=1.1 %, NO3-N = 17.5 mg kg -1, NH4-N = 12 mg kg-1, humus = 1.9 %) was filled in large plastic pots (40 kg soil/pot). Large doses of N-fertilisers (KNO3, NH4Cl) were applied at high rate of approx. 150 mg N kg -1 soil (6250 mg N/pot) to trace the precise transformation processes of N. P-fertiliser in all treated soils, and K-fertiliser in NH4Cl-treatments also were used (N:P:K= 1:1:3.35). All experiments were carried out at two soil moisture levels (field water holding capacity, WHC= 65 % and 80 %) with and without sowing of maize hybrids as test plants (two Volga SC and two Pioneer 3722 plants/pot). The plants were grown until full ripening. Maize (Zea mays L.) was sown in 24 pots, and 12 pots were let without plant for control. All treatments were replicated four times. Over ground parts of maize plants were cut after ripening and separated into different organs (leave, grain, stalk, shank, tassel and husks). The dry matter was determined in each organ. The total Ncontent of the above plant parts was analysed by Kjeldahl-method followed by ParnassWagner distillation and titration by HCl. Present paper reports about the results of the maize grains. The next questions were studied. Are there significant differences between the dry matters of maize grains depending on the N fertiliser treatment (control, KNO3, NH4Cl), the soil moisture levels and maize hybrids? The significant differences of the N content of the maize grains were examined also. Results were analyzed by three-factor variance-analysis. The effect of year on the dry matters and N content of maize grains was calculated by four-factor variance-analysis. Results and discussion In consequence of N fertilisation the dry matter and N content of maize grains increased significantly at LSD5%* (at hybrid x WHC x fertiliser treatment interactions) compared the controls in most of the treatment (Table 1. and 2.). The rate of this increase was different in the examined years probably due to the effect of year, with the lowest rate in 1994, where the dry matter was 2-3 times higher and the N content was 2-5 times higher than the control values. In the year 1994 the average temperature and the number of sunny hours was the highest therefore the dry matter and N content of maize grains in the control plants was also high. The rate of the increase in dry matter was 8-26 times higher and the N content was 11-32 times higher, as maximum, than the control values in 1995. It can be established that the N-uptake rate and the amount of accumulated N were correlated with dry matter of maize grain. Our results are accordance with former reports of Greef at al.(1999). Significant differences were found between the effects of the forms of N fertilisers, as in some case, KNO3 was more advantageous to the increase of dry matter and N content of</p><p id="Pg424">VII.

Significant differences were detected between the effect of soil moisture levels in some case, as the 80% WHC was more advantageous in contrast with 65% WHC. In contrast with above stated the genotypes effect was not obvious. The effect of year on the dry matter and N content of maize grains at LSD5%** by means of main effect of year was significant, with the highest value in 1995, and the lowest in 1993 (Table 1. and 2.).

Abstract: The results of a small-pot experiment of cadmium-loading (5 mg . kg -1 ) with the addition of zinc (5 mg . kg -1 ) carried out are introduced in this paper. For this, soil samples were taken from 4 sites of plough-land, grassland and forest land-use types. Accumulation characteristics of the two metals as well as their interaction with the soil properties were analysed. The results show that land-use has significant effect on zinc uptake. There is close correlation between the zinc and cadmium uptake of plants as well as that cadmium concentration of soils plays an important role in it. Zinc shows positive correlation while cadmium shows negative correlation with organic matter. Beside organic colloids, inorganic colloids i.e. clay fraction also showed close correlation. Keywords: zinc, cadmium, accumulation, ryegrass, land-use Introduction Due to the production activities of mankind, a number of pollutants impacting living organisations to a various degree, are emitted to the environment. The type of their impact is highly dependent on the toxic characters of the very materials as well as on what level they can enter organisms (Bíró and Takács, 2007; Rabnecz et al. 2007; Rékási and Filep, 2006). A significant proportion of pollutions can come from inorganic contaminants including heavy metals. Metals can enter the food-chain and accumulate in living organisms to such a degree that may have a harmful influence on their physiological processes (Rékási et al. 2006). As a result of biomagnification, concentration increases as reaching the top of the food-pyramid. Metal uptake by plants are studied in field and small-pot experiments, during which it the amount of metal accumulated by a given plant in given circumstances and its potential toxic effect can be determined (Kádár, 1991). Each plant is susceptible to such effects to a various degree and accumulate metals in a various level even according to genotypes. Cadmium is, even in small quantity, a toxic element that accumulates in plants without visible signs. It tends not to be washed-out from the soil, thus as a consequence of the use of phosphate fertilisers, sewage sludge disposal and industrial emission, its concentration can increase and can also enter the food-chain (Kádár and Kastori, 2006; Wu et al. 2002). In the environment cadmium and zinc usually occur together and they compete for the same binding places on the colloid surface. An experiment of cadmium-zinc loading aiming to compare the role of the endowments of 4 habitats and 3 land-use categories in plant accumulation was carried out. The aim was to study the influence of different soil types and land use on heavy metal uptake of a test plant.</p><p id="Pg427">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 428 Materials and methods Soil samples were collected to the experiment from 4 areas (from the Hajdúhát [Chernozem] and Hevesi-homokhát [Arenosol] regions and from two areas of the Bükkalja Region [Cambisol]) with 3 land-use types (from plough-land, grassland and forest). Average samples consisting of 10 sub-samples for each land use types were collected from the upper 20 cm layer of soils from all habitats, of which after homogenisation 0.5 kg was used in each small-pot. 4 repetitions were applied with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) as test plant in the experiment. Both a control and a treated small-pot sequence were set. To the treatment, 5 mg.kg-1 Cd (ZnCl2) and 5 mg .kg-1 Zn (Cd(NO3)2+4H2O) were used. It should be noticed that the additional amount of zinc means a small quantity (it was about the 1/10 of the soil zinc content) but in the case of cadmium it was relevant, about 50 times of cadmium content like in soil. Plants were irrigated under controlled circumstances with distilled water. Plants were cut in the stage of their intensive tillering four weeks after their starting up, they were dehumified and the dry samples were weighed. Following this, the metal content of plant samples were detected. Granulometrical composition, organic matter content (OM), humus quality, pHH2O, pHKCl, HAC, EAC and U% were determined from the soil samples. Heavy metal content (Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Zn) of the soil and plant samples were determined with cc. H2O2+HNO3-digestion, ICP-AES method according to MSZ-08-1722-3:1989 Hungarian Standard. Statistical analysis was carried out using ANOVA (Tukey HSD) and correlation analysis with SPSS software. Normality was tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results and discussion The habitats regarding the studied soil characteristics are significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.05) with the exception of the two Cambisols where except of the pH no difference was found. In the case of land use, significant difference was found between the ploughland and forest types (p&lt;0.05), as organic matter content and HAC were higher while pH was lower in the case of forests. The amount of zinc and cadmium taken up by plants is shown in Figure 1 and 2. Characterisation was carried out by soil types and land use categories. No significant difference was found in the control samples regarding either the zinc or the cadmium taken up in the plants for the studied soil types. Following treatment, however, significant difference was detected. Zinc content of the individuals grown on Arenosol did not show significant difference (p&lt;0.05) from the remaining three types nor Chernozem differed (p&lt;0.05) from Cambisol II. In the case of cadmium, Chernozem did not show difference (p&lt;0.05) from Cambisol I, but a difference was found for all the other types. By the metal concentration uptake of plants, by soil types, no sequence can be set for cadmium except for the treated sequence: here, plants grown on Cambisol I and Chernozem soils accumulated 2.5 mg.kg-1, whereas those grown on Cambisol II and Arenosol accumulated 4.2 mg.kg-1. For zinc, in the control sequences, individuals grown on Cambisol I and Arenosol soils it amounted ca. 50 mg.kg-1, whereas 80 mg.kg-1 for Cambisol II and Chernozem soils; in the treated sequence, the order was modified and became more destinctive: Cambisol I (102 mg.kg-1), Arenosol (149 mg.kg-1), Chernozem (170 mg.kg-1) and Cambisol II (195 mg.kg-1).</p><p id="Pg428">VII.

Cadmium uptake of ryegrass by soil types and land-use categories (a: control; b: treated; 1: Cambisol I.; 2: Arenosol; 3: Cambisol II; 4: Chernozem) Figure 2. Zinc uptake of ryegrass by soil types and land-use categories (a: control; b: treated; 1: Cambisol I.; 2: Arenosol; 3: Cambisol II; 4: Chernozem) By land-use, in the case of the control samples, zinc content of the individuals grown on the soils of ploughlands and grasslands was significantly different (p&lt;0.05) compared to that of forests whereas in the case of the loaded samples, significant difference was only found between the plants grown on the soils of ploughlands and forests. Land-use did not influence the cadmium content of plants: no significant difference was found either in the case of the control samples or in that of the treated samples. Regarding quantity, a series of plough-land&lt;grassland&lt;forest can be set for both metals (control: Cd [mg.kg-1]: 0.31&lt;0.31&lt;0.42; Zn [mg.kg-1]: 49&lt;58&lt;90; treated: Cd [mg.kg-1]: 2.71&lt;3.55&lt;3.91; Zn [mg.kg-1]: 116&lt;158&lt;187 respectively). Thus it can be concluded that the amount of zinc taken up by plants was the lowest in the soils of plough-lands whereas the highest was in the case of the soils of forests. A correlation analysis was carried out on the amount of metals taken up and soil characteristics. Correlation between zinc and cadmium taken up by the plants was found</p><p id="Pg429">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 430 to be close (r=0.84, p&lt;0.05), due to the similar characteristics of the two metals. This was later on, controlled by partial correlation. According to the results of the partial correlation study (controlled for Cd and Zn), the correlation of cadmium with the organic matter content is negative (rplantCd-OM.Zn=-0.64; p&lt;0.05), whereas that of zinc is positive (rplantZn-OM.Cd=0.71; p&lt;0.05). According to this, cadmium is bound by the organic matter, i.e reduces its accessibility for plants also furthering the uptake of zinc. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the most of the zinc (60-75%) are bound by fulvic acid and thus – as fulvic acid is less stable – even root acids are able to mobilise these chelates (Livens, 1991). In contrast to this, cadmium is bound more strongly than zinc and tends to be bound to polymerised humus materials with longer coal chain from which it can be mobilised with great difficulty, (it is in accordance with Piotrowicz et al. 1984 and Sedlacek et al. 1989). This claim is supported by the sign of correlation in our experiment for the polymerised, NaF-soluble humic acids (rplantCdNaF.Zn=-0.67; p&lt;0.05 and rplantZn-NaF.Cd=0.58; p&lt;0.05). The uptake of both metals is reduced by clay content, i.e. inorganic colloids (clay minerals) play an important role in this process (rplantCd-clay%.Zn=-0.78; p&lt;0.05 and rplantZn-clay%.Cd=-0.70; p&lt;0.05). Conclusions From the results of the experiment it can be concluded that both the habitat and the soil type found there have an important influence on the amount of metal uptake up, being an especially remarkable influencing factor in the case of zinc. Both the concentrations of zinc and that of cadmium were influenced by what area of land-use the soil in the small-pot was from. Land-use has an infulence on the physical and chemical parameters of the soil (e.g. organic matter accumulation), thus the availability of certain metals may vary. Closely connected to this, it was proved that zinc and cadmium contents are evincibly affected by the decomposition level of humus materials (quality) as well as clay content.

J. Strossmayer University of Osijek, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, marija.ivezic@pfos.hr 2 Agricultural Institute Osijek Abstract: Nematodes are widely distributed in soil and influenced directly by environmental and anthropogenic factors. The objectives of this study were to determine the population fluctuation of five trophic groups for two vegetation periods (2005 and 2006) and to observe the differences between the same trophic groups compared by month between the years. Soil samples were taken twice in soybean vegetative growth stage and once in reproductive growth stage on 7 cultivars. Total of 39 nematode gena were identified. The most dominant genus in trophic groups were: Pratylenchus, Aphelenchoides, Rhabditis, Dorylaimus and Mononchus.The population fluctuation differed for all trophic groups depending on the month and the year. Significant differences between the years were found among the same trophic groups depending on the month while all groups except plant parasites significantly differed in October. The significant difference between the years of total population of nematodes occured in June and October. Overall, plant parasites increased population in both years indicating soybean as good host plant, while the environmental and human factors probably were the most important influencing factors for the other trophic groups. Keywords: nematode structure, trophic group, plant parsites, soybean Introduction Nematodes represent an important part of the soil microfauna and are directly affected by environmental and anthropogenic disturbances. According to their feeding strategy, nematodes could be classified into five trophic groups: plant parasites (PP), bacterial (BF) and fungal feeders (FF), omnivores (OM) and predators (PR) (Yeates et al., 1993). Nematodes can be used as bioindicators of conservation or disturbance, nutrient enrichment and pollution of soils. The latter one is particulary important role since environmental concerns are rising (Beres and Husti, 2006; Dobo et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2006; Brmez et al., 2007). In response to a human intervention, the structure of nematode comunity becomes dominated by bacterivores. However, increase in numbers of fungivores indicates association of FF with fungal root degradation in soil (Berkelmans et al., 2003). Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is a globally important oilseed crop and source of high quality protein and among the various constraints, plant parasitic nematodes pose treat to demanding high yield production (Sikora and Greco, 1990; Sudaric et al., 2007). Use of soybean resistant cultivars has been exploited successfully to control to the most important nematodes of soybean Meloidogyne spp. (root-knot nematode) and Heterodera spp. (cyst nematode). However, resistant cultivars are still not released for the second most important plant parasitic genus, Pratylenchus spp. (root lesion nematode), which proved to be pathogenic to soybean, since it has suppressed yields up to about 31% (Schmitt and Barker, 1981). The objectives of this study were to determine the population fluctuation of nematode trophic groups in soybean for two vegetation periods (2005 and 2006); furthermore, to determine the differences between the same trophic groups compared by month between the years.</p><p id="Pg431">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 432 Materials and methods The research was conducted in 2005 and 2006 at the Agricultural Insitute Osijek, Croatia and set as randomized complete block design. Soil samples were collected in four replicates on fields (3.5 ha) planted with 7 soybean cultivars. The sampling was done in June and July in soybean vegetative growth stages and in October during the reproductive growth stage. The climate of this region in 2005 was characterized by excess of rainfall during early vegetation period and very dry in October, while in 2006 precipitation was normal to dry. The type of soil was hypogley hydromeliorated soil (pH 6-6.5; humus 2.2%; 27.4 mg K2O 100 g soil -1; 18.4 mg P2O5 100 g soil -1). The research fields in 2005 and 2006 were rotated with cereals for two years prior to soybean planting. Extraction of nematodes from soil was processed following the Erlenmeyer method (Seinhorst, 1955). Nematodes were identified to the genus level according to Bongers (1994) and classified into the trophic groups after Yeates et al. (1993). The data of nematode population were log10 transformed and subjected to the Duncan’s multiple range tests (P &lt; 0.05). The differences between the population of the same trophic groups by the month and by the year were tested with the analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2000). Results and discussion In 168 analyses of soil samples, 39 genus of nematodes were identified and classified into five trophic groups. Their population fluctuation is shown in Fig 1. and Fig. 2. The PP appeared as the most dominant group present in 2005, while BF was the most dominant in 2006. In October 2005 and 2006, the population of plant parasites (PP) reached the highest peak. This coud indicate that the same conditions that favor soybean growth are also favorable for PP development. The genus Pratylenchus was the most dominant in all soil samples for two years and should be monitored continuously in order to prevent possible yield losses (Schmitt and Barker, 1981). Figure 1. Population fluctuation of five trophic groups in 2005</p><p id="Pg432">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 433 The population of BF, with the most abundant genus Rhabditis peaked in October indicating their association with environmental factors and anthropogenic influence (Brmez et al., 2007). As opposed to the PP and BF, the final population of FF and OM in October decreased, when it is compared to the initial population in June 2005 and 2006. Decline might be associated with the low fungal degradation of root tissues prior the harvest for FF (Gomes et al., 2002) and the possibility of human intervention in the field prior to the sampling since dorylaimids are sensitive to agricultural practices (Brmez et al., 2006). Nematodes from genus Aphelenchoides comprised the major group of FF while Dorylaimus was the most dominant genus amon OM. The PR (Mononchus as the most dominant genus) population levels were low and stable for the whole vegetation period, except for peak in October 2005. Figure 2. Population fluctuation of five trophic groups in 2006 Significant differences were found in October between the same trophic group between the years for population of all trophic groups except PP (Tab. 1). Table 1.

Significant difference between the years was found in July for PP, when it was extremely wet in 2005, while in 2006 it was dry period. Since, PP is</p><p id="Pg433">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 434 associated with plant growth, here it might indicate that plants could have been under drought stress in 2005 and consequently their natural plant defense mechanism was weaken that enabled PP to feed and reproduce intensively. In addition, increase of PP during the vegetation period suggests susceptibility of soybean to the most dominant group of PP. Total number of nematodes significantly differed between the years in June and October when population of nematodes were higher in 2005 compared to the same period in 2006. Conclusions Since the population of PP had an increasing tendency towards the end of vegetation and their reproductive ratio (population final/population initial) was positive it suggests that soybean cultivars have been good host plant to the most dominant PP genus Pratylenchus. Environmental effect as well as human intervention in the fields might be the most important factor influencing population of other trophic groups, but it remains speculative since these effects were not studied in this research.

The trial was set up according to the Latin square method with four fertilization treatments (unfertilized control, 5 kg m -2 stable manure, and 50 and 100 g m -2 NPK 5-20-30). The highest soil phosphorus content was obtained in the treatment with 100 g m -2 NPK 5-20-30 or stable manure (up to 139 mg P2O5 kg -1 soil). In all three investigation years, the highest fresh and cooked red beet phosphorus content was recorded in the treatment with 5 kg m -2 stable manure (400 and 358 mg P 100 g -1 dry weight). The highest values were recorded in 2005, probably owing to very good agroecological conditions. Cooked red beet phosphorus content was 10 % lower than in fresh red beet in all trial years. Keywords: Beta vulgaris var. conditiva, phosphorus, fertilization, soil Introduction Soil is a renewable natural resource, whose restoration can be, among others, enhanced by adequate fertilization (Varallyay, 2007). Daniel and Gyori (2000), cited according to Čoga et al. (2007), report that prolonged application of phosphorus fertilizers, produced from raw phosphates containing high amounts of Cd, may lead to an increase in soil Cd and its accumulation in plants; thereby reducing the nutritional value of plants. High yields can only be obtained through the application of optimal NPK doses in balanced proportions (Poljak et al., 2007). Optimal fertilization would enable production of vegetables of high nutritional value, the consumption of which would supply the organism with sufficient amounts of vitamins and amino acids (Ćustić et al., 2002), as well as minerals (Russo, 1996) because sustainable agricultural production processes focus on the conversion of agricultural products into final food products (Husti, 2006). Phosphorus mobility in soil is low because of the generally low solubility of phosphate compounds and the strong P-binding capacity of soil components (Kadar, 2007). Kadar and Erno (2000) report that Beta vulgaris L. does not have a high soil P content requirement (150-200 mg P205 kg -1 soil). Lešić et al. (2004) report that 50 kg P is necessary for red beet yields of 60 t ha-1. Phosphorus, along with nitrogen and potassium, is the most important biogenic macroelement, because it enters into the composition of phosphatides, nucleotides, nucleic acids and enzymes. Red beet is recommended for the prevention of cancer appearance and its treatment (Bobek et al., 2000). Lešić et al. (2004) and Kołota and Adamczevska-Sowińska (2006) report that red beet contains 30-66 mg P 100 g-1 dry matter, similarly to Maynard and Hochmuth (1997), and Bergmann (1992) reports 0.2-0.6% P, while Herak Ćustić et al. (2007) report that up to 6.2 g P2O5 kg -1 fresh weight can be found in red beet. Red beet can be consumed fresh or processed, most commonly preserved cooked. Lisiewska et al.</p><p id="Pg435">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 436 (2006) maintain that cooking does not cause loss of any large amount of minerals from red beet. The goal of this research was to assess the influence of different fertilization treatments upon phosphorus levels in soil after harvest and in the edible parts of fresh and cooked red beet. Materials and methods Three-year (2003-2005) fertilization trial with red beet (cultivar Bikor), laid out according to the Latin square method with four treatments (unfertilized control, 5 kg m-2 stable manure, and 50 and 100 g m-2 NPK 5-20-30), was conducted in Jastrebarsko (2003) and Otočac (2004 and 2005), Croatia. Beet seed was sown directly into soil in the third decade of May. Harvest was done in the third decade of August. Plant spacing was 0.07 m x 0.40 m; the main plot area was 12 m2. Half of each beet sample was analyzed fresh and the other half was first cooked in distilled water and then analyzed. Dry homogenized samples of plant material (105 °C) and air-dry soil were analyzed in triplicate and the results are presented as mean values. Soil phosphorus was determined according to Egner et al. (1960), while plant phosphorus was determined by spectrophotometer after digestion with concentrated HNO3. Table 1.

According to precipitation and temperature data for growing periods of all three years, 2005 was agroecologically the most favourable year for red beet production (Table 1). Results and discussion Results of chemical analyses of phosphorus in soil and in fresh and cooked red beet are given in Table 2. In all three trial years, statistically significant differences were determined in post-harvest soil phosphorus contents in dependence on fertilization. In</p><p id="Pg436">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 437 2003 and 2005, the highest and statistically significant phosphorus amount was recorded in fertilization with 100 g m-2 NPK 5-20-30 (73 and 99 mg P2O5 kg -1 soil, respectively). In 2004, the highest soil phosphorus content was determined in fertilization with stable manure (139 mg P2O5 kg -1 soil), which is not statistically different from the treatment with 100 g m-2 NPK 5-20-30 (127 mg P2O5 kg -1 soil). In all three trial years (in 2003 and 2004 also statistically significant), the lowest soil phosphorus content was determined in the unfertilized control treatment (21, 89 and 54 mg P2O5 kg -1 soil, respectively). In all three trial years, the highest phosphorus content in fresh beet at harvest was recorded in fertilization with 5 kg m-2 stable manure (270, 224 and 400 mg P 100 g-1 dry matter, respectively).

Means without any letter indicate no significant differences In 2005, phosphorus contents of fresh beet, as compared to the other two years, were significantly highest (344 to 400 mg P 100 g-1 dry matter). These values are in agreement with the literature data (Lešić, 2004; Kołota and Adamczevska-Sowińska, 2006; Maynard and Hochmuth, 1997; Bergman, 1992). Such situation in 2005 can be attributed to the most favourable agroecological conditions at the critical time of the growing period compared to the other two years. In all three trial years, no statistically significant differences between treatments were determined in cooked red beet in particular years while, like in fresh beet, relatively highest values were recorded in 2005. In general, it can be pointed out that the phosphorus content of cooked beet</p><p id="Pg437">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 438 decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.01) by 10 % in all three years compared to fresh beet, which is somewhat higher decrease than reported by Lisiewska et al. (2006). This is also corroborated by strong correlations between fresh and cooked beet for each trial year (r=0.619, r=0.987, r=0.787, respectively). No statistically significant differences were determined in interactions between trial factors. Conclusions The highest phosphorus content values in fresh and cooked red beet were determined in fertilization with 5 kg m-2 stable manure. Phosphorus content of fresh beet decreased by 10 % compared to cooked beet. Fertilization with 100 g m-2 NPK 5-20-30 resulted in the highest post-harvest phosphorus content in soil. Based on the research results, combined fertilization with stable and mineral fertilizers is recommended for red beet. References Bergmann W.: 1992. Nutritional disorders of plants.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 439 VINE PLANT CHLOROSIS ON UNSTRUCTURED CALCAREOUS SOILS AND LEAF Ca, Mg and K CONTENT Mirjana HERAK ĆUSTIĆ1 – David GLUHIĆ2 – Lepomir ČOGA1 – Marko PETEK1 – Ivan GOŠĆAK3 1 Department of Plant Nutrition, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska cesta 25, HR10000 Zagreb, Croatia, mcustic@agr.hr 2 Institute for Agriculture and Tourism, Poreč, Croatia 3 Student, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: Excess calcium in expressly carbonate soils (up to 40 % CaO) in the Plešivica sub-region causes soil bicarbonates accumulation and ion antagonism, thereby disturbing uptake of nutrients, notably Mg and micronutrients. Deficit of some elements results in chlorosis and physiological disorders, which often depress yield and wine quality. Research results show significant differences in soil reaction and CaCO3 and CaO content between investigated soils of the Plešivica vine-growing region. Soil lime content influenced ion antagonism between Ca, Mg and K in vine plants. Magnesium uptake was probably depressed by Ca excess. Soil chemical properties were not the only reason for chlorosis occurrence. Chlorosis is a consequence of grapevine cultivation on inadequate rootstocks and also on unstructured soils of heavy mechanical composition. Keywords: active lime, grapevine, chlorosis, leaf Mg, Ca, K content Introduction The food chain involves agricultural production and its inputs, processing, distribution and consumption of food and so agricultural production has an impact upon the environment (Husti, 2006). Soils are conditionally renewable natural resources and their sustainable use is possible with proper agrotechnics (tillage and fertilization), moisture regime regulation, recycling of plant residues and prevention of soil degradation and pollution (Varallay, 2007). In vineyards, agricultural inputs depend more than elsewhere on soil properties and fertilization. Because of the very sensitive and sophisticated grapevine production, especially if planted on inadequate rootstocks and under inadequate agro-technics, chlorosis and physiological disorders, as indicators of ion antagonism, are most commonly observed in calcareous soils. Calcareous soils are characterized by carbonate contents, by high pH and thereby also high HCO3 - concentrations in soil solution (Mengel and Kirkby, 2001). All this favours formation of HCO3 - ions, which cause disturbances in the uptake of nutrients and different types of chlorosis (Imas, 2000; Ksouri et al., 2005). All this often depresses yield and wine quality (Herak Ćustić at al., 2007). Calcium makes up more than 80 % of calcareous soils and exchangeable Mg only 4 %, which leads to Mg chlorosis (Hagin and Tucker, 1982). Garcia et al. (1999) report that high content of Ca in the soil influences ion antagonism between Ca, Mg and K in the vine plant. Because of unfavourable soil physical and chemical properties and very important role of Mg in the central atom of chlorophyll and also as activator of numerous enzymes in the plant, Mg-foliar fertilization has the advantage over uptake through roots (Takacs et al., 2007). Most soils of the Plešivica wine-growing region are alkaline, of heavy mechanical composition and low air capacity. The research objective was to determine the soil</p><p id="Pg439">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 440 reaction, CaCO3 and CaO in the soil and Ca, Mg and K content in the plant in 4 vineyards planted on SO4 rootstock. Materials and methods Field investigations were carried out in 2005 and 2006 in the Plešivica vine-growing region in Croatia. The trial was set up on vitisol (rendzina on marl.) Soils are of heavy mechanical composition, with low air capacity, alkaline and calcareous. In 2005, chlorosis was evaluated visually and vineyards were divided into zones of chlorotic and non-chlorotic plants. In the same year, physical and chemical properties were determined and 82 soil samples from vineyards of 25 wine producers were taken. According to soil active lime content, all soils were divided into 3 types: with low, medium and high lime content (20, 25, 30 % CaO, respectively). Four vineyards (cv. Sauvignon blanc) planted on SO4 rootstock (unresistant to high active lime content) and calcareous soils (Borička, Klemenka, Veselnica, Šipkovica) were selected for investigations in 2006. Soil reaction, CaCO3 and CaO content in soil and Mg, Ca and K content in vine plants were determined. Soil reaction was measured in H2O and 1 MKCl (soil suspension 1:2.5 /10g soil + 25 ml H20 or 1 MKCl) on a pH-meter with combined electrode. Active lime content was determined according to Galet, and total lime content on Scheibler calcimeter (JDPZ, 1966). Leaf potassium content was determined using a flame-photometer, while Mg and Ca in the plant by AAS. Statistical data analyses were performed using the SAS 8.2 System (1999-2000). Results and discussion Preliminary investigations done in 2005 revealed that the soils under study were unstructured calcareous soils (silty clay loam, silty loam) with a high proportion of fine silt, susceptible to compaction and of very low air capacity (0.2.-3.5 %). Also, in 49 % of 82 investigated soil samples from 25 wine producers, between 25 and 40% CaO was found (Jakovčić, 2006). All this can certainly have a limiting effect on vine growing, so selection of chlorotic and non-chlorotic vine plants was made for further research work on 4 selected vineyard locations (Borička, Klemenka, Veselnica, Šipkovica). According to the soil active lime content, all soils were divided into 3 types: with low, medium and high lime content (20, 25, 30 % CaO, respectively). It was found in 2006 that the research location had a significant influence on all the soil parameters measured (soil reaction, CaCO3 and CaO contents) whereas the zone of chlorotic plants and their interactions had no significant effect (Table 1). The average soil reaction value in water was 7.8, and in 1 M KCl 7.7, which indicates alkaline soils. The recorded CaCO3 values and, which is particularly important, levels of active lime (CaO) on particular locations show its significantly lower amount in Šipkovica compared to other locations. Veselnica and Borička locations had approximately identical amounts of active lime (Table 2). Soil lime content (low, medium or high) had no significant effect on potassium and magnesium contents, while a significant difference was recorded in plant calcium contents (Table 3). It is interesting to note that significantly higher Ca values were determined in soils with low and high lime contents compared to soil with medium lime supply. Ratios between calcium and magnesium (Ca/Mg) ions also show that soils</p><p id="Pg440">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 441 with low and high lime contents had a much higher ratio (9.5) compared to soil with medium lime content (5.9). Higher ratio between potassium and magnesium (K/Mg) ions was also determined in soil with low and high lime content (3.8) compared to soil with medium lime content (3.3). Contrary to that, lower ratios between potassium and calcium (K/Ca) ions were determined on soils with low and high lime content (0.4) than in soil with medium lime content (0.6). Table 1.

This competition can lead to Mg deficiency in plants. Not only the uptake, but also the translocation of Mg from the roots to the upper plant parts can be restricted by K+ and Ca+2. Thus, the increased plant calcium content found in our investigations could have, as reported also by other authors (Garcia at al., 1999), influenced its adverse ratio to magnesium. Thereby, along with other already mentioned adverse soil conditions, cause chloroses, but also confirm the fact that moderate amount of a particular ion in soil is optimal for nutrient uptake. Viticulturalists try to solve the problem of high lime contents by adequate selection of rootstock such as 41 B or 140 R. This was not,</p><p id="Pg441">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 442 however, the case in these investigations where rootstock SO4 was used which tolerates only about 17 % of active lime. In view of all the mentioned facts and a relatively large number of unknowns about the uptake and translocation of particular ions through the plant, it is possible, in accord with Bavaresco et al. (2005), that chlorotic leaves had higher macronutrient levels than green leaves and that their concentrations did not correlate with chlorosis occurrence. Conclusions Effects of soil reaction and soil lime content on studied locations had a significant influence on the incidence of grapevine chlorosis, notably Mg chlorosis. It is assumed that the high Ca content had an antagonistic effect upon the uptake and translocation of Mg ions through the plant. Besides excess Ca, occurrence of chlorosis was also significantly influenced by adverse soil physical properties and very low air capacity, but also by the selection of rootstock (SO4) not tolerant to high lime levels. Hence, we recommend mineral fertilization using a vibrational 2-row subsoiler with pneumatic fertilizer device for depth fertilization, and two foliar applications (every 10 days) of Mg early in spring as soon as the leaf area is sufficiently developed.

E-mail: kodobocz@hotmail.com Abstract: The goal of the experiment was to characterize the efficiency of phytoremediation technologies by quantifying the major groups of rhizosphere microorganisms. An integrated phytoremediation experiment including physical, chemical and biological treatments was developed on a mine waste. Three parcels were established: 1. mine waste; 2. mine waste plus fly ash; 3. mine waste plus fly ash plus lime. To determine the number of heterotrophic bacteria and microscopic fungi plate count method was used. Two tailed correlation analysis between soil chemical and microbiological properties was studied. The shoot dry weight of plants was risen several times as a result of integrated phytoremediation treatments. Our results indicated the relationship between plant shoot dry weight and CFU number of rhizosphere microbes. Modifying the physical and chemical characteristics of mine waste had a positive effect on the quantity of rhizosphere microorganisms. It was concluded, that rhizosphere microorganisms, as mediators in plant soil interactions, indirectly could indicate the efficicncy of phytoremediation technologies. Keywords: rhizosphere microorganisms, integrated phytoremediation, complex inoculum. Introduction Soil microbiota especially rhizosphere microorganisms play an important role in soilplant interactions. The rhizosphere is the zone of soil influenced by roots through the release of substrates that affect microbial activity. Microbial activity in the rhizosphere affects rooting patterns and the supply of available nutrients to plants (Barea et al., 2005). There are two types of interactions in the rhizosphere: the first is related with decompostition of plant residues, which affect energy and nutrient flows; the second is the active exchange between living root and soil microbiota (Biró, 2007). Interactions between soil physical, chemical and biological properties determine the functioning and diversity of soil microbial populations (Azevedo et al., 2005). We can indicate soil functioning and quality of agricultural systems and remediated lands via quantification of biological parameters of the rhizosphere (Máthé-Gáspár et al., 2006). The objective of this paper was the characterization of a phytoremediation technology by the quantification of main microorganisms groups in the rhizosphere. Materials and methods Sampling site. Sampling site is located near village Gyöngyösoroszi (North-East Hungary), on the territory of an abandoned Pb/Zn mine. The climate of the region is temperate with continental features. An integrated mine waste phytoremediation experiment with physical chemical and biological treatments was set up in 2007 with three different combinations: 1. mine waste; 2. mine waste with fly ash; 3. mine waste with fly as and lime. All treatments were completed with a complex microbial inoculum and N:P:K nutrients in a ratio 15 : 15 : 15, dosage:300 kg/ha. Molasses as carbon source was added to the treated plots. These nutrients were applied to increase the poor fertility of the mine waste.</p><p id="Pg443">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 444 Plant and soil samples. Soil samples were taken from the rhizosphere of grass, sorghum and sudan grass, at three replicates both from control and treated plots, from 0-20 cm depth. Plant and soil samples were dried at room temperature until the weight stabilized. The total element content of plant and soil samples was determined by ICP spectrometry. The number of CFU (colony forming units) x g-1 dry sample was determined using plate count method on Nutrient (for heterotrophs) and Rose Bengal Agar (for microscopic fungi). Data analysis. SPSS program were used for two-tailed correlation analysis between soil physical and chemical and microbiological properties. Results and discussion Plant biomass Plant growth was not detected in the parcel which contained mine waste alone (Fig, 12). Fly ash and lime additives significantly increased shoot dry weight of grasses and sorghum plant. The same result was realized in the case of sudan grass (data not shown). The microbial inoculum with chemical amendment had a significantly positive effect on shoot dry weight of plants. The biomass production of plants did not show significant differences in the inoculated parcels. As a result of the integrated phytoremediation technology the shoot dry weight of grasses had risen three times, in the case of sorghum seven times and in the case of sudan grass more than tenfold increment was detected. Rhizosphere colonization Colonization of plant rhizosphere was estimated by the numbers of colony forming unites of heterotrophs bacteria and microscopic fungi. The CFU number of native microbial population of mine waste was about 106 g –1 (Fig. 1-2). Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 445 The CFU number of mine waste after microbial inoculation had risen, but the differences were not significant, compared to the control plot. As a result of complex chemical and biological treatments the number of heterotrophic microbes had rise up to 5x108 and the differences were significant comparing to the untreated mine waste. Figure 2. Sorghum biomass and number of heterotrophic bacteria and microscopic fungi in different treatments (M- mine waste; A-fly ash; L-lime carbohydrate; c-control; t-treated). Complex treatments together with microbial inoculation gave better results in all cases comparing to the chemical ones. The maximum number of microscopic fungi was detected in mine waste mixed with fly ash with microbial inoculation and the minimum value was measured in lime treated plots. A relationship between plant shoot dry weight and CFU number of rhizosphere microbes was established (Fig. 1-2). No significant differences in CFU numbers were detected when the corresponding treatments of different plant rhizosphere samples were compared. This fact indicates that there were no differences in rhizosphere effect of plants investigated. Soil properties and plant microbiota Number of heterotrophic microorganisms had a strong negative correlation with soil conductivity (p&lt;0,01) and a positive correlation with soil pH (KCl), C, humus, K2O and P2O5 content (Table 1). Positive correlation (p&lt;0,05) was found as well with soil B and Ca content. There was a negative correlation (p&lt;0,01) between number of microscopic fungi and soil pH (KCl), B, Ca, Mg and Mn content. The positive effect of fly ash and lime additives on plant dry weight and rhizosphere microbiota is particularly related to the pH value, what is confirmed by the strong correlation between soil pH and rhizosphere microbial parameters.

Positive correlation between heterotrophic microorganisms and soil C, K2O and P2O5 content support the efficiency of applied technologies. As a consequence, microbial inoculation should be supplemented with essential nutrients in case of mine wastes with poor fertility. In connection with physical, chemical or biological additives to phytoremediation technology we also have to pay attention on possible adverse effects (heavy metal mobilization, Na-accumulation etc.) of this additives (Barkóczi et al., 2007).

Nitrogen and liming material were added on two levels, while Ni on three. The same environment was ensured for all 4 replications of 12 treatment combinations. On the chernozem soil N and Ni had a significant effect on the Ca-content of plants at P=0.1%. Ca-content of plants was determined on the blownsand soil by all three treatments (N, Ni, and liming) and we could reveal the interaction between Ni and liming. On the chernozem soil all three factors (N, Ni, and liming) increased Ni-uptake at P=0.1%. The interaction between N and Ni was also significant. On the blownsand soil the Ni-content increased parallel to higher nitrogen-dosages at P=10% significance level. The effect of Ni and liming was significant: in presence of higher Ni-amount, the Ni-content of plants also increased, depending on liming, this increment was different. Keywords: nutrient-supply, nickel-loading, liming, Ca-content, Ni-content Introduction There are many natural and anthropogenic factors, which determine plant production. It’s also well-known, that plant production is determined not only by one factor, – e.g. nutrient and water supply, basic soil characteristics, such as soil-pH, biological makings, anthropogenic pollutants – but by the interaction between all factors. Negative factors, such as heavy metal-content of soils, mean a serious risk for plants and other members of food chain (Bíró – Takács, 2007). It should also be considered that environmental and production factors (e.g. supply of nutrients, changes in soil pH, precipitation) can modify the mobility of nutrient elements (Kincses et al., 2007; Ragályi – Kádár, 2006; Rékási – Filep, 2006) and pollutants. For we know, that compost materials (Kovács – Füleky, 2007) and sewage sludge applications may cause heavy metal contaminations, it is important to investigate and know the interactions between favourable – e.g. nutrient-supply (Kádár, 2005), liming (Karalic et al. 2007) – and pollutants – Ni-contamination (Vágó et al. 1995; 1997) – determine the yield, dry matter and chemical composition of plants. Materials and methods Setting up our experiment, we aimed to study and reveal the interactions between and direct effects of heavy metal – nickel – contamination and other production factors, which have favourable effect on plant development (fertilization, CaCO3 application) on the chemical composition of plants. A pot experiment was set up in May 2006. We used perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a test plant. The experiment was carried out on two extremely different soil types. One of the soils was calcareous chernozem with high fertility and buffering capacity from DebrecenLátókép, while the other was an acidic sandy soil with weak fertility from Újfehértó.</p><p id="Pg447">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 448 Each of the 12 pots per replication was treated with a joint solution of 100 mg kg-1 P and 160 mg kg-1 K, in 10 cm3 KH2PO4 and K2SO4. Nitrogen was added to the soils as NH4NO3 solution. To six combinations 80 mg kg -1, to the other six combinations 160 mg kg-1 N was added. Ni was added as NiSO4 solution, in 0, 50 and 100 mg kg -1 dosages. Lime requirement of the soils was calculated according to the method of Filep (1988). Each treatment was carried out in four replications. The water supply was ensured by daily irrigation to a specific weight. Plants were cut two times, 33 and 61 days after sowing. The grass yield was dried and the dry matter production per pot was measured, then fractured and the element-content was measured by inductive coupled plasma analyzer (ICP-OES). Results and discussion On the chernozem soil (Tab. 1) nitrogen had an effect on the Ca-content at P=0.1% level, while CaCO3 resulted an effect at P=0.1% significance. Adding a higher amount of N also resulted in higher Ca-content of plants. Liming also resulted in a Ca-content increment of plants. It’s also due to the adequate CaCO3-supply, for we got our soil samples from the above 30 cm at the production site, within that the amount of Ca was leached.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 449 Regarding the combinations set up on the blownsand soil (Tab. 1), it can be stated, that nitrogen and liming had a significant effect on the Ca-content of plants at P=0.1% level, while Ni at P=1.0%. The interaction between Ni and liming was significant at P=5%. By adding a higher amount of N, the Ca-content of samples was also higher, that is due to the more appropriate nutrient supply of plants. Liming had also a positive effect on the Ca-content of plants by all Ni- and N-combinations. Liming resulted in a more favourable soil pH (Karalic et al., 2007). The blownsand soil was acidic with low buffering capacity, so liming increased the amount of Ca-ions to uptake. On the chernozem soil (Tab. 2) liming, nitrogen-supply and Ni-contamination had at P=0.1% level significant effect on the nickel content of the dry matter of ryegrass. We also could reveal an interaction between Ni and N at P=0.1%. Higher N-dosages resulted in higher Ni-content of plants. The effect of different N-dosages depended on the amount of Ni added. The reverse of this statement is also true. The effect of Ni is conspicuous in dependence of N-supply and liming as well. The Ni-content was higher in combinations treated with lime, than in combinations without lime-treatment. Because of the high colloid-content of the chernozem soil, most of the Ni-ions became adsorbed on the surface of colloids. In treatments without there was hardly any Ni2+-ion in the soil solution, so plants could not take it up. But in treatments with lime the concentration of Ca2+-ions increased, and they changed the adsorbed Ni2+-ions. So the Ni-concentration of the soil solution increased and plants could take up more Ni.

The statistical analysis showed a significant interaction between Nicontamination and liming at P=0.1% level. It can be stated that in treatments with and without lime as well, the Ni-content of plants increased with the higher amount of nitrogen added. Adding a higher amount of Ni, the Ni-content of plants increased, however the rate of this increment differed depending on liming. From the data of table it’s evident, that in treatments with and without liming, as well the Ni-content increased. However, the increment of the Ni-content was in combinations not treated with lime much higher, than in limed ones. It’s probably because of the higher Ni ion-content of soil solution as well, so plants could take up more Ni. Liming had a balancing effect on soil pH. For we know, that Ni is more soluble in acidic environment, the higher soil pH-values depressed the amount of Ni-ions in the soil solution and in plants as well. Conclusions On the chernozem soil N and liming affected the Ca-content of drymatter. Ca-content of plants was determined on the blownsand soil by all three factors (N, Ni and liming) and there was an interaction between Ni and liming. Due to appropriate nutrient-supply, a higher amount of available Ca-ions and improvement of a better pH-value the N-supply and liming increased Ca-uptake. On the chernozem soil N and Ni increased Ni-uptake. However, liming also had a positive effect on Ni-content of soil solution, which can be explained by the high amount of colloids in the soil, and the replacement of Ca- and Ni-ions. The interaction between N and Ni was also significant. On the blownsand soil the Ni-content increased parallel to higher nitrogen-dosages. In presence of higher Ni-amount, the Ni-content of plants also increased, depending on liming, this increment was different. References Bíró I. – Takács T.

Soil potassium uptake is strongly dependent on the status of other soil cations, such as calcium and magnesium, especially on calcareous soils. Research was done during 2006 on three fully productive vineyards (I, II and III). The vineyards were a significant source of variability for all investigated parameters: pH value, soil and leaf potassium status, and soil active lime. The determined soil potassium values ranged from 142.5 to 197.1 mg K2O kg -1 , soil lime content was from 18.82 to 28.44 % CaO, and from 1.05 to 1.17 % K in leaves, while the leaf potassium content in the vineyards that contain the highest soil potassium was significantly lower. But, the best quality grapes were harvested vineyard II. Leaf sampling time also influenced the leaf potassium status. Leaf potassium content increased at harvest time. Research on the relationship between potassium in soil and in leaf will be continued in the coming years to obtain more accurate data. Keywords: potassium, vine plant, calcareous soil, active lime, rootstock Introduction Potassium plays a very important role in plant physiology. Its presence is required for cellular osmotic and ionic balance, neutralization of organic acids, and regulation of stomatal function, cell division, enzyme activation, and synthesis and translocation of sugars (Fregoni, 1998; Varallyay, 1994). Potassium also plays important role in protein synthesis (Loue and Boulay, 1984). Some researchers noted how by high nitrogen fertilization, withouth adequate potassium supply, the protein synthesis were reduced (Klupacs and Tarnawa, 2007, El Hallof and Sarvari, 2007). The grape proteins are very important for regular must fermentation (Fregoni, 1998). Knowledge of soil potassium levels and major soil properties, such as texture, pH, cations level, etc., when the plant is grown on calcareous soils is of great importance (Csatho, 1992; Garcia et al., 1999; Kadar I., 2007; Rajkai et al., 1997). An adequate potassium supply is required for better plant resistance to disease, drought and frost (Fregoni 1998, Husti, 2006). The main soil potassium source are clay minerals (Nemeth and Sipos, 2006). The soil potassium sink is divided into three fractions: potassium as a structural element of soil minerals, K+ adsorbed in exchangeable form by soil colloids such as clay minerals and organic matter, and K+ present in the soil solution. Potassium is absorbed as free K+ ion dissolved in the soil solution. Exchangeable and non-exchangeable K+ amounts represent only a small percent of total soil K+. Generally, the percentage of exchangeable K+ of the total soil K+ decreases as the clay content increases (Martin and Sparks, 1983). Vine plants potassium requirement is very high. Retard effects on the shoot growing in two years after application was determined by the KCl form fertilizer rate. This effect was not determined by K-sulphate (Fodorne-Feher et al., 2007). Fregoni (1998) reports that for the production of 10 t grapes ha-1 the demand is 112 kg K2O ha -1. The same author says that the demand of nitrogen is 76 kg N ha-1 and 44 kg P2O5 ha -1. The bulk of K+ is mainly taken up during the vegetative growth stage. In the period from the end of flowering to veraison, the rate of K+ uptake by vine plant is particularly high. Rootstock selection can differentially affect nutrient uptake as well. Although</p><p id="Pg451">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 452 rootstocks differ little in nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation, they vary considerably in the absorption of potassium and calcium (Loue and Boulay, 1984). The same authors report that rootstock 44.53 accumulated much more potassium than other rootstocks, such as 41B, SO4 or 110R. With equal soil potassium content, rootstock 44.53 achieved a 2.2 % leaf potassium content whereas other rootstocks did not surpass 1.8 %. The optimal rate of leaf potassium is around 1.2-3.0 %, while the toxic range is more than 3.5 % (Loue and Boulay, 1984; Christensen, 1984). In the agroecological conditions of Californian vineyards, the toxic level is around 3.0 % (Christensen and Cook, 1966, cit. by Fregoni, 1998) while in Italian vineyards Fregoni (1998) recorded a toxic level of 1.6 %. The high K+ uptake rate is a strong competition to the uptake of other cations, whose absorption rate is especially enhanced when the K+ uptake is low. On the other hand, the K+ uptake and retention in plant cells are also competitively affected by H+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ (Elzam and Hodges, 1967). Materials and methods Research was conducted in the area Plešivica wine-growing region (North-Western Croatia). This paper presents the results of the first investigation year, 2006. The trial was set up in three fully productive vineyards (I, II and III), cv. Sauvignon white, grafted on SO4 rootstock, planted on highly calcareous soils without potassium fertilization. Soil samples were taken at the beginning of the vegetative cycle, at two depths (0-30 and 30-60 cm) according to Škorić (1982). Leaf samples were taken 4 times during the growing period (beginning of vegetative cycle, prior to flowering, after full flowering and at harvest) according to Fregoni (1998). Soil reaction was measured in H2O and 1 MKCl (soil suspension 1:2.5 10 g -1 soil + 25 mL H2O/1 MKCl) on a standard pH meter unit. Soil lime content was determined by the Galet method (JDPZ, 1966). Soil potassium was determined according to Egner et al. (1960). Leaf potassium was determined using a flame photometer (Isaac and Kerber, 1971). Grape sugar content was measured with a digital refractometer (Fregoni, 1998). Statistical data analyses were performed using the standard statistical methods. Results and discussion According to the ANOVA results (Table 1), the vineyards are a significant source of variability with regard to all parameters. Soil sampling depth did not affect the potassium level, or the active lime content or pH value. The soils are typical alkaline, with an average value of 7.77 (H2O) and 7.69 (1 M KCl). Investigated vineyards soils are generally slightly deficient in soil potassium. According to Škorić (1982), the optimal soil potassium level is approximately 250 mg K2O kg -1 soil. Optimal ranges of other researchers are different due the different soil extract solutions. The highest potassium soil content was determined in vineyard II. Significant differences in active lime soil content were found between the vineyards (Table 2). Vineyards I and II can be allotted to the high calcareous soil category (&gt; 25 % CaO), whereas vineyard III is moderately calcareous soil (20 % CaO). Table 1.

The leaf potassium content did not follow the soil potassium trend (Table 4). The highest soil potassium (Table 2) and the lowest leaf potassium (Table 4) contents were determined in vineyard II. Although vineyards I and II contain similar soil active lime contents, the difference determined between their leaf potassium contents was probably not affected only by soil active lime. This difference could be influenced by the potassium ion competition with other soil cations, as reported by Elzam and Hodges (1967). On the other side, vineyards I and III, which have the same level of soil (Table 2) and leaf potassium (Table 4) contents, show a significant difference in soil active lime. Table 3.

In the first three samplings, leaf potassium contents were determined in the optimal range (1.2-2.5 %) as reported by Christensen (1984), Winkler et al. (1974) and Fregoni (1998). Although the lowest leaf potassium content was recorded at harvest time, typical symptoms of potassium deficiency - reduced shoot</p><p id="Pg453">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 454 growth and browning, and leaf necrosis (Fregoni, 1998) were not observed. The highest grape sugar content was achieved in vineyard II with the highest soil potassium and the lowest leaf potassium contents, where up to 24 % Brix was determined while up to 22 % Brix was recorded in other vineyards. Conclusions Potassium management, both in soil and plant, plays an important role for the production of high quality grapes. This fact is more significant if vineyards are planted on calcareous soils. Research results confirm that the leaf potassium status is not directly influenced by the soil potassium content. As well as, the soil active lime is not the only soil parameter that influenced the potassium status, in soil or leaf, and finally that a high leaf potassium content still does not guarantee high sugar content in mature grapes.

HAMID - György FÜLEKY Department of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Institute of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, Szent István University, 2103 Gödöllő, Páter K. u. 1. Hungary e-mail: fuleky.gyorgy@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: Computer analysis was used to separate the very fast, fast and slow carbonate dissolution reactions in the genetic horizons of a Keszthely chernozem soil. In the 0-25 cm, 25-45 cm, 45-64 cm and 64-115 cm horizons of the soil the manometric data were analyzed in the coarse sand and clay fractions. The fitted first order kinetic equations very well described the parallel reactions. At the same time calcite and dolomite were used to demonstrate the fast and slow dissolution reactions, respectively. During soil development the fast dissolution process disappeared from the coarse sand fraction of the upper horizon, but this process significantly increased in the accumulation horizon both in the coarse sand and clay fractions. Keywords: carbonate, soil, dissolution kinetics, genetic horizon, particle size Introduction The acid dissolution kinetics of CaCO3 is important to many fields of applications, i.e., the maintenance of marble monuments, the uptake of calcium medicines, the dissolution of liming materials and apatite containing phosphate and carbonate crystals tightly held together, when it is introduced into the soil-plant system (Economu et al., 1996) There are many sustainable calcium carbonate modifications that appear as initial solid phases in many carbonate precipitation processes, and most probably as precursors in carbonate geological sediments. The kinetics of CaCO3 dissolution is very sensitive to the surface structure, composition, and physical properties of the crystals (Economu et al. 1996). They determined, that the dissolution rate of CaCO3 particles is decreased with the increase of the particle size.It was concluded that effective diameter of carbonate crystals and activation energies of calcite and dolomite are two important parameters affecting acid dissolution rates. In a subsequement experimental investigation with pure calcite and dolomite, Turner and Skinner (1959) showed that acid dissolutions did indeed follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. Even though different rate constants may be yielded by dolomite, depending upon crystal size, rates are sufficiently different from rates of dissolution of calcite of equivalent size. Evangelu et al. (1984) used a method which based on differential pseudo-first-order kinetic rates of dissolution of the two carbonate species (dolomite and calcite) when reacted with excess of 5 M HCl. Gehlen et al (2005) carried out kinetic experiments with biogenic CaCO3. They derived an average reaction rate order n=2.30.4. The higher reaction order is explained in terms of multiphase system. It results from the concomitant dissolution of carbonate fractions characterized by variable reaction rate constants. The objective of this study was to separate the possible dissolution reactions with computer analysis, and at the same time determine these dissolution reactions in different particle size fractions of soil.</p><p id="Pg455">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 456 Materials and methods The samples were taken from the genetic horizons of a chernozem soil at Keszthely.

The measured amount of particle size fraction was put into a glass. Hydrochloric acid, 10 % was added in excess. The volume of CO2 released was measured in a Scheibler calcimeter (Buzás et al. 1993). Pure calcite and dolomite were powered and their carbonate content was also determinal. The CO2 development was read 27 times between 0-60 minutes. 3 term first order kinetic equation was fitted to the measured data: Y = Q + A1(1-e -k1t) + A2(1-e -k2t) Where Y = is the amount of carbonate developed, % Q = is the amount of carbonate developed very fastly, in the first 20 second, % A1 and A2 = are the maximum amount of carbonate developed faster and slower respectively, % k1 and k1 = are the rate constants of the faster and slower processes, respectively, 1/min In the case of calcite and dolomite only one first order kinetic reaction was supposed. Results and discussion Table 1., and Figures 1. shows the kinetic parameters of carbonate dissolution. The used equations in all cases very well fit to the measured data. Calcite and dolomite dissolution can be characterized with one first order reaction. Calcite with one fast reaction, where k1 is very big (14.4) and the half-life-time is 0.05 minute. It is really fast one. In the case of dolomite the slow reaction with k2 (0.29) and with a half-life-time 2.4 minute, not so slow. In all the genetic horizons the slow process practically the same in the coarse sand and clay fractions, 4-5 % and1-2 %, respectively. The upper soil horizon shows a characteristic picture, in the coarse sand fraction there is no fast reaction, only 1 % very fast one. The clay fraction almost, in all horizons contains more fast dissolution reaction carbonate than the coarse sand fraction. In the upper horizon in the clay fraction the fast process is rather slow (k1 = 0.82) and small (2.4). The carbonate accumulation well follows the soil development, its maximum mainly is in the coarse sand fraction, of the B horizon.

The amount of the carbonate can be characterized with the maximum values (A and Q) of the reactions, the solubility and reactivity with the rate constant (k) values and half-life-time values. The distribution of carbonates between soil horizons and particle size fractions could be also well described with the first order kinetic reactions and their parameters.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 459 PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF SELENIUM ANALYSIS BY INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY IN PLANT AND SOIL SAMPLES Béla KOVÁCS - Éva SZÉLES - József PROKISCH Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology, Centre of Agricultural Sciences, University of Debrecen Abstract: Methods are suggested to decrease the error of selenium analysis from plant and soil samples. To analyse selenium in agricultural samples (plant, food, feed and soil), the most appropriate inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer is a quadrupole instrument applying a collision cell technique (CCT). The extent of interfering effect of carbon content depends on the type of compounds. The carbon content significantly affects the measured concentration (intensities) of Se, which can be corrected using internal standard (arsenic or tellurium). Keywords: selenium, ICP-MS, plant, soil Introduction For analysis of elements in different samples (plant, soil, food raw material, food, feed, organic fertiliser, irrigation- and soil-water, sewage, sewage sludge), generally a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS), a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GF-AAS), an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Montaser-Golightly, 1987.; Boss-Fredeen, 1997.) and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (Montaser, 1998.) are applied. All the analytical instruments have different physical and chemical interfering effects analysing plant and soil samples. The smaller the concentration of an analyte and the larger the concentration of the matrix the larger the interfering effects. Nowadays there is very important to analyse growingly smaller concentrations of elements. From the above analytical instruments generally the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer is capable of analysing the smallest concentration of elements. The applied ICP-MS instrument has Collision Cell Technology (CCT) also. Using CCT mode certain elements have better detection limits with 1-3 magnitudes comparing to a normal ICPMS analytical method. The CCT mode has better detection limits mainly for analysis of selenium (arsenic, germanium, vanadium and chromium). To elaborate an analytical method for selenium with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer the most important interfering effects (problems) were evaluated: 1) isobaric elemental, 2) isobaric molecular and 3) physical interferences (www.epa.gov; Montaser, 1998.). Analysing plant and soil samples an other (new) interfering effect emerged in ICP-MS, namely the effect of various matrixes having different evaporation and nebulization effectiveness, moreover having different quantity of carbon content of plant and soil samples. In our research work the effect of different water-soluble compounds furthermore the effect of various quantity of carbon content (as sample matrix) were examined on changes of intensity of selenium. So finally we could find “opportunities” to decrease the error of selenium analysis. Materials and methods In our research work an X7 type (Thermo Elemental, Winsford, UK) inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometer (ICP-QMS) was used to perform the</p><p id="Pg459">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 460 selenium analyses (Table 1.) from plants and soils. Table 1. shows the setting values of parameters of the applied ICP-MS instrument (Montaser, 1998.). Table 1. ICP-MS operating and data acquisition parameters Inductively coupled plasma: Data acquisition: RF power: 1400 W Dwell time per isotope: 10 ms Nebulizer gas flow: 0.84 L/min Number of sweeps: 21 Auxiliary gas flow: 0.95 L/min Number of replicates: 3 Cool gas flow: 13.0 L/min Sample uptake and wash time: 35 s Sample uptake rate: 0.88 mL/min Calibration mode: Peak jump Interface: Xi interface cones (Ni) 3/sample, Number of integration: 5 for blank Isotopes measured: in CCT mode: 76 Se, 77 Se, 78 Se, 80 Se, 82 Se in normal mode: 76 Se, 77 Se, 78 Se, 82 Se Results and discussion Combs (2001) has estimated that the total number of Se-deficient people in the world is approximately in the range of 500-1000 million. The vast majority of people appear to be Se undernourished, which Se deficiency can play a significant role in different diseases: eg. heart disease, I-deficiency disorders, hepatitis, influenza, cancer and HIVAIDS. To increase Se intakes improving the public health is very important. Hence to know the selenium content in mainly food, food raw material, feed, plant and soil samples also (Kádár-Radics, 2005; Kádár, 2005a; Kádár, 2005b; Tóth et al., 2005; Sipos et al., 2007; Kátai et al., 2006.). As the selenium concentration in the above samples is very low, the most appropriate analytical method is the ICP-MS (Kovács et al., 2006). The ICP-MS instrument was operated in collision cell (CCT) (using 7% (v/v) H2 in He as the collision gas) and standard modes. CCT mode is the preferred method for acquiring data for selenium concentration (76Se, 77Se, 78Se, 80Se, 82Se). CCT can eliminate the 40Ar40Ar+ and 39Ar39Ar+ interferences on 80Se and 78Se, respectively. The instrument was operated with a Peltier cooled impact bead spray chamber, single piece quartz torch (1.5 mm i.d. injector) and a conventional glass concentric nebulizer. An ICP-MS has good detection limit of selenium: appr. 0.07 µg/l for 82Se (normal mode=without CCT). However the applied X7 type ICP-MS using CCT has much better detection limit for analysis of selenium: approximately 0.001 µg/l for 80Se isotope. Using CCT we can apply the most abundant 80Se isotope (Table 2.), as the isobaric elemental (in certain cases) and the isobaric molecular unwanted interferences (polyatomic adducts=dimers and trimers) can be eliminated with application of collision and reaction gases (6-8 mL/min. 7% (v/v) H2 in He gas) (Table 3.). This better detection limit origins from using the collision and reaction gases to reduce the interfering effects on selenium peak using the most abundant selenium species. As plant or mainly soil samples contain high amount of other elements, we have to deal with the matrix effects. For element analysis of agricultural samples the best choice is an ICP-MS instrument that uses a collision cell which can eliminate the unwanted interferences. The 3rd interference effect (physical: eg. density, viscosity, surface stress, volatility and temperature of a sample, physical parameters of the ICP-MS) can be eliminated if we</p><p id="Pg460">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 461 use matrix matching, furthermore we do not change any parts of ICP-MS between the calibration and sample analysis processes. Table 2.

Effect of different compounds on the measured concentration of different selenium isotopes (carbon content: 2 %) Analysing the above types of samples a new interfering effect emerged in an ICP-MS, namely the effect of various matrixes having different evaporation and nebulization effectiveness, moreover having different quantity of carbon content. As a real agricultural sample contains different compounds containing carbon, in our research work we examined the effect of different watersoluble (carbon containing) compounds (Figure 1.) on changes of intensity (concentration) of selenium. 1) The same</p><p id="Pg461">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 462 amount of carbon content (2 %) was used in the case of each watersoluble compounds. 2) The carbon content (the concentration of applied compounds) was also changed. The 2 % carbon content resulted approximately fivefold measured concentration of selenium. This means max. 400 % error in the analysis of selenium (Figure 1.). Finally we could elaborate a method which can eliminate the effect of the above interference. As the effect of carbon containing compounds depends on the carbon intensity in the argon plasma, we analysed 13C intensity simultaneously. On the basis of analysed carbon content and the type of matrix compound, the selenium concentration (intensity) of a sample can be corrected applying internal standard. The best internal standard is arsenic, and the second choise is tellurium. Then we can decrease the extent of error in the analysis of selenium, so a more precise and accurate selenium result can be reached in analysis of plant and soil samples which materials have high concentration of carbon content. Conclusions - During the analysis with an ICP-MS there are many interferences (mainly polyadducts) - The most appropriate ICP-MS equipment is a quadrupole instrument applying a collision cell technique for analysis of agricultural samples (food, feed, plant and soil) - The extent of effects of carbon content depends on the type of compounds - The carbon content significantly affects the measured concentration (intensities) of Se, which can be corrected using internal standard (arsenic or tellurium).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 463 NITROGEN UPTAKE AND UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY OF MAIZE HYBRIDS UNDER HIGH AND LIMITED NUTRIENT SUPPLY Boris VARGA – Darko GRBEŠA – Kristina KLJAK – Tea HORVAT Faculty of Agriculture, Svetošimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, * e-mail: varga@agr.hr Abstract: Maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes with improved nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) are of interest to growers. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the total N uptake in the aboveground biomass and NUE (kg grain per kg of N absorbed in the aboveground biomass). Four commercial hybrids of similar maturity ranking were grown under the high-N (200 kg N ha -1 ) and low-N (100 kg N ha -1 ) fertilization rates over three years. Growing conditions significantly affected hybrid performance for NUE, which ranged from 42 kg grain kg N -1 in the low-yielding (dry) environment to 55 kg grain kg N -1 under higher yielding environment. When compared to the low-N rate, the average N uptake was by 32% higher at the high-N rate, whereas smaller differences occurred for the aboveground biomass (12%), grain yields (14%), stover N (28%) and grain N (13%) concentrations. Significant differences existed among tested hybrids for grain yield, aboveground biomass, grain and stover N concentration, N uptake and consequently NUE. Keywords: biomass, grain, N content, stover , yield. Introduction The effectiveness with which N is used by crop has become increasingly important because of economic and environmental concerns. This encourages growing of maize genotypes with high NUE i.e. genotypes that are able to produce higher yields at the same level of N fertilization. Crop NUE is the expression of N-uptake efficiency (total plant N per unit available N) and the utilization efficiency of the N absorbed (grain yield per unit of plant N) in producing grain. Research to date has not provided information on the importance of hybrid selection to maximize N fertilizer efficiency for the Croatian farmers. Optimum N applications are important inputs for maize production and larger yields with improved grain quality due to increasing levels of N fertilizers were found many authors (Hegyi et al., 2007; Nagy, 2007; Plavšić et al., 2007; Svečnjak et al., 2007). Genotypic differences in NUE of maize hybrids were described by Moll et al. (1982). Authors reported that NUE accounted more for the variation in grain yields at low level of N supply than N uptake efficiency (plant N content per kg of soil applied N). Other authors also documented that maize genotypes may differ in NUE when N availability is low (Presterl et al., 2002). Our objective was to evaluate four maize hybrids of similar maturity ranking for the N uptake and NUE when grown under two levels of N fertilization. Materials and methods Field experiments in a maize–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.–winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop rotation were conducted in northwestern Croatia during 2000 through 2002 on a silt loam soil (Typic Udifluvents). Previous crops (soybean and winter wheat) were grown under low fertilizer N during the years prior to use in these experiments to minimize the potential effects of residual profile NO3-N on crop response to N fertilization management. Treatments were randomized in a complete block with a split plot arrangement with five replications. Nitrogen fertilization rates of 100 (low-N rate)</p><p id="Pg463">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 464 and 200 kg N ha-1 (high-N rate) were the main plots and the four hybrids were the subplots. Tested hybrids were either introduced (Stefania and Florencia) or home-bred (Bc 462 and Bc Jumbo 48), widely grown in Croatia and of similar maturity ranking (FAO 400). This narrow range in hybrid maturity was used to minimize the potential effect of maturity differences on responses to N fertilization. Maize was planted on 28 Apr. 2000, 26 Apr. 2001, and 1 May 2002 within the optimum planting date window for the region. Individual plots were 2,8 m wide (four 0.7 m rows) and 8.0 long. Conventional herbicide and soil insecticide applications were used to control weeds and insects. At maturity, plots were evaluated for final plant stand, barren plants and stalk lodging. Very few barren and lodged plants occurred in our experiments, and therefore data are omitted from results. A few days after physiological maturity, whole plants aboveground were sampled to analyze components of NUE. Two middle rows (3.0 m of row) of all plots were hand-harvested for grain and stover (stalks, leaves and cobs) yields. Plant parts were weighed and dried for N analysis and dry matter measurements. Dry grain and stover yields, and percent N in grain and stover were obtained. Nitrogen concentrations in grain in stover were determined by Kjeldahl method and expressed on a 0% moisture basis. N-uptake was calculated by multiplying the percent N in the plant (grain plus stover) by the aboveground biomass at 0% moisture. The remainder of the two middle rows of all plots was harvested for grain with a small plot combine. Grain yields per hectare were adjusted to include grain removed in hand-harvested samples and expressed on a 14% moisture. The NUE is expressed as kilogram of grain at 14% moisture produced for each kg of N accumulated in the aboveground biomass. All data were analyzed with analysis of variance. Mean separation was obtained using a protected LSD test at the 0.05 probability level when significant F-tests (P &lt; 0.05) were observed. Results and discussion Average maize grain yields in the dry growing season of 2000 (5728 kg ha-1) were by 49% lower that those in the favorable yielding environment of 2002 (11 244 kg ha-1). In contrast, grain and stover N concentration were significantly smaller in 2002 and averaged 13.3 g kg-1 for the former and 6.0 g kg-1 for the latter. In the dry growing conditions of 2000, grain and stover concentration averaged 16.3 and 8.9 g kg-1, respectively. Despite the highest plant N concentrations, total N uptake in the dry growing season of 2000 averaged 118 kg ha-1 only because of relatively low grain yield and aboveground biomass (Table 1). High plant N concentrations associated with low grain yields brought about the smallest NUE in the growing season of 2000 (42 kg grain kg N-1), which was significantly smaller than that in 2002 (55 kg grain kg N-1). When compared to the low-N rate, the average N-uptake was by 32% higher at the highN rate, whereas smaller differences occurred for the total aboveground biomass (12%) and grain yields (14%). The increase associated with the high-N rate for grain N (13%) was much smaller than that for stover N (28%) concentration. In contrast, average NUE was significantly larger at the low-N rate (52) than at the high-N rate (44). Decrease in NUE with increased N rate was anticipated, since higher available N levels are usually needed to maximize N uptake than to maximize grain yield. In a study reported by</p><p id="Pg464">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 465 Presterl et al. (2002), average NUE increased from 44 at high N rate to 52 at low N fertilization. Table 1.

Average grain yields were unaffected by N fertilization in the dry growing season of 2000 (Table 1), though small, but significant increases in grain and stover N concentrations were observed at the high-N rate. In addition, total N uptake was significantly influenced by N rate in 2001 and 2002, but not in 2000. Significant differences existed among tested hybrids for the N uptake, NUE and other related traits (Table 2). N-uptake of the four hybrids was controlled by yield as well as grain N and stover N concentrations specific to hybrids tested. When averaged across all treatments, the highest yielding hybrid Florencia also had the highest N uptake (Table 2). Other three hybrids accumulated significantly smaller amount of N in plant, with no significant difference among them. However, the lowest yielding hybrid Bc 462 succeeded to accumulate amount of N similar to Stefania and Bc Jumbo 48, although it had significantly smaller grain yields. This was due to its highest grain N concentration that was significantly higher than those for other hybrids. However, three of the hybrids tested did not differ significantly in average NUE. Only Bc 462 was significantly lower in NUE than the remaining hybrids. There was a 12% difference between the best and poorest N-efficient hybrids in terms of grain produced per kg total N uptake in our 3-yr study (Table 2), whereas Eghball and Maranville (1991) reported a 19% difference found in their one-year field trial.

Cereal Research Communications 466 The combination of a greater total N uptake by Florencia and its greater NUE gives evidence of a greater efficiency in use of fertilizer N for this hybrid relative to other tested hybrids. Growing conditions significantly affected hybrid performance (data not shown). However, this interaction was mainly due to hybrid Bc 462 that yielded similar to the highest yielding hybrid Florencia under the dry growing season of 2000. Consequently, those two hybrids had similar N uptake, whereas grain yield and N uptake with Florencia was significantly greater than with the Bc 462 in the growing seasons of 2001 and 2002. Differences in plant moisture stress between growing seasons most likely influenced hybrid N accumulation in our work. In 2000, only 20 mm of rainfall occurred between 1 June and the midsilk growth stage (20 July). In contrast, near optimum soil moisture was maintained by 140 mm of rainfall during the corresponding period in 2002. Mackay and Barber (1986) also attributed the differences in hybrid N accumulation to severe moisture stress during the growing season in which their field study was done. In our research, the absence of year × hybrid × N rate interaction for NUE indicated that hybrid specific responses to moisture stress were evident under both N fertilization rates. Findings of Eghball and Maranville (1991) also reported that maize genotypic selection for NUE does not appear to be influenced by water regime. Conclusions Three hybrids with similar N uptake had significant differences in NUE because of variations in grain yields and grain and stover N concentrations. Although responses for N uptake and NUE varied across years, hybrid specific responses for these components of nutrient utilization efficiency were consistent at both high and low fertilization rates across contrasting growing seasons. Thus, hybrid selection appears to be an important consideration for maize crop in sustainable farming systems regardless of N fertilizer inputs. References Eghball, B. – Maranville J.W.: 1991.

The results obtained suggest, that treatments applied – both the increasing rate of fertilizers and the increasing intensity of pesticide application – had significant effect on the grain yield of wheat. In case of fertilizer application each N rate resulted in a further significant yield increase in the average of pesticide applications. In accordance with the increment of the level of plant nutrition and plant protection applications a decreasing magnitude of yield increase was observed. Plant nutrition applications had a more definite effect on yield figures in comparison with that of plant protection treatments. The paper summarizes plant and soil interrelations regarding plant protection and nutrition impacts on wheat performance. Keywords: winter wheat, fertilization, pesticide, weed Introduction Life and development of crop plants is much influenced by soil conditions, properties and processes (Nagy et al 2006). The performance of crops plants depend on three basic thresholds: moisture, temperature and the presence of oxygen. Nutrient supply has a twofold role in agronomy; on one hand to replace nutrients to the soil as a basic habitat for crop plants, while ont he other hand to supply plants with an excess amount of nutrients aiming yield improvement (Kádár and Kismányoky 1999). Weeds are in permanent competition with crop plants. Weed control is essential to establish conditions for optimum crop performance (Kazinczi et al 2002). Plant nutrition may have adverse impacts on crop plant and weed manifestation (Nádasy and Nádasy 2006). Soils as the fundamental habitat for any plant growth provide optimal, suboptimal and hyperoptimal conditions for vegetation (Lawlor 2002). The aim of the present study was to observe and evaluate the imapcts and interactions of pesticide applivcations and various levels of plant nutrition on wheat crop. Materials and methods The study was conducted in a field experiment set up by the Department of Plant Production and Soil Science of the Georgikon Faculty of the University of Pannonia, Keszthely (Hungary). The bi-factorial trial was arranged in split plot design with three replications. The soil was Ramann-type brown forest soil (Eutric Cambisol) containing 41% sand, 32% silt, and 27% clay. The available phosphorus content of this sandy loam soil was low (AL- P2O5: 60-80 mgkg-1), the potassium content medium (AL-K2O: 140-160 mgkg-1) and the humus content fairly low (1,6-1,7%), with a pHKCl value of 7,3. In the experiment the effect of different rates and application methods of N fertilization as well as different variants of pesticide application was studied. The studied winter wheat cultivar was Mv Suba.</p><p id="Pg467">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 468 Table 1.

The average yield improvement was 1,21 t ha-1 and 0,42 t ha-1 respectively.</p><p id="Pg468">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 469 The highest yield, 4,56t ha-1 was obtained in the combination of the highest fertilization dose application and at the highest pesticide level (CH3 x N4). The highest yield was 4,38 times bigger than the lowest one (Figure 1.). The composition of weed species was also influenced by the experimental treatments. Less species were found in the herbicide treatment plots (CH1) than in the control ones. There were no statistically proved differences between the weed canopies at the first observation time (31st May). At the second monitoring (18th June) there were significant differences between CH0 and CH1 in weed canopy. The canopy of the weeds observed in the control plots was 3,59% and 6,42% covering. In the herbicide treated plots this figure was 0,92% in both times.Dominant weed species in the first observation period (31st May) on the control plots (Ch0) were as follows: Martricaria inodora L., Galium aparine L., Convolvulus arvensis L. In the pesticide treated plots (CH1) they were: Convolvulus arvensis L., Galium aparine L., Apera spica-venti.

ALEXANDRA PR) Sandra VOĆA – Stjepan PLIESTIĆ – Nadica DOBRIČEVIĆ – Dubravko FILIPOVIĆ Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, HR-10000 Zagreb, e-mail: svoca@agr.hr Abstract: Various physical and mechanical properties of sunflower (Helianthus annuus cv. Alexandra) seeds and kernels were determined as a function of moisture content. The average length, width, thickness, equivalent diameter, unit mass, and sphericity of seeds were 9.61, 4.82, 3.20, 5.32 mm, 0.0524 g, and 54.24%. In the moisture range from 5.29% to 20.08% w.b., studies on the rewetted seeds showed that the bulk density of seed decreased from 416.32 to 391.05 kg/m 3 and kernel increased from 533.67 to 701.69 kg/m 3 , respectively. The true density of seeds decreased from 648.21 to 582.66 kg m-3, while for kernel it increased from 868.30 to 1081.43 kg/m 3 . The porosity of seeds increased from 35.78 to 44.27%, while porosity of kernel increased from 38.53 to 46.11%. In the same moisture range, the static coefficient of friction for seeds on three different material surfaces varied from 0.421 to 0.572 on aluminium, from 0.501 to 0.811 on plywood and from 0.537 to 0.861 on rubber. Keywords: Sunflower, seed, moisture, physical properties, mechanical properties Introduction Today, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the most popular field crop in the world. It has been grown in Croatia at 25000 hectares, with huge fluctuations in area planted and grain yield (Mijic et al. 2007). In Croatia sunflower has very significant role in the production of vegetable oil, therefore sunflower was converted into one of most important field crop. Production of sunflower seed in Croatia has a long tradition in the Slavonia, eastern part of Croatia, where are good agroclimatic conditions for its production. Beside soil conditions the profitable cultivation of sunflower depends on temperature, the amount of rain and sunshine (Hunyadi Borbéli et al., 2007). The physical and mechanical properties of sunflower seeds and kernels, like those of other grains and seeds, are essential for the design of equipment for handling, harvesting, transportation, processing and storing the seeds, or determining the behaviour of the seeds for its handling (Baryeh, 2001). Physical properties of numerous grains and seeds have been determined by many researchers. Some of them determined physical properties of different seeds, such as wild sunflower seeds (Perez et al., 2007), lentil seeds (Amin et al., 2004), cucurbit seeds (Milani et al., 2007), sunflower seeds (Gupta &amp; Das, 1997). An increase in moisture content was observed to increase the coefficient of static friction against plywood, mild steel, galvanised steel and glass for sunflower seed and for neem nut (Gupta &amp; Das 1997). The objective of this study was to investigate some physical and mechanical properties of seeds and kernels of one of the most popular sunflower variety in Croatia, Alexandra. Materials and methods Alexandra variety sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds used in this study were collected in the 2006 season. The soil of the research site is pseudogley. The dimensions, size and sphericity of seeds and kernels were evaluated at moisture content 5.29% wet basis (w.b.). The moisture content of the samples was determined by using the AOAC official oven method (AOAC, 2002). The gravimetric properties of seeds and kernel were evaluated as functions of moisture content. To obtain higher moisture contents than initial, the samples were prepared by adding a predetermined quantity of</p><p id="Pg471">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 472 distilled water and sealing in separate hermetic glass vessels. The samples were kept at 5°C in refrigerator for one week to enable the moisture to distribute uniformly. To determine the average size of the seed and kernel, a sample of 100 sunflower seeds variety Alexandra was randomly picked and their three major dimensions namely length, width and thickness (as shown in Fig. 1) were measured using a digital micrometer with accuracy of 0.01 mm. L L s k W Wk s T T s k Figure 1. Major dimensions of sunflower seed and kernel To evaluate the mass, each seed and kernel were separately weighed on a precision electronic balance. The equivalent diameter and sphericity were calculated using the equations according to Mohsenin (1970). The bulk density of seeds and kernels (the ratio of weight and volume) was determined with a weight per hectolitre tester (Deshpande et al., 1993). The seeds were poured in the calibrated bucket up to the top from a height of about 15 cm and excess seeds and kernels were removed by a strike-off stick (Dutta et al., 1988). The true density defined as the ratio between the mass of seeds and kernels and its true volume was determined using the toluene displacement method. The porosity of seed and kernel was calculated from the bulk and true density using the equation according to Mohsenin (1970). The gravimetric properties defined above were evaluated at three different moisture contents (5.29, 12.28, 20.08 w.b.) through eleven replications. The static coefficients of friction of sunflower seeds and kernels on three different structural surfaces, namely, aluminium, plywood and rubber, were determined at different moisture contents. The seeds and kernels were placed on an adjustable tilting plate with a screw device and graduated scale. This was replicated by taking fifteen samples of seeds and kernels at three different moisture contents and the averages were calculated. The coefficient of friction was calculated using the equation according to Singh &amp; Goswami (1996). Results and discussion The average dimensions, size and sphericity of sunflower (cv. Alexandra) seeds and kernels are given in Table 1. The frequency distribution in the sample, at a moisture content of 5.29% (w.b.) of sunflower seeds are shown 73% of the seeds had a length in the range of 9.5-10.0 mm, 82% had a width in the range of 4.5-5.0 mm and 90% had a thickness in the range of 3.0-3.5 mm. In the sample, 73% of the kernels had a length in the range of 8.0-9.5 mm, 91% had a width in the range of 3.5-4.5 mm and 91% had a thickness in the range of 2.0-2.5 mm. The values of seeds and kernels dimensions of sunflower seeds Alexandra are found to be higher than Morden, wild sunflower seeds, and lower than oleic sunflower seed-NN. The values of seeds and kernels mass are found to be higher than Morden, and wild sunflower seeds, but lower than oleic sunflower seed-NN. The sphericity of sunflower seeds Alexandra is also found to be</p><p id="Pg472">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 473 higher than Morden, and wild sunflower seeds (Gupta &amp; Das, 1997; Santalla et al., 2003; Perez et al., 2007). Table 1. Dimensions and some properties of sunflower seeds and kernel at a moisture content of 5.29% w.b.

Alexandra) seed and kernel decreased from 416.32 to 391.05 kg/m3 and from 582.66 to 533.67 kg/m3, respectively, as moisture content increased from 5.29 to 20.08% w.b. This was due to the fact that an increase in mass owing to the moisture gain in seed and kernel was lower than accompanying volumetric expansion. The true density was found to decrease from 701.69 to 648.21 kg/m3 for seed and from 1081.43 to 868.30 kg/m3 for kernel. The negative linear relationship of bulk and true density with moisture content was also observed by Gupta &amp; Das (1997) for sunflower variety Morden, Santalla et al. (2003) for oleic sunflower seeds, Perez et al. (2007) for wild sunflower seeds, Amin et al. (2004) for lentil seeds. The decrease of bulk density, but the increase of true density with the increase of moisture content was observed by Amin (2004) for lentil seeds, respectively. Effect of moisture content on sunflower bulk density seed and kernel can be represented by the following equation: ρb,s=427.29-1.7037Mc (R 2=0.903); ρb,k=514.25+3.3075Mc; (R 2=0.981) and effect of moisture content on sunflower true density seed and kernel can be represented by the following equation: ρt,s=632.30+3.6242Mc; (R 2=0.956); ρt,k=779.19+14.378Mc; (R2=0.9559) where: sunflower seed (subscript s ) and kernel (subscript k); subscripts b and t, bulk and true density; R2, coefficient of determination. The estimated porosity of both sunflower seed and kernel was found to slightly increase with increase in moisture content from 5.29 to 20.08%. The porosity of seed increased from 35.78 to 44.78%, while porosity of kernel increased from 38.53 to 46.11%. Dutta et al., (1988), Gupta &amp; Das (1997), Amin et al., (2004), also found the porosity to increase linearly with moisture content for most agricultural seeds and kernels, respectively, while Baryeh, 2001 found the porosity of neem nut to decrease with increase in moisture content. Effect of moisture content on sunflower porosity (ε) can be represented by the following equation: εs=39.362+0.190Mc; (R 2=0.966); εk=37.034+0.220Mc; (R 2=0.961) where: seed (subscript s) and kernel (subscript k); Mc, moisture content (%); R 2, coefficient of determination. The static coefficient of friction of sunflower seeds and kernels was determined on three different surfaces. It is observed that the static coefficient of friction increased with an increase in moisture content on all surfaces for both seed and kernel. At all moisture contents, the static coefficient of friction for seed and kernel was greatest on rubber, followed by plywood and the least on aluminium. This may be owing to smoother and more polished surface of the aluminium sheet than other materials used. The static coefficient of friction has also been found to be higher on rubber than on plywood for sunflower seed, higher on plywood than on aluminium for bambara groundnut and higher on plywood than on metal (mild steel and galvanized iron) for neem nut (Baryeh, 2001). The relationship between the static coefficient of friction and moisture contents of the seed and kernel can be represented by the</p><p id="Pg473">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 474 following equation: μ=k1+k2Mc, where: k1 and k2 are regression coefficients with values given in Table 2 for three surfaces, namely, aluminium, plywood and rubber. Table 2.

This must be taken into consideration in any serious production attempt, especially if climatically extreme years come in a shorter period of time. The average length, width, thickness and equivalent diameter of sunflower seeds variety Alexandra at 5.29% moisture content (w.b.) were 9.61, 4.82, 3.20 and 5.35 mm, while the corresponding values of kernels were 8.81, 3.99, 2.47 and 4.1 mm, respectively. The average unit mass and sphericity of seeds were 0.0524 g, and 54.24%, while the corresponding values for kernels were 0.0397 g and 50.13%, respectively, at a moisture content of 5.29% w.b. The bulk densities of sunflower seeds decreased with increase in moisture content, but true densities of sunflower kernel increased with increase in moisture content, while porosity and projected area increased. The static coefficient of friction of sunflower (variety Alexandra) seed and kernel increased with moisture content. This coefficient was highest on rubber, followed by plywood and the least on aluminium. References Amin M.N. - Hossain M.A. - Roy K.C.: 2004.

Using litter-bag method the decomposition of different residues - leaf and root tissues of transgenic Bt (DK440BTY)and isogenic non-Bt corn plants (DK440), and different soil types - where previously Bt corn or isogenic corn had been grown, was compared. Significant differences were found in the decomposition in some cases - in Bt soil, between plants regarding the isogenic leaf residues, but not in the decomposition of the root residues. The potential reasons are discussed in the study. Keywords: corn decomposition, genetically modified plants, Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Introduction Toxin of Bt corn can be released into the soil in root exudates, by pollen, from damaged and degraded root cells and also from decaying plant material, as it was detected at 12 studied hybrids of Bt corn by Saxena et al. (1999). The free toxin can be easily utilized as a carbon and energy source by soil microorganisms for growth, but when released into soil it rapidly and strongly adsorbs and binds to surface-active particles. This fact renders it to be resistant to degradation by soilmicroorganisms (Koskella, Stotzky 1997) and as a result the toxin accumulates (Icoz and Stotzky, 2007). Meanwhile it retains its anti-lepidopteran activity for at least 180 days, the longest time studied (Crecchio, Stotzky 2001). The toxin released into the soil had no apparent effect on earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, bacteria and fungi (Saxena, Stotzky, 2001), and the purified free and clay-bound toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis subspp. kurstaki did not affect the growth of a variety of bacteria and algae in pure and mixed cultures (Koskella, Stotzky, 2002). Other authors also confirmed the finding that the use of Bt-corn apparently poses minimal risk to different earthworms species as far as growth and reproduction is concerned (Vercesi et al. 2006). But any effect of the genetic manipulation on soil animals and microbiota is probably more complex (Biró et al. 2005, Villányi et al. 2006). The transformation may have lead to pleiotropic effects that could have further ecological implications: different studies showed that the stems of the transgenic lines had higher concentrations of total lignin than the isogenic lines. Although Poerschmann et al. (2005) found that differences in the total lignin concentration of leaves were marginal, Villányi et al. (2003) measured significant differences of transgenic and isogenic corn plants considering C:N ratio of leaf tissue. Effects above was studied by combining two approaches: the decomposition of Bt and isogenic non-Bt biomass, and the decompostion processes was both assessed in the soil where previously the two maize lines had been grown. We addressed this under field conditions using a suitable litter-bag technique suggested by Bocock and Gilbert 1957.</p><p id="Pg475">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 476 Materials and methods Isogenic (DK440) and transgenic corn line (DK440BTY) was provided by the Monsanto Company. Corn seeds were planted at the experimental station of the Plant Protection Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The age of transgenic and isogenic plants was the same when harvested. After separation into leaves and roots pieces of air-dried biomass (weight: 1g) were put into litter-bags (mesh-size: 1mm) and buried vertically in the soil where previously the transgenic or the near-isogenic line had been grown, respectively, (depth: 10 cm) in October, 2001. Litter-bags were sampled till April, 2002 (6 sampling times, 5 replicates per sampling). After soil particle removal and washing samples were air-dried again and measured. Results were statistically analysed using non-parametric Friedman Anova. Results and discussion We did not find any significant differences regarding the decomposition of the root samples of both corn varieties (data not shown). The decomposition of root residues was very slow anyway, reaching approximately the 70% of the original weight at the last sampling. The following results apply to the decomposition of leaf samples: Comparison between corn lines: Significant plant effect (P&lt;=0.001) was found between the decomposition of the two lines in the soil where previously Bt-plant had been grown: Bt-corn decomposed more slowly (Figure 1.). The decomposition of the two lines did not show any significant differences in the soil, where isogenic (non-Bt) plant had been grown previously. Comparison between soils: Weak significant difference (P&lt;=0.05) was found in the decomposition process of the isogenic line of corn in Bt and in non-Bt soil: the decomposition was faster in the soil where previously the Bt-corn was grown (Figure 2.). We found no significant differences between the two types of soil regarding the decomposition of the transgenic corn samples. In a recent study, which was conducted under fairly similar circumstances to ours (Zwahlen et al. 2007), it was found that Bt corn decomposed faster than isogenic one. Our results suggest significantly lower decomposition rates considering Bt corn leaf tissue, which can be potentially the result of the toxin content. In a growth chamber experiment (Blackwood et al. 2004) expression of Cry endotoxin significantly reduced the presence of eukaryotic PLFA biomarker in bulk soil, although there was no decrease in fungal, arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungal, or protozoan markers. This implies that Cry protein may have significantly reduced populations of soil arthropods or other invertebrates. Or it can be the result of other physiological differences in plant tissue composition that as a consequence caused the plant material a less preferred food for some soil animals (Bakonyi et al. 2006). Different tissue composition can also have an effect making the leaf more resistant to microbial degradation. Flores et al. (2005) observed phenomena contradictory to that hypothesis, namely lower decomposition rates irrespective of C:N ratio. They also found that the addition of streptomycin, cycloheximide, or both to the soil suspension did not alter the relative degradation of Bt-</p><p id="Pg476">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 477 and non-Bt biomass, suggesting that differences in the soil microbiota were not responsible for the differential decomposition of the two plant types. On the other hand we found higher decomposition rates in the soil where previously Btcorn had been grown. This can be the result of the altered exudation pattern of Bt plants, observed by Blackwood et al. (2004). In high-clay soil bacterial CLPP profiles were affected. Bt corn root exudates seemed to stimulate increased ability of the rhizosphere community to metabolise certain amino acids and other amines. Biró et al. (2005), Villányi et al. (2003) also found higher total microbial activity in the rhizosphere of Bt corn at the end of the vegetation period. Figure 1.

Conclusions Genetic modification of corn and previous soil-use with Bt- or non-Bt corn might have an impact on the decomposition of plant residues. Our results support also the opinion that mechanisms and potential reasons of Bt corn decomposition are purely understood (Hegyi et al. 2006). 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 days w eight % isogenic plant Bt plant 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 days w eight % in isogenic soil in Bt soil</p><p id="Pg477">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 479 STUDYING THE SOIL - WATER - PLANT RELATIONSHIPS ON WINTER WHEAT GROWN IN UNDISTURBED SOIL COLUMNS András LUKÁCS 1 – Géza PÁRTAY 1 – Csilla FARKAS 1 1 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Hung. Acad. Sci. Herman Ottó st. 15, 1022 Budapest, Hungary, e-mail: lukacs@rissac.hu Abstract: Stress tolerance of four winter wheat genotypes in undisturbed soil columns were studied in two subsequent experiments. TDR soil moisture probes were used to monitor changes in soil water content. In order to study the drought stress reaction of the wheat plants, microsensors were implanted into the stems of the plants and connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer for gas analysis. The stress status was indicated in the plants grown on partly non-irrigated soil columns by the lower CO2 concentrations. Keywords: winter wheat, drought stress, undisturbed soil column, soil moisture, CO2 concentration Introduction Winter wheat has a very important role in the crop production of Hungary. Drought stress tolerance of wheat varieties was studied by several authors to detect different drought tolerance strategies (Balla et al., 2006, Czövek et al., 2006, Hagyó et al., 2007). In the present experiment drought stress (water stress) of winter wheat grown on large undisturbed soil monoliths was studied. This experimental technique may be suitable for simulation of field conditions covering the whole lifetime of the selected crop. Moisture regime of the soil (Farkas et al. 2005) was determined by the TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) method. Gas metabolism of plants’ reproductive stage (accumulation/consumption of respiratory gases inside plant tissues) was followed by a quadrupole mass spectrometric (QMS) method in situ and in vivo (Lukács et al. 2005).

The soil type was defined as meadow chernozem (Table 1.). Ten undisturbed, 0.42 m diameter, 0.80 m long soil monoliths were prepared following methods proposed by Németh et al. (1991). The monoliths were excavated at the selected field site and their cylindrical surfaces were coated with fibreglass cloth impregnated with a synthetic resin. The advantage of this technique is that it ensures a very close contact between the outer layers of the soil column and the material of the coating. Part of the coating imbibes the</p><p id="Pg479">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 480 outer macrospores, creating a continuum between the soil and the coating, thus the wall effects are reduced. The monoliths were transported to the greenhouse of our institute. Here further preparations were made: a tap was inserted into the lowest part of each column and then the bottoms of the monoliths were coated with fibreglass-resin. Two series of experiments, each with four monoliths and one in reserve were prepared: (A) for the year 2005/2006 and (B) for the year 2006/2007 vegetation period. In (A) the monoliths were saturated to field capacity by slowly filling them up with deionized water through the built-in bottom tap and then let them drain. Saturation was done with rising water level. In October 2005 30 seeds of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were sown into each soil column. Two genotypes, “Gk Élet” and “Mv Emese” were used and grown as test plants till maturity. In (B) only two monoliths were saturated (with the methods described before). In October 2006 15+15 seeds of four genotypes of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were sown into each soil column (halving the columns), in the following order: “Plainsman”/ “Mv Emese”, “Capelle Desprez”/ “Gk Élet”. As winter wheat must go through a prolonged period of cold (vernalization) before flowering occurs and to ensure environmentally optimum conditions, the monoliths were kept outside until next spring (May 2006 and May 2007). No irrigation was made during this period. In the meantime the number of plants/column had been reduced to 5 in (A) and 5+5 in (B). At the time of heading, when the stems of the plants had reached sufficient thickness to ensure the implantation of the sensors for gas analysis, the monoliths were transported to the laboratory. Sufficient light (21000 lux) was ensured in 12 hours day/night cycles. Temperature of the air at various heights and in the soil at various depths (0, 0.10 and 0.35 m) was recorded daily. Soil moisture content was measured by TDR multiplexer system. TDR probes were placed at 0.10, 0.30 and 0.50 m depth horizontally and at 0-0.20 m depth vertically into every soil column. Irrigation was applied at the soil surface once a day on the basis of TDR data except for columns subjected to drought stress. Gas concentrations of the soil and plants and laboratory air were continuously measured by the 20 channel QMS apparatus with the help of microsensors. The microsensor is made of a stainless steel tube of 0.20 m length and 1.65x10-3 m diameter. One end of this tube is closed by soldering and perforated on two sides for 0.02 m length. A 0.02 m long tube of silicone rubber, which serves as a membrane, covers these perforations. The implantation of the microsensor into the stem of the wheat plant was preceded by the preparation of a channel in the plant tissue with the help of a punctuation needle of appropriate diameter. 4 sensors/column were used (3 for plants + 1 for soil). Laboratory air served as standard, argon as control Relative amounts of water vapor, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon-dioxide and argon (as control gas) were determined. Both the soil moisture and gas concentration measurements were made with a 4 hour interval between measurements.</p><p id="Pg480">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 481 Results and discussions (A) The period during which the soil moisture content changes were measured with TDR was altogether 50 days: from the start of heading to the dying stage. The first 40 days of this period with “Mv Emese” genotype is shown on Fig. 1. Although the irrigation was stopped after the first week (11,6L irrigation water deficit per column, non-irrigated figure) and the average temperature was 32oC in the air 1 m above the soil surface and 29oC in the soil 0.10 m below the surface, the moisture level of the 0.10 to 0.50 m layers has only slightly decreased, thus the plants’ water supply was almost the same as in the non-stressed (irrigated) column. The 0-0.20 m surface layer showed the highest drop of moisture content after the end of irrigation. Fig.2. shows –with the help of two selected sensors - the typical CO2 curve of the last two weeks of the plants’ life. When the CO2 concentration dropped to the level of that measured in air, the plant died. The slight stress status was indicated in the plants grown on partly non-irrigated soil columns by the lower CO2 level at both genotypes. The concentration levels of the other gases measured in the plants were constant throughout the experiment with daily fluctuations of O2. The order of gas concentrations was the following: water-vapor&gt;N2&gt;&gt;O2&gt;CO2. 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0 10 20 30 40 Days S o il w a te r c o n te n t (m 3 m -3 ) 0.10 m 0.30 m 0.50 m 0 - 0.20 m Mv Emese - NS 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0 10 20 30 40 Days S o il w a te r c o n te n t (m 3 m -3 ) 0.10 m 0.30 m 0.50 m 0 - 0.20 m Mv Emese - S Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 482 (B) In the second series of experiments the TDR data showed, that due to the very dry and hot spring weather in the year of 2007 and contrary to the later laboratory irrigation, the soil moisture content of the monoliths – even of the ones filled up to field capacity – dropped by 10-12 % (v/v) compared to the previous (A) series. The difference between the irrigated and stressed columns was only 2%. CO2 concentrations curves of „Gk Élet” and „Mv Emese” were similar to that of the (A) series but on a lower level: the initially altering CO2 concentrations of the plants decreased continually (the irrigated ones slower, the stressed faster) until they reached the CO2 concentration of air, after which point there was no difference between them. The genotype „Plainsman” showed high stress reaction even in the irrigated soil. „Capelle Desprez” showed very high daynight CO2 dynamics with mild, but detectable stress effect. The CO2 concentration decrease at this genotype was small in the beginning but very fast at the end. The stress status of the plants could also be followed by measuring the water vapor concentration in the stem of the plants. Although the concentration decrease of water vapor was smaller than that of CO2, but the irrigated/stressed status could be identified and valued. Conclusions (A) Due to the high water conductivity and water retention of the meadow chernozem soil in addition to the high water requirement of the roots of the two studied wheat genotypes “Gk Élet” and “Mv Emese”, the plants were able to compensate the water stress caused by the lack of irrigation. Similarly and consequently there were no differences in the yield data. However, slight stress was indicated by the CO2 concentration changes in the plants of the non-irrigated columns compared to the irrigated ones. There was no concentration difference between the genotypes. (B) The lack of snow-cover, low precipitation and unusually high average temperature of the 2006/2007 winter and spring caused the partial desiccation of the monoliths. The columns originally filled up to field capacity have lost their surplus quantity of water against the columns not filled up. Therefore the irrigation water deficit applied at the time of heading caused only minor yield losses. Slight stress was indicated by the CO2 and water vapor concentration changes in the plants of the non-irrigated columns.

Gaja 6, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: This paper refers to the influence of K fertilization on K, Ca and Mg relations in strawberry cv. Elsanta grown in peat mix, in a plastic greenhouse with vertical pot system. Four fertilization variants (control - 0.72 g K plant -1 as KNO3 and three variants with 2.22 g K plant -1 as the combinations of KNO3 and K2SO4, KCl or KHCO3) were applied using trickle irrigation in fruit bearing stage in autumn. The amount of K leached through the verticals containing eight pots and four plants per pot was influenced mostly by K rate. The highest yield was obtained on control variant with lower K dose applied as nitrate. The enhanced K rate influenced on leaf K concentration, showing significant differences among the applied combinations of K salts and the antagonism with Mg uptake was observed. The possible role of accompanying anions in the nutrient relations in soilless grown strawberries needs to be further elucidated. Keywords: fertilization, calcium, magnesium, nutrient leaching, soilless culture, strawberry Introduction The effect of major and minor elements on the fruit quality as well as their accumulations in the organs of strawberries grown in the field and soilless culture was reviewed by Nestby et al. (2004). A strawberry plant with unsatisfactory nutrient supply can not produce the genetically determined fruit quality (M. Deák et al., 2007). However, leaf dry matter analysis taken during beginning of flowering, could be used as an indicator thus making it possible to make corrections within the season, if needed (Daugaard, 2007). K is one of three major crop nutrients, with an essential role in physiological processes such as water uptake, osmotic regulation, photosynthesis enzyme action, and has been considered to have a significant role in decreasing effects of climatic stress (Fodorné Fehér et al., 2007). As stated by Tagliavini et al. (2004), K uptake has special features as more than 60% of total requirements are met in short period of five weeks after flowering. It is well known that high supply with K can influence Ca and Mg uptake in plants, but the possible influence of accompanying anions on K, Ca and Mg interrelations were rarely investigated. Recently, Rácz (2007) stated that the mean utilisation of main nutrient elements varied between 30 and 80% in the open systems of experimental soilless cultures. However, after Madjar and Davidescu (2004), the K retention and leaching process on organic substrate with high organic matter content are not fully understood yet. Therefore, the aim of the presented study was to evaluate the K level influence on strawberry nutrient supply, considering possible impact of accompanying anions and the intensity of K loss by leaching in soilless culture. Materials and methods The cold stored frigo plantlets (A4+) of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv. Elsanta) were planted on August 1, 2007, in perlite pot (4.5 l) filled with peat mix</p><p id="Pg483">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 484 (Stender B 400) and mount on vertical support structures (Figure 1), in plastic greenhouse located in Dalj (40 km east from Osijek, Croatia). The number of pots per vertical was 8 with 4 plants in every pot. Each vertical was supplied by one trickle irrigation line, placed in the uppermost pot. In the vegetative stage all plants received in total 0.41 g K plant-1, using complex fertilizer with microelements, with N : P2O5 : K2O ratio 12 : 30 : 12 and 20 : 20 : 20, as well as fertilizer Universol Purple containing MgO and microelements. On September 10, at the beginning of fruit set, the experiment with 4 potassium fertilization treatment was settled with 4 verticals (repetitions) per treatment. Control plants (variant F1) received further 0.72 g K plant-1 as KNO3. The variants F2 - F4 received triple dose (in total 2.22 g K plant-1 in period September 10 – October 12), applied in 4 fertirigation treatments, in the same terms as control variant. F1 was the combination of KNO3 and K2SO4, F2 was composed of KNO3 and KCl, while F4 contained KNO3 and KHCO3. The ratio of KNO3 and other K salts administered in nutrient solution was 1:2 in treatments F2 - F4. Plants received the same Ca and Mg amount regardless of K treatment, whereas 1.5 g Ca plant-1 was applied additionally in fruit bearing period. The percolated nutrient solution was collected using PVC containers placed under the verticals before the applications of fertilization (Figure 1). The volume of the leached solution was measured and the concentration of K in the solution was analyzed by AAS 24 h after the beginning of treatment. The most developed strawberry leaves were sampled (30 leaves per vertical – repetition) before the first fertilization treatment on September 10, as well as two days after the last fertilization treatment, on October 12. The concentration of K, Ca and Mg in leaf dry matter was determined by AAS, after leaf dry matter decomposition using acid mixture (sulphuric and perchloric acid) and H2O2. During the experiment, fruits were harvested every third day from each vertical (repetition) and the total yield was calculated and expressed as g plant-1. Statistical data analysis was performed using single-factor ANOVA, with F test for treatment influence evaluation and LSD test for treatments means comparison, as well as t test in correlative regression analyses. Results and discussion According to the measured K concentration in percolated nutrient solution, it can be concluded that higher K supply in nutrient solution resulted with significantly higher leaching loss (P≤0.01), as compared to control treatment with 2.4 times lower K dose (Table 1; Figure 2).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 485 However, although the same K amount was given in F2 – F4, the percentage of lost K per vertical was not equal (Figure 2). Among these treatments, the lowest leaching of K was observed in F3 (the combination K-of nitrate and -chloride). Rácz (2007) stated that as the ratio of nutrients depleted as well as left in the overflow cannot be determined directly in the experimental production so that the volume of the overflow could not be plotted against the nutrients taken up by plants. Accordingly, the data presented show only the loss of the applied K that occured in 24 h after the applied fertirrigation. In the research of Madjar and Davidescu (2004), the quantity of K that passed through the organic substrate column without being retained or K in percolate was 34-46% from the applied quantity of K. The content of nutrients in the drainage water depends on the substrate, the addition of preplant fertilizer, the growth stage of the plants, the percentage of drainage and the climatical conditions (Lieten et al., 2004).

Cereal Research Communications 486 As stated by Tagliavini et al. (2004), nutrients entering the fruit during its maturation derive only partially from direct root uptake, while significant amounts come from leaves, in the latter, N and K contents may markedly decrease during fruit maturation if not compensated by root uptake. Here, the enhanced K supply led to significantly higher K concentration in strawberry leaves, especially in F3 and F4 (P≤0.01). Although the K dose was much higher in F2 – F4 as compared to F1, leaf K concentration was different regarding accompanying anion (Figure 3). In generall, K dose was not significant for Ca concentration in leaf dry matter, but in the case of Mg, there was very significant decrease under influence of K excessive supplly (Table 1; P≤0.01). As reported by Lieten (2006), during the autumn culture of Elsanta on peat substrate, the different K:Ca:Mg ratios in the nutrient solution did not affect vegetative growth or yield. Regarding the leaf K and Mg concentration in the research presented here, there was an antagonistic relation between these elements (Figure 4; P≤0.01), but the possible role of accompanying anions in the uptake of K and Mg as well as other nutrients, remains to be further investigated. Conclusions This research shows that rapid loss of the applied K in peat grown strawberry in vertical pot system depends mostly on K rate. The higher fertilization level enhanced leaf K concentration, depending on accompanying anions, yet without beneficial effect on fruit yield. Based on leaf mineral composition, the antagonism in the uptake of K and Mg was observed, while K did not affect Ca uptake. The role of accompanying anions in the nutrient relations in soilless grown strawberries needs to be further elucidated.

Strossmayer, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: astanisa@gmail.com Abstract: In two-year experiment in apple orchard on calcareous soil in eastern Croatia, N fertilization and crop load influence on fruit macroelement content and fruit quality was investigated. The effect of year was significant in all tested parameters except Ca and Mg content in fruits, with higher values observed in dryer 2003 year. The applied N fertilization and crop load did not influence any of tested parameters except fruit weight. The interaction of year and crop load had an impact on fruit Ca content and fruit weight, which was negatively related to all macroelement concentrations as well as fruit dry matter content, total acid and total sugar content in given experimental conditions. Keywords: apple, calcareous soil, crop load, fruit mineral composition, fruit quality, nitrogen fertilization Introduction As stated by Nagy et al. (2006), modern and competitive fruit growing is unimaginable without appropriate location, technology and nutrition that need to be harmonized. Fruit nutrient contents and their interactions, important for fruit quality, can be greatly influenced by abiotic environmental factors, such as soil nutrient supply and climate conditions. According to Nava et al. (2007), vegetative vigour and yield potential of the apple trees primarily depend on the initial soil fertilization, based mainly on N application. In comparison with other nutrients, N has the largest uptake and can as well significantly influence the uptake and content, mainly cations (e.g. K, Mg and Ca) in plants (Tůma et al., 2007). Therefore, optimal N fertilization in particular fruit growing area needs to be established considering source-sink relations in fruit plants, determined by crop load. On acid soil, Vágó et al. (2007) obtained the best yields of apples under harmonic nutrient supply, regarding Ca, Mg and B. Low uptake of K on calcareous soil was reported in sweet cherries (Nagy et al., 2007). Mg can strongly compete with Ca and K uptake and transport processes, leading to the development of apple storage disorders (Zavalloni and Marangoni, 2001). The aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of broadcast N fertilization and apple crop load on the fruit macroelements composition as well as fruit quality, based on two-years experiment settled in the orchard planted on calcareous soil. Materials and methods The field trial was conducted in apple orchard (cv. Idared, grafted on M9 rootstock) on southern side of Baranja mountain in eastern Croatia. The tree density of apples planted in 1989 was 1984 trees ha-1 in form of spindle bush. Design of the experiment was splitplot with 4 nitrogen doses (0-control, 30, 60, 90 kg N ha-1) and 3 crop load pattern (not regulated-control, 50, 100 fruit tree-1 defined by hand after June drop). All experimental combinations were settled in 4 replications with 5 trees each. Broadcast N fertilization was applied during 3 years (2001-2003), about 1 month after bloom (May) in the form of Ca(NO3)2.</p><p id="Pg487">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 488 The applied fertilization supposed to provide faster and more secure N uptake, including N storage from previous year for subsequent bud formation, and to improve quality of remainig fruit later in season as well.

After peeling, slices of fruit without seed were homogenized and used for total acids (Mitcham et al., 1996) and total sugars determination. The same fruit samples were used for dry matter and mineral content analysis. After wet ashing using a mixture of sulphuric and perchloric acid, with H2O2 additions, N was analyzed with micro-Kjeldahl procedure, P spectrophotometrycally, while K, Ca and Mg content was determined by AAS. The results were analyzed using ANOVA and F-test for the evaluation of treatments effect, as well as linear correlation analyses and t-test in the assessment of the significance of tested parameters relations. Results and discussion The highest influence on the investigated parameters had year what means that P, K, Ca content and fruit FW differed very significantly between years (P≤0.01), however, year influence was less significant for fruit N content (P≤0.05; Table 2). All four macroelements had higher content in fruits in 2003. On the contrary, fruit FW was lower in that year. TA and TS were also influenced by the year (P≤0.05), showing higher values in 2003. N rate influenced only fruit FW, with heavier fruits obtained with higher N rates (P≤0.01). We supposed that increasing N content in fruit (FW) in that year (2003) is a consequence of N accumulation from fertilization in a previous year (2002), which in the research of Nava et al. (2007) had affected the fruit buds nutrition, considering the significant increase of the fruit number and yield. In both years, the highest dose of 90 kg ha-1 of N increased the number of fruits before June drop (data not shown). Hence, remaining fruits (after adjustment of crop load) were significantly bigger than observed at other N levels applied even in the year 2003, inspite of severe drought (Table 1). As a diference from young fruit trees that have shallow root system, the old trees have their active root zone in much deeper soil level (Németh, 2006). Here, the sub-surface soil layer was poor in K2O (Table 1), and considering that no K was added in the applied fertilization treatments, this might explain relatively low K content in fruits (909.4 - 1171.4 mg kg-1 FW).</p><p id="Pg488">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 489 In comparison with the results of Čmelik et al. (2005) in young apple orchard on acid soil, K content was lower and Ca was higher in our research, what seems logical because of differences in soil nutrient content and pH. Table 2.

Hungary Abstract: Cotinus coggygria - smokebush is a species widely used for its autumn leaf coloration aesthetics in temperate climate ornamental horticulture. We carried out measurements to assess if there is any difference in the autumn coloration among female and male plants of the species. The preliminary measurements served to determine any correlation between the color parameters of the CIELab system (L*, a*, b*) and spectrophotometric reflectance (400-700nm). When comparing the green-red (a*) and lightness (L*) parameters, with spectrophotometric measurements, we were not able to determine a close correlation on any wavelength. But b* parameter representing yellow color showed a close correlation with reflectance measured at 520nm. In the comparison of male and female plants, there were no significant differences between L* and a* value during the autumn coloration of leaves. Only the b* parameter characterised by yellow pigment, showed significant difference, the most intensive yellow hue developing in leaves of female plants. After this stage b* parameter considerably decreased in both sexes, without any statistical difference. Meaning that the leaves of plants changed from green to red and turned darker regardless of sexual expression, but during the process of senescence the female plants posessed a significantly more yellow hue compared to male plants. This might be a signalling against herbivores observed in other plant species. Keywords: Cotinus coggygria, autumn coloration, handicap signal, sexual expression Introduction Smokebush (Cotinus coggygria) is an important species used in temperate climate ornamental horticulture for its autumn leaf coloration aesthetics (Dirr, 1998). Anthocyanin and beta-carotene responsible for leaf coloration are also important in other aspects of horticulture (Brandt et al., 2006; Dani, 2007; Helyes et al., 2006; Pintér et al., 2007; Skalicky et al., 2007). Upon visual sex determination of the available, different leaf color smokebush cultivars, we found that purple leaved cultivars were all female, where as the single yellow autumn leaf coloring cultivar was male. Therefore we investigated whether there is any sexual difference in the autumn coloration of the species. The process of fall leaf coloration has been studied in other species (Field et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2003; Schaberg et al., 2003) but not in the species Cotinus coggygria. The effect of temperature and UV-light on leaf pigmentation was only studied in the purple leaved cultivar ‘Royal Purple’ (Oren-Shamir and Levi-Nissim, 1997). Materials and methods Plants were selected from nine years old Cotinus coggygria growing under nursery conditions in Baracska, Hungary, from a plot of 2700 individuals at a spacing of 3m x 3m. During autumn of 2006 leaves representing all stages of color change were visually and randomly chosen from non shaded shoots and removed for preliminary color and spectrophotometric analysis. The spectrophotometric measurements were carried out using a Minolta spectrophotometer. Minolta chroma meter CM-512m3 is a multi-angle</p><p id="Pg491">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 492 spectrophotometer, which uses geometry with D65/10°. Sex determination of plants based on floral anatomy was carried out in June 2007 and ten plants of each sex were randomly chosen. One non shaded, vegetative shoot with normal size, non deformed leaves, on the south side of bushes was tagged. Color measurements were performed on the abaxial surface of the top four non shaded leaves, in the middle of the right lamina, excluding the midvein, using the CIELab color measurement system with Sheen Micromatch Plus (Sheen Instruments Ltd, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK). The L*, a* and b* values were obtained directly. Mesurements were taken at weekly intervals between September 18. and October 26. 2007. until minimum temperatures remained above freezing. Results and discussion Color measurement of leaves was first carried out for the methodological study of Cotinus autumn leaf coloration. The preliminary measurements served to determine any correlation between the spectrophotometric reflectance (400-700nm) and the color parameters of the CIELab system (L*, a*, b*), since the measurement of spectral reflectance is a non destructive and fast method of pigment estimation (Gitelson et al., 2001; Sims and Gamon, 2002).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 493 When comparing the lightness (L*) and green-red (a*) parameters, with spectrophotometric measurements, we were not able to determine a close correlation on any wavelength. But b* parameter representing yellow color showed a close correlation with reflectance measured at 520nm (Fig. 1) in all stages of leaf senescence. From these results we concluded that the much handier CIELab system is also capable of monitoring the process of autumn leaf senescence in smokebush. Therefore we continued to investigate any possible connection between autumn leaf coloration and sexual expression. CIELab L* value gradually decreased with the senescence of leaves (they gradually turned darker), while a* value increased exponentially, changing gradually from green to red (data not shown). In the comparison of male and female plants, there were no significant differences between L* and a* value during the autumn coloration of leaves. Only the b* parameter characterised by yellow pigment (Fig. 2), showed differences from September 18. to October 09. In the course of autumn leaf coloration, the most intensive yellow hue developed by October 9. characterised by value 20 of female plants, which also showed the highest significant difference compared to value 15 of male plants. After this time b* parameter considereably decreased below value 15 in both sexes, without any statistical difference. Figure 2.

Cereal Research Communications 494 Conclusions We were able to show significant difference in the CIELab color parameter b*, but not in parameters a* and L* during the course of autumn leaf coloration in female and male plants of Cotinus coggygria. This means that the leaves of plants turned darker and changed from green to red regardless of sexual expression. But during the process of senescence the female plants posessed a significantly more yellow hue compared to male plants which might be a handicap signalling against herbivores observed in other plant species (Hagen, 2003; Manetas, 2006; Schafer and Wilkinson, 2004).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 495 EVALUATION OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE MAIZE KERNEL IN 2007 Péter SIPOS – Diána UNGAI Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology, Faculty of Agronomy, University of Debrecen, 138 Böszörményi Street, Debrecen, H-4032 Hungary, siposp@agr.unideb.hu; ungai@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Chemical composition of maize kernels was examined from 5 cropping sites. We found that the performance of recurrent hybrids grown on different locations is equalized by optimal input utilization, so they are suitable for offer a homogenous stock by their protein, starch, fat and fibre content. Whereas, significant deviation around the mean is experienced by the examination of the results of 30 hybrids, which means that hybrids, suitable for other utilization ways by the yield and protein content centered forage, are present. It is important to explore the effects of environment and agrotechnic factors on the genetic base to reach the best result in agronomy practice. Keywords: maize, chemical composition, environment effect Introduction Maize is general foodstuff in several countries, but its primer utilization is in forage in Hungary, traditionally. Its large rate in cropping area resultes overproduction by the decreasing national animal population, which leaded to the decrease of prices. The intervention solved it only partly and provisionally. Besides, the industrial ethanol production, which could be the largest costumer of maize yield, requires different chemical composition as forage industries (Voca et al., 2007). Previously the increase of yield and protein content (which correlates negatively to yield) was the primer aim of maize breeding, but the colourful utilization possibilities increases the importance of other quality parameters. The knowledge of connections between genetic, environmental and agronomy factors could basically modify the method and result of production (Huzsvay és Nagy, 2005; Hegyi et al., 2007; Nagy, 2007). The positive effect of increasing nitrogen supply and the negative effect of increasing water supply on protein content have known for a long time (Lilburn et al., 1991). The most important chemical reaction on the increasing protein content is the decreasing starch content, however, in several cases the resistable or insoluble starch contents are more important than total starch content (Patzek, 2006). The environment has stronger effect on the protein content than fat content (Gyenesné-Hegyi et al., 2001), and it is proved that the fat content of maize correlates the average temperature of cropping field (Veneni, 1971). Our aim was to evaluate the genetic properties of maize hybrids of common cultivation by the chemical analysis of their grain yield from 2007. Materials and methods Maize samples are partly from a field plot experiment on University of Debrecen, Faculty of Agronomy, Látókép Experimental Station, partly from a hybrid comparison experiment at 4 locations (Kaba, Derecske, Szentlőrinc és Orosháza) from 2007. Most hybrids were breeded in Hungary but others are from abroad, but expansively represent the Hungarian seed supply. Agronomic treatments were the same on all sites, based on the requirements of hybrids. Chemical analyses were made in University of Debrecen, Faculty of Agronomy, Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology. Protein content was</p><p id="Pg495">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 496 determined by MSZ 6830-5:1987, starch content by MSZ 6367-13:1982, fiber content by MSZ EN ISO 6865:2001, fat content by MSZ 6830-19:1979 Hungarian Standards. Results and discussion It is a well known fact that the increasing nitrogen fertilization increases the protein content of grain and there is a negative connection between yield and protein content. In previous works it have been proved that irrigation decreases the nitrogen content and the weather conditions with significant amount of precipitation has similar effect (Győri et al., 1996; Győri and Győriné, 2002; Győri et al., 2005), but besides, the field conditions basically influences the grain quality. The examined hybrids from different cropping fields showed significantly different protein content in several cases (Figure 1). The DKC 5143 showed the highest field effect (the ratio of range and mean was 52%), and the PR37D25 (9,7%) and Furio (14,3%) hybrids were the stablest. The hybrids presented in Figure 1. have the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 10th highest cropping field in Hungary in 2006, so they were remarkably popular for farmers. By the chemical analysis of them we found that they chemical composition is similar at the examined locations; their protein content is between 9-10% and their starch content is between 7173%. The similarlity is also visible when we examines their grain hardness; the average of 5 popular hybrids is between 4250 and 4980 while the extreme values are from 3250 to 6260. It suggests that the chemical composition of new varieties uniformizing as an effect of closely defined requirements, and their performances in production are balanced in the case of the application of hybrid specific agronomy conditions and inputs. Despite this, the whole database shows wider diversity both in protein content and starch content (Figure 2). The examination of distributions is misleading; they show higher frequencies at the higher ranges, while this known (Bálint, 1977) negative connection between this two parameters is proved again in 2007. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 S z e n tl ő ri n c K a b a O ro s h á z a D e re c s k e S z e n tl ő ri n c K a b a O ro s h á z a D e re c s k e L á tó k é p K a b a O ro s h á z a D e re c s k e L á tó k é p S z e n tl ő ri n c K a b a O ro s h á z a D e re c s k e K a b a O ro s h á z a D e re c s k e L á tó k é p S z e n tl ő ri n c DK 440 DKC 3511 PR37D25 Furio DKC 5143 P ro te in c o n te n t in d ry m a tt e r, % Figure 1.: Protein content of grains of maize hybrids on different cropping locations (2007)</p><p id="Pg496">VII.

Range of fat content is much wider; it lasts from 2,87 to 6,19. This neglected parameter could be important in the near future: the separated germ, which grain part valued in several cases as waste, and the fat, which could be get from it, could be important measure of value of the hybrid valuation, keeping the germ oil utilization in sight. It could be especially important in the starting maize based bioethanol production, where the recoverable germ oil could be an important source of income. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 be lo w 7 7 - 8 8 - 9 9 - 10 1 0 - 1 1 1 1 - 1 2 a bo ve 1 2 F re q u e n c y , p c s Protein content, % 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 be lo w 6 6 6 6 - 6 7 6 7 - 6 8 6 8 - 6 9 6 9 - 7 0 7 0 - 7 1 7 1 - 7 2 7 2 - 7 3 7 3 - 7 4 ab ov e 74 F re q u e n c y , p c s Starch content, % 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 be lo w 3 ,5 4 - 4, 5 4, 5 - 5 5 - 5 ,5 5, 5 - 6 6 - 6 ,5 ab ov e 6, 5 F re q u e n c y , p c s Fat content, % 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 be lo w 1 ,8 1, 8 - 2 ,1 2, 1 - 2 ,4 2, 4 - 2 ,7 2, 7 - 3 3 - 3 ,3 F re q u e n c y , p c s Fibre content, % Figure 2.: Distribution of protein, starch, fat and fibre content of examined 169 maize samples, 2007 (in dry matter) Conclusions It is timely to revise the protein content increasing breeding strategy of latest decades, because the carbonhydrate content of maize grains is appraised in connection with bioethanol production. Another question is if it is important to renew the breeding strategy, or the hybrids with low protein content are ideal raw materials for the fermentation industry because of the negative correlation between protein and starch content. Do the high fermentable corn hybrids mean surplus for crop production and industry, and how much surplus product and income can it result in our national circumstances? Further examinations, especially the cognition of HFC hybrids, are important to the safe answering of previous questions.</p><p id="Pg497">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 499 MODELLING OF ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION IN HUNGARY László BOZÓ1 - Zsuzsanna FLACHNER2 1 Hungarian Meteorological Service (OMSZ), H-1024 Budapest, Kitaibel Pál u. 1., bozo.l@met.hu 2 Research Institute for Soil Sciences and Agrochemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (RISSAC) – H- 1022 Budapest, Hernam Otto u. 15. flachner@rissac.hu Abstract: Atmospheric depositions are important external factors of soil-plant systems, especially trace metals and nitrogen need to be cosidered. Annual average atmospheric concentrations and depositions of sulfur and nitrogen species, as well as trace metals in Hungary and its surrounding regions were estimated by model computations. Spatial and temporal variations of the distributions are presented in the paper. In the case of atmospheric lead, the cumulative atmospheric depositions were estimated for a sixty years long period until 2015 using historical emission factors for the past decades as well as emission scenarios for the future. It was found that Hungary belongs to the moderately polluted regions in Europe. Keywords: atmospheric deposition, sulphur, nitrogen, trace metals, plant effects, monitoring, modelling, Hungary Introduction Atmospheric deposition contributes to the definition of the external factors of local, regional assessment of soil-plant systems (NÉMETH,et al,1998, NÉMETH, 2006). The national monitoring and modelling work performed by OMSZ and partner institutes and linked to international assessment systems such as UNECE (Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution) EMEP and Critical load mapping activites (in HU the RISSAC is tne national focal point) are essential for regional and local soil-plant research, however, its importance and its application is not always recognized (FLACHNER, BOZÓ, 2004). The Environmental assessment methodology program (KÉP) contributed to the development of a more complex and integrated assessment framework in which the atmospheric deposition research have been incorporated into soil – plant - landscape assessment methodologies (VÁRALLYAY et al., 2007). Materials and Methods Due to the geographical size and location of the country, local air quality is highly influenced by both Hungarian and transboundary sources. In Hungary, the SO2 emission decreased significantly during the past decade in all important source categories: energy, industry, transportation, agriculture, home heating and other services. The release of 1,020 ktonnes estimated for 1990 was reduced to 480 ktonnes in 2000. In the case of nitrogen-oxides, the annual emission of 240 ktonnes in 1990 was reduced to 180 ktonnes within 10 years. It should be noted, however, that the relative contribution of transportation to the total emission increased during the same period. The emission rates of heavy metals have also decreased between 1990-2000. The most significant decrease was detected in the case of atmopsheric lead (from 695,000 kg to 37,000 kg). The corresponding annual emission rates in 1990 and 2000 are 5,600 kg and 2,700 kg for Cd, 43,000 kg and 37,000 kg for Ni, 6,800 kg and 4,200 kg for Hg, 150,000 kg and 110,000 kg for V. Due to the significant reduction of SO2 emision during the past decade, the annual average concentrations have also decreased. For the long-range transport computations a continental scale, climatological-type model (TRACE) was used. Input fields of emission inventory, meteorological data and deposition parameters are preprocessed for 50 x 50 km2 spatial resolution EMEP grid</p><p id="Pg499">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 500 system. The concentration of lead at a certain receptor point is given by a simple loss function: c(xr,yr;xe,ye) = ß E(xe,ye) R -1 (1-a) e-(kd+kw)t where: c is lead concentration in the air in a certain receptor point as a result of an individual source point (ng m-3); (xr, yr) and (xe, ye) are the spatial co-ordinates of source and receptor points; E is the emission at the source point (ng s-1); ß is derived by setting the upward and downward atmospheric fluxes equal assuming mass conservation (s m-2) R is distance between the source and receptor (m); A is local emission coefficient (dimensionless); kd and kw are loss parameters for dry and wet depositions (s-1); t is atmospheric transport time between source and receptor (s). Dry deposition velocities of lead are calculated separately for each grid element, depending on roughness length, friction velocity and size distribution of aerosol particles containing lead. Size distribution of particles were taken from MÉSZÁROS ET AL. (1997). For detailed model description, testing and validation see ALCAMO ET AL. (1992), BOZÓ (1996) and BOZÓ ET AL. (1992). Even relatively low fluxes across the Earth’s surface can result in accumulation of toxic trace metals in various soils. From the soils they can be taken up by the plants and may be leached out into the ground water. Results and Discussion Based on EMEP model calculations (EMEP 2003), local maxima could be detected in the northern part of western Hungary and in the northern part of eastern Hungary, where still lignite based powerplants are in operation. The model also shows, that Hungarian sulfur emitters contributes to the total atmospheric sulfur deposition in Hungary at a rate of 43%, the remaining part is transported from abroad. The atmospheric sulfur budget of Hungary, however, is still negative, so higher amount of sulfur is emitted than deposited by dry and wet atmospheric processes in the country. The rate of Hungarian SO2 emission in 2000 was 0.24 Tg (S) yr-1, while the rates of dry and wet deposition were 0.07 Tg (S) yr-1 and 0.04 Tg (S) yr-1, respectively, thus the total atmospheric sulfur budget was –0.13 Tg (S) yr-1. The value of the sulfur budget in 1990 was –0.38 Tg (S) yr-1, so a significant improvement could be estimated for the last decade of the past century. Based on the measurements at the regional background stations in Hungary, the annual average SO2 concentration decreased by 50% between 1990 and the first years of this century. The annual average NO2 concentration under regional background conditions were in the range of 2.5 - 4.0 g (N) m-3 in 1990, which decreased into the range of 0.5-3.0 g (N) m-3 in Hungary. It should be noted, however, that in the vicinity of major roads and within urban areas, where traffic is the dominating NO2 source, the average concentrations are much higher. Total atmospheric nitrogen deposition is also calculated by the EMEP model. It includes the dry and wet deposition of gases and aerosol particles containing nitrogen. Its range is between 400-1500 mg N m-2 yr-1. This amount need to be considered in soil-plnat modelling as background concentration load. Local maxima were detected in the northern and western part of the country. Concerning the atmospheric nitrogen budget of Hungary, it can be stated that it is more</p><p id="Pg500">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 501 or less balanced for both reduced and oxidised nitrogen compounds. Modelling pilot studies were performed for the region of Lake Balaton (Fig. 1.) The most significant changes in the atmospheric environment of the past decades in the central-eastern European region is connected with the introduction and widespread use of unleaded gasoline. Lead emission decreased considerably in all countries of the region, resulting in decreasing atmospheric concentrations and total deposition rates, as well as in re-ranking the relative contributions of source categories. Long-range transport of atmospheric trace metals is not simply a clean air protection problem in Figure 1. Total deposition of N species in the vicinity of Lake Balaton (mg N m -2 a -1 ) Figure 2. Total deposition of atmospheric lead (Pb) in the vicinity of Lake Balaton (g km -2 a -1 Europe but a major part of environmental policy as well: considering their characteristic residence time in the atmosphere (a few days) and the sizes of the countries in Europe, international co-operation is needed to control the transboundary flux and deposition of these pollutants. These background calculations need to be considered in soil –plant modelling as well as background pollution load. Conclusions The rate of annual lead deposition in 2004 over Hungary was found in the range of 600 - 2000 g km-2 yr-1, much below the ecological threshold in Europe (250,000 g km-2 yr-1). It was also estimated by model computations that ecological threshold of 5,000 g km-2 yr-1 for Cd was not exceeded in any parts of the region: it varies in the range of 20-300 g km-2 yr-1 . This parameter can be taken into account when specific agricultural crops threshold level is computed. Based on the comparisons with regional background measurements, it was found that our model simulations underestimate the rate of annual deposition by 10-20%. The reason for this could be the underestimations in emission data of trace elements and the uncertainty in the parameterization of deposition processes in the atmosphere. The rate of lead deposition varied significantly during the past decades. Results of a pilot model study in the vicinity of Lake Balaton is presented in Fig. 2. Deposition matrices and maps can be used as a background load of Pb on regional scale, and the effects of local sources can later be added to this load in order to estimate the actual rate of atmospheric deposition. Due to the cumulative characteristics of lead in our environment, it is advisible to estimate the cumulative lead deposition in Hungary for the past 50 years and to provide some quantitative estimates for the next decade. This type of simulation was also done by means of TRACE model computations. Historical emission data were taken from OLENDRZYNSKI</p><p id="Pg501">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 502 ET AL. (1995), while future scenarios are based on the calculations of BERDOWSKI ET AL. (1998). For comparisons, the target of model simulations was not only Hungary but a few other countries in different regions of Europe It is not surprising that cumulative lead deposition was much higher during the 30 years of the period 1955-1985 than that of 19852015. Regarding Hungary, the rate of total lead deposition was 320 mg m-2 during 19551985, while on the basis of model computations it is expected that it will not exceed 95 mg m-2 during the consecutive 30 years period (1985-2015). The cumulative deposition in some regions have high risk on soil –plant systems, which need to be elaborated and incorporated into crop and soil modelling activites.

From the AGROTOPO database, dominant properties were ordered to each hexagon. This process was applied to the whole territory of Hungary. From the Digital Kreybig Soil Information System (DKSIS) not only the dominant properties, but the distribution of the properties was assigned to each cells. Furthermore, we have created an index to estimate the heterogeneity of the soil. We will adopt the DKSIS to the MÉTA grid only in the territory of the Hungarian Great Plain. This new digital soil information system can satisfy the growing necessity of information for sustainable land use and environmental protection. Keywords: digital soil and vegetation information system, soil property, dominance, heterogeneity, density Introduction There is a growing necessity for relevant information about the renewable resources in order to support the decisions connected with environmental protection and sustainable land use. The information about soil is particularly important especially as soil is a conditionally renewable natural resource. Its sustainable use is possible but needs continuous actions and a permanent care for the maintenance of its resilience. We also have to help its maximum renewal, and to keep or increase its sustainable multifunctionality (Várallyay 2007). The soil is endangered by natural and humaninduced stresses such as the soil degradation processes, the extreme moisture regime and the unfavourable changes in the biogeochemical cycles of the elements (Várallyay 2006). The Research Institute for Soil Sciences and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) has joined to the project of the Landscape Ecological - Vegetation Mapping of Hungary (MÉTA). Spatial information of two digital soil information systems with different resolution was attached to the hexagonal MÉTA grid. We integrated the data of the polygons from the AGROTOPO database and the Digital Kreybig Soil Information System (DKSIS) into the hexagons. Materials and methods The MÉTA programme, which was carried out by the Institute of Ecology and Botany of the HAS, is a country-level vegetation mapping project (Molnár et al. 2007). The goal of the project is not only to map and to evaluate the actual (semi-)natural vegetation of Hungary, but to evaluate the state of our landscape from a vegetation point of view, and to collect vegetation and landscape-ecological data for the prognosis of the future vegetation and landscape changes. It will provide basis for a more operative nature protection, landscape management planning on country scale and at regional level, and for the maintenance of the natural ecosystems.</p><p id="Pg503">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 504 The hexagonal grids and quadrats introduced by MÉTA project cover the whole country’s surface without overlappings and gaps. One hexagon covers 35 hectares and one hundred hexagons form a quadrat (Molnár et al. 2007). The AGROTOPO database is a nationwide spatial soil information system at a scale of 1:100,000 which was elaborated in the RISSAC. The nine soil-parameters of the homogeneous agro-ecological units are the following: 1. soil types and subtypes, 2. parent material, 3. soil texture, 4. contents of clay mineral, 5. categories of the water management of the soil, 6. soil reaction and carbonate status, 7. organic matter resource, 8. depth of the column (limited by solid or slightly fragmented rocks, gravel, cemented layers, peat, groundwater, etc.) and 9. soil productivity value (Várallyay 1979, 1980). The Digital Kreybig Soil Information System (DKSIS) is a potentionally nationwide spatio-temporal soil information system (Pásztor et al. 2006) with the scale of 1:25,000. It contains primary soil parameters (chemical and physical properties and Kreybig’s soilscape cathegories) of soil mapping units, and it is upgraded and refined continually (László et al. 2006, Szabó et al. 2007). For the MÉTA project we concentrated on the area of the Hungarian Great Plain and processed only this part of the database. The spatial analysis (intersection and calculation) was carried out in ESRI GIS environment. For the vizualization and internet publication of the results (Soil-MÉTA) we operate a map-based server (Autodesk MapGuide 6.5) in cooperation with the HungaroCAD Ltd. It is available on www.taki.iif.hu/gis/databases.html for authorized users. Figure 1. Dominant properties of the AGROTOPO database were ordered to each hexagon Results and discussion The data from AGROTOPO are proper for the spatial characterisation of the soil on regional scale, relevant at least at a scale determined by MÉTA quadrats. We intersected the MÉTA hexagonal grid and the AGROTOPO database, then we chose the dominant</p><p id="Pg504">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 505 property of the soil parameter and defined it as the value of the hexagon (Fig 1.). We applied this method for all of the nine soil parameters of AGROTOPO. The process has been completed for the whole territory of Hungary. The integration of spatial and thematic data of DKSIS into the MÉTA system provides proper information with larger spatial resolution. In addition to ordering the dominant properties to the hexagons, we also determined the distribution of the various soil properties in each hexagon. Pie charts show the distribution (Fig 2.). Nevertheless, we estimated the heterogeneity of the soil. We used the number of the soil patches within the hexagon as an indicator of soil heterogeneity. Figure 2. Pie charts show the distribution of the DKSIS defined soil properties in MÉTA cells The transformation of the DKSIS has not been finished yet, and we are going to extend it to the whole territory of the Hungarian Great Plain. Soil-MÉTA can complete the goals of the original MÉTA project. It provides additional information for conservation purposes, moreover, it provides soil layers and a wider prospect for complex ecological evaluation and for landscape ecology modelling. It can also constitute the basis for further investigations of landscape history. It can be used for modelling effect analyses and predictions, for example, as an input soil layer for climate change estimations, or for soil protection arrangements. Similarly to the vegetation database, soil data can complete the environmental education of learners from primary school to university. It is possible to draw conclusions about soil and plant interrelations. It can support the evaluation of the vegetation and the landscape assessment in regional and nationwide investigations. It can answer questions like what the correlation is between the soil and the vegetation. It would be particularly interesting to make further investigations in the field of edaphic associations.</p><p id="Pg505">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 506 Soil-MÉTA can be the basis and the confirmation of the “potential natural vegetation” parameter of the vegetation map. This parameter is defined as the most complex – “climax-like” – vegetation that would develop in a site “in no time” (Molnár et al. 2007). Our index of heterogeneity can be a good basis to compare the heterogeneity of the soil and that of the vegetation. Soil-MÉTA is not only a new interpretation of an important factor. The vegetation map puts bigger emphasis on natural habitats, but does not deal with the agricultural areas in detail. They are the soil databases which concentrate rather on the agricultural areas. Thus it widens the horizon as a consequence of which we can consider the Soil-MÉTA as the complement of the vegetation map as well. Consequently, it can be an important basis of decisions and plannings in relation to agro-environmental arrangements, water management, and to evaluate land use suitability at country and regional level. Conclusions Soil-MÉTA can provide a basis and a good background for researches, evaluations and decisions in the topic of conservation, land use and education. MÉTA materializes the multidisciplinary approach of providing information and of the successful protection of the environment because it integrates the soil maps into the vegetation map’s grid. All in all, information is available about the soil and the vegetation within the same environment and with comparable spatial resolution.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 507 REGIONALIZATION OF SOIL DEGRADATION PROCESSES IN HUNGARY László PÁSZTOR – József SZABÓ – Zsófia BAKACSI GIS Lab, Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1022 Budapest, Hermann Otto u. 15., e-mail: pasztor@rissac.hu Abstract: There is a renewed interest in the identification of areas endangered by various soil threats explicitly formulated in EC’s Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection. In our paper we present a functional approach for the regionalization of soil degradation processes combining the relevant map-based data available in nationwide scale. The thematic interpretation and spatial integration resulted in a soil degradation index map, which has been used for the delineation of soil degradation regions as well as for the quantitative comparison of areas based on its appropriate spatial aggregation. Keywords: functional mapping, GIS, soil threats, regionalization Introduction In the last decades soil degradation processes have been significantly increased and, according to the predictions, it is almost sure that without adequate arrangements this tendency will continue (Bridges, Oldeman 1999; Várallyay 2006, 2007). The Commission of the European Communities in the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (CEC 2006) defines the eight most important soil degradation processes in the EU: erosion, organic matter decline, contamination, salinization, compaction, decreasing biodiversity, soil sealing, hydrogeological risks (landslide, flood) as well as proposes a Framework Directive as the means of a comprehensive approach to soil protection and ample freedom on how to implement its requirements is left to Member States. Various threats occur in specific risk areas, which must be identified which will be required by Member States in a national or regional approach possibly on the basis of common elements (Tóth et al. 2006). Over time more harmonised monitoring approach and methodology may be developed, exploiting ongoing work on harmonisation of methodologies carried out by the European Soil Bureau Network and in the frame of RAMSOIL and ENVASSO projects. Soil Information Working Group of the European Soil Bureau Network elaborated common criteria and approaches to identify risk areas for five specific soil threats (Eckelmann et al. 2006). Member States will be free to develop and combine approaches to combat further and concurrent threats. In the frame of Land Degradation Mapping Sub-project of PHARE MERA ’92 (Dallemand, Perdigao 1998) identification, delineation and description of Hungary’s major land degradation regions (areas of potential land degradation risk) at 1:500.000 scale were accomplished by building and analysing an extent digital land degradation geographic database in the late ‘90s (Várallyay et al. 2000). Territories affected by various limiting factors of soil fertility were determined by complex spatial queries of the integrated GIS evaluating the proper influencing factors. Generalising and merging the maps of individual degradation factors resulted in the compilation of a complex degradation map. To derive the boundaries of land degradation regions required the consideration of a further information source. The physiographical delineation of the complex land degradation regions became possible using microregion landscape units. Finally 88 regions resulted in Hungary, which then were thoroughly characterized</p><p id="Pg507">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 508 (Szabó et al. 1998). The applied GIS analysis techniques were mainly based on traditional cartographic methods and had not fully exploited the opportunities, which were later emerged in digital soil mapping. Additionally, numerical analysis of the resulted maps was not really straightforward, however it was highly expected by decision-makers responsible for soil conservation actions (Németh et al. 2000). Materials and methods Digital soil mapping (DSM) integrates the recent developments in numerical soil mapping techniques with the knowledge on soil cover, which has been accumulated by soil surveyors. The development of DSM methods has been a growing activity for the past decades. DSM with the computational power integrated into modernised GIS packages provides new solutions for the improvement and straightforward functional application of spatial soil information systems. Recently the available techniques provided by DSM together with the renewed interest in spatial delineation of areas endangered by various soil threats (e.g.: Conrad et al. 2006; Dent 2007) has been combined in the recompilation of land degradation regions of Hungary. The available map-based data related to soil degradation processes on nationwide scale (Várallyay 1991; Pásztor and Szabó 1998; Pásztor et al. 2000) were collected, integrated and expanded with new spatial information -as compared to that used in MERA project-. The following land degradation factors were distinguished, identified and interpreted: acidity, compaction, excess inland water, low organic matter content, nitrate leaching, salinity-alkalinity, water and wind erosion. Figure 1. Soil degradation index map as a result of summarized regionalized information on specific soil degradation processes Different levels of specific threats were determined in the form of ranked categories using four to six classes. Supposing a (quasi)uniform distribution of vulnerability measure along these classes, we introduced a “standardized” value as a ratio of the class order to the maximum class order expressed in percentage. For the overall spatial characterization of degradation status, spatial information was integrated in a result map</p><p id="Pg508">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 509 (Fig. 1) by summarizing the degradation specific “standardized” cell values. Actually no weights were applied, however their usage may be suggested for the implication of e.g. economical (financial) considerations. Figure 2. Aggregation of soil degradation index on settlement (i.e. LAU1) level Figure 3. Land degradation regions of Hungary: „DSM dominated” derivation Results and discussion The resulted soil degradation index map was and potentially might be further postprocessed in different ways.  Pixel values of the raw degradation maps serve as spatial index of specific soil degradation hazards; their integrated value indicates the overall spatial distribution and territorial extension of soil degradation processes. As a consequence it can be used as an estimate of the grade of the required soil conservation actions.  Applying spatial aggregation of cell based index values can be used for the quantitative comparison of individual geographical and administrative regions how they are affected (Fig.2), thus they can be ranked. This feature can be used for the identification of less favourable areas (LFAs) on various levels (NUTS, LAU). In this context it should be mentioned that the applied functional method can also be carried</p><p id="Pg509">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 510 out in larger scale, based on spatially more detailed data sources providing suitable background for cadastre level LFA designation.  Appropriate contouring of grid data provides soil degradation regions (Fig. 3.) thus recompiling Hungary’s map of soil degradation regions in a more advanced, appropriate and up-to-date form.

Our results shows that these parameters were influenced mainly by fertilization had an effect on the humus, nitrate, uptakeable phosphorus and potassium content of soil.. the systems of cropping on arable lands as well as its interactions with plant nutrition practices. The crop composition of crop rotations inluenced mainly the humus, nitrate, lime content and pH values of soil, while Keywords: crop rotation, fertilization, uptakeable phosphorus and potassium content of soil Introduction Plant nutrition especially macronutrient application is a basic factor of agronomy influencing either crop quantity or quality (Szentpétery et al. 2005, Tanács et al. 1994 and 2005, Jolánkai et al. 2006, Kassai et al. 2006, Márton 2006, Tanács et al. 2006, Németh and Izsáki 2007, Kismányoky and Lehoczky 2007) as well as soil fertility and resilience (Várallyay 2007). Since the dinamics of the different nutrients in the soil are different, application of the different fertilizers should also be different. Unlike N, soil has a significant mineral P and K storage capacity, but only a small amount of these nutrients are available for the plants. It was reported by several authors that the higher the total P and K content of the soil, the smaller amount of fertilizer is needed to increase the uptakeable P and K content of soil by one unit. Láng (1979) found on different soil types that even 70-300 kg ha-1 P2O5 active ingredients of fertilizer is needed in order to increase by 10 mg kg-1 the Ammonium-lactate soluble P2O5 (ALP2O5) content of soil. In case of K nutrient balance was positive above 100 kg ha -1 K2O dosage of fertilizer (Füleky et al., 1994). Materials and methods The study was conducted in a long-term field experiment set up by the Department of Plant Production of the Georgikon Faculty of the University of Pannonia, in Keszthely, Hungary in 1963. The soil was a Ramann-type brown forest soil (Eutric Cambisol) containing 41% sand, 32% silt, and 27% clay. The available phosphorus content of this sandy loam soil was low (AL- P2O5: 60-80 mgkg -1), the potassium content medium (AL-K2O: 140-160 mgkg-1) and the humus content fairly low (1.6-1.7%), with a pHKCl value of 7,3. Longterm annual mean precipitation was 650 mm, but the distribution was often unfavourable. The long-term mean annual temperature was 10.2 oC. In the experiment the effect of mineral fertilization and farmyard manure application (FYM) was studied in the different crop sequences (winter wheat - alfalfa - alfalfa - winter wheat – maize, winter wheat - oats and vetch - winter wheat - maize - sorghum). The study was conducted on the maize grown in both of the two different types of fiveyear crop rotations.</p><p id="Pg511">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 512 In the experiment three variants of fertilization were studied: control: 0 kg NPK ha-1, mineral fertilizer application: 2080 kg NPK ha-1 5 yr-1 (in each rotation cycle), mineral fertilizer application + FYM: 2080 kg NPK + 35 t FYM ha-1 5 yr-1 (in each rotation cycle). FYM had been applied before the maize every fifth year. Soil samples were collected in the maize plots after the 8th rotation cycle at a depth of 0-300 cm after the harvest of maize in the autumn. The 0-300 cm soil layer has been split into 20 cm thick sublayers and tested in the lab. The soluble P2O5 and K2O content of soil was quantified from Ammonium-lactate (AL) extraction by spectrophotometric and flamephotometric method, respectively. Analysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance of the treatments. Results and discussion In case of AL soluble P2O5 content of soil fertilization had a significant effect (significancy level: 0,1%), while the effect of the different crop rotations was not significant. Mineral fertilizer application as well as complementary FYM application increased the AL-P2O5 content of soil significantly in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm layers. The highest AL-P2O5 values were measured in the mineral fertilized+manured plots. In the deeper layers AL-P2O5 content reached small values and did not changed significantly, there were no significant differences between the effect of the experimental treatments. It can be concluded from the results, that migration of phosphorus was caused only by ploughing, which is the usual primary tillage for maize on the research field (Figure 1.). 0,00 100,00 200,00 300,00 400,00 500,00 600,00 700,00 0-20 20-40 40-60 60-80 80-100 100120 120140 140160 160180 180200 200220 220240 240260 260280 280300 depth (cm) m g k g1 control, crop rot. incl. alfalfa control, crop rot. without alfalfa mineral fert., crop rot. incl. alfalfa mineral fert., crop rot. without alfalfa mineral fert.+#, crop rot. incl. alfalfa mineral fert.+#, crop rot. without alfalfa Figure 1.

Mineral fertilizer application as well as complementary FYM application increased the AL- K2O content of soil significantly in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm layers.

With a rise in depth, AL-K2O content of soil decreased significantly until the 60-80 cm layer. In the deeper layers AL-K2O content did not changed significantly, there were no further significant differences between the effect of the experimental treatments.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 515 PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF AN INTEGRATED AGROMETEOROLOGICAL FORECASTING SYSTEM IN SOUTH-EAST HUNGARY Ferenc LANTOS1 – Zoltán GÖRÖG2 – István KRISTÓ1 – Tamás MONOSTORI1 1 University of Szeged, Faculty of Agriculture, Hódmezővásárhely, Hungary e-mail: lantos@mgk.u-szeged.hu 2 Mórakert TÉSZ, Mórahalom, Hungary Abstract: An integrated agrometeorological forecasting system was built out in SE Hungary. The system is based upon 12 meteorological stations deployed at thoroughly selected sites in 3 counties. Collected and calculated meteorological data serve as basis for disease forecasting algorithms worked out for the typical fruits, vegetables and arable crops of the region. Experiences after the first years’ usage suggest that the disease forecasting system gives reliable data to make efficient management of plant pathogens possible. Keywords: agrometeorological forecasting, integrated pest management Introduction Climate change and diversity of meteorological phenomena have a predictable impact on both the ecological and the economical environment of agricultural production (Dobó et al., 2006; Mikulec and Stehlová, 2006; Tanács et al., 2006; Vágó et al., 2006). Agrometeorological modeling, processing and analysis are essential parts of yield forecasting systems such as the MARS project (http://mars.jrc.it/marsstat/Crop_Yield_Forecasting/METAMP/INDEX.HTM). Integrated pest management (IPM) requires forecasting to make an effective plant protection technology based on prevention and on the use of contact pesticides of short persistence possible. Deployment of agrometeorological stations directly on the field of the crops to be protected can be the basis of delivering proper data for plant protection algorithms in each culture. IPM models based on weather data were established for several diseases e.g. potato late blight (Hansen et al., 1995), apple fire blight (Billing, 1990), apple scab (Mills, 1944). Models of this type can be integrated in complex computer programs such as GALATI-VITIS (Szőke et al., 1998). Here we report about the experiences after the first years’ application of an agrometeorological system deployed at 12 farms of various location in SE Hungary. We evaluated the correspondence between the diseases forecasted by the system and the actually detected infections. On this basis the protection algorithms can be corrected if necessary. Materials and methods The agrometeorological system was developed and delivered by the Boreas Ltd., Hungary: – Meteorological station (temperature and moisture sensor, wind speed and direction sensor, soil temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, precipitation quantity sensor, precipitation or leaf moisture sensor, sunshine detector), to perform the necessary measurements – GPRS communication module to transfer the measured data</p><p id="Pg515">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 516 – MailBCUServer a central data collecting/processing program to store and process data and to forward them towards growers – MultiStation4Web program to calculate the infection index of the given pathogen – InterMet3, a data presentation program for basic agricultures to visualize data on the user’s side The 12 agrometeorological stations were deployed in the following sites, in fields where the most characteristic vegetables or fruits of the given region were cultivated: Tataháza, Jánoshalma, Öttömös, Ruzsa, Üllés, Zsombó, Röszke, Balástya, Csengele, Tömörkény, Makó, Medgyesegyháza Meteorological data (basic and calculated) collected by the system: minimum and maximum air temperature (ºC), relative moisture (%), precipitation quantity (mm), leaf moisture (h), duration of solar radiation (h), soil temperature (ºC), soil moisture (%), positive heat unit (ºC day), active heat unit (ºC day), effective heat unit (ºC day), air drought (h), potential evaporation (mm) The fruits, vegetables and arable crops involved in the forecasting program: grape, apple, cherry, sour-cherry, apricot, peach, plum, potato, wheat, maize, sunflower, canola, tomato, pepper Collection of data happens via GSM technology. Each station is equipped with a GSM adaptor and forwards the measured parameters to the central server (MailBCUServer) of the Mórakert Ltd. in the form of a data package. Data are processed by a software (MultiStation4Web) installed on this server. Infection indexes are calculated by algorithms used by the software. The indexes give the basis of the protection method recommended by the consultant. Recommendations are forwarded to growers in the form of SMS. Furthermore, they can collect all the measured and calculated data through the InterMet3 data presentation program. Results and discussion Evaluation of meteorological data (primarily: leaf moisture, moisture, temperature) suggested that climatic conditions had been suitable for several parasites in the region over the year 2007 (Tab. 1). However, the probability levels given in Table 1 were determined on the basis of literary data of the diseases (e.g. Glits and Folk, 2000) and did not always reflect the current situation. Based on the disease forecasting algorithms of the system, the regularly occurring parasites in the region were e.g. Ph. infestans in potato (from 17.04. to 20.06., 4 times forecasted), V. inaequalis and P. leucotrycha in apple (2-3 times forecasted), T. deformans in peach (2 times forecasted). Home and international experiences confirm that before using an IPM model that was not field tested or validated for a specific location, the model should be tested for one or more seasons under local conditions to verify that it will work in the desired location (http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/DISEASE/DATABASE/diseasemodeldatabase.html#FUN GICIDES).</p><p id="Pg516">VII.

The typical diseases detected were the same as in other years (growers, pers. comm.). Leaf moisture (leaves covered by moisture, hours day-1) was found to be the meteorological parameter which essentially determined the forecast of each disease. Generally, the meteorological parameters correlated with the disease forecasting data. The only exception could be found in plum and cherry plantations in Öttömös, where the meteorological data did not correlate with the forecasted as well as detected diseases. Forecasting algorithms for onion and watermelon disease are not included in the system yet. In this case, however, the meteorological data themselves gave sufficient information to forecast the infection (Tab. 2). Conclusions The agrometeorological forecasting system deployed in South-East Hungary proved to be amenable to help growers in performing an environmentally friendly integrated pest management protocol. Anomalies of the weather conditions characterizing the year 2007 gave a good possibility to test the algorithms built in by the developers of the system. Our survey among growers showed that meteorological data-based forecasting gave reliable data for the farmers to prepare themselves for prevention and protection according to the consultant’s suggestions.</p><p id="Pg517">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 519 ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF CHEMICAL REDUCTION ON FARMING: ROLE OF PRECISION FARMING – WILL THE PRODUCTION STRUCTURE CHANGE? Katalin TAKÁCS-GYÖRGY Department of Farm Management, Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, Szent István University, H-2103 Gödöllő, Páter K. u. 1., takacsne.gyorgy.katalin@gtk.szie.hu Abstract: Precision farming – besides other aspects – enables the reduction of use of chemical substances in crop production while decreases farming risks, contributes to specific field-cropplant applications, makes production processes more plannable and increases profitability. The latter, however, can be realised on farm level only under well-determined economic conditions. The objective of the study is to examine the optimal farming size of crop producing farms, when the development of own precision farming equipment is managable and the farm can become self-financing with different production structure. The study also makes recommendations for forms of co-operation. In addition to application of hired machine work, the machine clubs, machine co-operatives can offer solutions for small-scale farms, so that similarly to precision crop production they can apply the same environmentally friendly and efficient technology in economic sense. Keywords: precision farming, field-cropplant applications, viable size, production structure Introduction During the recent decades, new directions have appeared in the agricultural production of developed countries which moved farming towards reduced chemical use. These include the following:  reduction of plant protection chemical use in general (long-lasting, curing agents) with which less treatments are needed during vegetation. The reduction of active ingredient doses results that the quantity of agent per area unit is dropped.;  chemical-free (banning the use of artificial chemicals) trends (types of organic farming), or total banning of chemical use for the sake of environmental safety. The extension of this trend slowed down in 2005, the primary reason for which was the decreasing bonification following the market saturation processes. This resulted a drop – stoppage - of producers’ income. (Willer - Yuseffi, 2006; Takács, 2007);  implementation of integrated crop production systems that is reasonable farm management (Integrated Pesticide Management);  precision farming – which enables targeted agent spraying via spot treatments – results rational chemical use besides – or instead of – chemical reduction. Precision nutrient supply with appropriate technical background has become general practice by now. (Csathó et al., 2007) Precision fertilizing has proved its cost efficiency, while the cost reducing impact of precision crop protection has been less examined by researchers. Besides the reduction of number and extension of treatments, however, the proper selection of dosage depending on soil features would further reduce the agent quantity sprayed. (Wiles, 2004). At the same time, precision crop protection may serve value production purposes, public welfare services, preservation of biodiversity and the protection of nature and the Earth. It requires from the farmer, however, to create appropriate technical background (additional investments) and the maintenance of the available technique which means extra costs (extra costs of extra investment, technology and quality assurance). An analysis, based on years of data collection, carried out in Denmark, stated that on the level of national economy, the 33% decrease</p><p id="Pg519">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 520 of chemical application level in the past decade did not reduce significantly the income level of farmers. Income supplements for producers were not necessary. (Ørum et al., 2001) Based on data from North-America Lowenberg-DeBoer (1996) put down that less than half of farms that switched to precision crop production could obtain surplus income compared to conventional farms, in an area where basically the large-scale technology was general in the last decade. Precision farming can meet both requirements: it can be a tool of reducing chemical use and profitable farming at the same time. It is necessary to examine the economic aspects of this new technology, regarding the consequences of turning to a new farming strategy that could reduce chemical use and environmental pollution at the same time (Swinton, 2005; Wiles, 2004; Kis, 2006) Under the economic conditions of Hungary, payback on the investment on precision farming can be ensured in case of at least 250-280 ha field crop production cultivated with this technology. (Takácsné György - Kis, 2007; Székely - Kovács, 2006). On the basis of economic statistical data this group involve approximately 10% of producers. Those farmers, who deal with crop production on smaller scale, the machinery rings or joint machine co-operatives can offer solution in addition to hired machine work. The virtual large-scale farm – from 3000 ha to even 20-30 thousand hectare farms e.g. in Germany – covered with one machine club implements high-level exploitation of highquality technology, developed with big investments.(Takács, 2000; Kovács et al., 2003; Baranyai – Takács, 2007 Thus the machinery ring reduces the cultivation cost per area unit and increases the individual income of the producer. Materials and methods Based on our former model calculations, during the research the model was updated and cost-margin analysis was made in order to show how the viable size – covering the simple capital replacement, too – is modified by the introduction of precision farming with average crop production structure. (Kis – Takács-György, 2005) Upon the calculation of investment costs it was presumed that the required machinery is developed parallel with the introduction of the new farming strategy (technology) and the purchase of basic instruments is not delayed, therefore only the extra investment costs were defined on the basis of Hungarian distributors’ data of 2006. Thus the extra investment need of a farm having the basic equipment (including corn harvesting machine) is 22.000 EUR. Production costs include costs corrected with income expectations from the invested assets. The produced crops are as follows: 30% winter wheat (61 ha; 5.15 t/ha) – where precision crop protection is not significant – 15% sunflower (31 ha; 2.49 t/ha), 35% maize (72 ha; 7.35 t/ha) – in case of these latter ones, significant cost savings can be calculated due to precision crop protecion – and 20% alfalfa (41 ha) which is utilised within the farm so it was not taken into account upon calculating the viable farm size. The crop yield was calculated on the basis of average Hungarian yield data of test farms in 2006. In the calculations, the material cost saving of precision farming was 10%, the cultivation cost was higher by 5%, and the yield was higher by 10%. The model was built under Hungarian conditions, calculating the costs on price level of 2006.</p><p id="Pg520">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 521 Results and discussion In case of applying precision crop protection, the calculations help to determine the income per unit in connection with production size, compared to the income of conventional farming (it was integrated crop production in this model). The introduction of precision farming technology will reach positive gross margin at 55-60-hectare size of precision crop fields – but it does not mean positive revenue for the farm –, that was about 12000 HUF/ha in winter wheat not taking into consideration the subsidies in 2006 on the base of data FADN farms. (Figure 1.) In the examined case, at least 206 hectares – involved in precision farming – is required for crop production in order to realise the same income as in case of production without extra investments, considering also the costs of necessary extra investment for the given year, presuming that the other factors are the same. It means that this type of farming can be viable for medium-size farms. (Kis – Takács, 2005; Kis 2007) Others should find some ways of co-operation – common machinery use, machine lending, machine leasing – that can help to avoid significant extra investment. Figure 1. Viable size determination in case of precision vs conventional farming Source: own calcultaitons The calculations proved that the reduction of cereals (sowing area) by 40% (31 ha) and the extension of sunflower branch by 50% (27 ha) would increase the income only by 3 %. When the maize branch is increased by the above degree at the expense of winter wheat, the farm-level income grows by 4%. When the proportion of the two widespaced crops is increased to the same degree, the income growth is 4 %, too. When winter wheat is not included in the optimum production structure made with linear programming, the farm income was higher by 11% than the income with the initial structure. If the changes of production structure is examined, it can be stated that the increased proportion of wide-spaced crops increases the total income on enterprise level. In other words it means that farms applying precision crop protection can reach surplus income with low production proportion of cereals.</p><p id="Pg521">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 522 Conclusions The investment in technical background required for the introduction of precision crop production can be a rational economic decision but only with a certain farm size and production structure. Based on own equipment system – under Hungarian conditions – it means 220-250 hectare size. The implementation of precision crop protection is reasonable only in wide-spaced cultures. Payback on complementary equipment can be expected when these crops are in higher proportion in the production structure of the above-sized farm. Shift of smaller farms to precision farming is possible if they apply the technology as a hired service, or the investment is made in the frames of joint machine utilization, like machinery rings.

As a forage crop, pea hay and seed is rich in crude protein content, and most mineral elements. Due to their high nutritive value, peas are an important feed grain legume for animal production operations in the Croatia, where they are an alternative source of crude protein for soybeans. Four forage type pea lines were evaluated for 2 years for dry matter and crude protein yield under rainfed conditions in northwest Croatia. All the lines used in this study were forage type with inteterminate growing habit. Under humid conditions and cool temperatures in early spring, high forage production was obseved in all the lines. Significant differences in dry matter and crude protein yield were found among the lines. Keywords: forage pea lines, wheat, mixtures, crude protein Introduction Mixed cropping is one important element of self-sustaining, low-input agricultural systems (Altieri, 1999), while components of a mixture use limiting resources more efficiently than pure stands, thus showing resource complementarity (Bulson et al. 1997). Nitrogen application is an important and one of the most costly inputs in the nutrition and the production of higer plants including wheat and other cereals (Varga et al. 2004, Szentpétery et al. 2005, Svečnjak et al. 2007). Mixtures may be composed of different species or different genotypes of the same species. Growing legumes such as alfalfa or red clover in monoculture, and forage winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) in mixture with cereals, provides many benefits to cereal-based cropping systems: legume crop biologically fixes atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria making it available to both the legume crop and a subsequent nonlegume crop, thus reducing the need for inorganic N fertilizer inputs (Štafa et al. 2002, Leto et al. 2004, Maćešić et al. 2007), decrease potential diseases, weeds and pest cycles established in continous cereal crops (Percze 2006) etc. Interspecific mixtures are used throughout the world for grain and forage production, often because of an assumed advantage over monocrops. Cereal and legume species are commonly intercropped for forage production, and are harvested at the early stage of the cereal component for better quality feed (Štafa et al. 2002), and higher biomass production compared with sole cropped (Juskiew et al. 2000). According to Mislevy et al. (1997) the stage of harvest was more important than species on the quality and yield of cereals for forage. This research was conducted to determine how forage yield and crude protein (CP) concentration of forage type pea lines and wheat mixtures (Triticum aestivum L.) intercrops are affected by harvest at two small grain cereals growth stages (milk and soft-dough). An additional objective was to determine if an interaction exists between forage type pea lines and wheat crop component that are sown together.</p><p id="Pg523">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 524 Material and methods A 2 year experiment was conducted in northwest Croatia at the Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb experimental field during 2005-2006, and a randomised complete block design in a split-plot arrangement was used. Wheat cv. Sana were grown in mixtures with the forage type winter pea lines. The base seeding rate used in this study was 100 seeds m-2 of forage pea in mixture with 200 seeds m-2 of wheat. Plots were seeded at 15 Oct. 2004 and 18 Oct. 2005. At seeding, plots consisted of of 10 rows that were 12 cm apart and 10 m in lenght. A summary of production treatments involved: fertilisation before plowing (40 kg N ha-1,130 kg P ha-1, 130 kg K ha-1), plowing at 30 cm, granular topdressing 2 x 30 kg N ha-1 . Forage dry matter (DM) yield was determined by clipping the plots at two stages of type pea lines: early flower and early seed, while subsamples of approximately 1000 g randomly selected from each plot were dried at 60°C until a constant weight was attained. Forage pea and wheat components were separated within each subplot in m2 area and weight. Forage crude protein (CP) concentration was determined from a subsample from each plot by standard procedures (AOAC 1990). The data within this experiment were analyzed using mixed model procedures (SAS Inst., 1997). Results and discussions Average DM yield of forage type pea lines and wheat mixtures and their separate components across two growing seasons (2005-2006) was shown in Table 1. In the early flowering stage of forage pea DM yield was significantly (P=0,05) lower than when it was cut in early seed vegetative stage. The highest DM yield was obtained with forage type pea line L1 (ZG10) in mixture with wheat. Wheat in mixtures with forage type pea lines also significantly better yielded in early head vegetative stage compared to late boot. These results are in accordance to data given by Uher et al. 2007, reporting that factors affecting feed quality and yield of forage pea in mixture with cereals include plant stage at harvest, species and genotype. Wheat in mixture with forage type pea line L4 (ZG87) gained significantly the highest yield of DM among all type pea lines, and that affected in great portion total DM yield that was also significantly highest with that mixture. Average CP yield of forage type pea lines and wheat mixtures and their separate components across two growing seasons (2005-2006) was shown in Table 2. In the early flowering stage of forage pea CP yield was significantly lower than when it was cut in early seed vegetative stage. Furthermore, differences in quality may be attributed to biomass distribution during growth period and differences between genotypes and species in their biomass distribution as reported by Juskiew et al. 2000. The highest CP yield was obtained with forage type pea line L1 (ZG10) in mixture with wheat.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 527 BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND ETHANOL POTENTIAL FROM SWEET SORGHUM IN CROATIA Dubravko MAĆEŠIĆ* - Darko UHER - Zvonimir ŠTAFA University of Zagreb, Faculty of Agriculture, Dept. of Field Crops Forages &amp; Grasslands *Corresponding author: dmacesic@agr.hr Abstract: Sorghum has been identified as a preferred biomass crop for fermentation into methanol and ethanol fuel. The adaptation of sorghum to sub-humid and semiarid climates has extended sorghum production into larger regions than other warm-cereal grains. Sorghum can produce approximately 30 dry tons/ha per year of biomass on low quality soils with low inputs of fertilizer and limited water per dry ton of crop, half of that required by sugar beet and third of the requirement for sugar cane or corn. The foreseen results were to test different Sweet Sorghum genotypes to their aptitudes to produce biomass and ethanol production in the climatic conditions of Croatia. The Sweet Sorgum hybrid proved to be very valuable and well adapted to the conditions of Croatia, outlined by high productivity of biomass and ethanol production. Keywords: sweet sorghum, cultivar, biomass, ethanol, energy Introduction The genus Sorghum is characterized by a vastly diverse germ plasm in terms of phenotypic and morphological traits. Many of these have been exploited to give genotypes suitable for grain and forage production, as well as, alternative uses, such as energy, pulp for paper, food products, high grade chemicals and building products (Duncan et al., 1991). Quality parameters of wheat bioethanol versus bread is recently studied (Szakal et al. 2007), but much of the work related to non-food agricultural production of sorghum has been conducted on sweet sorghum, because of the increased interest in sugar crops as potential renewable resources that can be converted into ethanol. It also has a shorter growing season than sugarcane, and is therefore suitable to be grown in geographical areas with a temperate climate. It also has rapid rates of growth. In several studies, sweet types have been evaluated for fermentable sugar production and theoretical ethanol yields (Smith et al., 1987; Copani et al., 1989; Belletti et al., 1991), for the relationships between agronomic practices and yield (Broadhead and Freeman, 1980, Németh, T. and Izsáki, Z., 2005) and among growth parameters (Shih et al., 1981; Ferraris and Charles-Edwards, 1986a; Tarantino et al., 1992), for the pattern of soluble carbohydrates accumulation (McBee and Miller, 1982; Ferraris and Charles-Edwards, 1986b; Petrini et al., 1993), and for relevant physiological aspects of this metabolic process (Vietor and Miller, 1990; Tarpley et al., 1994). Unlike sweet genotypes, nonsweet, and especially those characterized by stalk storage organ with high fiber content, have had little attention, so far. A comparative analysis of the growth and yield performances of five late maturing and productive sweet and fiber sorghums has been conducted, with the perspective of their introduction in temperate Croatia climate areas as competitive multiproduct crops. Biomass production of energetic purpose has a number of benefits for environment (Szakal et al. 2007) and for wellfare of family farms as well (Nagyne Demeter et al. 2007, Sipos et al. 2007). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the productivity of a group of sweet sorghum cultivars of varying maturity and morphology, to determine sugar accumulation patterns in the cultivars, to examine cultivar growth patterns, and to</p><p id="Pg527">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 528 evaluate sweet sorghum as an energy crop by producing ethanol from the cultivars processed as silage. Material and methods A 3 year field experiment was conducted in northwest Croatia at the Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb experimental field during 2004-2006, and a randomised complete block design in a split-plot arrangement was used. Prior to establishment of the sweet sorghum plots, fields were in the soybean year of an oatcorn-soybean rotation. Experimental plots were chisel-plowed in the fall. The seedbed was prepared in the spring with a field cultivator and a harrow in one pass. The sowing density was 150 000 plants per hectare, space between rows was 0.70 m and the between plant spacing was 0.095 m, and the depth was of 3 cm. The sowing time was the 29 th April in 2004, 1th May in 2005 and the 5th May in 2006. A summary of production treatments involved: fertilisation before plowing (48 N ha-1, 156 kg P ha-1, 156 kg K ha-1), plowing at 30 cm, granular topdressing 2 x 54 kg N ha-1. Prior to sorghum planting, production in this area is primarily devoted to livestock. The average frost-free season at this location was 165 days. Five cultivars of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, were selected to include a wide range of maturities, morphologies, and breeding histories. The cultivars, were Grazer N, Keller, Wray, Sugar Drip and Rio. Developed at various locations, several of these are dual-purpose forage and syrup cultivars. Dry matter yield and ethanol production were studied. Laboratory methods and statistical analysis: Dried or frozen plant samples were analyzed for sugars. A main stalk subsample was frozen at – 20°C and used for the determination of fermentable carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and sucrose) and a second stalk was sampled and dried to constant weight at 60°C and ground (size 1 mm) for chemical anlysis. After filtration, the level of soluble carbohydrates was determined enzymatically (Anon, 1984). Reducing sugars consisting of glucose and fructose along with a nonreducing sugar, sucrose, were determined calorimetrically. Sugar concentrations of samples were then calculated, along with percentages and determination of sugar yields on the basis of land area. Fermented silage samples were analyzed for residual sugar, and high pressure liquid chromatography was used to analyze ethanol and volatile fatty acid concentrations. Potential ethanol production was calculated using the total sugar yields for the two cultivar replications that were fermented. The General Linear Model procedure and Analysis of Variance procedure (SAS) were used to determine the statistical significance of cultivar, year and potential of ethanol production. Results and discussions The number of days to anthesis (full blossom) for the 5 cultivars grown in Croatia provides an indication of relative maturity, although cultivars differed in rates of seed head development during the post-anthesis development period. Maturation was linked to other yield characteristics. Tabe 1 shows how the cultivar varied in dry matter production and ethanol potential production during the 3 season (2004-2006). Dry matter production: Cultivar Wray had the highest percentage of dry matter at single harvest in all 3 years (31,80 t ha-1), and as well yielded the most dry matter over all 3 years (average of 30,08 t ha-1). Yield characteristics differed among years, due to climatic differences in years, but the relative rank order of the cultivars remained rather</p><p id="Pg528">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 529 consistent. Two cultivars, Grazer N and Rio, had the least dry matter yield of the cultivars. Three other cultivars, Keller, Sugar Drip and Wray stand out from all others as high yielded. Mean dry matter yields in 2004, 2005, and 2006 were 26,67, 29,31, and 28,55 tons per hectare, respectively. The least dry matter yield was 24,69 t ha-1 from Keller in 2004, while the least mean dry matter yield also achived Keller (27,33 t ha-1). Ethanol production: Cultivar Wray had the highest ethanol production at single harvest in all 3 years (3339 l ha-1), and as well yielded the most ethanol over all 3 years (average of 3159 l ha-1). Ethanol production differed among cultivars, years, due to climatic conditions in different years, but the relative rank order of the cultivars remained rather consistent. Two cultivars, Grazer N and Rio, had the least mean ethanol production of the cultivars, 2447 and 2633 l ha-1 respectively. Three other cultivars, Keller, Sugar Drip and Wray stand out from all others as high ethanol potential cultivars. Mean ethanol production in 2004, 2005, and 2006 were 2731, 2923, and 2887 l ha-1, respectively. The least ethanol production was 2280 l ha-1 from Rio in 2004, and the least mean ethanol production also achived Rio (2447 l ha-1). Table 1.

H- 4400, Nyíregyháza, Hungary Abstract: During our R&amp;D works we have been worked out different GC and GC-MS methods for the separation and identification of vitamin E isomers and some phytosterols from different type of breeded oil seed samples. We optimised the sample preparation, separation, identification, and quantitative determination steps. Databases such as that provided in our study, provide a means for assessing the very important lipophilic antioxidant vitamin E, and phytosterol intake in population studies. On the other hand seed kernel oil and flour of the studied oil seeds and their cold pressed residue byproducts have great potential for addition to food systems, not only as phytonutrient supplements but also as functional agents. Finally, the utilization of the cold pressed residue byproduct of sunflower and pumpkin seeds could provide some income, and on the other hand, help to minimize waste disposal problems. Keywords: gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, oil seeds, vitamin E isomers, phytosterols Introduction Interest in vitamin E as a lipophilic antioxidant has greatly increased recently. αtocopherol content of sunflower, and other olisseeds is a well characterized property of different kind of hybrids as well as plant hight or seednumber per head (Göksoy and Turan, 2007), as well as the yeast content of sunflower depend on the characteristic of the cropyear (Hunyadi et al, 2007). Tocopherol isomers, mainly α-tocopherol, are reported to have a number of valuable health benefits, including the abilitiy to help in controlling the excess of free- radical produced by the antioxidant deffence mechanismus of the body (Azzi and Stocker , 2000; Gardner and Fridovich, 1991) and some clinical conditions that have been related to the continuing excess of these freeradicals. Halliwell et al (1992) proposed that dietary antioxidants help to prevent to control this excess and vitamin E (α-tocopherol) may have great significance as it integrates in the vulnerable cellulare membranes (Niki et al, 1995). Besides tocopherols in principle four tocotrienols also exist in plant materials. However, the antioxidative activity of tocopherols and tocotrienols is different. Thus it is important to determine the content of various tocopherols and tocotrienols in food materials and foods in order to estimate the total vitamin E content. Sunflower and pumpkin are the most important Hungarian oil seed producting agricultural plants. In the last years more than 17 new sunflower variety were improved at the Department of Crop Growing of Universitiy College of Nyíregyháza. The most important aim of our studies were to chemically characterize the Hungarian sunflower varieties and other Hungarian oil seeds first of all to separate, and to quantify of their vitamin isomers and the characteristic phytosterols.</p><p id="Pg531">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 532 Materials and methods All standards were Merck tocopherols (Art. 15490) and tocotrienols (Art. 8224) throughout. The collected sunflower seeds were pooled and carefully homogenized and then analyzed in duplicate. The homogenized sample was saponified at 70 °C for 2 h by alcoholic 6 M potassium hydroxide. The sample was filtered and three times extracted withn n-hexane, three times rinsed with water and evaporated under vacuum at 30 °C to dryness. All analyses were carried out in duplicate. The results were analysed using SPSS package. This includes linear regression analysis and the analysis of variance. The significances of linear relationship of the calibrations were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), in all cases P&lt;0.01 %. The coefficient of determination (r2) was calculated from the results for all relationships and is included; the significance was assessed (at p&lt;0.01%)(r ≥0.97). Results and discussion The aim of this study was to separate, identify (Figur 1) and quantify eight vitamin E isomers (tocopherols, tocotrienols) and phytosterols in different Hungarian oil seeds and their coled pressed residues byproducts. Capillary column GC and GC-MS procedures were used to analyse 17 sunflower seed items of Hungarian origin, some of the results are in the Table 2. In general αtocopherol was the dominant vitamin E isomers (Table 1), followed by β-isomers, while there were only small amounts of γ, δ. Table 1.

Keywords: long-term field, experiments, organic and inorganic fertilization, grain and straw yield, N indices, Corg., N balance Introduction The field experiment testing mineral nitrogen fertilizer in combination with different forms of organic manure over period of 23 years (8 crop rotation) has provided specific results concerning the interaction of the manure treatments. The present publication gives a short information about the most important results of the last crop rotation (2005-2007) at wheat. In the crop rotation the yield of winter wheat in the average of years varied 2-6 tha-1 interval.With the organic manuring at the N0 plots yielded cca.1000 kg ha-1 grain more (and straw alike) compare to the absolute N0 and have positive effect on yield at the lower N fertilizer level, as well. In the crop rotation FYM, straw and green manure +N increased the Corg and Nt significantly. Material and methods The experimental site is situated in the west part of Hungary.

The yield of winter wheat varied between 2-6 t ha-1 depending on the different manure treatments. Without organic manure (I) in the only NPK fertilizer combinations the average yield level was lower compare to the others (II-III) where both the organic and inorganic fertilizers were given. The N0 plots yielded only 2 tha-1 in the average of the two decades but in the case of organic manuring the N0 plots yielded 1000 kg ha -1 more. The positive effect of organic manures compared to the only NPK fertilizer combinations was significant in all of N fertilizer treatments. y = -0,3321x 2 + 2,8869x - 0,7778 R 2 = 0,9924 y = -0,2944x 2 + 2,5238x + 0,3602 R 2 = 0,9883 y = -0,3016x 2 + 2,496x + 0,6422 R 2 = 0,9872 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 N0 N1 N2 N3 N4 F(I) F+FYM 2year (II) F+S(III) y = -0,4832x 2 + 3,9882x - 1,9708 R 2 = 0,9912 y = -0,4133x 2 + 3,4283x - 0,4882 R 2 = 0,9958 y = -0,3804x2 + 3,1828x - 0,3144 R2 = 0,9907 LSD5% AxB = 0,4239 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 N0 N1 N2 N3 N4 F(I) F+FYM 2year (II) F+S(III) Figure 1.

In the treatments of manuring in N3 plots the amount of biomass was significantly higher. The table 1 collected topether some parameters related to the N fertilization Grain and straw yield (standardized absolute D.M.) show the same feature lake at the Figure 1-2. The harvest index was mostly 1/1 in drymatter, too. The N content of grain was 2,38 mg kg-1 at straw it was 0,447 mg kg-1 in the average of the combinations. The results are equal to expectation. (BERECZ K. et.al 2005, HUGGINS et.al 1993, SARKADI J. 1975). The 80 % of the uptaken N was found in the grain and cca. 20 %, in the straw depending on the N supply. The maximal biomass yield was measured at 100-150 kg ha-N where the N balance was slightly positive or at equilibrium. In the N0 plots the results show the natural N supply of soil where the soil releases 37 kg ha-N-1, the FYM (2nd year post effect) 30 kg ha-1 and the straw +N approximately 30 kg N ha-t amount of N nutrient. The Harvest index of N (HIN%) means that the wheat more than 80 % of the N absorbed in the grain. The plant produced 30-40 kg grain from the soil N kg-1 and from the applied fertilizer this was 10-30 kg grain kg-1 N fertilizer. The recovery of the fertilizer had given were 40-70 % compare to the N0 plots. The Corg content of soils (%) humus content (%) and humus weight (t ha-1) increased significantly paralell to the given manure.

The N fertilization significantly increased the yield compare to the N0 plots. On the basis of P2O5 100, K2O 100 kg.ha -1 the maximal grain (and straw) yield production was measured at the amount of 100-150 kg.ha-1. positive effect of N fertilizer amounts above there were not significant. The organic manure (FYM) had given to the proceeding crop maize proved to be favourable at wheat as an 2nd year after effect. With the organic manuring at the N0 plots yielded 1000 kg.ha -1 grain more compare to the absolute N0 and have positive effects on yield at the lower N fertilizer levels, as well. The straw +N incorporation and the green manure had positive influence of soil fertility and plants in the whole crop rotation mostly on the lower N level (N0-N1). The maximal biomass yield was measured at 100-150 kg ha-N fertilizer where the N balance was slightly positive or at equilibrium, Tóth Z. (2007) found in field experiments that above the balance the N leading could be very much even in 1 m deep layer. The Corg content of soils% humus content % and humus weight (t ha -1) increased significantly parallel to the given manures. It draws our attention to the facts, that the straw as an byproduct means a very important C resources what have to be put into the recycling as an straw manure mainly if there is no animal husbandry in the farm to preserve of the C balance. This idea appeared former publication, as well (Kismányoky, 1997). Várallyai (2006) decleared, “Soils are the most important (conditionally renewable) national resources of Hungary. Consequently, their rational use and maintenance of their multifunctionality” quality, fertility and agricultural productivity are important elements of sustainable (agricultural) development.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 539 MAIN DRIVERS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USE CHANGE IN EUROPE Maria FEKETE FARKAS 1 – Mahesh Kumar SINGH 2 1 , Institute of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, Szent Istvan University, Gödöllő, Hungary Faculty, University, address, e-mail: Farkasne.Fekete.Maria@gtk.szie.hu 2 Institute of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, Szent Istvan University, Gödöllő, Hungary Abstract: During the last decade, as our Planet became more vulnerable, the demand for improved knowledge of environmental process and the impact of human activity on their dynamic increased. It is there for clear how important agricultural land use change is for European environment in all its varied components. Different factors, including demographic trends, economic growth and affluence, technology, agricultural and rural policies, institutional structure, attitudes and social values and other key driving forces, lead to changes of land use and land cover, which result in a range of impacts on yields, farm income, biodiversity, landscape identity water quality, flooding, greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion. Information about causal relationships driving land use development is needed to build models of land-use and land cover change, the result of them help governments and other agencies to shape land-use decisions by creating the incentives that motivate individual decision makers in changing their practice toward sustainability. This paper presents the main drivers of European land use change, focusing on regional differences of them and their impacts. Keywords: land use change, socioeconomic driving forces, climate change Introduction According to Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2003) the sustainable supply of ecosystem services can be used a measure of human wellbeing. Among the many other factors of global change land use change has been highlighted as key human induced affect on ecosystem. In spatial terms, agriculture is the most widespread type of land use in Europe. The basic assumption is that the pattern of future land use depends on the decision of land owners or land users. The basic premise is the theory that producers are motivated by self-interest. It results the assumption of profit (utility –maximising) behaviour (Audsley et al., 2006). Given this utility maximising behaviour, the land use observed at a particular location will depend on relative profitability of competing potential uses as urban, agricultural, pastor, forest, protected areas, and green area for recreation or conservation. The changes in pattern of land use are driven not just by the private interest of landowners but by interest of society formulated in actual policy aim. We should note as well that any policy measurement should be guided by targets, and this raises the question that what we can expect of agriculture. Agricultural production generates a set of outputs, including two major subsets: food and fiber outputs and environmental outputs. The general way of the expectation is that agriculture should supply goods that meet consumers’ demand both in quantity and quality (Várallyay, 2006). However, the orientation of social and political value has changed. The land use change can not be understood independent of the underlying driving forces that motivate and constrain production and consumption. The candidate drivers shaping future agricultural land use were identified (FeketeFarkas et.al.2003): geographical, biophysical situation, demography (population growth, density; population breakdown: by age and urban-rural; migration: international flow; from urban to rural; from rural to urban), economy and policy (GDP/capita; growth of the national economy; changes of income level and distribution; world</p><p id="Pg539">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 540 market situation: demand/supply, prices; domestic demand of agri-food production; technological innovation and deployment; food quality regulation, food safety; role of WTO; role of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI); pattern of market chain; development of infrastructure; energy demand; EU enlargement), agricultural policy (national; Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): price support, intervention, direct payments, rural development, environment protection), environment policy and regulation (national; international agreements (Kyoto, etc.); public awareness), other sector and social policies (because of finance, of education, social benefit, sources of alternative income, support of S&amp;M enterprises), land market regulation (ownership, leasing), resource competition (land, water), farm structure (size and legal form), personal characteristics of farmers (education, age) (Fekete-Farkas et al, 2003). Materials and methods Future trends in the factors determining land use are full of uncertainties. In such a context, prediction of socio-economic trends and the environment changing in space and time is clearly impossible. Given these constraints, an alternative technique for the exploration of uncertain futures is used: the application of scenarios (Farkas et al., 2006 Mikulec et al., 2006, Várallyay et al., 2007). The methodology and scenarios have been used in this paper was developed by research team of ACCELERATES (Assessing Climate Change Effects on Land Use and Ecosystems from Regional Analysis to The European Scale Modelling long-term changes in agricultural land use are here driven by the use of climate change scenarios for the years 2020, 2050, and 2100 (Rounsevell et al., 2006). This paper is focusing on the socioeconomic model. Steps of development of socio-economic model: Identify and describe the global scenarios to simulate (SRES); identify and evaluate the Global Driving Forces (GDF); describe the impact of GDF on agricultural sector; identify and evaluate the Agricultural Sector Driving Forces (ASDF); evaluate the impact of ASDF on the Agricultural Model Parameters over time and space ((Fekete-Farkas et al, 2005). The integrated scenarios of future agricultural land use change in Europe is based on an interpretation of the IPCC-SRES storylines, which describe 4 alternative futures (A1: world market, A2: regional cooperation, B1: global sustainability, B2: local sustainability) and combines qualitative and quantitative methodologies. These alternative scenarios are different in development characteristics - more economically or environmentally-orientated, and with global or regional level priorities. Importance and intensity of these driving forces are different by scenarios, time horizon, or by countries, and the final outcomes result willingness and ability of people to change. As the economy of European Countries are market economy it is a real assumption that driving forces impact mainly through market mechanism (supply and demand traditional agricultural product and environmental services, and land for other purposes), which in addressing cases of market “failure” corrected, or regulated, or sometimes destroyed by special policies. Having the world general scenarios and global driving forces the next step is to evaluate their impact on agricultural land use in order to select the dominants. Taking into consideration that the European agriculture is not homogenous, the local, sector experts or stakeholders should select drivers, which are considered to be the main drivers for changing in the examined region. Qualitative values of driving force came from the experts’ opinions that have been collected by asking those questions, and</p><p id="Pg540">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 541 having the Saaty scale as a reference for their answers. Socioeconomic data for the future are detailed in Abildtrup et al.2006 and the result of ACCELARATES project are summarised in a Special Issue of Environmental Science &amp; Policy, 2006. (Rounsevell et al, 2006, Abildtrup et al, 2006, Audsley et al., 2006)) Results and discussion The results indicate that, on one hand, it is not possible to design policies that anticipate certain climate induced land use changes, but that policies should be adjusted continuously to adapt to climate change (Dobo et al.2006, Várallyay et al., 2007) On the other hand, land use is sensitive to markets for agricultural inputs and outputs, technology, and policies and these changes may in many cases have more significant impacts on land use than climate change. The results show that the various historical backgrounds make differences between the dominant driving forces, their importance in the EU-15 and new members EU-12 as it is shown in table 1 and table 2.

In the new EU members the years until 2020 is considered a transition years, i.e. the scenarios include mechanisms how to get to the future. It means we have to separate the impact of transition from long term drivers (Fekete-Farkas et al., 2005).</p><p id="Pg541">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 542 Conclusions An important benefit of the scenario approach is that scenarios allow the direct comparison of changes arising from either climate or socio-economic change. Thus, the relative importance of socio-economic and biophysical drivers can be assessed, and the implications for policy can be highlighted. According to the result of land use model applied in this project the socio-economic scenarios are shown to have an even larger effect on land use, however climate change can create new food insecurities in coming decades. Regional land use studies make it possible to compare the importance and the structure of the driving forces of land use changes at different spatial level, global national, regional and local. The key driving forces, lead to changes of land use and land cover, which result in a range of impacts on yields, farm income, biodiversity, landscape identity water quality, flooding, greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion. Information about causal relationships driving land use development is needed to build models of land-use and land cover change, the result of them help governments and other agencies to shape land-use decisions by creating the incentives that motivate individual decision makers in changing their practice toward sustainability.

Abstract: Based on the new soil acidity determination method a new technology has been developed for the amelioration of acid soils. According to this technology the amount of liming material is equal to the amount of H + in the liquid and solid phase and the H + deriving from protolityc reactions. The Hungarian liming recommendation system that is based on the hydrolytic acidity gives twice as high lime doses than the new method. In this work the yield and element composition of plants grown on limed and unlimed soils will be compared. These experiments confirm the results of former experiments that the lime amount calculated from the hydrolytic acidity is excessive. This investigation proved that this lime amount decreases the maize yield and element content compared to the half dose of the calculated lime amount. These experiments showed that the present Hungarian liming recommendation system results lime overdose that is unnecessary and partly harmful. Keywords: acidic soil, liming, maize, acidity titrated, hydrolytic acidity Introduction The soil’s basic functions may suffer a loss by natural or anthropogenic acidification. In Hungary this problem has a great importance because the area susceptible for acidification covers more than the half of the country’s land. The knowledge of the exact value of soil acidity is important because of lime requirement estimation, thus their amelioration and protection of soils (Várallyay et al., 1980; Várallyay, 2006; Husti, 2006). In Hungary and in some other countries the CaCO3 amount needed to ameliorate acid soils is calculated by considering their hydrolytic acidity (HAC1). In the measurement suggested by Kappen (1929) the acidity of the equilibrium solution of the soil’s Caacetate extract is quantified. This acidity value shows only the equilibrium value of H+ amount corresponding to the given soil/extractant ratio. To determine the total releasable surface acidity the soil must be continuously percolated or the soil/extractant ratio must be changed (Filep, 1999). For the elimination of this principle error of Kappen’s method the soil acidity can be determined by the pH-stat titration of the soil suspension (Czinkota et al., 2002). Based on the new soil acidity determination method a new technology has been developed for the amelioration of acid soils. According to this technology the amount of liming material is equal to the amount of H+ in the liquid and solid phase and the H+ deriving from protolityc reactions. The Hungarian liming recommendation system that is based on the hydrolytic acidity gives twice as high lime doses than the new method. Csatho (2001) found that lime doses according to the recommendation system are adequate to loamy clay and clay soils but on sand and sandy loam 50% of the full lime dose was the most efficient.</p><p id="Pg543">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 544 In this work the yield and element composition of plants grown on limed and unlimed soils will be compared. Materials and methods For the experiment 3 sites with low soil pH were chosen from the farms of KITE Rt. The soil properties of these sites can be seen in Table 1. The experiments had 3 treatments in 4 replications in randomised plot design. The area of one plot was 0.1 ha. The treatments were the calculated full and the half lime dose. The lime dose was calculated by the following formula: lime dose =17.4*KA*HAC1/1000 (t.ha -1). Where KA is the upper limit of plasticity and HAC1 is the hydrolytic acidity. The liming material was sugar industry sludge with 80% CaCO3 content. The applied plant was maize in both years (2006, 2007). The plant samples were taken on 27th June 2006. Determination of plant element concentrations was carried out with ICP-AES method after cc. HNO3 + H2O2 digestion in the laboratory of RISSAC. At harvest the grain yield of maize and moisture were measured. The yield values were converted to the value of May (14% moisture content). For data evaluation 2 and 3 factor ANOVA was used. Table 1.

The Ca content of the plants were influenced by both site and liming technology. In every treatment the maize in Vasmegyer contained less Ca than the plant samples of the two Álmosd site. The average values showed the same trends (Table 2). Table 2.

Only the site significantly influenced the K content of the maize. In the average of the treatments the K content in Vasmegyer was 3.1% while on Álmosd 1 site 1.8% and on</p><p id="Pg544">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 545 Álmosd 2 1.5%. The LSD5% value was 0.5% thus K content on the Álmosd sites are the same but on the Vasmegyer site it was twofold higher. The average value of the treatments for the control treatment was 2.4% for half dose 2.1% and for full dose 2.0%. The LSD5% value for these data was also 0.5% thus the decrease in K content of the plants caused by liming was not significant. The P and S content of the plant samples were equalized. Nor the site neither the liming treatment had any significant influence on maize P and S content (Table 3 and 4). Table 3.

In the average of the treatments the Cu content in Vasmegyer was 6.4 in Álmosd 1 7.9 and in Álmosd 2 8.1 mg.kg-1. The LSD5% is 0.7 thus there was no difference between the two Álmosd sites but on Vasmegyer the Cu content of maize was significantly smaller. This phenomenon can be the consequence of the high organic matter content of the Vasmegyer soil. The average values of the treatments were 7.0 mg.kg-1 for control, 7.8 mg.kg-1 for half dose and 7.5 mg.kg-1 for full dose. The LSD5% value (0.7) showed that the Cu content of the plants increased significantly even in the half dose lime treatment. The Cu content decrease in the full dose treatment was not significant. The Fe content of the plants did not change in function of sites (Table 5). The Fe content increased significantly only in the half dose treatments according to the average of the sites. The application of full dose did not cause further Fe increment is the maize. On the Vasmegyer soil the full dose liming decreased the Fe content of the maize compared to the half dose treatment (LSD5% = 19 mg.kg -1). Table 5.

In the second year (2007) one year after liming the effects are not that significant. The yield increment in the half dose and full dose treatment was not significant compared to the control. The full dose treatment caused yield decrease compared to control and half dose treatment in the average of years and sites too. The average values for the different treatments were the following: control 8.3, half dose 8.36 and full dose 7.9 t.ha-1. The LSD5% for these values was 0.38. The average of the yield on the three sites was not different significantly. The yield in 2007 was significantly smaller than in 2006. This decrease was in accordance with the changes of nationwide yield thus it is caused by the weather. Conclusions These experiments confirm the results of former experiments that the lime amount calculated from the hydrolytic acidity is excessive. This investigation proved that this lime amount decreases the maize yield and element content compared to the half dose of the calculated lime amount. These experiments showed that the present Hungarian liming recommendation system results lime overdose that is unnecessary and partly harmful.

In this paper changes in SOM content is discussed by examining the changes of humus content. A six year experiment was conducted and shows a direct correlation between the litter production and SOM content. A well characterized difference was observed in changes of SOM content between litterless (NL, NR, NI ) and the other (C, DW, DL) plots. Keywords: soil organic matter, humus content, litter, Quercetum petraeae-cerris Introduction The effect of climate changes in Hungary (Várallyay et al., 2007) and changes in land use have an impact on the litter production and through that the humus forming processes.Regular examination of soil organic matter (SOM) content and quality of a given area makes the detection of environmental stress and early indication of other changes possible regarding the soil quality. Due to the heterogeneity of soil organic matter and humus forming molecules their solubility and redox status can be different, therefore their ’lifetime’ also shows meaningful differences. Thus, there are slowly changing fractions, regarding their quantity in longer term they can be considered to be more or less constant and there are fractions reacting quickly to external impacts. An example for the latter are labile, light fractions or water soluble carbohydrates (Bending, 2000). In broader sense SOM includes the biomass of soil living organisms. Still samples free from roots and other organic matters are analysed when examining SOM. Beside the soil humus content these data include carbohydrates, lignin, proteins, amino acids, fats, chitin, wax and other organic matters (Filep, 1988). Organic matter content of temperate zone soils also changes slowly (Johnston, 1991) unless biomass is carried away from the area by erosion or harmful human activity. Stefnovits (1992) found that under favourable environmental conditions there is no substantial organic matter accumulation in the case of climax association. Tillage of arable land and other human intervention - particularly when erosion through eradication of the natural vegetation is accelerated- can decrease the SOM content to half in a few years or decades (Alvarez et al., 2001). In the background of the process is the substantial decrease of litter production, therefore microbial mineralization decreases the SOM supply, then with the reduction of organic substrates, the activity and number of bacteria and fungus taking part in the decomposition, also falls. These effects are well-shown by the reduction of soil respiration (Steenwerth et al., 2005) and enzyme activity (Fekete et al., 2007). The</p><p id="Pg547">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 548 above described processes are also strengthened by the accelerating erosion, which almost always occurs on slopes after clearance of the natural vegetation. Materials and methods The experimental forest site of 64 ha is located in the south part of the Bükk Mountains in North Eastern Hungary at 325 m altitude. GPS coordinates N 47o90’ E 20o46’. This forest has belonged to the Bükk National Park since 1976. The annual precipitation amounts to 550 mm. The plot is an unfertilized forest soil with Quercetum petraeaecerris community. The type of the soil according to the FAO Soil Classification is Cambisols. The applied litter treatments are shown in Table 1. Each plot is 7m wide and 7m long (49 m2), and every treatment was set up in three replications. Table 1. The applied treatments in open-field experiment (Síkfőkút, Hungary) TREATMENTS DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD CONTROL (C) Normal litter inputs. NO LITTER (NL) Aboveground inputs are excluded from plots. DOUBLE LITTER (DL) Aboveground leaf inputs are doubled by adding litter removed from NO LITTER plots. DOUBLE WOOD (DW) Aboveground wood debris inputs are doubled by adding wood to each plot. NO ROOTS (NR) Roots are excluded by inserting impenetrable barriers in backfilled trenches to the top of the horizon C. NO INPUTS (NI) This treatment is the combination of NR+NL plots. Humus content was measured 12 times altogether from April 2001 to October 2006. Soil samples had been taken from the experimental plots and were sieved, homogenized and dried before their humus content was analysed. Humus content was measured with the Tyurin method (Buzás, 1988). Since three plots were established for each treatment, therefore every treatment had 9 measured data. Statistical analysis of our data was carried out by paired sample T test using SPSS 12.0 software. Results and discussion At first time the highest humus content was detected in NR plots. Humus content measured in NI plots was higher than in DL and C plots, however, it did not occure in the following time. The first sampling date was spring 2001, 5 months after the establishment of the plots. In our opinion decomposing roots of the removed shrubs and woods increased SOM content and enzyme activity (Fekete et al., 2007) that is why high organic matter content was measured in NR and NI plots, first. Decomposition rate of roots with different diameter is very dissimilar (Silver &amp; Miya, 2001). Roots with a diameter of more than 5mm are decomposed slowly because leaching out of watersoluble compound from thicker roots is slow (Fahey et al., 1988). Moreover, needs more time for fungal hypha to penetrate inside the root tissues and thicker the diameter of root more resistant organic matter is contained (Fitter, 1985). The unfavourable C:N ratio for decomposers has a role in the slower decomposition. The C:N ratio of roots thicker than 2mm can be more than 75 (Heal et al., 1997). Therefore the increase in organic matter content observed in certain treatments refered to the decompositon of the thinner roots. After the fine roots had been decomposed, SOM content measured in NR</p><p id="Pg548">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 549 and NI plots as well as in NL plots decreased with 31%, 17.6% and 23%, respectively in the period of 2003-2006 compared to 2001 (Table 2). Table 2. Yearly changes in humus content (%) from 2001 to 2006 TREATMENTS 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 DL 3.34 2.84 3.15 3.35 2.96 3.05 C 3.03 2.95 2.96 3.07 2.89 2.63 NL 3.27 2.61 2.40 2.64 2.67 2.37 NR 3.50 2.43 2.48 2.66 2.45 2.06 DW 3.26 2.58 2.99 3.11 3.12 2.77 NI 3.11 2.45 2.63 2.60 2.75 2.27 Compared the average humus content of the three litterless plots to that of litter treated ones (DL, C, DW) there was significant (p&lt;0.05) difference found in the soil organic matter content within the 6 year period. Decreasing amount of organic matter int he soil leads to the decline of humus content in a relatively short period of time (Lal, 2002). In Síkfőkút site Kovács (1978) measured 3.2% SOM content in the top 10 cm soil and 2.6% in the 10-30 cm layer. His results corroborate with ours because our samples were taken from the top 20 cm layer from what 2,95% humus content was measured in average. This concurrence proves that SOM content does not change considerably even in long term, unless humans interfere in the organic matter turnover of natural ecosystems (Stefanovits, 1992). Yearly differences in humus content – beyond the effect of the treatments – probably reflect the differences manifested in the yearly litter production. Table 2 shows that during the period of 2003-2006 SOM content of plots treated by surplus litter amount (DL, DW) increased, there was a slightly change in the soil of C plots and int he case of litterless plots (NI, NR, NL) SOM content decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) compared to the period of 2001-2002 (Table 3).

Conclusions Our results show that litter amount either getting onto the soil or produced under the surface has a strong impact on SOM supply. In a few years interval significant</p><p id="Pg549">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 550 differences were observed in humus content measured in the soil of the litterless (NL, NR, NI) plots and in the soil of the other plots (DL, C, DW) covered by leaf or wood litter. These changes in humus content elucidate the decline in SOM content of arable lands, appears in few decades, particularly when the major share of the developed biomass is deprived.

Páter Károly 1, 2100, e-mail: gogan.andrea@mkk.szie.hu 2 Department of Plant Physiology and Molecular Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Eötvös University Keywords: truffle cultivation, mycorrhiza level, soil parameters Introduction Mycorrhiza fungi play an important role in the life of higher plants, improving their nutrient and water uptake (Bíró, 2007). Besides these functions some of them develop ascocarp of great gastronomic value. Truffles have been considered as rare and highly appreciated spices in Europe and in the World. Besides the history of collection and gastronomic use of these delicacies efforts for the cultivation started more than two hundred years ago. The cultivation technology is based on the successful mycorrhiza relationship between the fungus and the host tree, aimed first by Joseph Talon, who sowed acorns under truffle producing trees then planted out them, resulting in a plantation imitating natural truffle habitats (Hollós, 1911). Since then truffle cultivation developed to a modern technology when seedlings mycorrhized under controlled circumstances are planted out in a spacious grid. Nevertheless, a way of “extensive” cultivation is still exists when mycorrhiza contact develops after planting out seedlings or sowing acorns covered by truffle suspension. And, although this method involves a potential risk of being colonized by other mycorrhizal fungus and it needs more time to produce truffles, due to its lower cost of establishment (one tenth of the cost of planting mycorrhized plantlets) it is popular (Gógán et al, 2007a). Materials and methods The 14-hectare truffle plantation examined in the current study is situated in the Szekszárd-hills (Hungary), established by the owner, József Ulrich periodically from 1999. The L shape valley is heterogeneous regarding slope steepness, orientation and soil characteristics. Main soil types are water affected meadow chernozem and heavy, highly carbonated chernozem–brown forest soils (Stefanovits, 1999). The plantation was established between 1999 and 2002, applying the above mentioned “extensive” method of covering oak acorns with truffle suspension then sowing them in a dense grid of 2m*0.05m (Gógán et al, 2007b). Irrigation facilities are under construction due to extreme weather patterns during past years. To carry out the study the orchard was divided into approximately homogenous parcels based on geography, time of plantation, species of the truffle and the host tree (Table 1).</p><p id="Pg551">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 553 Soil analysis results show that regarding pH the plantation is suitable for truffle cultivation comparing to natural habitat truffle beds where pH range is between 5.9 and 7.9 with an average of 7.19 (Bratek, 2007). Humus content are relatively high in spite that the site were used for agricultural production previously and therefore intensive organic material accumulation could not happened contrary to the average of natural forest truffle habitats of 6.2% (Bratek, 2007). Sticky point by Arany is in correlation with natural habitats average 69,42% (± 4.5%) (Bratek et al, 2005), which could reflect heavy, clayey soils (Stefanovits, 1999). Results show that concerning soil heaviness the plantation is suitable for truffle cultivation. Suitability of the soil has been confirmed by the finding that truffle species (Tuber aestivum, Tuber brumale, Tuber macrosporum) used as inoculum when establishing the plantation between 1999-2002 were detected on the root tips (Figure 1). Figure 1. Distribution of mycorrhizas and average mycorrhiza level intensity Mycorrhiza levels of the targeted truffle species resulted variable, from no mycorrhiza to as high as 36 per cent of the root tips. Levels of the detected contaminant species proved to be variable as well. The most common contaminant fungus were aff. Scleroderma and aff. Tomentella, in some cases being responsible for the highest of 40 percent of mycorrhiza level. Contaminant Tuber species also occurred in the root, although in lower percentages. Conclusions Comparing with the characteristics of Hungarian natural truffle habitat soils the plantation proved to be suitable for truffle production concerning key soil parameters as pH, humus content and sticky point by Arany, therefore posterior soil analysis confirmed the adequate site selection. Besides the favourable soil parameters climatic conditions are generally suit to the cultivation of different truffle species. Low number of root samples and no mycorrhiza presence lead us to the exclusion of parcel III from</p><p id="Pg553">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 554 the cultivation therefore further plantation of seedlings or sowing of acorns are discouraged. The unsuitability of this parcel can be originated in the orientation (South) and therefore drier microclimatic patterns. Based on climatic model forecasts long-term warming, decrease of precipitation and increase of extreme weather conditions are predicted (Várallyay et al., 2007), which will necessitate the application of irrigation on the orchard. Other parcels showed the presence of target truffle species in 1/3 of the examined root samples which reflects successful initial colonization on the young (4-6 years old) trees. With the application of a proper cultivation technique, spatial distribution of truffle mycorrhizas could be reached. Currently mycorrhiza intensity levels are also low due to the applied low-cost inoculation method, however, effect of favourable orientation can be traced in mycorrhiza intensity and in lower contamination levels. Further study of the plantation could include for instance the spatial and temporal monitoring of the coexistence of the three target truffle species on the level of soil colonization and mycorrhiza levels and the long-term evaluation of an unusual way of plantation establishment technology.

Andrea BALLA KOVÁCS - Marianna SIPOS - Rita KREMPER Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen Böszörményi út 138. Hungary, E-mail:kovacsa@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: A greenhouse pot experiment was carried out to study the effects of bio- and N fertilization on total N, nitrate, calcium and phosphorus content of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Results indicated that total N of lettuce increased significantly with increasing N supply. The application of biofertilizer slightly increased the total N of plants grown on chernosem soil and decreased these values in that plants grown on sandy soil. NO3 -N of lettuce was not increased continuously with N rates and only the highest N doses produced increased NO3 -N values (0.2-0.4%) in plants. At highest N supply, application of Phylazonit MC caused a significant increasing effect on NO3 -N of plants grown in chernosem soil, and inversely caused a decreasing effect on these values in sandy soil. Changes in the calcium content of plant grown in sandy soil showed a statistically significant increasing tendency with increasing nitrogen fertilization. Biofertilizer did not effect on Ca content neither in sandy soil nor in chernosem soil. Increasing N supply and application of biofertilizer resulted in significant decreases in the phosphorus concentrations of plant grown in sandy soil, but there was not significant effect in chernosem soil. The Ca/P ratio significantly increased by N fertilization and biofertilizer application in the case of sandy soil, and there was not significant effect on chernosem soil. Keywords: nitrogen, nitrate, phosphorus, calcium, lettuce Introduction The use of nitrogen fertilizers is standard practice in vegetable production systems. High nitrate concentration in leafy vegetables constitutes a health hazard and is therefore undesirable (E. Nádasy-M. Nádasy, 2006). Applications of biofertilizers may reduce the nitrogen doses and may help to avoid environmental hazards for plants, animals and human beings. Lettuce is an essential salad crop for the diet, it is an important source of vitamins and minerals. Phosphorus and calcium are essential macronutrients in the human diet. It is important not only the concentration of calcium and phosphorus, but also the Ca/P ratio. The higher the phosphorus amount is compared to calcium, the poorer the absorption of calcium is in the body (Florian L. et al. 2005.). The present work was planned to study the effect of biofertilizer, Phylazonit MC in the presence of chemical fertilizers on the nitrogen, nitrate, P, Ca content and Ca/P ratio in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Materials and methods The greenhouse pot experiment was performed on calcareous chernozem soil (1) (from Debrecen-Látókép; pHKCl=5.9; pHH2O=6.7; Hu%=2.5; KA=42) and on acidic sandy soil (2) (from Újfehértó; pHKCl=3.7; pHH2O=4.1; Hu%=1.3; KA=27). 10 kg and 12 kg soil (chernozem soil and sandy soil, respectively) were weighed into Mitscherlich type pots. The experimental plant selected was cabbage head lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Four seed of lettuce were sown in the soil per pot. Ion exchanged water was added to all pots to keep the soil at constant moisture (60% of the waterholding capacity) using daily weighing. The bi-factorial trials were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications, applying three levels of N</p><p id="Pg555">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The applied biofertiliser was Phylazonit MC (phyl). Plant leaves after drying were digested by H2SO4-H2O2 and HNO3-H2O2 methods for P and Ca analysis, respectively. P was determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue colorimetric method, while calcium was quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy. NO3 --N was measured from water extract by ion chromatography (Balláné, 2004), and the total nitrogen analysis was performed by dry combustion method (Nagy P.T., 2000). Analysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance of the treatments.

Kátay et al., 2006). The influence of biofertilization on total N of lettuce grown in chernosem soil was slightly increasing, but not significant. Conversely, the total N of lettuce grown on sandy soil decreased significantly with application of Phylasonit MC. NO3 --N content of lettuce was not increased continuously with N rates, and only the highest N dose (0.2 g pot-1) caused a significant increment of NO3 --N (0.2-0.4 %) of lettuce. Our results indicated that application of 0.2 g pot-1 N increased NO3 --N in plants grown in sandy soil much more than in chernosem soil. At higher N supply, application of Phylazonit MC caused a significant increasing effect on NO3 --N of plants grown on chernosem soil, and inversely caused a decreasing effect on these values on sandy soil. The highest NO3 --N content (in average, 0.4 % NO3 --N DW) was obtained in that plants grown on sandy soil with application of highest N doses, without Phylazonit MC. Nevertheless, these values also were under the maximum acceptable level (4500 mg kg1 NO3 - FW), issued by the EU Community.

H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary, norbert.boros@hotmail.com 2 ABO-Mill Inc., Törökszentmiklós, Hungary 3 Hajdúsági Gabonaipari Inc., Debrecen, Hungary Abstract: In our study we have examined the effect of mineral fertilization on the extensigraph characteristics of wheat-flours. The baking quality of winter wheat is largely determined by variety, but it can be influenced by fertilization. Flours were from 3 varieties grown at six nitrogen fertilizer. The average gluten content of varieties was very different (30.4, 35.8, and 41.7%, respectively). We have found that the extensigraph properties of dough are affected by mineral fertilization, nevertheless, different varieties distinctly react to the increase of the proportions of fertilizer. Based on our investigations, we have come to the conclusion that the application of higher doses of nitrogen fertilizer did not improve the rheological properties of dough samples beyond a certain level. Keywords: extensigraph, winter wheat, mineral fertilization Introduction The rheological characteristics of doughs are determined by the amount and proportion of gliadin and glutenin proteins, and their significance lies in the fact that they affect both the processing ability of the dough and the quality of the end product. Probably the most significant factor in determining the baking quality of winter wheat is the variety, as it primarily accounts for the amount and quality of gluten proteins. However, other factors, such as cropping year, site, mineral fertilization also have considerable importance (Pepó et al., 2005, Győri and Sipos, 2006, Baric et al., 2007, Drezner et al., 2007). The variation in the quality parameters originated in the glutenin subunit composition, in particular, in the balance between the high and low molecular weight subunits (Gupta et al. 1992). Parades-Lopes et al. (1985) found that the dough baking properties can be influenced by nitrogen fertilization. The fertilization has a strong influence not only on yields but also on baking quality and quality stability (Tóth et al., 2006, Pepó, 2007). Nitrogen fertilizer application improved bread making quality of wheat flour, mainly by increasing the quantity of low molecular weight gliadins (Peltonen and Virtanen, 1994). Gupta et al. (1992) found that as the flour protein content increased, the proportion of glutenin remained constant, the proportion of gliadin increased, whereas the proportion of albumin-globulin decreased. Doekes and Wennekes (1982) found that increasing N fertilization increased the ratio of gliadin to glutenin correspondingly. Boehm et al. (2004) analyzed fresh and frozen doughs to determine the effects of nitrogen treatments on frozen storage. Nitrogen treatments had no significant effect on extensigram curve area for fresh and frozen dough samples, and dough qualities remained unchanged with an increase in N fertilization. Scheromm et al. (1992) the composition in glutenin subunits remained unchanged with increasing N fertilizer. Doekes and Wennekes (1982) establishd that in cultivars fertilized with nitrogen only the gliadin content increased. All the flour samples had the same average amounts of albumin and globulin. The glutenin contents were also</p><p id="Pg559">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 560 independent of the total protein contents, but differed among cultivars. Glutenin content proved to be related to both baking quality and grain hardness. Nitrogen treatments consistently had a greater influence than S fertiliser on mixing requirements and extensigraph tests (de Ruiter and Martin, 2001). There were no detectable effects of S treatment without N fertiliser in all farinograph and extensigraph tests on dough properties. Our objective in this investigation was to study the influence of nitrogen fertilization on extensigraph properties. Material and methods Samples are from the Látókép Experimental Site of The University of Debrecen, Centre of Agricultural Sciences. It has calcareous chernozem soil with a 70-90 cm deep humic layer, the humus content 2,8-3 %. The groundwater level is between 6-8 m. This soil has medium level nitrogen and phosphorous and high level potassium supplies The pH measured in KCl is 6.2. In the experiment we applied the following treatments: a control, 30 kg ha-1 nitrogen, 22.5 kg ha-1 P2O5 and 26.5 kg ha -1 K2O and the double, threefold, fourfold and fivefold amount of these doses in four repetitions. Three winter wheat varieties were investigated from 2006. In total, 87 flour samples were analyzed for extesigraph properties. Mean flour protein contents of cultivars (GK-Öthalom, Lupus, Saturnus) were 12.6, 14.4, and 16.2%, respectively. The average gluten content of cultivars were very different (30.4, 35.8, and 41.7%, respectively), as well. Dough properties were determined by the Brabender Extensigraph according to Approved Method 54-10 (AACC International 2000) after a 135-minute rest period. The gluten content was determined by Perten Glutomatic. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS 11.0 statistical software. Oneway ANOVA was used to analyze data to ascertain whether the fertilization significantly affected the rheological properties of dough. Results and discussion Mineral fertilization improved significantly the extensigraph properties of GK-Öthalom (Figure 1). All the extensiograph values were measured as smallest in the control group: we found that the values were higher with each fertilization level than that of the control group (123 mm, 107 BU, 117 BU, and 20 mm, P&lt;0,05). It was observable, however, that with the increase of the fertilizer doses, the rheological properties of the dough samples did not alter. We established that as the nitrogen doses increased the dough properties did not improve. No significant discrepancies were discovered between the various fertilization levels. Along with the increase of the level of fertilization, the extensibility of the dough samples of Lupus improved. However, the resistance to extension decreased in a small compass, which was most apparent in the two highest levels of fertilization (109 and 115 BU) as compared to the control group (145 BU). The area under the curve, similarly to resistance to extension (R5) and maximum resistance (Rmax), somewhat decreased with the application of larger portions of fertilizer.</p><p id="Pg560">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 561 The extensigraph properties of Saturnus at the first and second levels of fertilization improved as compared to the control group. Following this, however, decline could be observed in all examined properties with increasing the portions of fertilizer. Dough extensibility was lower with 3rd and 4th level of fertilization than with the control group (130, 128, and 147 mm, respectively). This tendency was even more remarkable in the properties of resistance to extension maximum resistance, and the area under the curve. 0,0 20,0 40,0 60,0 80,0 100,0 GK-Öthalom Lupus Saturnus A re a , c m 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 GK-Öthalom Lupus Saturnus R e s is ta n c e t o e x te n s io n , B U 0 1 2 3 4 5 0,0 20,0 40,0 60,0 80,0 100,0 GK-Öthalom Lupus Saturnus E x te n s ib ili ty , m m 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 100 200 300 400 500 GK-Öthalom Lupus Saturnus M a x im u m r e s is ta n c e , B U 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 1. The extensigraph properties of the examineted varieties at different fertilization level in 2006 Conclusions Based on our examinations, we have established that the extensigraph properties of dough are affected by mineral fertilization. However, we have observed that various varieties very much distinctly react to increasing the portions of fertilizer. The three varieties under our examination had different levels of protein and gluten content. The GK-Öthalom was characterized by excellent extensigraph properties on each level of fertilization, regardless of the applied fertilizer doses. The extensibility of Lupus improved, but its other properties declined with the increase of the level of fertilization. At Saturnus we have come to the conclusion that improvement was observable only on lower fertilization levels; the further increasing of fertilizer portions did not improve, but deteriorated the values of the examined parameters. The data presented are for a set of cultivars grown at one location in one year, it could be very interesting to continue these examinations on different cropping years and sites.</p><p id="Pg561">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Box 32., Hungary 3 Plant Ecology Research Group of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szent István University, H-2103, Gödöllő, Páter K. u. 1, Hungary Abstract: Significant carbon losses from temperate grasslands on different soils may occur due to interannual variations in microclimatic patterns most notably due to increased drought and heat stress extremities. The investigated grassland ecosystems can take up 186 gC m -2 year -1 or loose 73 gC m -2 year -1 depending on the precipitation supply and temperature. Increasing frequency of the above extremities on annual scale, also means that the region is among the vulnerable ones in terms of soil carbon loss and therefore potential occurrence of latent desertification. In addition to the micrometeorological factors the soil type have a great effect on the carbon balance of grasslands, due to greatly differing amount of precipitation needed to reach the field capacity ranges on the sandy and on the heavy clay soil, respectively. Keywords: grassland, eddy covariance, NEE Introduction Carbon balance of ecosystems are under climatic constraints with significant carbon losses occurring during droughts (Nagy et al., 2007). Long term eddy covariance measurements over grasslands have been conducted to characterize the interannual variability of the C-balance of grasslands on different soil types in Hungary (Barcza et al., 2003, Nagy et al., 2007). While the grasslands were sink for carbon in their majority of the study years on annual basis, droughts have been shown to turn these ecosystems into net source of carbon (Nagy et al., 2007). While the origin (age) of the lost carbon was not directly identified, the length of the source activity periods suggest this carbon arose from older soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. This, in addition to the potential possibility of the positive feedback between climate warming and carbon loss from ecosystems on global scale, may lead to latent desertification process locally, when decrease of SOM content will lead to decreased productivity of these soils (Urmos et al, 2007.). Studying this process is crucial in assessing the potential future impacts of climate change on the potential desertification process through loss of soil carbon and call the attention to revisit the cost-benefit problem of irrigation. Materials and methods The carbon balance of grasslands is investigated at three research sites in Hungary, situated in the north western part of the country near Hegyhátsál (Barcza et al., 2003), in the central region, in Kiskunság National Park (near Bugacpuszta), and the north eastern region in Mátra Mountains near Szurdokpüspöki. The measurements at the latter two sites are in the scope of this paper. The study site Bugacpuszta is situated in a temperate semidesert climate area covered by special sand grassland vegetation (Fekete et al., 1988). The measurements at Bugacpuszta (46.69°N, 19.60°E, 111.4 m a.s.l.) have been started in July, 2002 and are run since then continuously. In this region the soil type is sandy chernozem, and the</p><p id="Pg563">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 564 characteristic plant species are Festuca pseudovina Hack. ex Wiesb., Carex stenophylla Wahlbg. and Salvia pratensis L. At the other study site, near Szurdokpüspöki (47.85°N, 19.73°E, 300 m a.s.l.), the experimental tower was set up in June, 2003. The soil type of the meadow is heavy clay, brown forest soil, and the main grass component is Festuca rupicola Heuff. The turbulent exchange of sensible and latent heat and CO2 is determined at both sites by eddy covariance technique, which is a direct measurement of fluxes that uses high frequency measurements of vertical component of the wind speed and scalars (temperature, water vapour and CO2). The methodology of flux calculations and gapfilling is discussed widely in literature, the exact methods and corrections used in our study are described in Nagy et al., 2007. With this technique the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) can be measured, and further calculations are necessary to separate NEE into its components ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) which is done after Reichstein et al, 2005. Besides the flux measurements additional micrometeorological variables (wind speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, precipitation, direct and reflected global radiation, net radiation, direct and reflected photosynthetically active photon flux density, soil heat flux, soil temperature and moisture) are measured at both sites. Results and discussion In the region of Bugacpuszta site the mean annual (10 years average) temperature and sum of precipitation are 10.4°C and 562 mm, respectively. The microclimate at the mountain site is slightly different from the previous one, the mean annual temperature is 10.2°C and the annual sum of precipitation is 622 mm. Variations of microclimatic parameters during the last six years are presented in Table 1. Figure 1. Cumulated sum of precipitation (CP) at Bugacpuszta (left) and at Szurdokpüspöki (right) from 2002 until 2007 compared to the 10-years mean of the corresponding area There is about 270 and 230 mm difference between the amount of precipitation in the most dry and most wet year (Fig. 1.) at Bugacpuszta and Szurdokpüspöki, respectively. The sum of precipitation was less than the 10 years mean in 2002, 2003 and 2007 at Bugacpuszta and in 2003 and 2007 at Szurdokpüspöki. The annual mean temperature ranges from 9.2°C to 11.1°C at Bugacpuszta and from 9.7°C to 11.6°C at Szurdokpüspöki, being 2007 the hottest year (Table 1.). In summer, 2003 positive temperature anomalies (Fig. 2.) were joined to the lack of precipitation, causing a serious heat wave, while in 2007 the monthly mean temperatures were constantly above the mean in the first half of the year.</p><p id="Pg564">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 565 Figure 2. Monthly mean avereges at Bugacpuszta (left) and at Szurdokpüspöki (right) from 2002 until 2007 compared to the 10-years mean of the corresponding area The NEE is strongly linked to the micrometeorological conditions. According to the diverse precipitation and temperature circumstances the annual sum of NEE varies between wide range (Table 1.). The different source and sink periods of vegetation can be distinguished clearly on the cumulated NEE curves (Fig. 3.). The interannual variation of precipitation and temperature has a great effect on the occurrence and length of these periods. In winter the curves are usually ascending because the dominance of degradation processes. The year 2006 was an exception since due to the wet and gentle conditions at the previous autumn, the grass was not completely dried out, and its slight CO2 uptake balanced the CO2 release by ecosystem respiration. The vegetation usually starts to grow around the middle of March, so the daily carbon balance turns into negative, the cumulative curve starts to descend. Depending on the weather conditions the length of this main growing period can differ, in was the longest in 2004 (100 days), and the shortest in 2005 (59 days). After this intensive growth period, usually in the middle of June the vegetation turns into being net CO2 source on daily basis (loss of carbon). In early autumn a regrowth period may (or may not) start depending on precipitation supply. In 2003 the effect of heat wave was so strong that the vegetation had not taken up more CO2 after July until the end of the year. In 2007 the character of the CO2 balance of this grasslands differ noticeably from the other ones. The unusually warm and dry conditions in the main growing season caused the vegetation to fix only a small amount of CO2, but release a considerably amount during the drought. The assimilation activity during the secondary growing season in September, 2007 was not strong enough to turn the grassland to carbon sink on yearly basis. Figure 3. Cumulated sum of NEE at Bugacpuszta (left) and Szurdokpüspöki (right) between 2003 and 2007 The intensity of carbon uptake in favourable conditions, and the occurrence of secondary growing period differs at the two sites markedly, which is caused partly by</p><p id="Pg565">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 566 the slight differences on micometeorological conditions and partly by the difference in soil properties. Sand at Bugacpuszta can take up and store even smaller amount of water, while heavy clay soil at Szurdokpüspöki needs more precipitation to increase its soil water content (Hagyó et al., 2006).

Depending on the precipitation supply and temperature conditions the same grass ecosystem can be a sink with strength of 186 gC m-2year-1 or loose 73 gC m-2year-1. Largely different precipitation sums are needed to reach the field capacity on light sand and heavy clay soils, respectively. For this reason, the soil texture significantly influences the carbon balance of ecosystems through soil water content. This picture is also verified by the fact, that the sandy grassland's sink activity was generally stronger than that of the grassland on heavy clay soil, in spite of the former receiving less precipitation on annual basis.

Abstract: The initial plant succession, primary community of gravel lakes are hardly in researching sphere in Central Europe. In the first stage, these lakes are infrequent especially without any human caused exterior effect. We have been measuring the vegetations of two gravel lakes for six months. We did vegetation survey and have researched some characteristic points from the littoral region to profoundal region. By our results in the first step of succession few algae species, especially Chara sp. appeared. We found Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton natans in different dominance and pattern after the first succession stage. The depth was not a limiting factor for the flora only for a few species. The Chara sp. seems to be successful under low competition pressure, especially in deeper regions where they grow in monospecific carpets. Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton natans and Ceratophyllum demersum can grow together in great variability of presence-absence and abundance-dominance. Keywords: Plant succession, aquatic plant, gravel lake. Introduction This paper presents a previous examination of the aquatic succession. Plenty of research are engaged in the succession at an advanced stage (Nagy et al. 2006). The initial plant successions of gravel mining lakes were hardly researched in Hungary. We do not have enough data from the pioneer association, members of flora that populate unused gravel lakes.The building industry has opened lots of mines and the holes have filled up with ground water. We have researched the new lakes that are under mining treatment. Water of these lakes has no organically charge and human chemical pollution (Rabnecz et al. 2007). In spite of the inhabitants possessing the areas these lakes are oligotrophic. We have searched lakes without incoming surface water. The rainfall and the ground water are the only way to fill up these territories. Accordingly these aquatic habitats are in the initial stage of succession. However, new gravel lakes are perfect territory for this investigation. We have studied two gravel lakes of the same size and we took them as individual regions. Their flora was dissimilar to the aged lakes and oxbows (Gál et al. 2007, Szirmai et al. 2007). We have been researching this area for six months. There is a road between the lakes which is like an artificial barrier. These lakes never had mutual connection or incoming surface water. For this reason the living creatures could not invade them directly. The plants and animals are absent from the ground water except for a few algae species. The organical substance and solute oxygen contents of the subsoil water are low. Therefore the new lakes are sterile, recent habitats. The aged aquatic areas haven’t got same low vegetation values (Cserhalmi et al, 2007, Nagy et al. 2007). Although the mining regulation binds over the recultivation of the littoral zone generally the companies disinvest it. In the lakes the pelagic, profundal and littoral regions can be easily found and we have investigated them. We have been scanning two other mining lakes with huge human chemical and ecological balance for six months. We could measure the human effects in the control areas. Every lake has different parts where we found unsimilar steps of the succession.</p><p id="Pg567">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 568 The abiotic factors have effects on structures and patterns of vegetations and on dominance of plant Materials and Methods When we selected the investigated territories, the most important factor was the lowest ecological balance. The shifted lakes, Golem and Debrecen, can be found in the northeastern part of Hungary, neighbouring Miskolc. Both lakes which are of the same size have been studied. In that field were dominated by arable-lands and meadows before the industry broke the ground. The companies have been working mines in the vicinity since 1950 which have prepared lots of different sized ponds already. Lake Debrecen and Lake Golem are neighbours without connection. We made botanical surveys on different points of the beds. The experiment started in the beginning of October. Coenological samples were used for the description of vegetation. We have taken samples from one hundred different points. We used the Braun-Blanquet method (Braun-Blanquet, 1951). In the sample plots cover was estimated species by species on a percentage scale. The size of the sampling plots was one square meters (quadrate). The nomenclature of the species follows Simon (2000). We took soundings with every quadrate and registered the highest and the bottommost values. We used digital bathometer (Scubapro). We registered the data forthwith and used scuba diver equipment. We studied the association ability of the aquatic plants. We processed the data by Excel 2003 and analyzed it with the Syn-tax 5.0 programme (Podani 1993). We used ordering analyses and plotted the 3-dimensional figure in 2 dimensions. Results and Discussion Four aquatic plants and few algae species were described from the two lakes. We found Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton natans, Ceratophyllum demersum and Chara sp. One of them, the Ceratophyllum demersum, was found only in Lake Golem. The results presented that Myriophyllum spicatum could get implicated with the populations of Potamogeton natans and Ceratophyllum demersum (1.co-ordinate). This species has the highest density in the littoral. The cover of Potamogeton natans was not higher than 20 percentages and this species lived in mixed community with Myriophyllum spicatum . It lived with Ceratophyllum demersum in Golem-lake (10. point - 2. co-ordinate). We found the Ceratophyllum demersum only in Lake Golem in a mingled community with Myriophyllum spicatum, too (9., 16., 18.points - 3. co-ordinate) . The association ability of the Chara sp. was low (points on 4. co-ordinate). This species colonized the deeper zones from 3 metres but never with other plants. We represented the species as coordinates and the sample quadtrate as numbers of points. (Fig.1.).</p><p id="Pg568">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 569 Figure 1. Ordination for four species of gravel lake. 1: Myriophyllum spicatum, 2: Potamogeton natans, 3: Ceratophyllum demersum, 4: Chara sp The fieldwork observations showed us that the first step of the succession was when the algae and Chara sp. appeared. Secondly the littoral area became invaded by Myriophyllum spicatum and it displaced the Chara sp. In this time the Myriophyllum spicatum was dominant on higher parts of the bed and in the littoral zone but the deepest region colonized by Chara sp. Chara sp. populations were autocrats but Myriophyllum spicatum might drive them out in a longer period. Every lake had same old parts where we found unsimilar steps of succession. Probably the quality of substrate, inclination of substrate, stream of water (period, aperiod movement), and the abyss are important abiotic factors for inhabited vegetation. If the inclination of the substrate is not vertical, it will not prevent the establishment of aquatic plants. If gravel mine lakes do not get recultivation, they will really have a strait littoral zone. The waves detain the plants from taking into possession in this area when it is on direction of wind (upper 0.5m zone). The plants colonized the outermost littoral zone in calm area. Usually the depth didn’t restrict the vegetations. Light is able to reach the bottom of the water in clear gravel lakes and Myriophyllum spicatum, Chara sp. could utilize it. Conclusion The investigated two lakes were in the pioneer stage of the succession. Out of the four studied species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton natans, Ceratophyllum demersum and the Chara sp.) the Myriophyllum spicatum was dominant in the littoral region lived in mingled population with the Potamogeton natans in both of lakes. They grew with Ceratophyllum demersum in the Golem-lake too. The Chara sp. colonized the profundal zones.

E-mail: kincsesi@agr.unideb.hu. 2 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest Abstract: A pot experiment was carried out to investigate effect of N fertilizer and biofertilizer on parsley (Petroselinum tuberosum) yield and N, P, K, Ca and Mg content. Two soils were used, one of them is a chernozem with slightly acidic pH and with high content of organic matter, and the other one is an acidic sandy soil with low organic matter content. On chernozem, the N fertilization significantly increased the yield of plant, while there was no significant biofertilizer effect. On sandy soil, the dry matter of plants increased with increasing N doses comparing to control, but no correlation has been found between biofertilization and dry matter weight. The N fertilization increased the N content of parsley, however, no relationship was found between N content and biofertilization rate in chernozem soil. In case of the sandy soil, there was a statistically confirmed N fertilization effect on plant N concentrations. The P content of parsley was enhanced by both N fertilization and biofertilization on the chernozem soil. With increasing of N doses P content decreased significantly, while application of biofertilizers caused no any change in P concentrations. For both soils, both N fertilization and biofertilization has no effects on parsley K content. Keywords: N fertilization, biofertilization, parsley, pot experiment, plant N, P, K, Ca, Mg content Introduction In horticulture cropping, the main goal is to reach appropriate quality and quantity of crops, which are mainly determined by genetics parameters of plants, ecological circumstances and the nutrient status of soil. Application of chemical fertilizers may cause soil acidification that can modify not only the amount of available elements, but the biological condition of soil (Chander and Abrol, 1972; Felizardo et al., 1972; Kádár et al. 2007; Kátai et al., 2006). To decrease the harmful effects of fertilization, farmers are trying to decrease the amount of chemicals, and to substitute that to manure or biofertilizers, which are permitted in biofarming. In biofarming, the sustainability and improving of soil fertility plays the greatest role (Aubert, 1981; Kátai, 1999, 2006; Makádi et al. 2007; Nagy and Holb, 2006; Veres, 2007; Zsuposné, 2007). Our experimental data can be used, in the main objective of crop production, for improvement of environmental protection, and the site-specific fertilization. Materials and methods The experiment was carried out with parsley in spring of 2006 with 12 treatments and 4 replications at the Experimental Site of Debrecen University. Soils used were from Latókép (calcouorus chernozem) and Újfehértó (acid arenosol). Important parameters of soils are the followings: Látókép: pH (H2O): 6.7; pH (KCl): 5.9; pH (CaCl2): 6.23; Humus (%): 2.5; KA: 42; Újfehértó: pH (H2O): 4.1; pH (KCl): 3.7; pH (CaCl2): 4.81; Humus (%): 1.3; KA: 27; 10 kg of Látókép and 12 kg of Újfehértó soil was dispensed to pots. The N, P and K treatments were added as NH4NO3, KH2PO4 and KCl solution. The amount of applied biofertilizer was in accordance with the prescribed volume and two times of that.</p><p id="Pg571">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Besides plant biomass, the P, K, Ca and Mg content was determined from parsley leaf by digestion with cc. HNO3 and N was measured by dry combustion method (Nagy, 2000). We would like to get information about dry matter and N, P, K, Ca, Mg content of parsley in an experiment in which was used low dose of N fertilizers and biofertilizers. The experiment was set up two different soils, one of them (a chernozem soil) is a slightly acidic soil that has good N supply and high content of humus, and while another one (acidic sand soil) is an acidic soil that has poor N supply and low content of humus. Results and discussion Adding of N fertilizers to soils significantly increased dry weight of plant. Although there were no significant increases in dry weight after biofertilization, a clear trend has been displayed (Table 2). Relationship between biofertilizer rates and N content show a very similar trend like in case of dry matter content of parsley: at high rates of N, the biofertilization gave an increase in N concentration of plant, while at lower doses just the opposite was noticed (Table 3). The N fertilization increased the N content of parsley, however, no relationship was found between N content and biofertilization rate in chernozem soil. In case of the sandy soil, there was a statistically confirmed N fertilization effect on plant N concentrations (Table 3).</p><p id="Pg572">VII.

On the chernozem soil, P content of parsley was enhanced by both N fertilization and biofertilization. With increasing of N doses P content decreased significantly, while application of biofertilizers caused no change in P concentrations. For both soils, both N fertilization and biofertilization have no effects on parsley K content. Ca content of the test plant was no modified by treatments on the chernozem; whilst on the sandy soil it was declined by biofertilization. N fertilization increased Mg content only on sandy soil.

Because the chernozem soil has a great ability to maintain proper conditions for microorganisms, the biofertilization only increased the P content of parsley. On the sandy soil that have poor N supply and have much less power to give ideal environment for microorganisms than chernozem, adding of N fertilizers have a positive effect on parsley dry weight, N and Ca and Mg content. Surprisingly, the dry matter, N and Ca content of plant was no increased by biofertilization, but there was a significant negative effect on those parameters.

Gundulića 36b 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Speeding industrial development causes hurried life style as well as unstoppable energy consumption increase. During last years of 20th century in all developed countries raised awareness of limited amounts of major energy sources (fossil fuels), and attention is now directed to finding other energy sources. European Union emphasises production of alternative energy sources, like: methane, biogas, bio-diesel, bioethanol, liquid biomass, liquid gas and hydrogen. By utilizing organic waste from agricultural production for energy production, it is possible to gain profit and preserve environment. Sugar beet leaves and heads stay on plough-land during sugar beet root extraction and present great biomass potential that can be used for biogas production. Keywords: Sugar beet tops, biogas, swinish manure Introduction Sugar beet is an important agricultural crop, economically interesting because of a possibility for high yield achievement. According to literature data, sugar beet yields amount to 40-90 t/ha and more (Ungai, 2007). Pospišil (2006) in his research investigated production of 42 sugar beet hybrids and obtained results showed yield ranging from 61 t/ha to record number of 101.54 t/ha. The highest root yield (101.54 t/ha) had hybrid impact. Almost the same yield, over 100 t/ha, had hybrids SES 2371, H 46705, Georgina and Europe. Weather conditions (year) have significant influence on yield and technological quality of sugar beet, what became evident when using the same hybrids through out the years of research done by Pospišil (1999). Beside basic sugar production, sugar beet by-products are dry or wet sugar beet noodles, molasses, saturation slough and about 60% of green mass that consists of sugar beet leaves and heads. Leaves and heads have been used as cattle feed, but today it stays on arable land as green fertilization. Due to energy crises in the world, sugar beet becomes more and more interesting energy crop for bio-fuel production (Szakal, 2007). Materials and methods Fresh piggish manure was used with addition of 20, 40 and 80% of ensilaged sugar beet heads (R20, R40 and R80), and Control group (K) was piggish manure without additions. All groups were set up in 3 replications. Anaerobic fermentation process proceeded discontinuously in mesophilic conditions (40¨C) with retention time lasting 60 days. Dry matter content (DM) was determined by drying 100 g of fresh manure matter in a drier at 75¨C until reaching constant mass (Thompson, 2001). Total content of ashes and organic matter was determined by heating at 550¨C during two hours (Thompson, 2001). Produced biogas was collected through saturated solution in submerged graduated containers and amount of biogas was determined on daily basis. Produced biogas was analysed with gas chromatograph Varian 3900 according to modified method HRN ISO 6974-4:2000. Share of N, CO2, and CH4 was determined</p><p id="Pg575">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 576 by gas chromatography. Statistical analysis was done with ANOVA (post hoc Dunnet T3 and post hoc Bonferroni). Significance was determined at level p&lt;0.05. Programming system SAS for Windows was used. Results and discussion Dry matter content in piggish manure was 2.46%, and DM content in ensilaged sugar beet leaves and heads was 19.74%. Ensilaged sugar beet leaves and heads were added to piggish manure in proportions 4:1 for group R20, 3:2 for group R40 and 1:4 for group R80. Control group was piggish manure without additions of ensilaged sugar beet leaves and heads. Determined DM content in experimental substrata is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Amount of drymatter, organic matter and pH Substrate type Dray matter (%) Organic matter (%) pH Control 2,46 70,56 8,16 R20 3,94 80,48 7,92 R40 7,64 83,88 5,55 R80 15,4 86,55 3,86 Determined DM concentration in piggish manure was 2.46%, which is similar to research results of Benčević (1993), who reported DM concentration of 2.6% in manure from collecting pits. Significant differences in organic matter content were determined between Control group and R20 (ANOVA, p=0.013), between Control group and R40 (ANOVA, p=0.009) and between Control group and R80 (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001). Organic matter comparison between experimental groups showed significant difference between R20 and R80 (ANOVA, p=0.04), while R20 and R40 did not show significant difference. High organic matter content is important for development of methanogenic microorganisms. Anaerobic biomass degradation includes bacterial degradation, which has three basic stages: hydrolysis phase, acid phase and methanogenic phase. During hydrolysis phase, enzymes degrade large molecules to smaller ones that can pass through bacterial membranes. During acid phase, complex molecules such as proteins, fat and carbohydrates, are degraded by bacteria to organic acids, CO2, hydrogen and ammonia in acid medium. Finally in the last stage, methane is produced, partially from CO2 and hydrogen, but mostly from acid and alcohol fermentation. In biogas production plant all stages proceed simultaneously, and domination of one stage significantly decreases methane production. If pH concentration is low, methanogenic phase will not develop. Biro (2007) reported optimal pH concentration to be 7.2. Thus, biogas formation dynamics depends on proper development of all anaerobic fermentation stages. Daily biogas production is shown in Figure 1.</p><p id="Pg576">VII.

Biogas production dynamics during anaerobic fermentation In the beginning of fermentation, microbial activity is high, but after oxygen consumption hydrolytic phase transforms into acidogenic phase. It can be seen from the graph that methanogenic microorganism activity rises first in the Control group around day 11. In the beginning of experiment, pH reaction in Control group was mildly alkaline, which facilitated transition from acidogenic phase to methanogenic phase. In experimental group R20 transition from acidogenic phase to methanogenic phase happened after day 31 of anaerobic fermentation process. Due to high acidity in groups R40 and R80, methanogenic phase did not develop in full extent. Total biogas production during retention time of 60 days is shown in Figure 2. 0 5.000 10.000 15.000 20.000 25.000 Control R 20 R 40 R 80 Figure 2. Average total biogas production Using ANOVA with Post Hoc Bonferroni test, significant difference was determined in the amount of produced biogas when comparing Control with R20 (p&lt;0.001), Control with R80 (p&lt;0.001), R20 with R40 (p&lt;0.001), R20 with R80 (p&lt;0.001) and R40 with R80 (p=0.04). The highest biogas production of 21493.33 ml was determined in group R20, and Control group produced 10273.33 ml of biogas. Group R40 produced 6223.33 ml of biogas, and group R80 produced 1723.33 ml of biogas. Results show that substratum R20 produced 109,21% more biogas than Control group, 71.04% more biogas than group R40 and 91.98% more biogas than group R80. Recalculating biogas production per 1 kg of DM, it turns out that 1 kg of sugar beet leaves and heads silage can produce 0.55 m3 of biogas. In comparison to literature data, higher biogas production was obtained. In his research Svensson (2007) reported biogas production from sugar beet in range from 0.31-0.36 m3/kg of DM. Lehtomäki (2007) added sugar beet leaves and heads to bovine manure and produced 213 - 268 of biogas per 1 kg of DM, but with retention time of 20 days. If we take into account sugar beet production of</p><p id="Pg577">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 578 60 t/ha annually, with 60% of biomass remnants, that leaves us around 36 t/ha or 7.1 t/ha of DM annually. Utilization of sugar beet biomass remnants could produce 3905 m3/ha of biogas annually. Concentration of particular gases in produced biogas is shown in Figure 3. High methane concentration in produced biogas was determined in experimental group R20, in amount of 70.23%. Control group had methane concentration of 67.92% in produced biogas. Biogas from group R40 had methane concentration of 6.4%, and in group R80 methane was not detected, what proves that methanogenesis did not occur due to high acidity. 0 20 40 60 80 100 Control R 20 R 40 R 80 N CH4 CO2 Figure 3. Share of nitrogen, methane and CO2 in produced biogas (%). Biogas production out of biomass remnants from sugar beet production takes place in biogas production plants that should exist as a part of sugar refinery or a large farm. Economically, biomass transport at distances greater than 30 km is not profitable. Conclusions Utilization of sugar beet biomass remnants could produce 3905 m3/ha of biogas annually, with methane concentration of 70.23%. Biogas production would reduce our dependence on other countries, increase employment and Republic Croatia would more easily fulfil its commitment to EU in replacing conventional fuels with renewable resources.

Term energy crop includes crops that can be processed using different technologies in order to obtain different energygenerating bioproducts, such as: biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas and biomass for incineration. Correct management and better exploitation of existing land resources, as well as introduction and development of new crops makes possible higher production of plant organic material for processing and production of energy-generating bioproducts. In biogas production, biogas production plants work continuously throughout the year without stopping. To insure that, it is necessary to provide enough organic material in quality and quantity, which will be converted into biogas in production plants. Due to its distinctly high green mass yield, Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense L.) becomes interesting crop that can replace silage maize in biogas production plants. Sudan grass is an annual high grass, which gives exceptionally high green mass yields that can be used as green forage, haylage or silage. Due to its late sowing period, it is suitable as stubble crop. In conducted research, obtained Sudan grass yield amounted to 82 t/ha. Due to its high yield it is possible to obtain the same amount of silage using only 60% of land we used for maize silage production. Keywords: Sudan grass, maize silage, energy crop, biomass, biogas Introduction Sudan grass is a hybrid with an excellent resistance to aridity, high percentage of green mass, the plant that some consider as separate species and it has been used as livestock feed. This annual plant doesn't have rhizome and in our conditions it doesn't have a possibility of hibernation. In new hybrids crossing had reduced the amount of durin (glycoside which can cause digestion problems in livestock) three and more times, so there is almost none of it in green mass higher than 80 cm. It is also more resistant to aridity, diseases and parasites than maize and especially to wireworms. Sorghum has high demands for warm conditions. Temperature of 12ºC and for some hybrids even higher is needed for germination, which increases with the temperature increase. Optimal temperature for growth and maturation is 25ºC and higher, so in autumn with temperature under 12ºC its growth is much slower and temperature under -2ºC destroys it. In respect to soil it has less demands than maize and it grows on any type of soil from arid and sandy to highly weathered soils. It needs less moisture than maize. The sowing of fodder sorghum is done in the beginning of May, and when used as a secondary crop - sowing is done at the end of May or in June, and as a stubble crop it is sown on stubble cereals or rape. The norm of sowing is 30 -33 kg/ha. The depth of sowing is 3-6 cm. Materials and methods The fresh piggish manure has been used. In the first experimental group 10 % of maize silage was added (KS) to manure and in the second 10 % of Sudan grass (ST) was</p><p id="Pg579">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 580 added to piggish manure. Control group was piggish manure alone. All three groups were set up in three replicates. Process of anaerobic fermentation proceeded discontinuously in mesophilic conditions (40ºC) with retention time lasting 60 days. Content of dry matter was determined by drying 100g of fresh manure at 75ºC till reaching constant mass (Thompson, 2001). Total amounts of ashes and organic matter were determined by heating at 550ºC for two hours (Thompson, 2001). Produced biogas was collected through saturated solution in submerged graduated containers and the amount of gas was determined daily. Amount of N, CO2 and CH4 in produced gas was determined with gas chromatograph Varian 3900 according to modified HRN ISO 6974-4:2000. Group comparison was done using Mann-Whitney U test (post hoc Bonferroni). Significance was expressed at level p&lt; 0,05. Program SAS for Windows was used. Results and discussion Crop that is interesting for biomass production is Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense L). Field in village Jagodnjak, in county Osječko-baranjska was selected for the experiment, with the size of 1870 m2. Four- row drill OLT PSK-4 was used for sowing. The seed was sown with spacing of 70 cm and distance between plants was 5-7 cm. Seed was sown as stubble crop after barley on 6th of June in 2007, using four kilograms of SuSu seed, manufactured by Sjeme, Zagreb. Yield was determined after mowing 3 m2 on three different locations. Mass, number of plants and plant height was determined. Harvest was done 75 days after sowing. Average plant height was 206 cm, which is 20 cm higher than results obtained by Bhatta (Bhatta, 2006). It took 74.4 days from germination stage to panicle stage, which is 2,3 days earlier than standard. Resistance to lodging (grade 1-9) was 7.2, which is 0,1 higher than standard. According to average research results, Sudan grass would yield 82 t/ha, in extremely arid year. Manure utilization for energy production has multiple ecological benefits like: prevention of greenhouse effect (Kirova et al., 2004.), solving the problem of animal waste management (Juhász et al. 2006.), economical – extra profit and social – employment increase. In case of low dry matter content of manure (less than 6%) production of biogas is not profitable. Increase of dry matter content is possible by adding biomass with higher DM concentration like maize silage or other stubble crops e.g. Sudan grass. Fresh piggish manure with 10% of maize silage (KS) and experimental group with 10% of Sudan grass (ST) was used in the experiment. Control group (KG) was piggish manure without additions. Determined content of dry matter in piggish manure was 2,2%, which is similar to research results of Benčević (1993), who reported dry matter content in manure from collection pits of 2,6%. Dry matter content in Sudan grass was 20.47%, and according to Fribourg (1985) it was 15-20 kg/ha. Dry matter content in maize silage was 28,15%, and Robowsky (1997) reported dry matter content from 28 to 33%. Proportion of piggish manure and Sudan grass was 9:1, and the same was for manure and maize silage. Determined contents in prepared experimental groups are shown in Table 2.</p><p id="Pg580">VII.

The highest production of biogas was with substrate with addition of maize silage with average total production of 18.333 ml/l, followed by ST substrate type with 13.720 ml/l, and lowest production was observed in control group (Figure 1.). 9.320 13.720 18.333 Control Sudan grass Maize silage Figure 1.

In substrate with added KS, production of biogas was 33,6% higher than production of substrate with added ST. On the other hand, content of dry matter in KS was 16% higher. When obtained results are compared to literature than it is, as Bernik et al. (2006.) states, possible to produce 0,45m3 of biogas per 1 kg of dry matter from Sudan grass, and according to Beck (1997) and Dublić (1986) it is possible to obtain 0,41m3 of biogas per 1 kg of dry matter from maize silage. When we recalculate obtained results per 1 kg of dry matter, KS can produce 0,38m3 of biogas from 1 kg of DM, and ST can produce 0,45 m3 of biogas from 1 kg of DM, what is consistent with literature. With usage of Sudan grass it is possible to produce yield of 80 to 100 t/ha, while the yield of silage maize is 30 to 35 t/ha (Bernika 2006), from which is visible that is possible to achieve same biomass production using three times smaller areas. Biogas is a mixture of gases whose main compounds are methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), nitrogen (N2) and ammonia (NH3) in traces. Bukvić (2007.) states that according to different author's concentration of methane in biogas ranges from 40% to 70%. Composition of gas obtained during research is shown in Figure 3. Concentration of methane is within limits characteristic for biogas, and differences in methane concentration are not substantial and statistically significant.</p><p id="Pg581">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Percentage of nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide in biogas (%) Conclusions Obtained yield of Sudan grass of 82 t/ha in extremely unfavourable arid conditions can be considered as good yield. Production of Sudan grass will not jeopardize food production and livestock corps because it yields higher biomass than maize and it is also good crop for stubble conditions. It is proved that usage of Sudan grass for improvement of manure properties with the aim of biogas production increase, increases biogas amount by 32%. Significant differences in methane concentrations between groups weren’t determined, in other words addition of biomass doesn’t jeopardize energetic quality of biogas. Biogas production plant ensures environment protection and technological solution for slurry and organic manure waste management and unused waste is transformed into efficient energy, which reduces import costs of energy and oil derivates.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek,Croatia 2 Faculty of Food Technology, University J.J.Strossmayer, Kuhačeva 18, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: This research investigated efficiency of different amounts of earthworm humus lumbripost (1-8 t ha -1 ) and its combinations with NPK mineral fertilizers in sunflower production, in respect to dominant physiological groups of soil microorganisms (aminoheterotrophs and aminoautotrophs). Research was done on semigley loess type of soil in 12 fertilization variants. Application of this organic fertilizer in sunflower production had significant positive effect on aminoheterotrophic and aminoautotrophic soil microflora in amount of 8 t ha -1 of pure lumbripost and in organic-mineral combination of 3 t ha -1 of lumbripost + NPK mineral fertilization. These variants showed that application of pure lumbripost had positive effect on sunflower grain yield. Application of lumbripost (3-5 t ha -1 ) combined with NPK mineral fertilizer yielded over 4500 kg ha -1 of sunflower grains. Keywords: soil, lumbripost, microorganisms, yield, sunflower Introduction Significant reduction of farm manure utilization in crop production of Republic Croatia, in such extent that we can speak of total elimination, has incalculable repercussions on soil fertility. Considering manure production in our country, every plot could be fertilized every 20-30 years. Consequently, on one side we have arable land «hungry» for organic fertilizers, mainly manure, as an acute agricultural problem, and on the other side manure management on stockbreeding farms presents major ecological problem (Milaković et al., 2003; Kralik et al., 2007). Soils are conditionally renewable natural resources (Várallyay, 2007). In order to improve both the quantity and the quality of yields, we must acquire a complex ecological attitude and a more rational use of natural resources (Hunyadi-Borbély et al., 2007). Soil obtains productive potential through mineral fertilization, but only to a certain extent. The question is how much longer can soil take this «doping» that is increasing year after year and that diminishes chances for spontaneous soil regeneration. Numerous researchers give warnings about soil humus reduction (Whalen et al., 2000; Scheu, 2003; Birkás et al., 2006). Although mineral fertilization increases yields, raising energy costs for its production and deterioration of microbiological and physical-chemical soil properties point to the need for more rational approach in crop fertilization. Developed countries deal with this problem by substituting conventional technologies with biological approach, i.e. expensive mineral fertilizers replace with cheaper biological waste, i.e. organic fertilizers. For this reason, every organic material that increases biogenity and organic matter transformation should attract our attention. Relatively new organic fertilizer «Lumbripost» appeared on our market, obtained by organic waste processing by red Californian earthworm Lumbricus rubellus. We wanted to investigate its nutritive value in exact vegetation experiments in order to determine efficiency of different amounts of lumbripost and its combinations with NPK fertilizers on soil biogenity, yield and technological properties of sunflower.</p><p id="Pg583">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 584 Materials and methods Field fertilizing vegetation experiment was set up on semigley loess type of soil in block system with 12 variants and 4 repetitions. Size of experimental plots was 90 m2. Experimental variants were the following: 1) 1 t ha-1 ha of lumbripost, 2) 2 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 3) 3 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 4) 5 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 5) 8 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 6) control (0), 7) NPK mineral fertilization + 1 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 8) NPK+ 2 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 9) NPK+ 3 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 10) NPK+5 t ha-1 of lumbripost, 11) NPK+8 t ha-1 of lumbripost and 12) NPK mineral fertilization. Sowing of sunflower was done on 28th of April in 2006. Total amount of NPK mineral fertilization (121:74:100) in variants 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 was reduced for NPK nutritive content of lumbripost for corresponding variant. Soil samples for microbiological analyses were taken aseptically on arable soil layer depth of 0-30 cm for every experimental variant three times during sunflower vegetation, and results were expressed as an average value. Microbiological analyses were done by dilution method for: 1) aminoheterotrophs on meat-peptone agar and 2) aminoautotrophs on starch-ammonia medium. After sunflower harvest (12th of October, 2006), grain yield and oil content was determined in experimental variants. Results and discussion Soil, on which experiment was set up, was classified according to pedological classification (Škorić, 1990) as semigley loess, and its chemical properties are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Chemical properties of soil pH P2O5 K2O Humus N H2O KCl mg 100 g -1 tla % % 6.2 5.3 24.16 27.03 1.26 0.15 In anthropogenized soils, which are mostly supplemented with minerals (NPK), dominate mineral nitrogen reducers (aminoautotrophs), while organic nitrogen mineralizers (aminoheterotrophs) are mainly suppressed from soil. Application of organic matter in soil has influence on microbiological and chemical soil properties and soil processes. Microbiological activity, number and relation between dominant physiological groups of microbes changes, microbiological balance, synergistic and antagonistic relations, and qualitative and quantitative content of microbiological population become established. All of this depends on chemical content and amount of organic matter incorporated in soil. Lumbripost, as an organic fertilizer used in this research, has neutral to weak alkaline reaction (pH 7.49), and is rich in carbon and nitrogen in satisfactory proportion 10.2:1. This means that lumbripost easily undergoes mineralization process – releasing organically bound biogenic elements, mainly nitrogen. Based on carbon content and humification that took place, it was determined 38.09% of organic matter structurally similar to humus. Most of the lumbripost microbiological population are aminoheterotrophs (8.4x1012 CFU g-1) and aminoautotrophs (6.7x1010 CFU g-1), actinomycetes (4.8x106 CFU g-1) and fungi (6.8x105 CFU g-1). Basic nutritive substrata and organic nitrogen sources in soil today are humus, organic harvest waste, and protein substances as root system excretions from agricultural crops. Their transformation by aminoheterotrophs in ammonification</p><p id="Pg584">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 585 process enriches the soil with mineral nitrogen for utilization by plants. However, tendency in almost all soil is loss of organic nitrogen in arable layer, which is natural, knowing that most of the substances introduced in soil have shortage of this nitrogen form. For this reason, in layer 0-30 cm of anthropogenized soils dominate aminoautotrophs that immobilize mineral nitrogen, while aminoheterotrophs are suppressed. This causes constant decrease of humus content in soil, while in the most critical vegetation period of agricultural crop development (conditions of increased aridity) aminoautotrophs become plant antagonists, which inevitably effects yield. Relationship between aminoheterotrophs and aminoautotrophs in experimental variants are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

Soil humization by lumbripost in amount of 1-8 t ha-1 increased aminoheterotrophic microflora proportionally with the increase of fertilization with this high quality organic fertilizer. The highest number of microorganisms using this nitrogen form, total of 13.43x106 CFU g-1, was determined in variant 5, where 8 t ha-1 of lumbripost was used. Humization and chemization of soil in variants 7-11, where NPK mineral fertilizer was added to set amounts of lumbripost to achieve imposed fertilization, resulted in increase of aminoheterotrophic population, the highest being in variant 9 with combination of 3 t ha-1 of lumbripost and NPK mineral fertilizer. Table 2 shows that control variants did not show significant differences in number of aminoautotrophs in soil, but their number significantly exceeded aminoheterotrophs. Their dominance over aminoheterotrophs is explained by their ability to adopt mineral nitrogen supplied by fertilization, as well as nitrogen obtained by ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation processes. Greatest efficiency showed variant with organic-mineral fertilization (3 t ha-1 of lumbripost and NPK mineral fertilization) where impressive number of aminoautotrophs was determined, 17x106 CFU g-1. Beside influence on soil biogenity increase, application of this organic fertilizer influenced sunflower grain yield and oil content (Table 2). Application of lumbripost in starting fertilization of sunflower showed positive effect in pure treatment (without NPK mineral fertilization) and in</p><p id="Pg585">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 586 variants where we combined NPK mineral fertilization and lumbripost in such a way that we subtracted from total of needed NPK fertilization the amount of NPK that are mineralised from lumbripost during one vegetation at presumed mineralization rate of 50%. Application of pure lumbripost gave positive effects at 95% level of statistical significance, y=39.004x0.012 with r=0.8033*. Application of lumbripost combined with mineral fertilization also had positive effect, but at 99% level of statistical significance. Based on research results, we can determine that lumbripost application has positive effect on yield by regression equation y=38.505x0.02 with r=0.8727**. This suggests that introduction of this organic manure in sunflower production technology would be beneficial, but that significant positive effects would be gained in combination with mineral fertilizers. The best results gave application of 5 t ha-1 of lumbripost (variant 4) and its combination with NPK mineral fertilization (variant 10). Conclusions Earthworm humus – lumbripost obtained by biological processing of organic waste has very good microbiological and agrochemical properties. Application of this organic fertilizer in sunflower production had significant positive effects on aminoheterotrophic and aminoautotrophic soil microflora, applied in amount of 8 t ha-1 of pure lumbripost and in organic-mineral combination of 3 t ha-1 of lumbripost+NPK mineral fertilization. In the same variants it was determined that application of pure lumbripost had positive effect on sunflower grain yield. Application of lumbripost (3-5 t ha-1) combined with NPK mineral fertilization gave over 4500 kg ha-1 of sunflower grains. This suggests that introduction of this organic manure in sunflower production technology would be beneficial, but that significant positive effects would be gained in combination with mineral fertilizers.

Exact fertilizing vegetation experiment was conducted in 2006, in 7 variants and 4 repetitions. Amount of manure supplemented with disinfectants applied in arable soil layer was vital for soil biogenity, what had direct influence on silage corn yield. It was determined that smaller amounts of manure (10-30 m 3 ha -1 ) caused slight and relatively short-term decrease in amount of aminoheterotrophs, aminoautotrophs and non-symbiotic fixators of elementary nitrogen (Azotobacter chroococcum), which resulted in silage corn yield of 52.32-54.46 t ha-1 of fresh plant mass. While larger amounts of manure (65 m 3 ha -1 ) had stronger and long-lasting toxic effects on the same physiological groups of microorganisms, what caused lower silage corn yield (50.08 t ha -1 ). Keywords: manure, soil, microorganisms, ecology, silage corn Introduction Stockbreeding farms with great agglomeration of dairy cows produce significant amounts of manure. Correct management of organic manure makes possible to decrease environment pollution (Bukvić et al., 2007). However, most of stockbreeding farms in our country do not have facilities for technological waste water management, instead it is being drained together with manure to lagoon type of depot, which significantly decreases manure quality. The biggest problems of environment overload cause manure storage and distribution, with regard to green house effect and acid rain. It is estimated that global NH3 emission amounts to 54 TgN (Tg=billion tons), and agriculture makes 65% of that. Uncontrolled application of large amounts of manure on arable areas can have toxic effects on soil biogenity, and consequently on soil fertility and contamination of soil and underground water (Ređepović, 1993; Milaković et al., 2003; Nemeth 2006). For this reason, the aim of this research was to determine border-line amounts of manure supplemented with disinfectants which would have lowest toxic effects on dominant physiological groups of soil microorganisms and silage corn yield and that could at the same time be used as partial substitution for mineral fertilization. Materials and methods In vicinity of dairy cow farm in eastern Croatia, fertilizing vegetation experiment was set up on semigley type of soil in block system with 7 variants and 4 repetitions, 20 days prior to silage corn sowing (25th of April in 2006). Manure with disinfectants from lagoon type of depot was dispersed onto soil using cistern in the following variants: 1. 10 m3 ha-1 (30 kg N ha-1); 2. 15 m3 ha-1 (45 kg N ha-1); 3. 20 m3 ha-1 (60 kg N ha-1); 4. 30 m3 ha-1 (90 kg N ha-1); 5. 65 m3 ha-1 (195 kg N ha-1); 6. mineral NPK fertilization (180:110:160 kg ha-1) and 7. control.

Cereal Research Communications 588 September. Using dilution method, number and dynamics of 1. aminoheterotrophs on meat-peptone agar; and 2. aminoautotrophs on starch-ammonia medium was determined, while 3. aerobic non-symbiotic fixator of elementary nitrogen (Azotobacter chroococcum) was determined on silica-gel plates with appropriate mineral solution without nitrogen and with mannitol as carbon source. Average number of aminoautotrophs and aminoheterotrophs was calculated in one gram of absolutely dry soil, while presence and dynamics of A. chroococcum was expressed in percentage of fertile soil grains. Harvest of silage corn was done in wax maturity stage of grain, and total fresh plant mass yield was determined. Results and discussion Intensive management and high yields take out from soil great amounts of nutrients, which are present in cultivated soils in various amounts, but never in amount that is sufficient for permanent exploitation without compensation (Mihalić, 1976). The nutrient supply and fertilization have the key-role in the suistanaible production (Pepó, 2007). Using mineral fertilizers, lack of nutrients in soil is supplemented, but organic fertilizers in soil are irremediable. Organic fertilizers have positive influence on microbiological properties of soil, propagation of microorganisms and improvement of chemical and physical properties of soil (Eghball et al., 2004; Loecke et al., 2004; Hernandez-Fernandez et al., 2007) and in that way soil fertility is maintained (Milaković et al., 2007). Liquid bovine manure used in this research was mixture of cow dung, urine and technological wastewater needed for hygiene maintenance in facilities. According to investigated farm, as much as 10 kg of disinfectants is being used daily, with water consumption of 2000 l per building, which is being drained together with manure to lagoon type of depot, and is diminishing manure quality. Efficiency of different amounts of bovine manure on microbiological associations in semigley loess type of soil is shown in Figure 1, 2 and 3. Aminoheterotrophs have medium level of biogenity with regard to mineralization of organic nitrogen, which is consistent with work of other authors evaluating biodiagnostic properties of different soil types (Redžepović, 1993, Milaković et al., 2003). Obtained microbiological results (Figure 1) showed that every increase in amount of manure with disinfectants caused slight or significant reduction of aminoheterotrophs in arable soil layer (0-10 cm) in June, which is beginning of silage corn vegetation, due to inevitable inhibitory effect of chemicals used for disinfection. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 C F U g -1 x 1 0 6 10 15 20 30 65 NPK Control Variants (m3 ha-1) June July August September Average Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 589 Inhibitory effect of disinfectants on aminoheterotrophs in variants with small amount of manure (10, 15, 20 and 30 m3 ha-1) was short-term, and was followed by expansion of this physiological group that lasted until September. According to our results, large amounts of manure (65 m3 ha-1) with high concentration of disinfectants caused significant reduction of aminoheterotrophs, what slows down process of organic nitrogen mineralization in soil. Rapidity of microbiological degradation of disinfectant, and thereafter reduction of its persistency depends on its amount, and such large amounts give little chance for microorganisms to quickly adapt to new kind of chemical pollutant. Frequent use of such irrational amounts of manure would definitely have undesirable repercussions on soil biogenity maintenance. Aminoautotrophic microorganisms (Figure 2), capable adopting mineral nitrogen obtained by fertilization, as well as nitrogen produced in processes of ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation, dominate in anthropogenic soils and mostly surpass aminoheterotrophs. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 C F U g -1 x 1 0 6 10 15 20 30 65 NPK Control Variants (m3 ha-1) June July August September Average Figure 2.

Due to large doses of high disinfectant concentration incorporated in soil, in variants with amount of 65 m3 ha-1, number of aminoautotrophic microorganisms was drastically lowered, and their average number in all four research months was reduced to 3.75x106 CFU g-1 of absolutely dry soil.

However, larger doses (30 and 65 m3 ha-1) had marked negative influence on these microorganisms during whole silage corn vegetation, when compared to control variant. Based on research results, utilization of such inappropriate forms of liquid bovine manure as manure for fodder cultures is limited, and its frequent application could jeopardise number of nitrogen fixators and their molecular nitrogen fixation. Manure used in this research showed fertilizing effect on silage corn green mass yield dependent on applied amount. Smaller manure amounts up to 30 m3 ha-1 had positive influence on yield that increased from 52.32 –54.41 t ha-1, while manure amount of 65 m3 ha-1 reduced yield to control variant level (50.08 t ha-1). Conclusions Based on obtained microbiological results after investigating application of acceptable amounts of bovine manure on soil microorganisms we can conclude the following: amount of bovine manure supplemented with technological wastewater was crucial for number and activity of investigated physiological groups of microorganisms. Thus, smaller amounts of manure (10-30 m3 ha-1) caused slight and relatively short-term decrease in amount of aminoheterotrophs and aminoautotrophs, while manure amounts of 65 m3 ha-1 had toxic effects on these microorganisms. Manure amounts of 30 and 65 m3 ha-1 had marked inhibitory effect on Azotobacter chroococcum. Fresh green mass yield of silage corn ranged from 52.32 –54.41 t ha-1 in variants where manure amounted up to 30 m3 ha-1, while larger amounts of manure (65 m3 ha-1) caused yield decrease (50.08 t ha-1). Manure supplemented with technological wastewater could be used on agricultural land in rational amounts (with obligatory application of NPK fertilizers) and in that way could reduce influence of stockbreeding on environment.

H-2103 Gödöllő, Hungary, dobolyi.csaba@mkk.szie.hu 2 Departnment of Environmental Protection and Environmental Safety, Gödöllő, Hungary Abstract: There is an increasing demand in recent years for results of ecotoxicological measurements beside chemical analytical results in case of soils polluted by toxic elements. Taxonomical diversity measurements of soil fungi showed that the mycota had reconstructed after a giant pollution of the soil, as a result of a 15 years long phytoremediation experiment using agricultural and horticulture plants. The reduction of soil fungal populations affected by cadmium and selenium loading could have been hardly estimated after a 15 years long cultivation with traditional agricultural and horticultural plants. The taxonomical diversity of soil mycota has also almost restored. 21 species could be obtained from the plots treated with cadmium, 18 from the soil treated with selenium, and 28 from untreated control soil. Introduction Long-term field experiments (LTFE) are fundamental for the agriculture, and also for the protection of the environment. LTFE studies demonstrated that cadmium is toxic at even lower concentrations for grazing animals and man because cadmium can accumulate in the edible vegetative parts of crops without damaging them (Takácsné, 2007; Zhang et al., 2003). Thus, cadmium and other heavy metals including selenium must be followed in the soil-plant-animal system in LTFE experiments (Kádár, 2006; Rajkai et al., 2007). The soil mycota, which represents 30-40 % of total biomass, plays an important role in the mineralisation and other transformation processes in soil. The members of fungal populations belonging to different taxons are differently sensitive to toxic heavy metal elements (Misra and Pandey, 2005). Consequently, the composition of mycota may significantly change in response to these harmful environmental agents (Ködöböcz et al., 2007; Singh and Wright, 2006). With a properly detailed analysis of soil mycota, a new and adequate ecotoxicological test can be designed to become an important member of the soil monitoring system (Mikó et al., 2006). With a view of an ecotoxicological application, we investigated the effect of cadmium and selenium in the saprophytic members of soil mycota (Carvalho et al., 2003; Valkama et al., 2003). The experiments were carried out in the Nagyhörcsök Experimental Site of the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Materials and methods The soil of the experimental site (Nagyhörcsök Experimental Station) is a loamy calcareous chernozem with 25 % clay, developed on loess. In its ploughed layer, it contains 3 % humus and 3-5 % CaCO3. To ensure a sufficient macronutrient supply for</p><p id="Pg591">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 592 the whole experiment, 100 kg/ha N, P2O5 and K2O are given yearly. The 13 selected microelements were applied in early spring 1991 at 4 levels each. Since the artificial pollution in spring, 1991 each year different crops were grown in the plots, according to regular agricultural practice. The samples of the calcareous chernozem soil were microbiologically cultured (Martin’s agar, potato dextrose agar), fungal isolates were taxonomically identified, and the mycota of soil was analysed. Results and discussion The calcareous chernozem soil of the experimental site was rich in fungal populations: 7.3 x 105 CFU g-1, 9.4 x 105 and 6.1 x 105 CFU g-1 was present in the control plot in July and in November 2006, and in June 2007, respectively. The huge doses (270 mg kg-1) of both cadmium and selenium resulted in significant and permanent changes in the fungal biomass of the experimental soil. The reduction in CFU was measurable even 15 years after the treatment. The fungal CFU in the soil treated with cadmium was 3.5 x 105, 8.2 x 105 and 3.9 x 105 in July and in November 2006, and in June 2007, respectively. Similarly, the fungal CFU in the soil treated with selenium was 2.3 x 105, 7.6 x 105 and 1.9 x 105 in July and November 2006, and in June 2007, respectively. The levels of fungal populations both in treated and untreated plots showed a seasonal regularity (Figure 1). The effect of microelement treatments on the taxonomical diversity of fungal populations was even more evident: 21 species were obtained from the plots treated with cadmium, 18 from the soil treated with selenium, and 29 from untreated control soil. 21 of the total 29 species from the control plot were obtained only from there with a dominance of the species Acremoniella atra, Cladosporium cladosporoides and Scytalidium lignicola. 10 species of the total 21 from the plots treated with cadmium were obtained only from there with a dominance of the species Acremonium curvulum and A. terricola, which belong to the genus Cladosporium, and Fusarium solani, respectively. Three out of the total 18 species from the plots treated with selenium were cultured only from there with a dominance of the species Aspergillus ochraceus and Chaetomium elatum (Table 1). Dependence of the diversity upon seasons also remained higher in the loaded plots: we revealed 9 and 5 constant species from the soils treated with cadmium and selenium, respectively, while 20 in the control soil.</p><p id="Pg592">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 594 Conclusions The huge doses (270 mg kg-1) of cadmium and selenium caused a detectable reduction in the mycota and fungal biomass in soil. The reduction can be estimated even after a long-term experimental phytoremediation. The taxonomical diversity of fungal population was also affected: 21 species could be obtained from the plots treated with cadmium, 18 from the soil treated with selenium, while 29 from untreated control soil. 23 and 22 autochtonous soil fungal species disappeared in response to cadmium and selenium, respectively. After their disappearance, the nieche was filled by other species tolerant to cadmium and selenium. In addition, seasonal modifications are present in the ecotoxicological effect of cadmium and selenium. In summary, the quantitative and qualitative ecotoxicological effect of cadmium and selenium can be investigated with testing soil mycota, similarly as testing nematode fauna.

During the vegetation season is the water storage in the soil aeration zone influenced by meteorological phenomena and vegetation cover. If the soil profile is in contact with the ground water table, this also affects the water storage. The water amount stored in the soil aeration zone is determined by a combination of these components. The influence can be either monitored directly or simulated by a mathematical model for soil moisture regimes. Water requirements of cultivated agricultural crops differ during the vegetation season. In the present study the results obtained by direct monitoring of the effect of agricultural crops on the water storage dynamics under the conditions of the East Slovakian Lowland (ESL) are presented, particularly:  The mean water storage in the aeration zone during the vegetation period (April through September), under maize in the locality Vysoká nad Uhom during the years 1972–1976, and 1998–2003.  The mean water storage in the aeration zone under plant species in the locality Vysoká nad Uhom during the vegetation period 2003 Interpretation of the results has been made with regard to the actual evapotranspiration (Ea), and taking into account the measured precipitation (P) for the relevant periods of monitoring. Keywords: monitoring soil moisture content, interaction canopy and soil, precipitation, actual evapotranspiration (Ea) Introduction Assessment of the water volume balance in the soil aeration zone in lowland areas in certain period is based on a simple balance equation (1). (Wt - Wo) = Ik + P (1) where Wo – the initial water content in soil aeration zone, Wt – water content in the reviewed time interval in hydrological year, Ik – capillary water inflow, P- precipitation water inflow, E- outflow of water caused by physical evaporation of water from soil surface, T – outflow of water by evaporation of vegetation cover, i.e transpiration, E + T = E (also Eo or Ea, Er), Ip – water outflow from soil aeration zone by seeping into lower horizons or to groundwater. Two methodological procedures are applied in order to determine values of these members or components of water balance. The first of them leans on direct methods of their assessment in situ in interest locality or territory (Šútor, 1999). The second is based on computation. It applies numerical simulation of water regime with application of its mathematic model. (Šútor et al., 2002). The problems of interactions of soil water resources with plant cover were solved by Tall (2007) ,Zalewski et al. (1997) and Hunyadi Borbély et al. (2007) Materials and methods Soil moisture monitoring was secured in long-term stationary field trials in the experimental centre of the Regional Agro-ecological Research Institute of Michalovce, in Vysoká nad Uhom (on loam soil).</p><p id="Pg595">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 596 Collection of soil samples for water content monitoring was carried out in vegetation period in two-week intervals in the depth of 0.8 m in 0.1 m layers in three repetitions. Gravimetric method was used for the assessment of soil moisture. Water source for agricultural corps is the soil water reserve. If and how it will fulfil its function in production process in the course of vegetation period depends not only on the soil water content but also on the characteristics of soil and the grown crops. Hydrolimits, based on convention, are used for characterization of the relationship between the plant and soil moisture (Majerčák et al., 1998) or the soil moisture potential. Hydrolimits are expressed by typical soil moistures, such as field water capacity (ΘFWC-pF = 2.3), point of decreased availability (ΘPDA-pF = 3.3), and the wilting point (ΘWP-pF = 4.18). The same hydrolimits were used by for evaluation of soil water regime in Žitný ostrov region Štekauerová et al., (2003) Model crops such as alfalfa, wheat, peas, barley, maize, sugar beet, soya, sunflower, beans, winter wheat, alfalfa, clover, and spring barley were grown with the use of classic techniques consisting of normal agrotechnical measures (stubble breaking, ploughing, harrowing, sowing). Results and discussion In analysed cases, it means in Vysoká nad Uhom, the data sets concerning water content in the soil aeration zone obtained by monitoring were processed to sequences of mean water volume values for vegetation seasons in selected years. Availability of water from the soil aeration zone is assessed by certain criteria. These correspond to the existence of water reserve in intervals delimited by hydrolimits, it means by field water capacity (FWC), point of decreased availability (PDA) and the wilting point (WP). This methodological approach provides an important answer to the question, whether the vegetation cover had sufficient water supply from the soil aeration zone or not. Figure 1 brings obtained mean water storage in the soil aeration zone during vegetation season (April to September) at the locality Vysoká nad Uhom from 1972 to 1976 and from 1998 to 2003. The quoted data were taken under the maize growth. Simultaneously with water volume values obtained by monitoring also water volumes corresponding to hydrolimits FWC, PDA and WP are quoted. Monitoring of the effect of agricultural crops on the water reserve dynamics was carried out on clay-loam soils on ten fields with different crops. The effects of additional crops were quantified in locality Vysoká nad Uhom on loamy soils Alfalfa is the crop with the strongest effect. In reference to this crop, values corresponding to remaining crops are derived in increasing order. The maximum difference in water reserve in the soil aeration zone is between the sugar alfalfa andsunflower. The difference amounts to about 72millimetres, it means 72 litres of water per m2. Real values can be obtained after assessment of the actual evapotranspiration (Eta) for any monitored crop which can be used as the referential level for other crops of Fig.2. Eta and its components Ta, Ea were assessed by the numerical simulation on the mathematical model of soil water regime GLOBAL (Farkas et al., 2005)</p><p id="Pg596">VII.

The input data represented relevant values of meteorological characteristics, data on oscillation of groundwater table, hydrophysical characteristics, and the maize growth in given locality. Conclusions Regime of mean water storage values in the soil aeration zone at locality and Vysoká nad/Uhom in 2003 vegetation season is influenced by the water consumption of the grown crops in a significantly differentiated manner. Increasing arrangement of the water content values facilitates assessment of the rate of effect the individual crops exert - from the relatively strongest effect to the weakest. Hence, the crop with the highest consumption (on Fig. 1 maize and on Fig. 2 alfalfa) is the referential one for the remaining crops. Values corresponding to the remaining crops are subsequently quoted. Only relative values of the effect of growth on water reserve in the soil aeration zone are obtained from these monitored data. Real values can be obtained after assessment of the actual evapotranspiration (Ea) for any monitored crop which can be then used as the referential one for other crops of Fig. 2. By means of numerical simulation on the mathematical model GLOBAL (Farkas et al., 2005; Mikulec-Stehlová. 2006) of the soil water regime, values of actual evapotranspiration and its components Ta (transpiration) and Ea (evaporation) were obtained for the above localities. Using these values, real water volumes consumed by crops in vegetation season in given localities are obtained.The method of determining the effect exerted by the vegetation cover on the water reserve dynamics in the soil aeration zone with application of monitoring and numerical simulation facilitates quantifying of this effect for real conditions in particular territory.</p><p id="Pg597">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Highly significant were instead the differences expressed by individual varieties of F. esculentum grown at different locations; c) much higher values of rutin content in F. tataricum, although the differences among varieties and locations were clearly less pronounced than those observed in F. esculentum. Apparently, the pedoclimatic characteristics of given environment elicited a differential response among the varieties of F. esculentum. The hypothesis is that the relevant difference in the rutin content observed in F. esculentum between locations might be related to the irradiance characteristics inherent the different altitudes. However, F. tataricum could not keep its high rutin content regardless of the environmental conditions. Keywords: buckwheat, rutin, Fagopyrum, flavonoids Introduction Recent agronomic trials carried out in Regions of Central and Southern Italy have shown interesting buckwheat yield potential (around two t/ha) of both Fagopyrum esculentum and F. tataricum. In general F. esculentum was a better producer than F. tataricum. However, in the mountain location of Terranova del Pollino in the Region of Basilicata, F. tataricum equaled the yield of F. esculentum. The growing place has a great effect on the plant components (Izsáki 2006), and also the soil water content (Novák and Havrila, 2006). Nagy (2007) reported, the fertilization of yield has also a great effect on the ripening of different maize varieties and on winter wheat production (Pepó 2007). The use of buckwheat flour in cooking is gaining new interest in Italy due to the many health benefits provided by the hypocholesterolemic property of its proteins, superior to that of soy (Tomotake et al. 2001) but more importantly, because of the presence of the flavonoid rutin (a glucoside of quercetin). Rutin has an antihyperglycemic effect (Kamalakkannan et al. 2006); protective against diabetes development (Odetti et al. 1990; Srinivasan et al. 2005), and mitigates consequences (Nagasawa et al. 2003), antioxidant (Oomah and Mazza, 1996); anti-inflammatory (Guardia et al. 2001); antiplatlet formation property (Sheu et al. 2004); mitigates cardiovascular diseases (He et al. 1995); has anticancer activity (Park and Park, 2004) and antimutagenic activity (Aheme and O’Brien, 2000; Undeger et al. 2004).</p><p id="Pg599">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 600 The mountainous Central and Southern Italy can profitably adopt the cultivation of buckwheat as alternative crop to bread wheat. However, its success depends on the use of well adopted varieties for each environment because of the diversity of soils, altitude and climatic conditions. With regard to the rutin content of the grain, varietal differences have been reported in F. esculentum (Ohsawa and Tsutsumi, 1995; Oomah and Mazza, 1996), but location (Oomah and Mazza, 1996) and flowering time (Ohsawa and Tsutsumi, 1995) also seems to influence the rutin content. Fagopyrum tataricum performs much higher rutin content of the grain than F. esculentum (Fabjan et al. 2003; Park et al. 2004, Brunori and Végvári 2007), but F. tataricum is a lower yielder (Fabjan et al. 2003). In addition to the yield potential, the rutin content of the grain may effectively help in the identification of the best variety for a given environment, allowing the optimum combination of yield and grain quality to be achieved. To gain insight on the effect of location on the rutin content of the grain, and to obtain further data on the extent of variation of this trait among varieties, nineteen F. esculentum and three F. tataricum varieties were analyzed. Materials and methods The grains for rutin content determination were collected from nineteen Fagopyrum esculentum and three F. tataricum varieties in the summer of 2006 at the locations of Matrice (CB, 750 m, heavy clay soil rich in skeleton) in Molise, Camigliatello Silano (CS; 1200 m, extremely light, highly acidic soil) in Calabria, and Terranova del Pollino (PZ; 1300m, heavy clay soil) in Basilicata. Rutin content of the grain was analyzed at the HPLC laboratory of Corvinus University of Budapest. After methanolic extraction, cleaning and filtering, 20 µl of the extract was used for rutin content determination with a WATERS HPLC (717 plus auto-sampler, 1525 binary HPLC pump, 2487 dual absorbance detector, 350 nm, SYMMETRY C18 5µm 4.6X150 column). Analyzing conditions: 2.5% acetic acid in water (350 ml), MeOH (50 ml), acetonitrile (100ml) as mobile phase; flowrate was 1 ml·min-1; column pressure was 1750 ± 10 psi. Two replicate analyses were run for each sample. Reference was made of 2.65 mg rutin hydrate [153-18-4] dissolved in 25 ml methanol. The analysis was assisted by EMPOWER 2TM software. Results and discussion In F. esculentum, differences between the varieties were apparent at all the three experimental sites (Figure 1). Each location presented both a different ranking and a diverse top variety. At Camigliatello Silano, the rutin content ranged from (149mg/100 g DW) of ‘Arakawa Village’, followed by ‘Kitayuki’ (94 mg/100 g DW) and ‘Mancan’ (85 mg/100 g DW) to 26 mg/100 g DW of ‘Darja’ and 29 mg/100 g DW of ‘Bamby’ At Matrice, the rutin content varied from 232 mg/100 g DW of ‘Emka’ followed by ‘Jana’ (78 mg/100 g DW), while the lowest values were those of ‘Springfield’ (11 mg/100 g DW) and ‘Kitayuki’ and ‘Bamby’ (14 mg/100 g DW). At Terranova del</p><p id="Pg600">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 601 Pollino, ‘Jana’ presented 275 mg/100 g DW, followed by ‘Kitawasesoba’ (116 mg/100 g DW). ‘AC Manisoba’ (40 mg/100 g DW), ‘Darja’ and ‘Springfield’ (49 mg/100 g DW) had the least rutin contents. The rutin content of F. tataricum was much higher than that of F. esculentum. Of the three F. tataricum varieties, ‘Donan’ the best was at the location of Camigliatello (2567 mg/100 g DW) and Terranova (3078 mg/100 g DW), while ‘Golden’ ranked first at the location of Matrice (2416 mg/100 g DW). In F. tataricum, the rutin content of the grain gradually increased, from the location of Matrice to that of Camigliatello and Terranova del Pollino. The variety differences of locations, however, were not significant. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Varieties R u ti n c o n te n t (m g /1 0 0 g D W ) Camigliatello Silano Matrice Terranova del Pollino Figure 1.

The extremely high value of the rutin content (232 mg/100 g DW) presented by ‘Emka’ and the appreciable 78 mg/100 g DW of ‘Jana’ at the location of Matrice, where a low rutin content of the grain would appear the rule, might result of great interest in demonstrating the flexibility of F. esculentum as far as the rutin content of the grain is concerned. This is particularly interesting on the account that ‘Jana’ has previously shown a good yield potential in this location. If the rutin content of the grain is a relevant parameter of F. esculentum in quality evaluation, then it is evident that in Central and Southern Italy there could be areas and varieties suited to attain high contents of rutin in the grain. In this respect, varieties like ‘Emka’ and, to a less extent, ‘Jana’ could achieve a good level of rutin</p><p id="Pg601">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

LESZNYÁK Institute of Plant Science, University of Debrecen, Böszörményi str. 138. Debrecen, Hungary 4032 Abstract: We found close significant positive correlation between the photosynthesis intensity of maize, sunflower, sugar beet and the water reserve of upper 1 meter soil layer. In the extreme dry 2007 year sunflower tolerated better the unfavourable water conditions, its photosynthesis and transpiration were intensive, and the stomatal conductance was high. Keywords: soil moisture, photosynthesis, transpiration Introduction There is little direct information about the effects of the soil water content on the photosynthesis system of crops. Some recent publications pay attention on this field of research (Balla et al. 2006, Stuchlíková et al. 2007, Šafránková, 2007, Hniličková et al. 2007). Dóka, L.-Pepó, P. (2007) and Hagyó et al. (2007) wrote that the water stress has significant effect on the yield and other agronomic parameters of maize and wheat. The aim of our work was to get more data about the relations between the water supply and the assimilation parameters. Materials and methods The measurements were carried out in 2007 at the research site of the University of Debrecen in small plot experiments. We measured the assimilation parameters of the sunflower, maize and sugar beet, and took soil samples from the 0-1 meter layer for determining the soil water reserve. Fertilizer levels were: maize N60P45K45, sunflower: N30P45K53, sugar beet: N50P120K220. The soil of the experimental area is calcareous chernozem. The soil has favorable water regime. The minimal water storing capacity is 808 mm in the 0-200 cm layer. The unavailable water content is 295 mm in the 0-200 cm layer. The amount of disponible water in saturated state is 513 mm in the 0-200 cm layer of which 342 mm is readily available. Assimilation parameters measured in the field by the LICOR LI-6400 portable photosynthesis system. It has two infrared gas analyzers to measure CO2 and H2O mole fraction in air. There is a contact thermometer in the leaf chamber to measure leaf temperature. We measured the net photosynthesis rate, the stomatal conductance, the intercellular CO2 level, the transpiration, the air and the leaf temperature. We applied the same stable light intensity in every measuring: photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) 2000 mol photon m-2 s-1, with 90 % red (630 nm) and 10 % blue (470 nm) light. We measured six times per leaf, in four repetitions. We used SPSS 13.0 statistical software for data processing (General Linear Model (GLM) and Pearson correlation). The SD 5% values were calculated by the Sváb (1981) method.</p><p id="Pg603">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The closest relation was in case of maize. The measured data shows that maize was intensive water stress in the middle of July and middle of August. The stomatal conductance was very low, the stomata of the leaves were almost closed (Figure 3). In extreme dry 2007 year sunflower tolerated better the unfavourable water conditions. Photosynthesis and transpiration were intensive, the stomatal conductance was high in sunflower (Figure 4). The net photosynthesis of sugar beet was very low in the four measurings. The stomatal conductance and the transpiration highly increased at the end of the growing season, but changing of the assimilation rate was not significant. These results could be in connection the observed fungus infection on the leaves because we probably measured not the stomatal conductance but the gas exchange through the damaged epidermis. Table 1.

Szabadság utca, Szarvas, H-5540, Hungary E-mail: csizmarik.gabor@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract: The microbial respiration, calculated from O2 and CO2 changes, was measured in situ during 24 hour's periods by an Analox 1200 infrared biogas analyser, later by a Brüel and Kjaer multi-gas analyser with infrared photo acoustic spectroscopy (PAS). The bacterial germ numbers were counted by the standard plate count method The organic carbon content was determined in the sediment. The respiration rate varied from 85 to 626 mg C m-2 day-1 depending on daily average temperature and strictly followed the daily temperature variations. The in vitro experiment showed that respiration was strongest at 33% moisture content. Due to the drying state, bacterial number and the respiration showed parallel decrease with decrease of the moisture content. We can state, that drying and the seasonal klimatic variations are the main factors affecting the respiration activity and the composition of the microbial communities in these special ecosystems. Keywords: Drying sediment, soil, microbial respiration, CO2 emission, organic matter decomposition Introduction Some reservoirs and especially fish ponds are special aquatic ecosystems of regular annual drainage. Their sediment (soil) surface becomes exposed to air, thus, the altered redox conditions significantly influence the biological decomposition processes (Boyd and Pippopinyo, 1993). In these ecosystems the sediment is the greatest nutrient accumulator, therefore, the examination of decomposition is important. The intensity of respiration is a primer general feature of the metabolism of aerobic microbial communities, therefore, the examination of it may be one of the first steps to understand the decomposition processes of drying sediment. Furthermore, the CO2 and CH4 emission from these special sediment systems may have an impact on the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Várallyay, 2007). Several methods have been applied for measuring bacterial activity in the sediment (Witkamp, 1966), (Fallon and Boylen, 1990), (Trevors et al., 1982), (Sommaruga, 1991). Furthermore, special techniques have been developed for the in situ monitoring of respiration in the water body (Oláh et al., 1990). However, in order to study the microbial ecology of drying sediments new methods and principles are needed, since these sediments cannot be characterized by available terrestrial, nor conventional aquatic ecological approaches. Materials and methods First examinations were conducted in an experimental fish-cum-duck pond sediment at Szarvas, Hungary. The CO2 concentration and the temperature were measured simultaneously in situ for 24 hours in three different days. Second investigations were conducted in two different sites of Kisköre Reservoir at the area of Laskó and Eger stream. The CO2 concentration and temperature were measured in situ. The moisture content and total organic carbon were determined in these samples. The heterotrophic bacteria germ numbers were counted by the standard plate count method. In vitro experiments were developed for determination of moisture dependence. 1-20 ml distilled water was added to 20 g dry sediments /soil and incubated for one day in 150 ml closed flasks.</p><p id="Pg607">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The measuring chambers were connected by plastic tubes to the inlet and outlet of a gas analyser. Therefore, the system was closed, the gases were recycled. First an Analox 1200 infrared spectroscope (a biogas analyser) was applied for determining the CO2 concentrations. The sensitivity of this instrument was  0.1 vol%. It was followed by a Brüel &amp; Kjaer multi-gas monitor with a much lower detection limit: it was 0.01-1 ppm, depended on the monitored gas.

It was 223.0 mgC m-2 day-1 at 12.1 °C, 270.0 mgC m-2 day-1 at 13.6 °C, and 626.3 mgC m-2 day-1 at 15.6 °C average temperature. During a day the respiration followed the temperature changes: after a linear regression a good correlation was achieved with R2 value of 0.64 (Figure 1). In the in vitro experiment the highest respiration was detected at 33% moisture content. Below and above this water content the respiration was lower (Figure 2). In the sediment of Kisköre Reservoir CO2 concentrations were measured in every second minute during a 21 hour's period, thus we got more, than 700 data. The respiration was calculated by the first derivative after a polynomial curve fitting. It was also strongly correlated with temperature (Figure 3).</p><p id="Pg608">VII.

Due to the drying state and the organic carbon content, the microbial germ number and the respiration showed parallel decrease with decrease of the moisture content, which indicates the aeration influence (Table 1). Table 1. Respiration in the sediment at different sites of the Kisköre Reservoir. The daily average temperature was 5.9 °C. The negative values at the sites of Laskó stream indicates the possibility of the algal carbon refixation. Kisköre Reservoir sampling sites Moisture (%) Organic carbon (mg×g -1 , dry w.)

The activity of the microbial communities was influenced by temperature and moisture. CO2 refixation was detected especially at the Laskó stream site, which indicated an algal production (Table 1). We were able to follow continuously the variations in the respiration during a day in situ by the gas chamber method. The quantity of the bacterial community (the germ number) was affected by the organic carbon load. The intensity of respiration was affected mainly by the temperature and moisture. An organic carbon decrease was detected caused by the aeration effect, which may decrease the organic carbon load of the reservoir, fish pond, or even of a flood plain. References Boyd, C.

Bethlen Str. 5200-Törökszentmiklós, Hungary, postmaster@turagro.t-online.hu 2 Quality Assurance and Microbiology, Institute of Food Science, Centre of Agricultural Sciences, University of Debrecen, Hungary 3 Hajdúsági Gabonaipari Inc. Debrecen, Hungary Abstract: The effect of weather factors is extremely complex and appears in an interactive, cumulative manner, which could be achieved in the current cropping site and agronomic conditions. Changes in the quality parameters of 7 winter wheat varieties with good bread making characteristics, grown on different regions of Hungary were studied in the 2006/2007 vegetation period. According to our analysis, cropping site affected the quality parameters (wet gluten content, gluten expansiveness, gluten index, alveographical W value). In Tépe we experienced very weak conditions but in Jánoshalma, Somogyszil and Szentistván crops show relatively good quality values. Keywords: winter wheat, cropping site, quality of wheat Introduction The genetic, the ecological and agronomic conditions exercise the quality of winter wheat (Tanács, 2007; Baric et al., 2007; Pepó, 2007; Matuz et al., 2007, Sipos et al., 2007; Győri és Sipos, 2006/a; Tóth et al. 2006). According to Győri and Győriné (1998) these factors are divided into two parts: internal (biological growing) and external (agro technological, ecological characteristics) parameters. In the classification some overlaps might occur as the cropping site and the year are closely related to each other (Pepó et al., 2006; Győri és Sipos, 2006/b). During his researches Szabó et al (1987) established that the ratio of cropping site in the varience of the quality of winter wheat is 42%, and the year has an 18%, the production technology has a10% and the variety has a 30% effect. Nagy (1981) examined the conditions of cropping site and he could determine three various locations for wheat in Hungary. Vajda and Bujáki (2002) found the chernozem and the brown forest soil are excellent for wheat production. The climatic effect (precipitation, temperature, sun radiation, etc.) influences the effect of cropping site. The continental climate of Hungary shows the best conditions for the winter wheat production (Bedő et al., 1995). The first Hungarian Wheat Quality Map was accomplished in 1885 and it characterised the common effect of production site and crop year. Szániel et al (1978) made a comparison between various crop fields and he made a special clime-value-number map. Both maps help to shape the optimal crop rotation and to make the objective valuation of fields. So, the cropping site influences the quality of winter wheat significantly and the good quality depends on the year, too (Ragasits, 1997).</p><p id="Pg611">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 612 Materials and methods The representative 7 winter wheat samples (Áron, GK Kapos, Mv Suba, Saturnus, Sixtus, Mv Mazurka, KG Széphalom), which were produced in 2006/2007, originate from 7 cropping sites (Szentistván, Jánoshalma, Somogyszil, Tiszavasvári, Csorvás, Sükösd, Tépe) in Hungary. The agronomy treatments and the ecological effects were different on the stations. Somogyszil has brown forest soil and the other sites have chernozem. During the vegetation period Sükösd had the biggest (353,7 mm) and Tépe had the smallest precipitation (22,94 mm). The sowing of winter wheat was completed between 23.09.2006-03.11.2006 and the harvest from 28.06.2007 to 17.07.2007. The examinations of wheat were performed in the accredited Laboratory of Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology, Centre of Agricultural Sciences, University of Debrecen. The wet gluten content and gluten expansiveness were analysed with MSZ 6369/5-87 the gluten index with ICC No. 155, and alveographical W value with AACC 1983.54.30.methods. The statistical report was performed by SPSS 12.0 statistical program package. Results and discussion We show the wet gluten content in Table 1. and the gluten expansiveness in Table 2. In the tables it is noticeable that we analysed lower parameters in Csorvás, Sükösd and Tépe regions. There are high values of wet gluten content in Somogyszil and high values of gluten expansiveness in Szentistván, Jánoshalma and Tiszavasvári crops. In the latter case the values of relative deviation show heterogeneous data. If we see the gluten index, we can see reversed situation compared to wet gluten content and gluten expansiveness (Table 3.). In areas where we analysed low values of these parameters, the gluten index values show high values. The remands of Hungarian importers are shown by the increasing needs of certain suppliers and costumers to have the alveographical W as deform work of alveogram for the resistance extension of dough. Table 4 presents this important parameter. Among the values of deviation significant difference is shown but the average data is good for the characterization of values. We analysed the highest data in Jánoshalma, the lowest parameters in Tépe. Table 1.

Because of global climate change the frequency of excess water inundations related to land use risk may be higher in the near future. The investigated area was the BékésCsanád Loess Plateau. In our study we examined the relation between saturated buffer zones of excess water inundations and land use risks based on CLC50 database. The highest land use risk values were found on those areas which used for extensive agricultural production. Accordingly there is a need for an adequate field specified sustainable agricultural production which can take into consideration the actual risk of excess water inundation with different saturated zones. The results assisted and enabled the land use planning of the inundated and saturated areas by excess water, as well as it could be used for the calculation of different water management and land use scenarios. Keywords: excess water inundation, multi-buffer zones, land use risk Introduction The average annual precipitation may show high territorial and temporal variability in Hungary (Farkas et al., 2005; Pásztor et al., 2006; Tamás et al., 2007). Under such conditions a considerable part of precipitation is lost by surface runoff, downward filtration and evaporation, but principally in the flat-land regions the excess water inundations cause several problems and damages mainly in the agricultural areas (Várallyay, 2006). Damage caused by excess waters can be occurred about 1.8 million hectares, from which 60% is located in the arable-land. The area affected by inundation in every 5 years is 150000 hectares on average. The possibility of the amount and distribution of extreme rain event is increased in Hungary, as it is written in VAHAVA (Change-Effect-Response) project (Várallyay, 2007). The global warming is likely to have significant impacts on the hydrologic cycle, affecting water resources system (Mikulec and Stehlová, 2006; Dobó et al., 2006; Stehlová, 2007; Vicuna and Dracup, 2007). For these reasons the frequency of excess water inundations may be higher in the near future. The rational land use and proper soil management are important elements of sustainable (agricultural) development, having special importance both in the national economy and in environmental protection (Várallyay, 2003). Materials and methods The investigated area was the Békés-Csanád Loess Plateau (BCSLP, 172737 ha) which is situated in the lowland featured Southern Hungary. GIS based quantification and large scale mapping of excess water hazard was carried out. We compiled the map of relative frequency of excess water events. Its source was the yearly mapping of the areas damaged by maximal inundation from 1951 to 2005 (Source: Körös Valley District Environment and Water Directorate, Gyula; Lower Tisza District EWD, Szeged). Relative frequency of excess water events can be determined by dividing</p><p id="Pg615">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 616 number of excess water events by total number of examined years (Pálfai, 1994). The serial maps were overlaid providing an independent estimation of the spatial distribution of the most risky areas. The relative frequency of excess water map was used for the multi-buffer analysis to determine variant saturated zones from precisely defined distance (10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750 and 1000 meters) of each excess water polygon. In our study we examined the relation between saturated buffer zones of excess water inundations and land use risks based on Corine Land Cover (CLC50) database. Two land use categories were analysed: i.e. arable land with large fields (100635.6 ha) and arable land with small fields (49082.7 ha). The CLC50 has a working scale of 1:50000. CLC50 distinguishes arable land according to dominant field size, so small scale arable land – which is the characteristic of land privatised by small holders – is mapped as a separate category (Büttner et al., 2001). Spatial data were processed by ArcGIS, statistical data were analysed by SPSS 13.0. Results and discussion The relative frequency of excess water inundations related to two types of land use categories and the water management categories was shown in Table 1. Table 1.

One of the main aims of our examination was to identify different saturated zones around the excess water inundation polygons according to the Pálfai risk categories. It was required because the original excess water inundation map layers could not express the saturated zones around the inundated areas, which caused the same damaging effects for cultivated plants. A buffer is a newly generated polygon enclosed in an area within a specified distance from a certain source and is an expression of the influence zone with respect to a certain distance. The relative frequency of excess water inundations with multi-buffered (saturated) zones was shown in Figure 1. On the low risked areas (R1A1; R1A2) the land use risks are increasing from 22% (22775 ha; 11360 ha) to 79% (80167 ha; 40744 ha) depend on buffer distances, which was shown in Figure 2. Practically, in case of this, the relative frequency of excess water inundations is very low, but in our opinion the moderate excess water risked areas (R2) may be increasing because of climate change, where the frequency of inundations will be higher. The case of R2A1 and R2A2 areas are very similarly increasing from 1.5% (1235 ha; 550 ha) to 20% (18357 ha; 9872 ha). R2 values are very high, which mean the exponentially connection</p><p id="Pg616">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 617 between different buffer (saturated) zones and the increasing of land use risk. The highest R2 value (0.9915) was found on the area of R1A2, where slightly endangered area is 945.4 ha, moderate is 6247.6 ha and highly is 3602 ha based on Várallyay et al. (1980) categories. These areas are used for extensive agricultural production where agricultural damages caused by excess water inundation can be significantly increased by the subsoil compaction (disk-pan, plough-pan), decreasing natural drainage condition of root zone and the neglected table drainage channels.

Saturated areas related to different buffer distances Plant productions are determined by a complex of factors including biological basis (variety, seed), applied agro-technology and variable agro-ecological conditions (weather, soil). From among these factors, the effect of yearly weather conditions can hardly calculate. As Figure 2. shows different saturated zones expressed different land use risk, which suppose at least two suggestions. On the one hand the hazarded areas are exponentially increased by different added saturated zones; meanwhile the land use risk is higher and higher. On the other hand there is a need for an adequate field specified sustainable agricultural production which can take into consideration the actual risk of excess water inundation with different saturated zones.</p><p id="Pg617">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 618 Conclusions Reasonable and preventive management of agricultural areas requires satisfactory information on the spatial and temporal distribution of excess water. The knowledge about moisture conditions of variably saturated zone of soil and their management are one of the main possibilities that allow agronomist significantly raises the fertility of soils in sustainable cropping systems (Mikulec, 2007). The improvement of the efficiency of agricultural water management (vertical and horizontal drainage conditions of the soil profile, prevention of over-saturation and excess water inundation) are necessary, mainly on those areas, where the water management category is moderate based on Várallyay categories. The results assisted and enabled the land use planning of the inundated and saturated areas by excess water, as well as the calculation of different water management and land use scenarios.

TÓTH 1 – Judit L. HALÁSZ 1 – Zsolt KOTROCZÓ – György VINCZE 1 – László SIMON2 1 Institute of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, College of Nyíregyháza, H-4400, Nyíregyháza, Sóstói u. 31/B., e-mail: dobrone@nyf.hu 2 Department of Land and Environmental Management, College of Nyíregyháza, H-4400, Nyíregyháza, Sóstói u. 31/B. Abstract: This study focuses on the total cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc content of the soil in pot experiments as well as the corresponding metal contents in the ragweed plants growing on the aforementioned soils. By the end of the growing season, the percentage of metal content decreased in the pot soils. In comparison with the control plants, the treatment with 100 mg kg -1 of metals resulted in the increase of the Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn content of the roots. The individual application of Cu, Ni and Zn, however, increased the metal content of the leaves, whereas Cd, Cu and Ni rose the metal content of the inflorescence. With combined application of the four metals, the Cd, Cu and Ni content of the inflorescence tends to increase as compared to the control plants. The larger zinc content of the soil is primarily apparent in the roots. Keywords: heavy metal content, pot experimental, ragweed Introduction Large scale human disturbance is a common feature in habitats of ruderal plants such as earth hillocks, dunghills, landfill sites, roadsides and drainage ditches. In Hungary, ragweed is one of the most typical plants of such real ruderal sites (refuse dumps, ditches, wet areas) and it is also known as an allergenic plant. Due to unreasonable use of the environment, soils often ‘suffer’ from the frequently harmful stresses prevailing in the environment, which poses a threat on the other constituents of our environment, surface and subsurface water resources, the atmosphere near the surface and the living world (Várallyay, 2006; Fekete et al., 2007). According to Csathó et al. (2007), Kádár (2007) and Biró (2007), besides indicating the characteristic nutritional conditions, the leaves of plants growing in soils with large metal content tend to accumulate the available metals in their tissues in quantities that exceed the average volumes. Wang et al. (2004) mentioned that an evident difference existed in the contents of heavy metals in different parts of Paeonia ostii. The stem, leaf and root peel had larger contents of Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu. The accumulation factors of Zn and Cd were higher than those of Cu and Pb, but they were all smaller in root peel. Materials and methods Environmental conditions The impacts caused by cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc were examined both individually and in a combined manner, for all the four metals, with three repetitions and in randomised block arrangements, in the period of 2002– 2004. Both in the individual and combined treatments, the metal content was 100 mg kg-1, respectively. In the combined treatments, the pots contained 25-25 mg kg-1 of each examined metal (100 mg kg-1 on the aggregate – it was the largest combined metal content that still did not cause the death of ragweed seedlings). The metals were added to the pot soils as CdSO4, CuSO4, NiSO4, ZnSO4 and as aqueous solutions, and then the</p><p id="Pg619">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 620 soils were homogenised. One plant was grown in each pot. The four-leaved seedlings were planted in May. Depth of the individual pots was 45 cm, while the diameter of those was 55 cm, and each pots contained 55 kg of soil. In the pots, the sampling depth was 20 cm. Soil could be described by the following characteristics: CaCO3: 2 %; pH(KCl): 7,51; pH(H2O): 7,95; KA: 40 %; water capacity: 25 %; humus: 4,2 %; soil type: brown forest soil. Sampling and heavy metal analysis: The samples were hot air dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C to constant weight. The total cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) metal content of the homogenised and air dried ragweed samples was determined with ‘Analar’ concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) after full digestion throughout 12 hours (h). The digested samples were diluted to 10 cm3 with deionised water and analysed for Zn, Cd, Cu and Ni, using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES; type: Varian Vista-Pro Simultan ICP-AES) equipment. The analysis was done in the certified laboratory of Nyírség Water Treatment Company in Nyíregyháza. Results and discussion During the growing season, the percentage of metal content has decreased in pot soils. In control samples, decrease of cadmium content was 2%, while decreases of copper, nickel and zinc content were 0.8%, 13% and 24% respectively, in comparison with the initial concentration (Table 1).

With the addition of 100 mg kg-1 of metal in individual treatments, the initial concentration dropped by 15% for cadmium, 20% for copper, 54% for nickel and 67% for zinc, whereas the combined metal treatment brought about a decrease of 7% for cadmium, 19% for copper, 51% for nickel and 33% for zinc. Comparing the outcomes of the combined and individual treatments, the combined presence of the four metals apparently weakened the downward tendency in the metal content of the soils. This change was also reflected by the element content of the roots, leaves and inflorescence</p><p id="Pg620">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 621 of the ragweed (Table 2). Addition of 100 mg kg –1 of metals resulted in the increase of cadmium content in the organs of ragweed in comparison with the control plants (Table 2). The differences were rather significant in the roots and in the inflorescence. In general, there is straight correlation between the cadmium content of soils and plants (Simon, 2003; Kádár, 1991). Similarly to the figures of associated literature, increasing of cadmium content of the soil with 100 mg kg –1 results in the increase of cadmium content in all parts of ragweed, as compared to control plants. In case of inflorescence, combined application of metals showed the same relation. Table 2.

Means within the rows followed by the same letter are not statistically significant at P=0.05. In case of ragweeds which were grown in pots with 100 mg kg –1 copper content and were treated with all the four metals, copper contents in leaves and inflorescence were significantly higher than in control samples. Copper tends to interact with both the organic and inorganic substances of the soil, and accumulates in the upper layers (Kádár, 1991; Csathó, 1994). Copper content in the pots changed slightly (-19%) as compared to the initial concentration. In the plants, copper primarily accumulates in the roots, whereas the parts over the ground show smaller copper contents (Kádár, 1991). Similar results were obtained for the ragweeds, which grew in the control soils. In deviation from the data of associated literature, with the increase of the copper content of the soil, larger copper content could be measured both in the leaves and in staminate inflorescence. After the addition of nickel, the application of both 100 mg kg-1 of nickel and all the four metals brought about significantly larger nickel contents in comparison to the control plants in all plant samples. Nickel is fairly mobile in the soil, and also enters the plants where it is transported easily (Simon, 2003). Similarly to the relevant literary figures (Kádár, 1991), a positive correlation was found between the nickel contents of soil and plant samples. Addition of 100 mg kg-1 of zinc resulted in a</p><p id="Pg621">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 622 significantly larger zinc content in roots and leaves of the ragweed, while in the inflorescence, zinc content showed opposite tendency. In case of combined application of metals, larger zinc content was measured in the roots of the ragweed in comparison to the control plants, whereas the leaves and inflorescence contained less zinc. Zinc is one of the metal ions that can be taken up the most easily (Simon, 2003). Our results suggested that if there was just a small quantity of zinc in the soil (control), zinc accumulated in the parts of the plants above the ground. When the metal content of pot soils was increased with the addition of 100 mg kg-1 of zinc, larger quantities of zinc could be measured in the roots than in the leaves and staminate inflorescence. These latter findings support the literary data (Kádár, 1991; Csathó, 1994) according to which the majority of zinc accumulates in the roots. Conclusions The element contents of pot soils were increased with 100 mg kg-1 of cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc, and as a consequence of the increased element contents, the percentages of element contents showed larger differences than in the initial samples. In comparison with the control plants, in pot soils which were treated with 25 mg kg-1 of cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc respectively (i.e. 100 mg kg-1 of metal), metal concentrations were smaller than the initial metal concentrations of soil samples. When applied individually, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc were taken up in larger quantities than in the combined treatments. In comparison with the control plants, the 100 mg kg-1 of copper, nickel and zinc significantly increased the metal content in the leaves. The combined metals had a considerable impact on the cadmium, copper and nickel content of the leaves. The concentration of the examined metals changed in the inflorescence as a result of the treatments. In the staminate inflorescence of the ragweed, which grew in soils with a metal content of 100 mg kg-1, the largest quantity belonged to zinc, followed by copper and nickel, whereas cadmium was found in the smallest volume. This order is similar to the sequence ascertained in the combined application of the four metals.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 623 THE EFFECT OF CONSERVATION TILLAGE ON WATER REGIME IN SANDY LOAM SOIL Péter LÁSZLÓ 1 1 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1022 Budapest, Hermann Otto u. 15., laszlo@rissac.hu Abstract: In our long-term soil tillage experiment situated in Lower-Austria, the effects of conservation tillage systems on soil physical properties, hydro-physical characteristics and crop yield were examined in maize monoculture during ten years. Even though the results of bulk density and penetration resistant measurements show that direct drilling resulted soil compaction in topsoil in contrast with ridge tillage and conventional tillage, in case of crop yield were not considerable differences between the tillage treatments thanks to the soil moisture and plant available water content. Keywords: direct drilling, ridge tillage, soil compaction, soil water regime Introduction The most world-wide-spread, most harmful and hardly defendable form of soil degradations is the soil physical degradation, namely the soil compaction (Birkás et al. 2006). Compacted surface or near-surface soil (closing)layers induced by human activity or nature impede drainage and useful storage of precipitation arrived at the soil surface (Farkas et al. 2007). Due to unfavourable soil compaction, the probability of the development of extreme water regime situations is raised, while soil degradation processes strengthen and accelerate (Várallyay 2006). After all, the function ability of the soil is damaged and crop production becomes risky (Gyuricza et al. 2007). Since climate prognosis predicts that weather extremes will take place more often, extreme water regime situation can develop on several soil types. Its detrimental effect on crop production is already noticeable and probably it will be in the future as well. The soil use ensuring water drainage and its useful storage in soil can be the most effective and most important solution in the prevention and moderation of the development of extreme water regime situations. The assessment of the effects of conservation tillage systems is a recent issue of research. Soil tillage systems must be tested under local circumstances for proper introduction of conservation systems. For the sake of precise site-specification, direct drilling and ridge tillage were examined in our long-term trial. Materials and methods The research work was carried out at the experimental site (Geographical coordinates: =48º08’51’’, =15º42’08’’, 308 m above the sea level) in Lower Austria. The experiment was set up as a one-factor strip arranged soil tillage long-term trial by University of Applied Life Sciences and Natural Resources (BOKU) and Szent István University (SZIU) in 1996. The weather is determined by continental and maritime climate influenced by the closeness of the Alps as well. The area presents an average annual precipitation of 736 mm and mean annual temperature of 8,8 ºC (1901-2000). The soil is Endogleyic Fluvic Cambisol (Dystric, Siltic), with a base rock of fine-graded silt deposited during floods. The soil has good structure and favourable water regime, however it can be susceptible to compaction.</p><p id="Pg623">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 624 In the experiment three soil tillage systems were compared, namely direct drilling, ridge tillage and conventional ploughing in maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture. The size of a plot is 9 x 50 m= 450 m2, with three replications in split-plot design. Fertilisers and pesticides were uniformly applied to all treatments. Soil physical properties such as bulk density, porosity and penetration resistance examination were carried out to evaluate soil compaction. For the evaluation of water regime moisture content, water holding capacity and crop yield were analysed. The effects of treatments were determined by using multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). F statistics was used to separate significant differences (Fischer LSD-test). Significance is indicated at P&lt;0.05. Results and discussion The highest soil bulk density value was measured under direct drilling at all measured depths (Figure 1). Regarding total porosity, it can be stated that the lowest value was measured under direct drilling. Apart from the values measured at 0 to 10 cm, where direct drilling seemed to be the most compacted, direct drilling gave not the highest penetration resistance values under 10 cm (Figure 1). 0 10 20 30 40 50 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 1,7 Soil bulk density (g.cm -3 ) S o il d ep th ( cm ) No-till Ridge-till Ploughing 0 10 20 30 40 50 0,5 1,0 1,5 2,0 Penetration resistance (MPa) S o il d ep th ( cm ) No-till Ridge-till Ploughing Figure 1.

The highest calculated plant available water content was determined in direct drilling at the depth of 5 to 10 cm, while at 15 to 20 cm, conventional tillage showed higher values (Figure 2).</p><p id="Pg624">VII.

At the depth of 10 to 20 cm, differences found in soil water content in the upper-most layer were equalized, but in lower layers differences were experienced again due to the different effects of treatments. At the lower-most layer soil moisture contents were the same (Figure 3). Maize yield harvested in direct drilling (6.6 t.ha-1) was less compared to cultivated treatments. Yield obtained in the case of conventional tillage (7.6 t.ha-1) was higher than in ridge tillage (7.1 t.ha-1).

Conclusions Our results shows that the soil is more compacted in undisturbed direct drilling than in the case of soil disturbance by tillage (Table 1 and 2). The effect of soil tillage or the lack of soil tillage can be easily revealed in the topsoil by the evaluation of physical condition. Treatments have different effects in depth of course. As for plant available water content, there is no considerable difference between direct drilling and cultivated treatments according to water capacity values determined by undisturbed soil samples. Consequently, the tillage has no direct effect on the potentially available water. As the result of the measurements show, the highest soil moisture content and plant avaiable water content were found in the topsoil of direct drilling, while the lowest values were measured in ridge tillage.

As an effect of irrigation the significant difference between plant weight and yield in the three water supply treatments (regularly, cut off 25 days before harvest and unirrigated) we measured. Cut off irrigation could help us to maximise our profit, because in the year 2007, the cut off plants got higher production of dry matter/plant than the regularly irrigated and the unirrigated. Keywords: tomato, drip irrigation, Brixº, dry matter production Introduction In our days one of the most important problem is how to save our environment and take the biggest profit. The augment of human population increasingly put the water forward, because we had to obtain fresh water to everybody in the world and this is a limited quantity element. So we had to find the way, how to get less water in agriculture, to take the biggest yield. The climatic changeableness (Ligetvári et al. 2006), which can traceable in the soil (Farkas et al. 2005) inspired us to enable irrigation in processing tomato in Hungarian climate, and in the growing season we had to find the optimal water dose (Helyes et al. 2005). Soil type is determinate factor in yield (Bhattarai et al. 2006) and the amount of irrigation water. The higher temperature caused higher amount of transpiration, which effects lower sugar content in the berries (Balázs 1985), so we had to reduce the plants temperature with irrigation. Drip irrigation is the best alternative (Ayars et al. 1999) to save water and get the biggest yield. The highest stoma conductance has found in the rapid fruit grown (Gibert et al. 2005), so in this part of the growing season we had to take care the most. There are many ways to get information about the irrigation efficiency. Canopy surface temperature and stomatal conductance also could be an effective tool (Schober et al. 2007) to check the irrigation efficacy. Irrigation essentially allocate the fruits dry matter (Candido et al. 2000) and measured three different varieties and Brigade got the best result in fruit size dry matter and soluble solids content. Materials and methods We conducted our measurement in the Experimental Farm of the Institute of Horticultural Technology, Faculty of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, at Szent István University, Gödöllő. The experimental field is brown forest soil, with mechanical composition are sand, sandy-clay and the subsoil water is below 5m, therefore it cannot influence the water turnover. The whole area of the experiment was 300m2 and the area of one plot was 46m2. Seeds were sown on the 2nd of April 2007. in greenhouse and transplanted on the 14th of May 2007. Brigade F1 variety was used in twin rows, 0.4m spacing inside the raw and 1.2m between adjacent twin rows, the space between the</p><p id="Pg627">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 628 plans in the row was 0.4m. Nutrition supply gave out when a plants transplanted. Agroblen 18-8-16 (nitrogene-phosphorus-potassium) was used, which disengage in a 23 month period. There were three different irrigated parts of the plants, which were drip irrigated. One of the irrigation types were regularly irrigated in the growing season, one was cut off irrigated by 25 days before harvest and the unirrigated. Irrigation water was given out according to the air temperature (daily irrigation water (mm) = average daily temperature×0.2). OMSZ (Országos Meteorológiai Szolgálat ~ National Meteorological Institute) forecast were used to calculate with the probable air temperature. The canopy temperature was measured by Raynger II infrared thermometer. We had taken our canopy surface temperature measurement every day from the 9th of July to the 23rd of August. We had measured canopy surface temperature every day between 1pm. and 2pm. o’clock, because PAR has the most activity at this time of the day in the measured period. At the end of the growing period, 5-5 plants were harvested from each irrigation treatments and from the unirrigated. Brixº was measured with refraktometer, one sample contains 6 berries from each type. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the difference between the used irrigation treatments. In the selected period from the 9th of July to the 8th of August the unirrigated plans prove the highest temperature. Till the 30th of July the regularly and the cut off plants both got the same temperature. When the cut off plants irrigation was given up, their temperatures exceed the regularly irrigated plants. The 30th of July was a rainy day so we could not get measurement at that day. After that time we found that the cut off plants got higher temperature than the regularly irrigated, and approached more and more the unirrigated plants, but it never reached it in the growing season. 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 16,07 20,07 24,07 28,07 1,08 5,08 9,08 C regularly irrigated cut off 25 days unirrigated Figure 1.

Figure 2 shows the effect of irrigation on the plants mass weight and yield. The difference in both cases is significant, in plants mass weight p=3×10-3 and in plants yield p=1×10-3.

From these two parameters the dry matter production could recounted. The cut off plants got the highest amount of dry matter production so in the year 2007 the cut off plant got the highest profit. This table contains the % differences among these three parameters. Conclusions The following conclusions were drawn from this study: Regularly irrigated plant stands got the lowest canopy surface temperature, and after the cut off plant stands were finished to irrigate, its data approach to the unirrigated. Irrigation influenced in the plants weight and yield. There are significant differences between both parameters. The irrigation lowers the berries Brixº, but in the weather type of 2007 the cut off plants in processing tomato got higher amount of dry matter production, which is the determinative parameter in converse industrial realization. The cut off technology could help us to save water and get bigger profit. References Ayars J.E. - Phene C.J. - Hutmacher R.B. - Davis K.R. - Schoneman R.A. - Vail S.S. - Mead R.M.: 1999.

A tool for these efforts is to involve new species and types of different vegetables. In the case of peppers there are some promising wild or partially domesticated species and types. Two years of experiments in Hungary under cold forcing conditions proved that there are opportunities of growing several types of chile on loamy –send soil under greenhose. Different parameters were evaluated such as the time from sowing to the first anthesis, the time from sowing to the full maturity of the first fruit, and the cumulated yield. C. chinense type “cP” was the earliest in first fruit mature (148 days from sowing), which makes it suitable for forcing. Capsicum annuum cv. Fogo F1, C. annuum cv. Dieng F1 are excellent for growing under cold forcing conditions in Hungary due to the high yield which reached 4966 g m -2 in the case of C. annuum cv. Dieng F1 . The variable shape, colour and special aromatic taste are also added values in the case of wild types which could make them suitable for growing. For these reasons C. pendulum cv. Aji Jimón and C. chinense “cP” are recommended for production however their yield could be lower than yield of hybrids. The period of intensive fruit ripening should be extended to ensure a better distribution of the production. Keywords: chile, peppers, Capsicum,cold forcing. Introduction Nowadays customers are looking for new food. There are numerous possibilities for improving the diversity of horticultural products. In the case of peppers the wild or partially domesticated relatives provide opportunities for these efforts. The widening of the range of consumption can give dietetic benefits as well. Maturity stage of solanaceous fruits determine components (Helyes et al., 2006), and it depends on the time between anthesis and ripening (Pék and Helyes, 2004). Peppers have significant antioxidant content as well such as carotinoids, tocoferol, ascorbic acid. The level of these components could be higher under organic farming conditions as it was reported in the case of spice pepper by Daood at al (2006). The wild, partially domesticated Capsicum species are very important source of resistance (Bosland and Votava, 1999) In the future commercial production will only be possible using pepper varieties with a high level of resistance (Zatykó, 2006). The objective of this experiment was to prove the growing possibilities of different chile cultivars and wild Capsicum species on easily warming loamy-sand soil in cold forcing based on the evaluation of different parameters, such as the number of days from sowing to the first anthesis, the number of days from sowing to the full maturity of the first fruit, and the cumulated yield. Materials and methods More than 50 different types and varieties of chile peppers were involved in the experiments of 2 years. These chiles belong to different species, like Capsicum annuum, C. pubescens, C. chinense, C. chacoense, C. baccatum, C. pendulum, C. praetermissum,</p><p id="Pg631">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The date of sowing was 13th of February. On 1st of March the seedlings were transplanted into 9 cm diameter pots filled with Rekyva peat (Rekyva 2D: Baltic peat, 4000 g m-3 lime scale powder, 1000 g m-3 dolomite powder; 100 g m-3 PG Mix -14:16:18). The plants were kept in greenhouse at temperature between 20-25 °C. On 24th of April they were planted out to Richel type greenhouse to a space of 80 x 40 cm into easily warming loamy-sand soil. Due to the strong growing habit of the examined types, a simple trellis system was necessary. The shoots were held by a pair of wire in different height. During the culture compound fertilizers were used for fertigation. The following amounts of active components per week were given: from 18th of May 2.80 g m-2 N; 1.42 g m-2 P2O5; 4.63 g m -2 K2O; 0.11 g m -2 MgO; 1.49 g m-2 Ca; from 31th of May 2.76 g m-2 N; 1.10 g m-2 P2O5; 5.64 g m -2 K2O; 0.09 g m -2 MgO; 1.16 g m-2 Ca; from 7th of July 2.89 g m-2 N; 0.43 g m-2 P2O5; 5.38 g m -2 K2O; 0.25 g m-2 MgO; 1.37 g m-2 Ca. Integrated pest control was applied. During the 7 months of the culture 3 chemical treatments were necessary: 10th of May (1 l ha-1 Unifosz; 0.2 l ha-1 Spintor; 1 l ha-1 Sumilex; 500 l ha-1 water) 16th of June (1 l ha-1 Applaud 25 WP; 0.2 l ha-1 Spintor; 0.75 l ha-1 Amistar; 1000 l ha-1 water) 13th of October (0.8 l ha-1 Actara 25 WG; 0.7 l ha-1 Amistar; 1000 l ha-1 water). Parasites and predators were populated on two different dates for biological pest contorol. On 17 th of May: Orius laevigatus (0.7 piece m-2), Amblyseius cucumeris (100 pieces m-2) and on 22nd of June: Orius laevigatus (0.7 piece m-2), Amblyseius cucumeris (100 pieces m-2), Aphydius erwi (0.2 piece m-2), Aphydius colemani (0.5 piece m-2). The first fruits were harvested on 26th of June. Further pickings were done once a week until 16th of November. C. annuum ‘Bandai F1’, C. annuum ‘Dieng F1’ were picked in red, full mature and green stage as well. All other types were harvested only in full maturity. The date of the first anthesis, the date of ripening of the first fruit and the yield (scale: Entech NP-3L, max. 3000 g, d=1 g) were recorded during the experiment.</p><p id="Pg632">VII.

The deviation in the fruits harvested in green stage was high due to the fact that it is hard to decide which fruit reached the full size and which is ready to harvest. Red habanero type C. chinense gave the significantly lowest yield (611 g m-2). The major volume of the harvested fruits was realized in August. Conclusions The experiments demonstrated that some of the examined chile types can be produced successfully under cold forcing conditions in Hungary. C. chinense type “cP” was the earliest in first fruit maturity (148 days from sowing), which makes it suitable for forcing. The hybrids as it was expected can give higher yield than other wild types of chile. C. annuum cv. Fogo F1, C. annuum cv. Dieng F1 are excellent for growing under cold forcing conditions in Hungary. The type of C. chinense red habanero examined by us was completely unsuitable for production under greenhouse. The variable shape, colour and special aromatic taste are also added values in the case of wild types which could make them suitable for growing. For these reasons C. pendulum cv. Aji Jimón and C. chinense “cP” are recommended for production however their yield could be lower. The period of intensive fruit ripening should be extended to ensure a better distribution of the production. References Andrews. J. 1995. Pepperes: the domesticated Capsicums.

KOVÁCS Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H1022 Budapest, Herman Ottó str. 15. HUNGARY, 1 E-mail: koos@rissac.hu Abstract: A Hungarian CERES based model (4M) was used for modelling the seasonal changes of the available nutrients in the soil, and the dynamics of the whole nutrient balance. Changes of soil moisture content of the profile has also been measured and simulated. These data are key for any modeller to test the capability of a given crop model. 4M performed well in estimation of water and nitrogen dynamics. Phosphorus and potassium dynamics are more complicated in nature. Availability for plant uptake is a difficult question to follow and even so to measure. The results certainly give a step forward in modelling of P- and K-cycles.. Keywords: seasonal dynamic, Nitrogen, Potassium, Phoshorus, 4M simulation model, Introduction Hypotheses and antecedents In early 80’s Kovács (1982) questioned the theory of temporal stability of AL-P and AL-K values, the generally accepted and applied index of availability of P and K in Hungary. He supposed an agronomic significance of the seasonal dynamics of nutrients in soils. From that on, a lot of trials were made to prove or disprove these statements. Statistical changes have been proven between probes in time but factors of changes were not identified mainly due uncertainty of temporal versus spatial differences (Sarkadi et al., 1986; Kádár, 1986; Kovács, 2004). In case the changes are significant they have to be forecasted (simulated) for the sake of the necessary interventions. The crop models try to simulate the functioning of the atmosphere-soil-plant system with the help of computers. These models can be effective tools in research, education and solving agricultural and environmental protection related problems. Finally, they contribute to the sustainable (agricultural) developement (Várallyay, 2006). Materials and methods Few data are available for seasonal changes of soil phosphorus and potassium especially considering the whole rooted zone of the soil. For calibration we needed long term data from well documented field experiments. RISSAC has an experimental station at Nagyhörcsök (calcareous loam chernozem soil), where several long term experiments have been carried out. Kádár’s (1986) has 64 NPK treatments in two reps. Four combinations of balanced NPK treatments (N0P0K0, N1P1K1, N2P2K2 and N3P3K3) were selected for the study. Nitrogen (0, 100, 200, 300 kg ha-1 year-1) was added yearly in two equal portions. P and K (0, 500, 1000, 1500 kg ha-1) were given at the fall of 1999 and nothing from that time. Both reps were sampled (each sample was composed of 12– 12 sub-samples) till a depth of 60 cm in 20 cm intervals 19 times in the year of 2003 (Koós-Németh, 2006; Koós-Németh, 2007) and 12 times in 2005. Water and NPK nutrient status of the soil were monitored, biomass of the hay was measured after each cut from 2000 when the grass mix was sawn in the experiment.In 4M simulation modeling package (Fodor et al., 2002) water and nitrogen modules were inherited from</p><p id="Pg635">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 636 CERES model (Jones-Kiniry, 1986). The phosphorus model has been adopted from Jones et al (Jones et al., 1984a; Sharpley et al, 1984; Jones et al., 1984b). The potassium model was designed by our modeling team (Figure 1). P and K modeling were simplified by the practical consideration that the Hungarian laboratory analyses aim to measure AL-P and AL-K pools. AL-P includes the labile and active pools, AL-K includes solution and adsorbed (exchangeable) pools. Figure 1. Scheme of K model Grass model has been developed based on CERES Wheat. A number of parameter has been changed and the cut and re-growth has been modeled. Results and discussion Soil moisture measurements were mostly reliable. The new 4M grass model works well for water balance (Figure 2). Irregularities occurred at some dates. Figure 2. Soil water content, 0-20 cm, Treatment: N2P2K2</p><p id="Pg636">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 637 (Nagyhörcsök, calcareous loam chernozem soil)Biomass production can be modeled well until the major limiting factor is water. It is almost impossible to differentiate between temporal and spatial differences of nutrient contents in the soil. The relationship is loose between AL-solubility and plant availability of nutrients and the factors that influence them are different (Figure 3). Figure 3. AL-K content in soil 0-20 cm Treatment:, Treatment: N2P2K2 (Nagyhörcsök, calcareous loam chernozem soil) Major shift of paradigm and technical innovations are needed in sampling and analysis of plant nutrients in soils. 4M grass model needs improvements to model proper Nuptake and N-stress. Unrealistically low uptake caused N accumulation in soil through the years (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Cereal Research Communications 638 Conclusions In practical applications the model can be used to prepare agro-technological advise (fertilization, irrigation, etc.) for farmers, and to carry out economical analyses on farm level. Based on the experimental results, the fate and behaviour of the nutrient in the soil can be characterized and the residual amount can be taken into account during the calculation of the NPK fertilizer demand of the next crops. In relation to these experimental results a new fertilization advisory system was introduced (Kádár, 2007; Csathó, 2007).

Keywords: economic land value, D-e-Meter index, Standard Gross Margin Introduction In the case of economies in transition, such as in Hungary the formation of agricultural land market have not yet been finished. There aren’t reliable databases of market land prices. The land acquisition prices often don’t reflect the true economical value of land. But the land value is needed for more economical purposes (e.g. optimization of land use, land acquisition, land mortgage, land taxation, etc.). The current system of the economic land valuation based on the Hungarian system of land quality assessment, the Gold Crown (GC, in Hungarian: Aranykorona, AK) system. The GC system was introduced in Hungary in the second half of the XIX century. After more than 130 years’ use of this system there is need for a modern land quality index which could replace the obsolete GC index (Tóth - Fekete Farkas - Szűcs, 2004). In July 2001 started D-e-Meter project, which main objective was to develop an Internet-based intelligent system of the land quality assessment (Gaál et al., 2003). The new system of the economic land valuation is based on the D-e-Meter land quality index which is calculated on-line with the help of a complex Geographical Information System of soil and other maps (Hermann et al., 2006). The concept of D-e-Meter land quality index has being extended from croplands for other land uses, such as grasslands (Dér, 2003) and forests (Bidló et al., 2003). Materials and methods The developed method of the economic land valuation based on the Present Value Model (Randall – Castle, 1985; Lloyd, 1993; Shigeto, 2005): the land value estimated in it by dividing the estimated land rent by the real interest rate. The land rent as the income share attributable to land is hardly to be separated from other production factors, so we were forced to look for such a methodological solution by means of which the profit-yielding capacity of different land-qualities can be estimated. In our project the Gross Margin (GM) was used for these purposes. In our earlier publications we described the algorithm of the estimation of the GM value (Vinogradov-Szűcs, 2007, Szűcs et al., 2007a) for parcels.</p><p id="Pg639">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 640 This model contains the elements of the Hedonic Estimation Models (Chicoine, 1981; Dundofd et al, 1985; Shi et al., 1997): we take into consideration an infrastructure (distance to the closest dispatch stations, to railway station, port, processing plant; distance to a settlement with more than 1000 inhabitants, distance to road network, access to the highways in minutes) as an correction effect on the land rent. Characteristics of the working system were reported in details by Tóth et al. (2006). The study site was used a contiguous area of Zala country. Results and discussion The basis of the unified system is the D-e-Meter point, establishing the equivalence between specific yield and Gross margin. The logic of the system can be interpreted as shown on the figure 1. (Szűcs et al. 2006): Figure 1. Estimating of corrected GM value of cadastral unit The logical process of estimating of corrected GM value is as follows:  The D-e-Meter points will be determined in ecologic block of the system on land plot level (Tóth et al., 2006).  The basic return of lands (basic Gross margin) will be incorporated into the input data of the system in exogenous way after separated representative sampling.  The stratification levels of map (land plot, parcel, topographical plot number) will be arranged on the level of topographical plot numbers. Thus, it will be the level, where the complex Euro-returns value appears. (It is also in conformity with practical applications, since all the land-estate questions are arranged according to topographical plot numbers or their fractions.)  The basic land returns will be determined separately by regional levels, since there are big differences in infrastructural environment influencing the economic values, and they have to be taken into consideration during the construction of the system.  The externalities are treated as corrections of basic Gross margin by means of mathematical formulae and incorporated into input data in exogenous way (Fekete Farkas-Szűcs, 2005).</p><p id="Pg640">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 641  The basic returns value will be corrected by correction factors (after having read off the maps by means of mathematical formula). The structure of correction factors has been described earlier by Szűcs et al. (2007a, b). The correction factors are read from digitized maps, therefore then interpretation is completely automatic in the GIS system. In connection with present research work, we have applied such an estimation method what deduces the share (γ-value) of land rent within total income from the conditions of real land market. The mechanism of land-price estimation is illustrated on Figure 2. Figure 2. Estimation of land value The system contains the possibilities of the monitoring of the estimated land value: if the difference between the land market value and the estimated land value is significant, we will take the correction of the gammas and GM values. Conclusions The developed methodology of the economic land valuation has practically combined the land prices calculated on return basis with land market prices. It takes into consideration the ecological differences between land estates, but also reflects the demand-supply relations for land. The developed system is automated, it based on the existing GIS system. The automatic algorithms are easy to update, can be made legally bond and provide a transparent system of land taxation, calculation of subsidies, appropriation, land mortgage.</p><p id="Pg641">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek 3 Department of Biology, University of J.J. Strossmayer in Osijek Abstract: The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of soil on early growth of three white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cultivars obtained from three different countries and to examine relationships between pre-screened traits of seedlings and traits of three month old plants. Pre-screening for germination, temperature and pH tolerance indicated that temperature and pH decrease significantly influenced on germination and seedling growth of cultivars. In conditions of spring temperatures higher than average soil substrate and two different soils collected from a different source plots influenced on emergence, plant width, internode length of stolon, leaf number, leaf-petiole weight and stolon weight of clovers. Pre-screened germination energy and germination were significantly correlated with emergence, plant height, internode length of stolon, petiole length and flower number of three month old plants. Keywords: white clover, soil, pH, temperature, early growth Introduction It is evidenced that soil as well as climatic conditions affects early seedling growth, plant establishment and crop production (Balla et al., 2006; Bertic et al., 2007; ElTayeb, 2006; Venugopalan, 2007). However, there is a lack of information about cultivar differences of seedling establishment under abiotic stress conditions or agronomic advantages of tolerant genotypes in terms of plant establishment, growth and development (Singer et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006). For the maximum efficiency in production, it would be useful to identify cultivars superior in specific growth conditions as early as possible. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of soil on early growth of three white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cultivars obtained from three different countries and to examine relationships between pre-screened traits of seedlings and traits of three month old plants. Materials and methods Seed of three white clover cultivars (Jura, Regal, Rivendel) obtained from three different countries (Germany, USA and Denmark, respectively) were pre-screened for germination, temperature and pH tolerance by the modified procedure proposed by ISTA (2003). Solutions were modified from the water of the public water supply (pH7.27) to the water with pH-6 and pH-5 by addition of HCl (1 M) to desired pH. Seedlings were grown in germination chamber at the constant temperatures of 20 or 10oC. Pre-screening was performed in three replications for each of three cultivars, three solutions and two temperatures in 2006. Germination energy (%), germination (%), root and stem length of seedlings (cm) were recorded. Screening was conducted at the location Osijek (altitude 90 m, lat 45o32’N, long 18o44’E) over March–June period of 2007. Containers with 24 holes of 170 cm3 volume were fulfilled by commercial soil substrate and two different soils collected from a</p><p id="Pg643">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Monthly mean temperatures and many years’ averages were shown in Table 2. Soil moisture was kept on approximately 60 % of field water capacity. Table 2.

Emergence (%) as well as the traits of three months old white clover plants (plant height and width (cm), internode length of stolon (cm) and thickness of stolon (mm), median leaflet length and width (cm), petiole length (cm) and thickness (mm), number of flowers and leafs, leafpetiole weight (g) and stolon weight (g)) were recorded. Data were collected from all available plants and analysed by SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc., 2002-2003). Results and discussion Significant effects (p=0.01) for cultivar, temperature, pH and cultivar x temperature x pH interaction were found by ANOVA of pre-screened traits. In general, temperature of 10oC decreased the germination energy and germination. pH decrease influenced on each cultivar differently. However, the most of the seedling traits performance was better on pH 7 and 5 than on pH 6. Means for the effect cultivar x temperature x pH are shown in Table 3. Although well watered, plant trait performance undoubtedly suffered damage in conditions of high temperatures during screening. The influence of high temperatures on plant growth and transpiration were also reported by Huang et al. (1998), Novak and Havrila (2006), Postiglione et al. (2000). ANOVA of screened data revealed significant influence of soil on emergence, plant width, internode length of stolon, leaf number, leaf-petiole and stolon weight (Table 4). Similar to results of pre-screening, the highest emergence and internode length of stolon was obtained at the soil with pH(H2O)-5.61.</p><p id="Pg644">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 645 However, plant width as well as leaf-petiole and stolon weight were highest at the soil with pH(H2O)-6.27. The results of this study suggested wider range of white clover pH tolerance than reported by Andre (2004) and confirmed suggestion of Brauer and Staley (2005) on potential genetic differences in tolerance to acid soil conditions.

Cereal Research Communications 646 Cultivars were found to differ from each other in emergence, plant width, internode length of stolon, leaf number and stolon weight. The revealed differences among cultivars were in agreement with previously analyses carried out in other species (Balogh et al., 2007; Hunyadi Borbėly et al., 2007). Pre-screened germination energy was significantly correlated with emergence (r=0.42*) and flower number (r=0.45*) of three months old plants. Germination was correlated with emergence (r=0.45*), plant height (r=-50**), internode length of stolon (r=0.40*) and petiole length (r=-0.44*). Obtained correlations indicated that the seedling pre-screening may provide information on seedling establishment, growth and development under abiotic stress conditions. Conclusions The results demonstrated genetic variations of white clovers in early growth responses to different soils and temperature stress. Estimated correlations between data obtained by laboratory pre-screening and data obtained by soil screening suggested that the early stage testing may be suitable for identifying cultivars superior in specific growth conditions.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Sv Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Stability of 9 dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) genotypes across 2 locations and 3 years with respect to grain yield were tested in east Croatia. The object was to assess genotype-environment interactions and determinate stable genotypes. The analysis of variance of the 9 genotypes in 6 environments shows that genotype (G), location (L), year (Y) and their interaction (GxL, GxY, LxY) were significant (P&lt;0.01) for dry pea grain yield. Significant GxL effects indicated the necessity for testing pea genotypes in Croatia at multiple locations. The biplot shows that the genotypes Erbi and Bohatyr are best suited for cultivation in a wide range of environments. The genotype Primus is well-suited for cultivation in poor rainfalls environments. No genotype has superior performance in all environments. Keywords: Pisum sativum, GxE interaction, AMMI model, yield stability Introduction Dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) is the major once and the cheapest source of protein, as compared to another protein crops. It is a popular crop in a wide range of climatic and soil conditions of the central, north-west and eastern parts of Europe. Pea yields are sensitive to numerous environmental factors such as water stress, frost and height temperatures (Biarnes-Dumoulin et al., 1996; Elkoca and Kantar, 2006; Lesznyak et al., 2007). Passing climatic changes influence to instability of natural environment as well as hydro system which results in even more common extreme weather conditions (Stehlova, 2007). Early-maturing dry pea genotypes have been developed in pea breeding programs especially for the semiarid areas of south-east Europe. However, there is little information relating to the assessment of the magnitude of GEI and its influence on yields of pea cultivars grown in a range of environments in south Panonian region (area between river Drava and Sava). The analysis of the genotype × environmental interaction, which indicates the stability of genotypes, has always been part of plant breeding programms before the release of varieties for commercial cultivation (Backer et al., 1988; Drezner et al., 2007). The eastern area of Croatia (part of Panonian region) has a reliable rainfall of 650-700 mm (Penzar et al., 2000). In last decade rainfall is extremely variable and erratic during the growth season and over years. The primary goals of multi-environment trials are to identify superior cultivars for the target region, and to find ideal cultivar that has high yield combined with a low degree of oscillation by environment. Kaya et al. (2002) state that the combination of analysis of variance and principal components analysis in the AMMI model, along with prediction assessment, is a valuable approach for understanding GEI and obtaining better yield estimates. The results can be graphed in a useful biplot that shows both main and interaction effects for both the genotypes and environments. The aim of the investigation was to analyze GEI and describes adaptation in pea genotypes yield performance in East Croatia, during 2003 to 2005 by means of the AMMI model.</p><p id="Pg647">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 648 Materials and methods The 9 pea (Pisum sativum L.) genotypes are analysed this research. Most of them types originated from there are or uses in the wide production in neighboring countries (Austria, Hungary, Czech). The trials were conducted at two locations (Osijek 45º32΄N 18º45΄E, and Nova Gradiska 45º13΄Ń 17º18΄E) during three year (2003-2005). Some agro-climatic data and soil type during the conduct of the research is provided in Table 1. The general water balance was estimated for each environment based on the differences between rainfall in growing season and the value of the use total water need for average pea grain yield of 3000 kg. Estimate of the total water need was calculated according to Siddique et al. (2001) equation. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications. Plot size was same in the both locations: basic plot was 12m2 and accounting plot size was 10m2. The seeding rate for all cultivars was 120 seeds m-2. Table 1.

The combined analysis of variance according to the AMMI analysis was performed using the CropStat software (CropStat for Windows Ver. 7.2., 2007). To graphically explain the GEI and adaptation of pea genotypes to the environments, the AMMI model 1 biplot was used where the IPCA 1 scores were plotted against the mean yield. Results and discussion Results of analyses of variance for dry pea grain yield (Table 2) showed highly significant (P&lt;0.01) differences between genotypes (G), locations (L), years (Y) and their interaction (GxL, GxY, LxY), except the interaction GxLxY. Significant GxL effects suggested that genotypes reacted differently under varying locations, and indicated the necessity for testing pea genotypes in Croatia at multiple locations. The multi-environment traits and yield stability is most important for breeders and farmers to minimize crop failure, especially in environments with water problem. Several studies (Biarnes-Dumoulin et al., 1996; Elkoca and Kantar, 2006; Lesznyak et al., 2007) with peas showed that they are sensitive to drought stress and high temperature. The analysis of variance for AMMI model is given in Table 3. Genotype, environment and GxE interaction main-effects (sum of squares GxE) accounted for 87.54%, 3.15% and 9.31% respectively of the total sum of squares. The GxE sum of squares was 2.9 times higher than that of the genotypes, which indicated substantial differences in genotypic</p><p id="Pg648">VII.

A breakdown of the GxE interaction into the first three IPCAs were significant (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01) and shows that the GxE (SS) was spread in decreasing order of magnitude 53.96%, 27.13% and 9.32% respectively of the GxE SS. This made it possible to construct the biplot and calculate genotypes and environments effects (Kaya et al., 2002; Li et al., 2006). Table 2.

When looking at the environments it is clear that there is a good variation in the different environments sampled. Relatively low rainfall and higher temperatures in vegetation season 2003 (April-June) resulted in yield reduction and isolated environments A and D as low yield’s sites in biplot (Figure 1). The high yielding environments are E, F and C. E and F are at north eastern location Osijek, and C is at location Nova Gradiska. The environment E was most discriminating as indicated by the longest distance. This is unexpected, because the eastern area at Croatia historically prone to drought and high temperatures during the flowering period. The genotypes Bohatyr and Erbi are specifically adapted to the higher yielding environments, and Bohatyr was best for high yielded environments E and F. Considering only the IPCA 1 scores Luzsanyi and Gold were the more unstable genotypes, and also adapted to the higher yielding or more favorable environments. Genotypes adapted to the lower yielding environments are Eiffel, Adept, Isabella and Primus. The most stable genotype just considering IPCA 1 score was Baccara. The genotype Baccara was more stable but lower yielding than Erbi. GEI patterns revealed by AMMI plots indicate that dry pea genotypes are narrowly adapted. No genotype has superior performance in all environments.</p><p id="Pg649">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 650 Figure 1. AMMI biplot for grain yield pea of genotypes and environments Conclusions The analyses of variance of 9 genotypes in 6 environments shown that GEI was significant, and that genotype has superior performance in all environments. AMMI plots clearly showing that the genotypes Erbi, Baccara and Bochatyr are less responsive to changed environmental conditions and can be grown over rang of environments in rainfall problematic area of east Croatia. The genotype Erbi was the best in combining yield stability and productivity. References Becker H.C., Leon J. 1988. Stability analysis in plant breeding. Plant Breeding, 101: 1. 1-23.

Fifteen cultivars/populations of differing geographical origin were evaluated. Investigation was carried out at location Osijek for a period of two years (2004 and 2005). Field trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Ten agronomic traits were analysed: dry matter yield, number of stems per plant, plant height, regeneration after cutting, protein yield, number of internodes per stem, leaf to stem ratio, content of crude protein, neutral and acid detergent fibre. High yields and favourable values for the most of the investigated traits were found for Australian cultivars Genesis and Prime, Hungarian cultivar KM Norbert, Argentinean cultivar Barbara and American cultivar Magnum V. Therefore, these alfalfa cultivars could be considered as a valuable genetic material for the alfalfa improvement program. Keywords: worldwide alfalfa collection, cultivar,soil, population, agronomic traits Introduction Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is the most important perennial forage legume in Croatia. It plays a crucial role in sustainable agricultural systems due to its adaptation to lowinput or drought-stressed conditions. Also, alfalfa improves forage quality due to high protein content and has positive impact on nitrogen balance and soil fertility (Annicchiarico et al., 2006; Poti et al., 2007; Sipos and Halasz, 2007). The erosion of diversity in the most of the cultivated species emphasizes the need to collect and investigate new germplasm as genetic resources for future breeding research. In recent years different natural resources have gained importance (Hunyadi Borbely et al., 2007). Alfalfa is distributed worldwide and grown in highly contrasting environments. This extensive geographical adaptation promotes genetic variation and gives us the opportunity to use diverse gene pools. The objectives of this study were to determine variation for important agronomic traits of alfalfa collection and to identify valuable germplasm that could be used in alfalfa breeding programs. Materials and methods Plant material, experimental design, soil characteristics and weather conditions Fifteen alfalfa (Medicago spp.) genotypes (cultivars and populations) of a worldwide collection were analysed in this study (Table 1). Cultivar Vuka and the breeding population L-XX were developed by the alfalfa breeding program at Osijek Agricultural Institute. The foreign materials were collected from a gene banks, breeding institutions, and commercial producers. Total of 108 seeds of each genotype were sown in a peat pellets on March 12, 2004 and grown under glasshouse conditions up to four to five leaf stage. Young plants were transplanted on April 21, 2004, and grown two years under field conditions in Osijek</p><p id="Pg651">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 652 (eutric cambisol: pH in H2O = 6.22; pH in 1n KCl = 5.01; hydrolytical acidity 4.14 cmol kg-1; AL-soluble P2O5 and K2O = 19.7 and 25.3 mg 100 g -1, respectively; humus content 2.17 %). Experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Each plot included 36 spaced plants (0.50 x 0.50 m) of each genotype. Average annual temperatures for the investigated period (Osijek Weather Bureau: 11.20C and 10.40C for 2004 and 2005, respectively) moderately deviated from the 30years (1971-2000) average (10.90C). However, total annual rainfall (847 mm and 974 mm, for 2004 and 2005, respectively) was considerably higher in comparison with 30year average (654 mm). Agronomic evaluation and statistical analysis The field trial was harvested four times in 2004 (June 27, July 27, Aug. 30 and Sept. 29) and five times in 2005 (May 16, June 13, July 14, Aug. 24 and Oct. 3). The following agronomic traits were collected from all plants at each cut: dry matter yield (DMY: g plant-1) – total yield of four (2004) and five (2005) cuts, number of stems (NS plant-1), plant height (PH in cm), regeneration after cutting (RAC in cm). Protein yield (PY: g plant-1), number of internodes (NI stems-1) and leaf to stem ratio (LSR) were recorded for all plants in the second cut of 2005. In the same cut, average samples of each cultivar/population and of each repetition were taken for the chemical analysis. Contents of crude protein (CP), neutral and acid detergent fibres (NDF and ADF) were determined by Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant differences (LSD) test were applied using SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute, 2003). Results and discussion Significant differences were found among the genotypes and between years for all analysed traits (Table 1). Cultivars x year interaction was also significant. In the second cut of the second growing season differences were significant among the genotypes for all traits with exception of NDF and ADF (Table 2). The highest DMY in the first year of investigation was found for cultivars Barbara, Genesis and Prime (average 181.5 g plant-1), and was 21 % higher compared with average year yield. In the second year of investigation cultivars KM Norbert, Magnum V and Barbara (average 375.3 g plant-1) had 80 % higher DMY than population Maron which had significantly lowest DMY. The highest NS had cultivar Prime in the first year and cultivar Magnum V in the second year. The highest PH in the both investigated years had cultivar Genesis. Also, Genesis had the fastest plant regeneration (RAC) after cutting in the first year. In the second year of investigation the fastest RAC was found for cultivar Barbara. In the second growing season, significantly higher DMY (for 56 %) and NS (for 58 %) compared to the previous growing season were found. Similar results have been reported by Basbag et al. (2004). Favourable temperature and water regimes in both growing seasons enabled good growth and development of alfalfa and fast regeneration after cutting, which in final resulted in total nine high yielding cuts. In the second cut of the second growing season the highest PY had cultivar Victoria. The wild population Maron had the highest NI and LSR. Cultivar Radius had the highest CP and the lowest NDF and ADF. Population L-XX had the highest NDF and ADF, but not significantly higher than other cultivars.</p><p id="Pg652">VII.

Although wild population Maron (spp. falcata) had a lower yield, by crosses with sativa germplasm it is possible to transfer desirable traits such as resistance to biotic and tolerance to abiotic stresses into spp. sativa. Crosses between cultivated species and their wild relatives can give valuable genetic material for plant breeding programs (Hoffmann et al., 2007). Conclusions High yields and favourable values of the most of the investigated traits were found for Australian cultivars Genesis and Prime, Hungarian cultivar KM Norbert, Argentinean cultivar Barbara and American cultivar Magnum V. Therefore, this alfalfa cultivars could be considered as a valuable genetic material for the alfalfa improvement program.

The modern agriculture tries to present the optimal adaptation besides the economical production, but tries to keep the biodiversity too (Várallay – Láng, 2000; Várallay, 2006). For this it is very important to handle the soil, plant, weather, pest system as a complex agro-ecosystem in space and time and needs to be known every area that can be best carried out with remote sensing (Csete – Láng, 2004; Dobos et al., 2002; Rakonczai – Kovács, 2006). In the Hungarian Institute of Agricultural Engineering we are working with agricultural and environmental protection remote sensing for nearly twenty years. The aim of our remote sensing research and development projects were on one hand to create and improve a technical device system and on the other hand to apply this system, especially to examine the connection between the soil, plant, water, pest and weather. Materials and methods We have fixed the AGA 782 type camera with its mirror system that is for making aerial thermal infra pictures on a frame with a damper. We have also mounted the Nikon F3/T type camera that is for making the coloured infra pictures onto the frame. This frame can be easily placed into the hole on the aeroplane’s floor and also can be fixed on the measuring vehicle during reference measurements on the field. We have recorded the thermal infra pictures onto a modified VCR and we have used a special software for the processing. For the precise temperature values we used field reference values. The coloured infra pictures were shot to Kodak Ektachrome Infrared 2236 type film with a sensitivity range 500-900 nm. We have also used Kodak Wratten NR 22 (orange) filter. The “AISA DUAL” type hyperspectral imaging spectrometer is basically the building of two sensors, an “Eagle” and a “Hawk” together. The spectral range of the “Eagle” is 400-1000 nm and the “Hawk” is 1000-2500 nm. They both record the measured reflectancy in 244 channels. For the aerial pictures we used a modified Pa 23-250 Piper “AZTÉC” type twin-engine aeroplane. Figure 1 shows the difference between our spectral resolution and the spectral resolution of the popular space pictures (LANDSAT TM, LANDSAT MSS, SPOT).</p><p id="Pg655">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 656 Figure 1. Spectral resolution as a function taking Figure 2 shows the principle of aerial hyperspectral picture taking. The steps of the hyperspectral picture processing were: 1) Aerial and land picture taking. 2) Radiometrical and geometrical corrections. 3) Filtering and data decreasement. 4) Choosing the objective spectrum. 5) Classification. 6) Imaging. 7) Checking. Figure 2. Principle of aerial hyperspectral picture of reflectance The above mentioned steps were made with the CaliGeo -radiometric and geometric corrections- and the ENVI Geographical Information System Computer Softwares. The experimental and test measurements took place near Gödöllő -Kartal, Tura, Nagygombos-, and the hyperspectral pictures were taken from the agricultural areas near the cities Gödöllő, Keszthely, Szeged, Mosonmagyaróvár, Heves. All measurements were complemented with local field measurements and sample collection. Results and discussion Coloured infra pictures (CIR-colour infra red) The coloured infra red (CIR) images, applied with other field methods can effectively be used for determining the condition of the soil and the plants. The main advantage of these images is that they can give very sharp, contrast, colorful pictures even when the weather is vaporous. They show the living, healthy vegetation as red stains and the ill or damaged plants seem from white to different shades of green on the pictures. With the</p><p id="Pg656">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 657 help of these pictures we can collect many useful information about the condition of the soil and the plants (e.g. in case of the soil: humus content, soil structure, erosion degree, lime content, etc. and in case of plants: maturation degree, general condition, diseases, nutrition supply, etc.). The disadvantages of this remote sensing method: the making of the images is time-consuming and consumptive, their interpretation has many subjective elements, and they can not be directly used for the Geographical Information Systems that could help their practical and operative use. Aerial thermovisional images - thermo photos With the help of thermo pictures, the temperature of the surface of the soil or the plants can be detected, from which by knowing the temperature of the environment and the intensity of the solar radiation, we can come to several conclusions (e.g. the balance of heat and water of the soil, the condition of the plant transpiration, it is abnormity, etc.). The advantages of the method: can be made easily and quickly. The measurement results can be digitally stored. Disadvantages: The temperature change detected only with thermograph can not show the effect of a disease itself. Only the careful interpretation of the thermal pictures of the soil and the plants and the considering of the actual weather and natural conditions can lead to precise diagnostics. Aerial hyperspectral images For the historical fidelity it needs to be mentioned that the first aerial hyperspectral imaging took place as the part of the HySens project in August 2002 by using a DAIS type device with 79 spectral range and 6 meter/pixel resolution (Hargitai et al., 2006). The experts who took part in the research could realize a far away goal by starting the operation of the AISA DUAL sensor in Hungary, because it surpasses the spectral and spatial resolution of the DAIS instrument (488 spectral range, 1-4 meter/pixel resolution, depending on the flight height). Based on the experience of many aerial images taking and processing in 2007 and by using the literature in the topic, the following establishments can be listed: a) The aerial hyperspectral remote sensing means a remarkable quality jump in spatial and spectral resolution too. Because of this, pictures can be taken from each of the parcels that can operatively used in the field of precision farming for making soil and weed maps (Neményi et al., 2001). b) In the AISA DUAL system, the accuracy of the data – pixels - that are put in a Geographical Information System (GIS) is 3-5 meters with the currently applied method, but it can be reduced to 1-3 meters with using DGPS. c) The precise knowing of the reflection spectrums, applying together with the field samples can be used for determining quality and quantity parameters (e.g. biomass green mass, floating material concentration in water, etc.) d) The other great application field of the hyperspectral images can be the detection of the environmental pollution, mineral mapping, etc. (Jung et al., 2005). Summarizing the advantages of the hyperspectral imaging, the following statements can be listed: Great spectral and spatial resolution, geocoded data, it can directly be used for Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as input, flexible and very effective use, special data processing possibilities. On Figure 3 a hyperspectral picture of an agricultural area near Heves can be seen by using three spectral ranges. The picture was taken on the 2nd of July in 2007. A picture that has all of the spectral ranges, a so called hyperspectral data cube can be seen on Figure 4.</p><p id="Pg657">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 658 Figure 3. Hyperspectral picture of an agricultural area near Heves Figure 4. “Hyper data cube” Conclusions The aerial colour infra and thermal infra pictures that are taken with non-measuring cameras can not reach the present requirements. The main disadvantage of these pictures is that they can not be used directly in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The hyperspectral remote sensing technology will take more and more important place in the field of agriculture and environmental economy. The practical appliance of it in Hungary is not widespread, that is because the lack of the recording system. The operation of the AISA DUAL system is opened new alternatives for the practical appliance and for the research too.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 659 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SOIL - PLANT CONDITION WITH HYPERSPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF THE LEAF AND LAND SURFACE László FENYVESI 1 1 Hungarian Institute of Agricultural Engineering, H 2100 Gödöllő, Tessedik ut 4, fenyvesi@fvmmi.hu Abstract: The Hungarian Institute of Agricultural Engineering (HIAE) has a high-quality remote sensing device, the AISA DUAL hyper-spectral sensor. The device’s sensor operates in the range of 400-2400 nm wavelength and has a high, 1 nm sensitivity inside the visual spectrum. By using the hyper-spectral remote sensing method, the colour values can be calculated to a high level of accuracy and the spatial distribution can also be determined. In the case of the soil and the plant leaves it can be stated that the contents can better be determined by integral optical characteristics (for example: colour), rather than by differentials. High resolution photographs have been taken from the air of a ploughland situated near Bábolna by this instrument, and their colour attributes have been determined. There is a significant connection between the integral optical characteristics, the colour values and the contents of the soil and plant leaves. Keywords: remote sensing, soil features, plant condition Introduction A catalogue has been made that sorts the different types of soils by the optical characteristics of their surface (Baungartner, 1985). The catalogue lists the changing of the surface reflection of many soil types in the spectrum through the range 400-1200 nm. In the case of artificially produced „model” soils the exploration of the relationship between the optical characteristics and chemical components was successful (Baungartner at al., 1990). The setting of the content of the model soils was made by factorial experiment planning method. There is a significant relationship between the shape and the band of the spectral reflectance curve and the content characteristics (Stafanovits at al., 1989). There is an even stronger relationship between the colourcomponents that give integral information about some of the spectrum characteristics and the soil features. A similar connection can also be found between the colour of the plant leaves and the content characteristics and the condition of the plant (Fenyvesi- Papp, 1992). In the case of the soil and the plant leaves it can be stated that, due to the lack of the material that remarkably influences the reflectance, the contents can better be determined by integral optical characteristics (for example: colour), rather than by differentials (for example: measuring reflectance at different points of the spectrum). Materials and methods The Hungarian Institute of Agricultural Engineering (HIAE) has a high-quality remote sensing device, the AISA DUAL hyper-spectral sensor. The device’s sensor operates in the range of 400-2400 nm wavelength and has a high, 1 nm sensitivity inside the visual spectrum. The machine is able to take pictures at a certain wavelength, where the density deviation shows the changing of the reflection and can be seen as a picture. The changing of the reflectance can be shown at any point of the recorded object in the function of the spectrum (Figure 1.).</p><p id="Pg659">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 660 The recorded crude pictures can be radiometrically corrected and georectified (to correct the errors that are caused by the unsteadiness of the plane) by using a special software called Cali-Geo. The detected pictures can be further processed using the ENVI 4.1 3D software. The information from the pictures is stored in GIS, so the field works and the sample collecting can be precisely done. The device is an effective picture display system and a spectrophotometer in one (Fintha, 2007). The colour ingredients on a certain point of the surface can be calculated by the following formulas (Lukács, 1982):                   780 780 x ,y c x,y c 380 380 780 x,y c 380 X A P , x, y x d , Y A P , x, y y d , Z A P , x, y z d .                      The „A” in the formulas is constant,  cP  is the spectral output distribution of the illumination,  , x, y  is the reflected output distribution from the surface of the observed object;      x , y , z   values are the CIE distribution coefficients of the spectrum colours, that ensure the transformation to the colour ranges. The actual illumination  cP  comes from the Sun that changes throughout the day, and its value is affected by the atmosphere too. The actual value of  cP  and the reflected energy on the points of the surface  , x, y  are measured by the hyper-spectral sensor. We have made photographs from the B 22 field in Bábolna from an aeroplane. The first time the field was bare (Figure 1.) then it was covered in August at the end of the ripening of the corn. Figure 1. The schematic drawing of the hyper-spectral aerial remote sensing and the density picture of the soil surface in the „red” colour range (B 22, 710 nm) For the content examinations we have collected soil samples from the 100x100 m grid points from the field and on certain places we have measured the weight of the collected plants from 1 m2. Results and discussion We have determined the different colour characteristics by using the taken pictures. We have found the greatest connection between the measured humus content of the soil (H,</p><p id="Pg660">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 662 in the soil-plant system (Németh, 2006), we tried to establish the connection between the yield – humus content – nitrogen content: N=0,039-0,0013 H+7,361 10-6 G; (R2=0,966) In the formula „N” is the nitrogen content of the soil (g/kg). The spatial distribution of the nitrogen content in the soil can be calculated with only remote sensing and soil examinations at known points and by using the known yield. Conclusions There is a significant connection between the integral optical characteristics, the colour values and the contents of the soil and plant leaves. By using the hyper-spectral remote sensing method, the colour values can be calculated to a high level of accuracy and the spatial distribution can also be determined. The method can be expanded to improve the effect of the green manuring (Gyuricza et al., 2006). The results can be easily used for controlling precision operations, because the results are collected in a spatial IT system. The shown method can be simplified, and more precise by using the data of yieldmeasurement at harvest (Magó-Jakovácz, 2005; Késmárki-Gally,-Szűcs, 2007).

Due to the climate change the species composition of forest has been changing (Kotroczó et al., 2007), and the total leaf litter production has been slightly decreasing. According to our long-term litter manipulation field experiment, after a 5 year treating period, at the No Litter, No Root and No Input treatments the soil organic carbon, the soil pH, the soil enzyme activity (Fekete et al., 2007; Tóth et al., 2007; Kotroczó et al., 2006) and soil respiration decreased. If the average soil temperature raise by 2oC at the dry SIK site, the soil respiration would increase by 22.1%. The increasing soil respiration could speed up the global warming by positive feedback mechanism. Keywords: soil respiration, soil organic matter, DIRT, litter layer, litter decomposition Introduction The Síkfőkút DIRT Project (SIK) was established in 2001 as the part of US ILTER DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) network. It is connected to American Harvard (HFR, MA), Bousson- (PA), Andrews Forest (OR) and UM-Biological Station (MI). The main goal of this project to asses how rates and sources of plant litter inputs control the accumulation and dynamics of SOM and nutrients in forest soil over decadal time scales. The recent, and relatively rapid, rise in atmospheric CO2 has the potential to alter the cycling and storage of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the response of forest ecosystems to rising atmospheric CO2 is important, because forests cover a substantial proportion of Earth’s land surface (43%), contain 40% of the C in living and dead biomass and account for 72% of global net primary productivity (Melillo et al., 1989). Ecologists have long recognized that the quality and quantity of plant detrital inputs affect SOM accumulation and chemistry. However, the rates and forms of inputs to soil systems vary widely among ecosystems across the globe. In forests alone, fine litter inputs from aboveground (leaves, twigs, reproductive tissues, etc.) varies by at least 6-fold globally (Schlesinger, 1977; Raich at al., 1989). In this paper the effect of soil temperature on soil respiration and Q2 are published. Materials and methods The experimental site of 64 ha is located in the south part of the Bükk Mountains in North Hungary at 320-340 m altitude. GPS coordinates: N 47°90’ E 20°46’. This forest has belonged to the Bükk National Park since 1976, which protects this territory from anthropogen influence. The annual precipitation amounts to 550 mm. The site has brown forest soils with clay illuviation and the type of the soil according to the FAO Soil Classification is Cambisols. The site has Quercetum petraeae-cerris community. Plant litter inputs have been manipulated at the DIRT plots. Six different treatments (Table 1) were installed.</p><p id="Pg663">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 664 Table 1. The applied DIRT treatments in SIK Treatment Method Control (C) Normal litter inputs are allowed. No Litter (NL) Aboveground inputs are excluded from plots. Double Litter (DL) Aboveground leaf inputs are doubled by adding litter removed from No Litter plots. Double Wood (DW) Aboveground wood inputs are doubled based on measured input rates of woody debris fall. No Roots (NR) Roots are excluded with impenetrable barriers extending from the soil surface to the top of the C horizon. No Inputs (NI) Aboveground inputs are prevented as in No Litter plots, belowground inputs are prevented as in No Roots plots. Each plot is 7m x 7m, and every treatment was repeated in three times. The main standard for selection of the methods was the method book (Robertson et al. 1999) what use in all LTER sites too. The soil samples were taken randomly, from the top 15 cm layer, using an Oakfield soil sampler. The soil temperature was measured hourly in each 18 plots by Onset StowAway®TidbiT® temperature loggers in 10 cm soil dept. Data presented are the average of hourly temperature readings for each day of the year. The soil respiration was measured monthly by Soda Lime method (Raich et al., 1990, Grogan, 1998) simultaneously in all 18 plots on each collection date. The effects of treatments were statistically evaluated with SPSS software by analysis of variation. Results and discussion At the exclusionary treatments (NL, NR, NI) significant soil respiration decrease can be see after 5 years in 2005 (Figure 1). The soil respiration at DL treatment in the first tree years slightly increased, but in 2005 decreased (see at C). The soil respiration was higher in every treatment in 2005. This incident was in connection with gradation of Lymantria dispar. In this year the huge L. dispar faeces as an extra organic matter input deposited on the soil which increased the soil respiration. Figure 1. Effect of the litter manipulation treatment on soil respiration (yearly average)</p><p id="Pg664">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 665 Macro and microclimatic changes and seasonality strongly influence temperature and moisture content of the soil (Varga, 2003), that affect on soil microbial processes proved (Vágó et al., 2006; Fekete et al., 2007; D.Tóth et al., 2005). At the SIK site there was no significant difference between the soil moisture content at DL, NL and DW treatments compare to C. At the same time significant differences can be seen in soil moisture content at NR and NI treatments. In these plots the biggest soil moisture content is a consequence of the missing plant transpiration and trench of plots what is confirm by Varga et al. (2004a, 2004b) too. The seasonal changes of soil respiration correspond with the seasonal changes of soil temperature well. With increasing soil temperature the soil respiration is exponentially rising too (Figure 2). Soil respiration response to soil temperature was strongly and significantly influenced by treatment, and treatment effects increased with time. Figure 2. Effect of soil temperature on the soil respiration The relation between soil temperature and soil respiration is y = a*e(b*x). From this equation can be calculated the Q2 (Q2 = e b*2), (Nadelhoffer et al. 2004, Boone et al. 1998). The Q2 shows how many times the soil respiration will raise if the yearly average soil temperature increases with 2oC. We compare Q2 values of SIK to HFR in according to the Table 2. If the yearly average soil temperature grew by 2oC at the dry SIK site, the soil respiration would increase by 22.1 % (see at C). The increase would be higher (29.9 %) at the wet HFR site (see at C). The increasing soil respiration could accelerate the global warming (Várallyay, 2007) by positive feedback mechanism. Table 2. The Q2 values of SIK and HFR for soil respiration Q2 (After 5 years) Treatment SIK HFR (Tóth et al., 2007) Control 1.221 1.299 Double Litter 1.206 1.246 No Litter 1.208 1.237 Double Wood 1.213 - No Root 1.192 1.210 No Input 1.204 1.210 Conclusions Soil carbon accumulation and turnover are important global processes. In the last few decades the climate of SIK Forest became warmer and dryer. According to our results it may be hypothesized that global warming will raise the efflux of CO2 from the soil by the soil temperature raise, otherwise may be the absence of moisture will decrease the</p><p id="Pg665">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 666 CO2 efflux. It follows that both of these processes together will determinate the way of changes (change of litter production so the SOM accumulation too). Thus, any change in rates of soil carbon turnover has a remarkable effect to the global carbon cycle, and the CO2 as a most important greenhouse effect gas will speed up the warming by positive feedback mechanism.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 667 EFFECT OF SOIL QUALITY ON DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (DOM) CONTENT OF SOILS Tibor FILEP1– Márk RÉKÁSI2 – Ida KINCSES3 1 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Budapest, e-mail: filept@rissac.hu 2 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Budapest, e-mail: rekasi@rissac.hu 3 University of Debrecen, Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Debrecen, e-mail: kincsesi@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Effect of soil parameters on one of the least, but so much the more important fraction of soil organic matter so called dissolved organic matter fraction, was investigated. We have hypothesised that soil quality have substantial influence on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations. Based on soils of Soil Monitoring System of Hungary, relationship between soil parameters and DOC and DON were carried out by correlation and regression analysis. DOC concentration of soils was determined to the greatest extent by soil organic matter (r = 0.558 ** ). The DOC content and two parameters (y1 and CaCO3 content), that corresponding with soil pH, are in a rather strong correlation (r = 0.204 * and r = 0.205 * ). There also has been a strong relationship between DOC and the different N forms (nitrate, ammonium and total N). For DON, almost the same correlation relationships have been found than for DOC. It depends on – less extent than DOC – humus content (r = 0.458 ** ), on soil acidity parameters (pH, CaCO3; r = 0.225 ** and r = 0.391 ** ) and on N forms of soil. Of all of them, the strongest correlation was with the total N content. Keywords: dissolved organic matter, soil quality, Soil Monitoring System of Hungary Introduction Dissolved organic matter (DOM) participates in numerous processes in soils, e. g. mineral weathering (Raulund-Rasmussen et al., 1998) and transport of nutrients and pollutants (Kalbitz et al., 1997), as well as acid-base buffer capacity of soils (Vance and David, 1991). Nevertheless, DOM can be regarded as an easily mineralisable nutrient source not only for plants, but also for microorganisms. Physical, chemical and biological factors and/or the combination of this control the DOM content of soil. The main soil factors are temperature, soil moisture, pH, ionic strength, cation/anion concentrations, soil organic matter content and quality, land use (Kalbitz et al., 2000; Nagy, 2000). Although there has been several investigations on controls of DOM quantity and quality, a comprehensive study about this is still lacking. A study based on Soil Monitoring System of Hungary including hundreds of soils with important parameters makes an opportunity to quantify the effects of soil quality on DOM concentrations. Materials and methods Study was carried out using 133 soils of the Soil Monitoring System of Hungary (Várallyai, 1993). The soil data base contains soil samples from several area of Hungary with different land use managemant, e. g. forest, agricultural, and contaminated soils. Samples were taken between 15th of September and 15th of October. Soil parameters were as follows: pH (H2O and KCl), humus, y1, CaCO3, particle-size soil fractions. Furthermore, we measured the DOC, DON, TN, NO3, NH4 concentrations. These values were measured by extraction of 0.01 M CaCl2 at 1 to 10 soil:solution ratio for 2 hours (Jászberényi et al, 1994). DOC and TN was measured by TOC/TN analyzer, while DON, NO3 and NH4 was determined by contiflo.</p><p id="Pg667">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 668 Statistical evaluation of soil quality effects on DOC, DON concentrations and DOC/DON ratio was made by correlation and regression analysis. Results and discussion Soils in the investigation have very different properties as shown in Table 1. There are soils from the fairly acid ones (pHKCl ~ 3) to the nearly alkaline ones (pHKCl ~ 8), from ones with low organic matter content (Hu% ~ 0.5) to ones that have considerably high organic matter content (Hu% ~ 5). The CaCO3 content of soils also have a wide range: there is a soil with 50 % lime content. The dissolved organic carbon concentrations change more than 20 fold (20.4-421 mg/kg) among soils, while in case of DON content the difference between maximum and minimum value was only 10 fold.

The relevant correlation coefficients are presented in Table 2. DOC concentration of soils was determined to the greatest extent by soil organic matter. It is not surprisingly, because the major source of DOM is the humified organic matter (Zsolnay, 1996), which is confirmed by our examination. Figure 1 shows the regression of the two parameters. In the literature, the soil pH considered as one of the main controlling factor on DOM concentration. In our study, the DOC content and two parameters (y1 and CaCO3 content), that corresponding with soil pH, are in a rather strong correlation. Either of them of reason that soil pH has influence on DOM content is that changes in soil pH may cause a shift in circumstances of microorganism. If pH reaches the slightly acidic or neutral conditions the microbial activity increases, consequently the rate of biological decay increases as well. Because of this, the DOM concentration in soil solution enhances by increasing the breakdown of large molecules of humus.</p><p id="Pg668">VII.

Relation between the soil organic matter content and the dissolved organic carbon concentration There also has been a strong relationship between DOC and the different N forms (nitrate, ammonium and total N). As I have mentioned above, increasing of pH generates greater microbial activity, which involves higher concentrations of end product of mineralization (nitrate, ammonium). For DON, almost the same correlation relationships have been found than for DOC (Table 3). It depends on – less extent than DOC – humus content, on soil acidity parameters (pH, CaCO3) and on N forms of soil. Of all of them, the strongest correlation was with the total N content. C to N ratio of dissolved organic matter is an important quality parameter, which denotes the origin and fate of organic matter; it indicates that what soil parameters modify the dissolved organic matter quality. There only one positive correlation is: between DOC/DON and y1. With increasing of soil pH the ratio decreased, thereby</p><p id="Pg669">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Remarkable, that the C to N ratio is no in significant correlation with DOC content, whilst in case of DON, there is a strong correlation. Conclusions The hypothesis that the major source of DOM is the soil organic matter has been confirmed by strong correlation between humus content of soils and both dissolved organic carbon DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations. There also have been other significant correlations between soil parameters and DOC or DON, e. g. soil acidity parameters (pH, y1, CaCO3) was in a correlation with DOC and DON, indicating that the dissolved organic matter takes a share in microbiological processes which are in relationship with soil pH as well.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 671 LAND – USE HISTORY IN RURAL AREAS AROUND HORTOBAGY Erzsébet CSENGERI Institute of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agricultural, Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Samuel College, H-5541 Szarvas P.O.Box 3, csengeri.erzsebet@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract: Most of the north-eastern Hungary has been extensively altered by human activity over the earliest Stone Age. Hortobagy belonged to earlier communities in this territory. The land-use changes during the past 200 years were a response to human history that was dynamic in population size, technology, mobility, economic structure, and intensive interaction with the landscape (Nagy, et al., 2007). The effect of human history on the structure and management of the fields of Hortobagy has been a focus of study for soil scientist (Várallyay, 2006), economists (Oláh, Nemessályi, 2002), and ecologists (Veress, et al., 2000). One major theme that emerges from these diverse studies is that at a range of scales, from the stand to the region of central Hortobagy has been in a constant state of flux in response to dynamic and ever-changing modes of human activity. The human impacts to the ecosystem have not only altered the type and arrangement of fields, but the manner in which the fields function and respond to the natural process. Keywords: human activity, environmental impacts, interaction with the landscape, management of the fields Introduction The landscape was farmed in diverse ways, and eventually naturally. A characteristic feature of Hortobágy is that it represents a well-delimited natural unit from both botanical and zoological, hydrographical and soil respects, which preserves several cultural features. Any understanding of the land-use modes of this region therefore requires close consideration of human impacts, past and present, and their continuing effects over the modern landscape (Baranyi, 2007). This paper takes a look at the agricultural effects in the territory of Hortobagy dring the period 1800-2000, presenting and discussing the tendencies in the general stucture of land-use. Materials and methods The necessary database for this research was complied with the help of raw data from the agricultural census conducted by the Central Statistical Office and the T-STAR database in the years 1972, 1981, 1991 and 2000. Changes of the farming structure were studied from the 1750s, broken down by ten-year periods, giving median values. The study targeted the different agricultural land uses, changes of the ratios of agriculturally used crop lands and livestock. I made an in-depth interview with Mr. Csaba Göcz who was in charge of agricultural production on this territory of over 30 000 ha from the late 1960s. Results and discussion The natural richness of the Hortobágy is a typical example of how important a role the traditional ways of land use, existing and functioning for several thousand years, can play in the preservation of this area of great biological diversity. As regards of its</p><p id="Pg671">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 672 natural evolution, the Hortobágy is an intermittent inundation area that developed on the alkaline alluvial cone of the rivers running from the north to the south. Its surface has been formed by erosion and the work of the rivers into an almost perfect flatland since the end of the Ice Age. It is the greatest plain with sodic soil and continental climate in Europe.According to recent researches, the development of the alkali areas in the Hortobágy was not the result of the river control – as it was thought for a long time – but of the specific interactions among the petrographic, climatic and hydrogeological conditions (Nagy, et al., 2007). The first alkali areas developed as early as the end of the Pleistocene epoch on the eastern edge of the Hortobágy. This alkalization process was followed by another one around the dividing line between the Pleistocene and the Holocene epochs. It has been proved with mineralogical and geochemical – supplemented with Quaternarypalaeontological – data that the alkali areas of the Hortobágy were not created by human civilization; the development of the alkali desert had taken place in prehistoric times, well before the emergence of the great animal-breeding civilizations. Naturally, cultural influences played a different role in the development of the natural scenery from time to time. On the basis of their characteristics, the period of the great migrations till the Hungarian conquest, the Arpadian age, the Tartar and Turkish times, the period following the dislodgement of the Turks, the river control and the influences of modern agriculture stand out in sharp contrast to each other.At the time of the Hungarian conquest, the Hortobágy could be regarded as a natural area – in spite of the fact that the human populations previously living there, in addition to shepherding, had been pursuing farming as well. The early relationship of man and nature was characterized by gentle use. This gentle use did not harm the natural systems, which were made up of a mosaic of dry and wet habitats, nor did it decrease their biological diversity or interfere in the ecological processes determining the operation of the system. Man exploited a negligable part of the natural resources and wildlife for his own purposes and, with his vital functions, he did not harm the quality of his natural environment, either.Man discovered that, folowing floods, rich pastures and hayfields spring. He tried to control the water from the floods, and make it serve to his advantage. This conscious, controlled use was based on the exploitment of the potentials provided by the natural floodplain, and did not disturb the water balance of the area (Prokisch, et al., 2007). The regulation of the river Tisza played an important role in the development of the present appearance of the Hortobágy. The floods that had covered a major part of the prairie ceased to exist, and the river no longer spread rich silt on its surface. The extension of the swamps that had become isolated from the river decreased rapidly, and so did the area of the meadow-lands. The draining process and the periodical water covering caused by rainwater started a secondary alkalization process. The series of ecological changes that began after the regulation of the Tisza has not ended yet, since the delayed ecological processes still play – an will probably do so for a long time – a determinant part in the modification of the natural scenery of the prairie. The proportion and composition of the characteristic plant communities of the alkali deserts has changed, and the grass yield of the pastures has decreased (table 1).</p><p id="Pg672">VII.

Internal water problems are tried to be solved with technical devices, while the areas threatened by draining are protected with irrigation. For this reason, several establishments have been built, which require great areas, take away good quality lands from agriculture, and they also continue to change the economy of water-supplies of the area (Ecsedi, 1914) The different forms of farming on the area greatly influenced the development of the surface of the Hortobágy. The basis of farming is grass, so grazing animal keeping has proved to be the self-evident way of agriculture. In 1880, the Hortobágy got under the management of the city of Debrecen, and its agriculture has changed its direction. The livestock population has increased, which led to the beginning of an over-grazing process, and the internal grazing lands were ploughed up so as to ensure the winter feedstuff. At that time, Debrecen – as regards its number of livestock – got on the world ranking list After the Second World War, economy began to decline due to the conjugate effects of several factors. Change in the ownership of land (parcelling up into state estates and then their re-unification), development of inappropriate branches (exceeding the natural tolerance bounds, keeping fast economical profit animals), change in the market demands on animal final products, qualitative and quantitative decrease of grazing lands, spreading of plant cultivation (figure 1). 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 1 7 5 6 1 8 7 0 1 8 8 0 1 9 1 0 1 9 6 0 1 9 7 0 1 9 8 0 1 9 9 0 2 0 0 0 Catle Pig Horse Sheep Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 674 As a result of the survey of the animal husbandry sector of the agriculture, it can be stated that, in accord with the Hortobágy soil conditions and the productivity of the natural vegetation evolved here, rearing cattle that is grazed in the open air all the year round and sheep is more dominant even to this day, as well as the fish culture, done within the frame of partly natural pond culture. Conclusions Land use form is Hortobagy has three tipe, and requires close consideration of human impacts. First tipe was in time of the Hungarian conquest when the people previously living there. This tipe of land use was haracterized by gentle use. Next tipe of land use was in 1850 years when the population tired to controll the water. The regulation of the river Tisza bought first ecological changes in this territory. This ecolological process still play. 1950 was a yaers of intevsive stucture of agricultural management. In this time the plant- and animal production was made in intensive form. Status the natural resaurces (landscape) in Hortobagy doesen’t poper for the intensive management. Another result of the sixties was the systematic forestation programme started on the lowest-lying parts of the pastures. The land use trends have lasted throughout the years, although the usable crop land has shrunk, partly because of their exclusion from cultivation and partly because of land appropriations by the Hortobágy National Park founded in 1973. By 2000, over 80% of the crop land under the jurisdiction of the village of Hortobágy was transferred under the administration of the National Park, these areas are mainly used by the Hortobágy Non-Profit Company, while a smaller part of them is leased by agricultural entrepreneurs.
