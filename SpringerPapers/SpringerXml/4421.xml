This problem is especially critical in electricity-poor regions, where advanced water purification methods are absent. Here, we demonstrate that titanium dioxide nanowires (TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs)-based photocatalytic filters assisted only with sunlight can efficiently decontaminate water. Moreover, interweaving TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) leads to the formation of a TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs composite material and offers an additional water decontamination channel, that is of pasteurization with the visible part of the solar emission spectrum. Our results demonstrate that this nanoporous filter can successfully intercept various types of microbial pathogens, including bacteria and large viruses. In addition, photo-catalytically generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the surface of the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs-based filter material under exposure to sunlight contribute to an efficient removal of a broad range of organic compounds and infective microbes. A pilot study also yielded encouraging results in reducing traces of drugs and pesticides in drinking water.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41545_2022_Article_157.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water Quality/Water Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water Industry/Water Technologies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Waste Water Technology / Water Pollution Control / Water Management / Aquatic Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Universal access to clean and safe drinking water is essential for life. Since 1990 in emerging countries, the quality of water has remarkably improved due to economic growth and technological progress. Yet, even nowadays, numerous locations throughout the world are constantly exposed to risks of contamination and still suffer from the lack of sanitary infrastructure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], at least 1.8 billion people, mainly in rural areas, consume water that is contaminated with feces. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), an estimated number of 1,800 children die every day (diarrhea) because of unsafe water supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. WHO reports that by 2040, a large portion of the world will endure water stress in relation to the dramatically insufficient drinking water resources. For this reason, the same source predicts a global crisis regarding universal access to clean and safe drinking water.</p><p id="Par3">This problem may prove to be especially acute in countries where sanitary infrastructure is not at place or disrupted (e.g., at remote, rural or war-affected areas), as well as in electrical energy-disadvantaged communities, where running advanced purification methods is not feasible. Under such circumstances, people are forced to drink water contaminated by feces, parasites, life-threatening harmful bacteria, viruses, etc. These pathogenic species could be of various nature, like, e.g., <italic>Escherichia Coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, or <italic>Hepatitis A</italic>, which could cause not only stomach pain, fever, headache, painful diarrhea and fatigue, but even death, as in the case of <italic>Legionella Pneumophila</italic> infection. It is then important to find a simple and efficient way to eliminate them to provide clean, safe and affordable drinking water in a cost-effective manner.</p><p id="Par4">One of the possible solutions would be to make use of the photocatalytic water treatment by combining sunlight with nanoscale forms of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). In fact, this approach for water decontamination has been extensively investigated since 1985 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. TiO<sub>2</sub> is a wide-band gap semiconductor, which efficiently absorbs the ultra-violet (UV) part of the sunlight spectrum. For typical photocatalytic applications, due to their large specific surface area, the nano-sized forms of TiO<sub>2</sub>, e.g., TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) or TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires (TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs), are of particular importance. The electron-hole pairs induced by the absorbed UV photons diffuse to the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs or TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs, where, in contact with water and oxygen molecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. In the aquatic environment this photocatalytic mechanism generates various kinds of ROS, the most important of which are: hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>.</sup>), superoxide radical anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In turn, ROS formed on the surface of photo-excited TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, before they decay, can readily attack and react with organic contaminants and pathogens, if there are any in the immediate vicinity.</p><p id="Par5">Thus, due to the high specific surface area of nano-sized photocatalytic particles, their efficient photo-generation of ROS, as well as large contact surface and direct interactions, the photocatalytic systems based on nanoparticle forms of TiO<sub>2</sub> provide a powerful disinfecting strategy against waterborne microorganisms and pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, despite the significant potential and many advantages of such an approach, no operational photocatalytic sunlight-driven titania-based devices have been elaborated up to date. The current situation can be explained in part by the technical complications, which are directly related to the nanoparticle form of titania. More specifically, in slurry-type reactors, after completed photocatalytic cycles, it is difficult to collect and recycle TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs (20–100 nm in size), which are dispersed in suspension containing the pollutants.</p><p id="Par6">To overcome this problem, different techniques of immobilization of TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs on various types of substrates have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs immobilized in the form of compact thin films and porous coatings usually reveal mechanical and structural instabilities, because the powdery deposits tend to detach and fall apart exposed to the action of even weak friction and shear forces.</p><p id="Par7">In this regard, here, we report the design and characterization of a highly efficient and durable photocatalytic water filter, which is based on a nanocomposite material consisting of titanium dioxide nanowires (TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).</p><p id="Par8">The device has a very simple (planar) configuration, in which the contaminated water passes through a multi-layered filter material, the pathogens are trapped on the filter surface, whereas the UV component of the sunlight, being strongly absorbed by TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs, generates ROS. Therefore, in addition to the mechanical retention of pathogens, the photo-triggered ROS attack and kill diverse range of pathogenic species, including bacteria and germs, thus leading to even more efficient water decontamination. Furthermore, implementation of CNTs in the herein developed composite contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic action under exposure to sunlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Especially, electrically-conducting CNTs absorb a broad spectrum of the sunlight radiation, which heats up the filter material and thus provides an additional channel for water disinfection via pasteurization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">To further improve the photocatalytic properties of the composite filter material elaborated herein, we have also proposed to combine the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs composite with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The issue of incorporation of AuNPs into the structure of the filter material and its influence on the resulting photocatalytic properties is discussed in a more complete manner in the final part of this study (Summary).</p><p id="Par10">In brief, this study reports a tailored synthetic method to prepare a solar water purifier, its basic active components, as well as its thorough characterization in terms of photo-generation of ROS––towards the removal of a wide spectrum of toxic chemicals and pathogens from drinking water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>General concept of the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs nanocomposite-based water purification filter</title><p id="Par11">As mentioned above, the essential building elements of the herein elaborated nanoporous photocatalytic filter material are TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs and CNTs. A simple representation of the working principle of this TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs nanocomposite for water filtration is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Filtering and sterilization principles.</title><p><bold>a</bold> A representative selection of microorganisms, which could contaminate the drinking water.

Incorporation of CNTs into the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs nano-construct efficiently separates electron-holes pairs photo-generated within TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs, thus reducing their recombination rate and consequently increasing the efficiency of photocatalysis.

Moreover, the filter paper decontaminates the polluted water through the action of ROS, which are photo-catalytically generated under the influence of the UV component of sunlight on the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs surface due to their direct contact with water and oxygen molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">When it comes to the function played by CNTs in the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs nanocomposite material developed by us, it is generally accepted that the presence of CNTs enhances the photocatalytic effect in two ways. Specifically, numerous reports have shown that CNTs in combination with either TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs or TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs can act as electron acceptors to more effectively separate charges photo-generated within TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructures and thus significantly improve the photocatalytic properties of such constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, the broadband absorption of solar radiation leads to heating of the filter material, thereby allowing photo-thermal disinfection of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Indeed, we show that the herein elaborated combination of TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs with CNTs, gave a considerable improvement in the functioning of the filter material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Synthesis and structural characterization of TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs nanocomposite</title><p id="Par14">High resolution TEM images of the individual nano-structural components, that is of a single TiO<sub>2</sub>NW and a single CNT, are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, respectively. For the practical implementation of numerous variants of the filter material, a large-scale production of both TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs and CNTs was develop in our laboratory. The detailed description of the large-scale synthesis routes of TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs can be found in ref.

While using this technological approach, in our laboratory conditions we were able to produce an amount of ~0.3–1.0 kg of TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs per day in a single synthesis cycle. However, it is worth mentioning that prospective industrial production would not be subject to such quantitative restrictions.</p><p id="Par16">The mass production of CNTs was accomplished by a process of catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) performed in an inclined rotary tube furnace operating in continuous mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As explained in Methods, the overnight synthesis produced ~1.2 kg of CNTs.</p><p id="Par17">The above-described high-efficiency synthesis processes of both nano-structural components, i.e., TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs and CNTs, allowed us to fabricate photocatalytic filtering papers with large surface areas. To this end, TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs and CNTs were mixed in different proportions in order to optimize the filter’s performance in terms of water sterilization. Subsequently, the corresponding mixtures were processed by doctor blading into films of various thicknesses, ranging from 2 μm up to 300 μm. The thin layers obtained this way could easily be detached from the hydrophobic support material. After air drying at 120 °C and calcination in vacuum at 600 °C, a phase transformation from titanate to anatase was achieved. It is worth mentioning here that that the calcination process fuses TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs together, thus leading to the formation a thin filtering membrane with a tightly compact structure, which, in normal use (i.e., under standard volume flow-rates), does not release nano-structural ingredients. In short, the technology developed herein made it possible to produce freestanding, flexible thin filtering papers with large surfaces, which, depending on their thickness, could even be transparent.

We believe that this simple method could be a good solution for drinkable water-stressed areas.</p><p id="Par53">As an outlook, to further improve the photocatalytic properties of the composite filtering material elaborated in this work, we also propose a few of possible improvements. The first could be the incorporation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs-based composite fabric, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>. In this regard, earlier studies have shown that AuNPs exhibit enhanced photon absorption properties and can be used to efficiently generate local heating upon illumination through photo-induced resonant plasmons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, composites consisting of the photoactive TiO<sub>2</sub> and AuNPs can be conveniently employed as plasmonic photocatalysts, enabling a number of important reactions to occur with high efficiency and under minimal light exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although the exact underlying mechanisms are still not well understood, this direction of improvement of the composite material seems to be promising. In particular, the expected improvement in photocatalytic composite material also incorporating AuNPs is related to the plasmonic effect, which works for the whole spectral range of sunlight.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Strategies for the filter improvement by AuNPs and surface texturing.</title><p><bold>a</bold> TEM images of a large assembly of the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/AuNPs composite (the scalebar is 200 nm), and (<bold>b</bold>) Enlarged image fragment selected from the image shown in (<bold>a</bold>) (the scalebar is 5 nm); (<bold>c</bold> and <bold>e</bold>) SEM images of the filter material without and with surface structuring, respectively (the scalebar is 2 μm). <bold>d</bold> Two distinctly different optical responses upon visible light illumination of non-structured (left) and structured (right) versions of the filter material (the scalebar is 10 mm).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41545_2022_157_Fig7_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par54">A second route for improvement could be the surface structuring of the filter, in order to better trap and conduct the incident light into the bulk of the material, since, as mentioned before, both ROS generation and the resulting water pasteurization are proportional to the illuminated volume. In general, the question of more efficient light trapping is very vivid in photovoltaics in order to improve the light-matter interaction within the device’s photo-active layer and thus to enhance the solar cell efficiency. One way of achieving this is through elaboration of periodic light trapping structures. Recently, numerous such structures have been developed, including nanowires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], gratings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and many more. In particular, gratings could be designed to diffract the incident light at the TiO<sub>2</sub>–air interface at angles bigger than the critical angle (depending on the grating periodicity), so that most of the potentially scattered or reflected energy could be returned to the photo-active filter layer. It has previously been shown that such surface structuring results in an effective enhancement of the optical path length and better light absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">In this regard, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c–e</xref>, we show that it is possible to fabricate the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs filter to have a grating pattern structure on its surface. Specifically, the SEM images of the as-deposited filter on a flat and lithography-modified substrate surfaces are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, e</xref>, respectively. The grating pattern structure can easily be recognized on the surface of the filter material deposited on the lithography-engineered substrate. Moreover, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>, these two surfaces have distinctly different optical responses, due to the enhanced light interference on the surface with the grating pattern.</p><p id="Par56">Further optimization of structuring of the filter surface as well as exploration of its advantageous properties are the subjects of forthcoming studies related to the TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs/CNTs filter material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub>NWs</title><p id="Par57">TiO<sub>2</sub> nano-powder with size distribution of 20–50 nm (Nanoshell LLC) was dissolved in a base solution of NaOH (Merck), and heated up to 70 °C and exposed to turbulent mixing.
