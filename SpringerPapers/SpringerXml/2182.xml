sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising optoelectronic materials because of their exceptional optoelectronic properties, such as size-controlled tunable emission wavelength, narrow emission spectrum, high luminescent efficiency, and compatibility with solution processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Accordingly, QDs have enormous potentials as an essential component in high-efficiency luminescent devices, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, and other related devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To integrate them with the above-mentioned solid-state devices, the QDs must be precisely and accurately patterned in predetermined locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. So far, a variety of techniques have been applied to pattern functional nanomaterials, such as mask-based photolithography, inkjet printing, transfer printing, microcontact printing, and nanoimprint lithography, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, most of these methods suffer from drawbacks such as performance degradation by ultraviolet light and solvents, complex processing technology, long processing time, low efficiency, and poor repeatability. Therefore, improving and developing novel QD patterning technology is critical for commercially viable applications.</p><p id="Par4">Colloidal QDs are generally composed of an inorganic semiconductor core and an organic ligand shell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. QDs are not stoichiometric in composition and their ligands can ionize in the solution, therefore they will be rich in either anion or cation species, i.e., QDs are consequently rich in either cations or anions on their surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, the presence of surface charges in QDs provides an effective way of electrically driving the movement of QDs in a solution and depositing them onto the surfaces of the electrodes of opposite polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This approach of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has shown great potential for the fabrication of large-area films as the photoanodes of quantum dot sensitized solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, the technique still remains to be improved to resolve the problems such as low deposition selectivity, QDs adhering to both cathode and anode with non-uniform thickness, and hence the difficulty in multi-material integration. Thus, developing a new method of EPD that provides fast and precise deposition of large-area multicolor QD emissive patterns would be necessary, which would greatly facilitate the practical applications of QDs for displays, imaging, and photodetectors.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we present a universal QD patterning technique using photolithography combined with mild and low-cost selective electrophoretic deposition (SEPD) to achieve large-area full-color QD patterning. This novel EPD process utilizes a high-accuracy microelectrode by photolithography to rapidly (a few seconds) fabricate QD patterns only on selective polarity electrodes. The deposited QD films with controlled, uniform feature sizes down to 2âÂµm and precisely modulated thickness can be patterned into pixel array with arbitrary yet predefined shapes beyond 1,000 pixels per inch (PPI). The surface morphology, packing density, and refractive index of deposited QD films are tunable by changing the electric field, enabling us to tailor the performance of QD devices and achieve higher luminous efficiency than conventional solution-processed methods. Based on these, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach to integrate QDs with different emission properties into large-area arrays to form full-color photoluminescence (PL) pixels, and further construct high-performance QD light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Such devices developed with this approach are promising for next-generation displays with excellent optoelectronic performance and low-cost fabrication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patterning of QDs array via SEPD</title><p id="Par6">As well known, the surfaces of QDs can be charged by the ionization of the ligands (such as carboxylic-acid-, phosphonic-acid-, and thiol-terminated ligands) in polar solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, which facilitates the electric field deposition of the QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, colloidal CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD capped with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-COOH in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) was selected because of its high PL quantum yield (PLQY) and solution-processability. To analyze and improve the surface charges, four QDs modified by PEG-COOH ligands with different contents were designed and synthesized. And their charge characteristics were estimated by measuring their zeta potentials and electrophoretic mobilities (Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, the zeta potentials of all QDs are negative, indicating that these QDs are negatively charged by the ionized carboxylic acid due to the ligand ionization in PGMEA solution (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, inset). Moreover, the absolute value of zeta potential is increased with the increase of ligand content. This testifies that the charges on QDs mainly originate from ligand ionization and can be tuned by modifying the ligand. However, ligand modification influences PLQY of QD slightly, in our experiment, the QD with the highest PLQY was selected as the model compound for the construction of multicolor patterned structures.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Patterning of QDs array via SEPD.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Zeta potentials of QDs capped with different ligand contents.

The electrode substrate was placed into the QDs solution. A DC electric field in the range of 0.5â10âV Î¼m<sup>â1</sup> was then applied for QD deposition. The electric field force drives the movement and deposition of QDs in solution onto the surfaces of the electrodes of opposite polarity. Then, patterning of QDs can be achieved by the SEPD of the charged QDs into a film of arbitrary size, shape following the electrode geometry. After a fixed time, the substrate was lifted out of the QD solution. With the voltage bias remaining on, the electrodes were washed by dipping into a pure solution for 10âs. This washing step removes aggregated QDs that were not well-bounded to the surface and QD-rich droplets. After SEPD, the substrate was dried in an oven at 80âÂ°C for 20âmin, and finally, the patterned QD film was obtained.</p><p id="Par8">The as-fabricated QD stripe film can be patterned over a very large area, which is only limited by substrate size. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> shows the photograph of a 10âÃâ10âcm QD pattern deposited on a glass substrate with interdigitated ITO electrodes. Under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the QD patterns emit bright and uniform red fluorescence (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The QD patterns are in a uniform geometric shape with precise positioning (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). As the bright field optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f and g</xref>), QDs are only deposited on positive electrodes, which is in contrast with nothing on the negative electrodes. This result further indicates the surfaces of QDs are only negatively charged. A cross-sectional SEM and 3D OM images of deposited QD stripe pattern with different thickness are as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>, respectively. It can be observed that these deposited QD microstructures have close-packed arc cross-section structures without visible pinhole or surface defects, and the planeness of QDs patterns can be tuned to modify the interface and uniformity for optoelectronic devices by changing their thickness and linewidth (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The thickness of the SEPD QD microstructures can be controlled by varying the SEPD parameters, such as the electric field intensity, QD concentration, deposition time and so forth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref> demonstrates the kinetic aspects of SEPD through deposited thickness against time. At a lower electric field (for example 0.5âVâÎ¼m<sup>â1</sup>), the deposition rate is relatively slower. At a higher electric field, SEPD can be completed within 5âs due to the fast deposition rate of our method. Therefore, we set the deposition time to tens of seconds in our experiments, which is enough to complete the SEPD. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref> demonstrates the thickness of QD patterns as a function of field intensity and various QD concentration products (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). With enough QDs in solution and for fixed deposition time, the film thickness monotonically increases with the electric field and QD concentration. The curve has a linear slope of about 1.58âÃâ10<sup>â17</sup> m<sup>5</sup> g<sup>â1</sup> V<sup>â1</sup>. Therefore, the thickness of QD patterns can be precisely controlled in a large range from several nanometers to tens of microns through the combination of electric field and QD concentration, which not only can meet the thickness requirement for color conversion layer in LCDs, blue OLEDs, and micro-LEDs, but also the accuracy demand of QLED. The linewidth and space of the QD pattern mainly depend on the designed electrode. As shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, it demonstrates the QD microscale line array with different widths and gaps. We have further reduced the width of the ITO electrode to 2âÎ¼m by optimizing the process of photolithography (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), and the resulting QD stripe width is within 5% variation of the designed 2âÎ¼m width (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>). Generally, the resolution limitation of the SEPD method depends on the sizes of patterned electrodes, which are limited by the processing method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characteristic control of QD patterns</title><p id="Par10">To directly observe the movement and deposition of QDs in solution under electric field, a glass cell with in-plane interdigital electrode substrate was used as a container to hold the QD solution and was placed under a micro-PL system (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). Because of the high surface negative charges, the QDs can be driven by the electric field to move rapidly to the positive electrodes. As the Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref> shown, within one second, all QDs have been depleted in the solution with an electric field of 5âVâÎ¼m<sup>â1</sup>, which indicates the extremely fast processing speed of our SEPD method and the potential for fast electrophoretic displays. In addition, the QDs remained stable on the electrodes after removing the applied voltage or even reversing the field (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Cross-section structures of QD films were further measured by high-resolution SEM to analyze the accumulation and stable deposition of QD particles on electrodes. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the SEPD fabricated QD film is composed of larger particles than that of QD films prepared by spin coating (SC), indicating that the small QDs were aggregated into large particles under electric field force. Because the repulsive forces between the QDs were overcome by the electric field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, charged QDs were forced to get close to each other and form insoluble big particles due to the adhesion with intermolecular hydrogen bonds of PEG ligands (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Therefore, deposited QDs would not be dissolved and dispersed by solvent, so they could be stably adhered on the electrodes. This stable single polarity electrode deposition characteristic effectively avoids the cross-contamination of in-plane multicolor QD patterns. In addition, the particle size increases from single QD to âoligomersâ after the SEPD process, which could allow more voids in SEPD films and enhance the scattering coefficient of particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

To evaluate the effect of electric field on the SEPD films, the surface morphology, bulk density, and refractive index of QDs films deposited under different electric fields were measured.

After the same deposition and cleaning time, drying in an oven at 80âÂ°C for 20âmin, at last, the RGB pixels were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Device fabrication</title><p id="Par26">The ITO/Ag/ITO substrates were first cleaned in ultrasonic detergent for 30âmin and sprayed with deionized water, followed by soaking in ultrasonic deionized water for 15âmin and baking in an oven for 30âmin. Then they were cleaned with an oxygen plasma cleaner for 5âmin. The substrates were then transferred into a N<sub>2</sub>-filled glove box for the preparation of layers of PEDOT: PSS, TFB, and QDs and ZnMgO nanoparticles. A 15ânm thick PEDOT: PSS and TFB layers were spin-coated followed by baking at 150âÂ°C for 20âmin. In accordance with the microcavity effect, the optimized TFB layer thickness is different for specific color-emitting QLEDs and is proportional to the emitting wavelength of a device. The green QLEDs, therefore, have the optimized TFB layer thickness of â¼30ânm (8âmgâmL<sup>â1</sup> TFB in chlorobenzene solution, 3,000 r.p.m. spin speed), while those for red QLEDs are â¼50ânm (TFB, 20âmgâmL<sup>â1</sup>, 3,000 r.p.m.), respectively. A TFB/PEDOT: PSS-on-ITO/Ag/ITO/glass substrate and a whole ITO/glass substrate whose boundary was covered with 10âÎ¼m-height photo spacer structures were secured together with their conductive sides parallel and facing toward one another. An electric field of 10âVâÎ¼m<sup>â1</sup> is then applied, and the electrodes are placed into the CdSe/ZnS QDs modified by carboxylic acid in octane solution. The optimized QD layer thicknesses were â¼12ânm for red (8âmgâmL<sup>â1</sup> QD octane solution) and â¼10ânm for green (5âmgâmL<sup>â1</sup>) as determined from an efficiency comparison of devices with various QD layer thicknesses. After a fixed time (a few minutes in duration), the electrodes are lifted out of the QD solution and, with the voltage bias remaining on, washed by dipping into a vial filled with neat octane for 10âs. Then the substrates were dried in an oven at 80âÂ°C for 5âmin. Then 30ânm thick ZnMgO nanocrystals (in ethanol 30âmgâmL<sup>â1</sup>) were spin-coated onto the coated substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30âs and baked at 80âÂ°C for 10âmin. Then transferred into a vacuum chamber (with a base pressure of 10<sup>â6</sup>âTorr), where a 25ânm thick Ag cathode and a 60ânm thick NPB were deposited by sequential thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The devices were encapsulated in the glove box by the cover glasses using ultraviolet-curable resin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Characterizations</title><p id="Par27">The morphology of the as-prepared QD films was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS GEMINI 300), 3D optical microscope (VK-X1100), and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nano Man VS). The cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscope images of QLED were measured by FEI Helious G4 UC. Bright-field and fluorescence microscopy images were acquired using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Ti-U) under the excitation of a mercury lamp (330â380ânm). The electrophoretic mobility and zeta potential of the QD solution were measured by Brookhaven ZetaPALS zeta potentials analyzer. The refractive index of QD films was measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (J.A. Woollam RC2). The time-resolved PL spectra were recorded using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Fluo Time 300). Photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) were measured by using an integrating sphere on a HAMAMATSU absolute PL quantum yield spectrometer C11347. Excitation and fluorescence spectra were registered at room temperature on a Lumina fluorescence spectrophotometer. The current densityâvoltageâluminance (<italic>J</italic>â<italic>V</italic>â<italic>L</italic>) characteristics and the angular dependence of emission intensity of the devices were measured by a dual-channel Keithley 2614B source meter unit and a calibrated PIN-25D silicon photodiode.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China administrated by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2016YFB0401702), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62004008), Shenzhen China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd; Guangdong Provinceâs Key R&amp;D Program: Micro-LED Display and Ultra-high Brightness Micro-display technology (Project No. 2019B010925001); Guangdong University Key Laboratory for Advanced Quantum Dot Displays and Lighting (No.2017KSYS007), Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Advanced Quantum Dot Displays and Lighting (No.ZDSYS201707281632549), and Shenzhen Peacock Team Project (No. KQTD2016030111203005).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>J.Z., L.C., and X.W.S. conceived the original concept and designed the experiments.
