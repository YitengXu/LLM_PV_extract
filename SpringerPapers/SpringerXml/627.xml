simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) protocol design in full-duplex (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where the FD base station (BS) simultaneously serves a set of downlink half-duplex (HD) users (cellular users) and a set of fixed uplink HD users (fixed sensor nodes) which are uniformly distributed in its coverage area. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we investigate the beam-domain representation of massive MIMO channels based on the basis expansion model, and then the beam-domain SWIPT protocol which lies in intelligently scheduling the users and sensors based on the beam-domain distributions of their associated channels to mitigate SI and enhance transmission efficiency is designed for full-duplex massive MIMO system. The whole beam-domain hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol is divided into two phases based on the ideal of TS. The first phase is used for cellular users uplink training and sensor nodes energy harvesting as well as downlink training, wherein the cellular users transmit uplink pilots for uplink channel estimation at the BS, while the BS simultaneously transmits energy signals to the sensor nodes. Based on the idea of PS, the sensor nodes utilize the received energy signals for energy harvesting and downlink channel estimation. In the second phase, the BS forms the transmit beamformers for information transmission to the users as well as the receive beamformers for the sensors transmit their data to the BS simultaneously. By optimizing the TS ratio and transmit powers at the BS in two phases, the system achievable sum rate performance is maximized. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed protocol on spectral efficiency compared with the existing massive MIMO SWIPT protocol.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the existing fourth generation (4G) system, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has been used to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) performance. By deploying <italic>M</italic> antennas at transmitter, and <italic>N</italic> antennas at receiver, MIMO takes advantage of the spatial multiplexing gain of min(<italic>M,N</italic>) to improve the date rate. With the exponential growth of mobile Internet, the data traffic will increase by 1000 times beyond 2020. The existing 4G system cannot meet the increasing traffic demand of the future mobile communication, which put forward a great challenge to the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>As one of the key technologies in 5G, massive MIMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which uses large-scale antenna arrays (with 100 or more antennas) to replace the currently adopted multiple antennas, has been proved to be able to greatly improve the SE of wireless communications system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As the number of antennas in massive MIMO grows larger, the simple linear precoder and detector tend to optimize, and the noise as well as the uncorrelated interference can be effectively eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. What is more, the spatial resolution of massive MIMO is remarkably improved when compared with the conventional MIMO, and the signal beam can be focused within a narrow range; hence, various kinds of interference can be substantially suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the conventional half-duplex (HD) systems, i.e., time-division duplex (TDD) systems or frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems, the uplink and downlink are separated by orthogonal time or frequency resources, hence theoretically wastes half of the time-frequency resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As a potential SE enhancement technique in 5G systems, full-duplex (FD) wireless transmission scheme allows the transceiver to use the same frequency resource for simultaneous transmission and reception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. FD technology can potentially double the transmission capability of the wireless physical layer. In terms of practical FD implementation, the effect of self-interference (SI) due to the coupling of own high-powered transmit signals to the receiver must be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thanks to the promising analog/digital and spatial domain SI cancelation techniques that can achieve high transmit-receive isolation which have been reported in the recent literatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], now, FD is becoming feasible in the near future.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivation and related work</title><p>In addition to the SE, energy efficiency (EE) also has gained wide research attention for the design of wireless networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Energy constraints introduce an upper limit on the power of transmission and associated signal processing in wireless devices, especially for battery-powered equipments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As a sustainable solution to maintain the lifetime of energy constrained wireless networks, energy harvesting (EH) technique has recently received significant attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. EH technology can effectively solve the charging problem in battery-powered wireless networks, wherein the wireless nodes are inaccessible or a large number of wireless nodes are widely distributed.</p><p>Various sources of renewable energy, such as ambient heat, wind, solar, and vibration, can be used to power wireless communication devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, one common problem of collecting energy from such sources is its random nature. Energy availability variations with location, time, or environmental conditions make resource allocation in such systems very challenging. Radio frequency (RF) signals radiated by ambient transmitters can be identified as a viable new inspiration for EH. Compared with conventional energy sources, RF signals can carry both information and energy simultaneously. Wireless devices collecting energy of RF signals to power the signal transmission are named as simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which has recently attracted great attention for various wireless channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Owing to its features, SWIPT can be used to remotely power a variety of applications such as wireless sensor networks, body area networks, wireless charging facilities, and future cellular networks. Recently, several important advances of SWIPT in the antenna and RF EH circuit designs, have greatly increased the feasibility of EH in practical wireless applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The SWIPT receiver was originally designed for simultaneous information decoding (ID) and EH from the same received signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which is found to be unrealistic in the later research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Due to the non-ideal EH circuit design, part of the RF signal energy will be lost during the ID process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Hence, practical circuits used for EH are not able to decode the information carried by the signal directly. In the following SWIPT receiver designs, antennas with different functionalities are equipped for the information transceiver and the energy harvester, respectively. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], antennas with different power sensitivities are designed for receivers of different uses, i.e., − 20 to − 10 dBm for EH and − 60 dBm for ID.</p><p>According to the signal partition method for EH and ID, there are mainly two types of practical SWIPT receiver designs, namely the time-switching (TS) and the power-splitting (PS) receiver architectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The TS receiver alternately switches between EH and ID according to the TS ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The received RF signal is first sent to the EH receiver and then to the information receiver. In the PS receiver, the power of the incoming signal is split into two streams according to the PS ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One portion of the received signal is sent to the EH receiver, and the remaining portion is sent to the information receiver.</p><p>The design of transceiver for MISO interference channel with EH is studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], where the PS method is adopted and the transmit beamforming vectors as well as receive PS ratios are jointly optimized. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] consider a one-way single-antenna amplify-and-forward (AF) SWIPT relay networks, where both the TS and PS protocols are studied. The joint transceiver designs for multiuser MISO relay systems with EH is studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], where the received signal is divided into two parts for ID and EH based on the PS principle. Since the two-way relaying (TWR) system can further improve the SE, many works also studied the SWIPT protocols in the TWR scenario. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] considered a two-way AF relaying system with SWIPT, where an EH relay node is used to help two source nodes exchange information. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the authors consider the sum-throughput maximization problem in TWR network, where all the nodes are wireless-powered. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] consider a SWIPT AF TWR network, where two source nodes harvest energy from multiple relay nodes.</p><p>The above works on SWIPT relay network are studied in HD scenario, where devices can either transmit or receive on a single frequency band, but not simultaneously. Since FD can potentially double the wireless physical layer capacity, recently, the transceiver design problem in FD SWIPT systems has arised. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], the joint optimization problem of relay beamforming, the receiver PS ratio as well as the transmit power at the sources are investigated for SWIPT system with a FD MIMO AF relay to maximize the system achievable sum rate. The design of robust nonlinear transceivers for MIMO FD wireless-powered relay networks is studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], where the effects of imperfect channel state information (CSI) is took into consideration. The joint transceiver design for a FD cloud radio access network with SWIPT is considered in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The joint transceiver designs for FD K-Pair MIMO interference channel with SWIPT is considered in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Robust secure beamforming scheme for wireless-powered FD MIMO systems with self-energy recycling is studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>Despite the previous works on EH in FD system or MIMO system, a few works have been done on the SWIPT protocol design in cellular system with massive MIMO base station (BS). In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the joint FD self-backhaul and EH protocol for small cell networks with massive MIMO is investigated. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], SWIPT protocol for three-dimensional (3D) massive MIMO system is designed, where the matched filter (MF) precoder is adopted at the BS. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], the SWIPT protocol is designed for multipair TWR system with massive MIMO, where the linear precoders, i.e., zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC), are adopted at the relay. A low-complexity SWIPT scheme with retrodirective maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming is studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], where all energy receivers (ERs) send a common beacon signal simultaneously to the energy transmitter (ET) in the uplink and the ET simply conjugates and amplifies its received sum-signal and transmits to all ERs in the downlink for SWIPT. For SWIPT system with massive MIMO, instantaneous full dimensional CSI is needed to perform linear precoding. To obtain full dimensional CSI, the uplink training overhead scales linearly with the number of user equipments (UE) in TDD system, the downlink training overhead scales linearly with the number of antennas in FDD system, and the corresponding CSI feedback yield an unacceptably high overhead, and therefore poses a significant bottleneck on the achievable SE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Contributions</title><p>In this paper, we consider the beam-domain hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol design in FD massive MIMO system, where the FD BS simultaneously serves a set of downlink HD users (cellular users) and a set of fixed uplink HD users (fixed sensor nodes) which are uniformly distributed in its coverage area.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

In order to accomplish the channel estimation, the transmit and receive antenna arrays of the BS are assumed to be shared antennas, i.e., the transmit and receive RF chains share the same antenna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the frame-based BD massive MIMO FD SWIPT system, each frame is divided into two phases, <italic>phase I: estimation and EH phase</italic> and <italic>phase II: BD FD transmission phase</italic>, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><p>In the <italic>phase I</italic> of time period <italic>α</italic><italic>T</italic> (0≤<italic>α</italic>≤1), users transmit pilots for channel estimation at the BS, while the BS simultaneously transmits energy signals to the sensor nodes for EH and channel estimation. Due to the separate antenna configuration at the BS; therefore, the reciprocity of uplink and downlink channels does not hold. The BS uses the transmit antenna array to receive the pilot signals of users for uplink UE-BS channel estimation and uses the receive antenna array to transmit the energy signals. We assume that the sensor opens the receive circuit during the interval <italic>α</italic><italic>T</italic>, and part of the received energy signal is used for channel estimation and part of the received energy signal is used for EH; hence, the sensors can obtain the uplink sensor-BS channel.

The center frequency is 2.4 GHz and system bandwidth is set to 20 MHz. Thermal noise density is set to − 174 dBm/Hz. The channel coherent time is 200 symbol times. The path loss between BS and users/sensors are modeled as 2.7 + 42.8 log10(<italic>R</italic>) (dB), and the path loss between users/sensors are modeled as 55.78 + 40 log10(<italic>R</italic>) (dB), where <italic>R</italic> denotes the distance.

It is assumed that the passive SIC scheme for infrastructure nodes proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] has been employed at the BS. In such scheme, the suppression is from two parts, namely (1) the path loss introduced by the 20 m separation between transmit and receive antenna arrays and (2) an additional cancelation of 45 dB provided by techniques, such as radio frequency absorber material and cross-polarization. No other active SIC scheme is used in this paper.</p><p>In this paper, we assume that the BS can obtain the perfect DOA and DOD information when users access the system. In the following simulations, we consider the fixed sensors, hence it is reasonable to assume that the BS can obtain the perfect DOA and DOD information of sensors. We first consider a scenario where the sensors and users gather perfectly in three groups and the DOA/DOD regions of users in each group are identical. We assume that each group contains 5 uplink/downlink users. The DOA/DOD regions of three user groups are [− 45°,− 35°], [12°,22°] and [42°,52°], respectively.

Similarly, the DOA/DOD regions of three sensor groups are [− 42°,− 32°], [16°,26°] and [39°,49°], respectively. The DOA and DOD regions of SI channel between the transmit antenna array and receive antenna array are set to [− 12°,− 22°], [56°,66°] and [− 56°,− 46°], [27°,37°], respectively. The resulting ABSs for all the groups satisfy the user and sensor grouping criteria.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates the SE of the proposed BD hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol for FD massive MIMO system with perfect user and sensor grouping. The transmit powers of BS is 20.2 dBm. The distance between users/sensors and BS is set to 500 m. This setup ensures the average downlink receive SNR is 3 dB. The energy conversion efficiency <italic>η</italic> is set to 0.8, and the power ratio used for energy harvesting <italic>β</italic> is set to 0.8. For comparison, existing SWIPT protocols designed for massive MIMO (MM) system are also demonstrated, such as TDD SWIPT with MF precoder in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], TDD SWIPT with ZF precoder in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and TDD SWIPT with MRT precoder in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Meanwhile, traditional FDD MM with JSDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], FD MM with linear transceiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], FD MM with spatial SI suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and traditional BD FD MM transmission scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] are also extended to the SWIPT scenario and demonstrated for comparison. Note that the FD MM with spatial SI suppression in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the BS requires instantaneous CSI of SI channel in order to perform SI cancelation in spatial domain. In the simulations, the uplink transmit power in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] are also harvested from the BS downlink transmit signal. With estimated effective BD CSI, the SE of the proposed BD hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol outperforms the existing transmission schemes. The reason is that, the proposed BD hybrid TS and PS SWIPT transmission scheme can reduce the required length of pilot sequence significantly, hence significant SE gain can be achieved by the proposed scheme over the TDD and FDD MM systems and traditional FD MM. The SE of the proposed BD hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol with perfect CSI and the capacity are also depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

The signal of each user/sensor is within a 10° DOA/DOD region which is randomly distributed in the sectors. The distance between uplink/downlink UE and BS is randomly distributed in the interval [200, 1000] meters. After user and sensor grouping, three user groups and three sensor groups are formed, and the users and sensors in different groups are allocated orthogonal time-frequency resources. Since users and sensors are grouped into three groups, respectively, the SE is defined as the average SEs for three groups. The number of scattering cluster for SI channel is set to <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>SI</italic></sub> = 2. We can see from Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> that the proposed BD hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol for FD MM system obtains the best performance. For the FD MM with linear transceiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], we assume that there is no downlink reciprocity, hence the SE performance is greatly reduced as a result of the heavy cost of pilot resources.

In order to reduce the pilot resource cost used for channel estimation, we resort BEM to represent massive MIMO channel in the BD. Due to the spatial sparsity of massive MIMO channel, we can compress the massive MIMO channel in the BD under certain selected basis spaces and the channel dimension required to be estimated can be greatly reduced. The hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol which lies in intelligently scheduling the users and sensors based on the distributions of their associated BD ABSs to mitigate SI and enhance transmission efficiency is designed. The whole BD hybrid TS and PS SWIPT protocol is divided into two phases based on the ideal of TS. The first phase is used for cellular users uplink training and sensor nodes energy harvesting as well as downlink training, wherein the cellular users transmit uplink pilots for uplink channel estimation at the BS, while the BS simultaneously transmits energy signals to the sensor nodes. Based on the idea of PS, the sensor nodes utilize the received energy signals for energy harvesting and downlink channel estimation. In the second phase, the BS forms the transmit beamformers for information transmission to the users as well as the receive beamformers for the sensors transmit their data to the BS simultaneously. By optimizing the TS ratio and transmit powers at the BS in two phases, the system achievable sum rate performance is maximized. Simulation results shown the superiority of the proposed protocol on SE compared with the existing massive MIMO SWIPT protocol.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their careful readings and valuable comments.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work is supported by the Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation under grant BK20160079, National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 61671472).</p></sec></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>KX proposed the main idea and is the main writer of this paper.
