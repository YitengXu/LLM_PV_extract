a surge in photovoltaic (PV) systems installations on buildings. It is concerning that PV system related fire incidents have been reported throughout the years. Like any other electrical power system, PV systems pose fire and electrical hazards when at fault. As a consequence, PV fires compromised the safety of emergency responders. Therefore, the objective of this review is to evaluate the elements of firefighters' safety practices and subsequently collate the best safety practices for local fire rescue and firefighters in the event of PV fires. Out of 264 documents, only 20 publications were identified as ‘closely related’ and were systematically reviewed to evaluate firefighter safety practices from a scholarly perspective. Only 3% of the 20 publications reviewed, discussed the safety practices during PV fires. Thirteen safety practice key points were extracted from the reviewed documents, with nine critical findings highlighted as the hallmark of safety practices during PV fire for firefighters. The lack of academic journals discussing the fire safety aspects proves that there is a low interest in this field which is in dire need of further study and exploration to adhere with the PV population in ensuring a reliable emergency operation to minimize losses or injuries due to accidents.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Firefighter

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As a result of public incentives for green energy, the growth of global photovoltaic (PV) system installation is observed to escalate rapidly. This promising industry has been breaking the worldwide PV capacity growth records every year despite the difficulties arising from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although market experts have predicted a market decrease, the PV industry remains resilient with a record-breaking 138.2 gigawatts in total installed capacity in 2020, representing year-on-year growth of 18% more than in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With the medium-scenario trajectory, global installation capacity will surpass the terawatt scale by 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a primary source or a backup to supply electricity, PV systems vary from small residential sizes to massive utility scales with various mounting configurations and integrated installation.</p><p id="Par3">PV systems are classified into standalone/off-grid and grid-connected systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In most countries, the grid-connected mode is becoming the system of choice in contributing to their electricity generation mix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The standard layout of a grid-connected system is usually perceived as two separated sides: the DC and AC lines. Various components are involved in the system, such as PV modules, junction boxes, on-grid inverters, disconnect or isolator switches, net meters, distribution boxes, connectors, and cables. PV systems should not be perceived only as modules or arrays as they comprise electrical components, charged equipment, various electronics, the network of cables, and mechanical hardware, which are subjected to electrical fire ignition.</p><p id="Par4">As PV systems gain more acceptance and become more prevalent in their applications harnessing clean energy, increasing fire safety concerns will create an essential chapter in PV discussions. One of the heavily discussed topics is fire safety regarding PV systems of a building. PV fire is a term used in this paper to describe a fire incident involving PV systems installed on a building. Due to the confidentiality of PV installation companies, it is challenging to quantify cases of PV-related fires to measure the occurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, few statistics exist revealing cases of fire incidents involving PV systems. For instance, in Germany, from 1995 to 2012, 179 out of 400 fire incidents were identified that PV system had caused fires, with a large number failing during the first year, reflecting a 44.8% rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to a survey by the Italian National Fire Rescue and Service (CNVVF), from 2002 to 2015, around 2,500 fire incidents occurred in nearly 550,000 PV systems, reflecting a failure rate of 0.45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, as part of the BRE National Solar Centre project, a total of 80 PV fire incidents were identified, reflecting a 0.01% rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These few exemplary statistics imply that fire involving PV systems does exist despite existing fire safety codes. As PV installation and its application proliferate, the risk and probability of a fire occurring will eventually evolve. Research conducted by Mohd Nizam Ong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] revealed that the annual incident frequency of rooftop PV fires is approximately 0.029 fires per MW, with PV connectors being the prime contributor. PV fires are also highly related to the poor installation practices by PV installers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">As a PV system is a subset of an electrical system, it will carry some degree of fire risk by its nature. Due to that, installing a PV system on a building worsens the pre-existent fire risk level and increases fire severity compared to a building without a PV system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is because the PV system generates a large direct current. Unlike alternating current that oscillates, direct current is a continuous current making them more. They are more likely to cause muscular tetanus, making them more likely to freeze the victim in a shock scenario. Besides that, PV fire also aids in fire growth and alters the fire dynamics of the roof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PV systems can fail due to different faults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides a summary and classification of faults and failures in PV systems. These failures eventually set a foundation for fire ignition and fire spreading, thus becoming a hazard. The scenarios of fire that occur are characterized in two different settings: the original fire scenario and the victim fire scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. If a fire originates from the PV system itself, for instance, due to series arcing because of a poor connection, it is categorized under the original fire scenario; otherwise, it will be categorized under the victim fire scenario, for instance, catching fire from the indoor compartment or struck by lightning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Classification of PV Fire Scenario Based on the Faults</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="7"><p>PV fire scenario</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="5"><p>Original</p></th><th align="left" colspan="2"><p>Victim</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="2"><p>Physical</p></th><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Environmental</p></th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="2"><p>Electrical</p></th><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Natural hazard</p></th><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Manmade</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p>Internal</p></th><th align="left"><p>External</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="10"><p>Cell damage</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="5"><p>Cabling</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="10"><p>Shading faults/dust accumulation</p></td><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Hotspot</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="10"><p>Lightning strom, etc</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="10"><p>Catching fire from indoor compartment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Mismatch</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Arc fault</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Inverter</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Bypass diode fault</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5"><p>Cracks and degradation</p></td><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Bridging</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Power conditioning unit fault—MPPT</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3"><p>Array</p></td><td align="left"><p>Earth fault</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Line to line</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Open circuit</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Source: Table recreated from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par6">In a fire investigation of a large warehouse in Italy, the presence of a PV system contributed to an intense fire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PV fire incidents involving large roof fires were often followed by an interior compartment fire, resulting in the loss of the structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, combustion products from burning PV components on a roof or façade interfere with the smoke and the ventilation systems, which causes fire spread to evolve outside or throughout a building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A study conducted regarding PV panels installation on double-skin façade (DSF) of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) by Miao and Chow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] revealed that hot products were not only confined in the shaft wall area but spread to the whole shaft. The entire shaft increased in temperature significantly compared to the shaft without PV modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The experiment conducted by Kristensen and Jomaas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] indicated that the flame propagation is influenced substantially by the geometry of PV installations with additional heat reflected underneath panels that fuels fire to propagate. The inclination of the PV modules also affects the flame spread rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Although fires caused by PV panels are infrequent, any building fires involving PV systems increase the risk to occupants and firefighters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As such, firefighters have a majority percentage of dealing with PV system fires during the firefighting process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Firefighters involved in the PV fire incident were reportedly associated with increased fear of existing solar PV than the fire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It was alarming when the news about two firefighters shocked by a rooftop PV panel while extinguishing a one-alarm fire in San Francisco's Bayview district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In May 2013, a PV fire involving corporate headquarters in Wisconsin, USA had inhibited firefighters' suppression activity due to a disastrous fire spread on the rooftop with the presence of energized metal roof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In September 2019, Japan's floating PV power plant was torn apart by typhoon Faxai. During that incident, firefighters responded that the fire was complicatedly challenging to suppress, as fire, water, and electricity were all present at once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In Delanco, New Jersey, a 300,000-square-foot warehouse was let burn down with the fire chief's statement that he did not want to jeopardize his personnel's safety with the presence of nearly 700 solar panels on top of the warehouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Limited resources of operating procedures in fire suppression related to PV had caused uncertainties among firefighters contributing to burn-down scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. New training and fire codes are supposed to make firefighters safer when they run into solar panels, but they are inconsistently applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Tackling PV fire is deemed frightening among attending firefighters who lack confidence. Even with the technology adoption of disconnection switches, according to research activities conducted by BRE National Solar Centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the application is still perceived as an unproven technology. This technology has yet to prove its reliability for the whole lifetime of a PV system. The installation of such devices may give firefighters a false sense of security while damaged modules remain energized. The same conclusion can also be drawn about module-level shutdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Although, according to Aram et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], no study has viewed the overall impact on the fire safety of a building, as most research on PV has mainly focused on improving modules productivity and performance, it is worth noting that Cancelliere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in his work did addresses the overall fire safety strategy of a building where PV systems are going to be installed. However, presently, while there is a wide discussion in terms of guidelines and publications regarding the prevention and protection of PV systems from fire, the outcome tends to associate more with the pre-incident setting, that is, before the fire occurs. Outcome examples such as installing safety devices, implementing monitoring software, design standard and regulation (e.g., NFPA 70, IEC 60364-7-712, and CEI 64-8) connote pre-incident situations. The traditional firefighter tactics for suppression, ventilation, and overhaul have been complicated, leaving firefighters vulnerable to potentially unrecognized exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Therefore, in this systematic review work, two research questions were designed from a scholarly perspective: (a) To what extent has the topic broadened?, and (b) What are the safety practices during PV fire for firefighters under the scope of rooftop grid-connected application? This study will be beneficial to firefighters' problems and challenges with PV systems by identifying the elements of safety practices during PV fires. The findings are highly associated with local rescue teams dealing with PV fires prior to the arrival of firefighters. In addition, the products of this study will also benefit firefighters who perform suppression, extinguishment, and rescue plans in a fire attack. The gaps identified in this study will improve safety practices during PV firefighting operations from the perspective of scholars and eventually draw the attention of the fire safety community and facility managers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Review Methodology</title><p id="Par11">This research employs literature study as the primary research method. An approach of a systematic literature review by Denyer and Tranfield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] has been advocated to identify and discuss key findings of safety practices during PV fire from the perspective of firefighters through selected discipline databases. The design of relevant queries at the beginning of the search established the direction of this research. A four-stage process was performed throughout this research, as illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Stages of systematic literature review in this study</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10694_2022_1269_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> is the review process conducted in the study to gather all closely related documents and gain key findings of safety practices during PV fire for firefighters.

The system cannot be isolated since the inverter holds charges, and electricity may flow back to PV panels. There is no single point to isolate a PV system completely.

This results in even greater voltage for multi-family dwellings and other large buildings that incorporate PV systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. During an emergency, firefighters sometimes use a cable cutter, axe, rotary saw, or chainsaw in clearing routes or cut an opening. Consequently, firefighters become vulnerable to electric shock hazards due to severing energized PV components or cutting through raceways containing live conductors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Experiments conducted by the underwriters laboratory have concluded that severing conductors in metal and plastic conduits would result in electrical and fire hazards; therefore, close attention must be exercised during ventilation and overhaul [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For an exceptional case where cutting and severing are a requisite and remarkably required, the hazard duration can be shortened with a faster cut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, during a rescue operation, where a part of a component or conductor has to be pulled apart, the current can continue to flow in an air space creating an arc between separated conductors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This can propagate over several millimeters depending on voltage level and environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The arc hazard can potentially burn skin when in contact and aids in spreading fire. Therefore, close attention must be adopted during the rescue operation if the component or conductor has to be pulled apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Warning Labels and Markings</title><p id="Par34">In recognizing PV systems, warning labels and markings would be valuable for firefighters in the firefighting operations. The International Fire Code requires markings for a DC conduit and the main service disconnect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In Germany, a standard was established regarding PV signage and is stated in VDE-AR-E2100-712, which requires PV signage to be visually present at the connection points of a PV system, such as the connection box and the main distribution board [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. With the standard implemented in Germany, PV system operators must install layout diagrams showing the locations of PV system components with respect to the structural layout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In Japan, a "Directive Standards for Fire Safety Measurement regarding PV Systems" which contains the requirement of specific labeling for PV signage that enables firefighters to recognize PV systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], was released. In the United States, identifying power sources is well instructed through Article 690.56 of national electrical codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], which is helpful for attending responders. Warning labels and markings are excellent practices that all PV developers should exercise across the nation for firefighters to recognize every part of the PV system in enhancing fire safety practices among emergency responders. Therefore, attending firefighters must be attentive to these labels and markings to commence PV firefighting operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus</title><p id="Par35">It is highlighted that during roof operation, the use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is of utmost importance to protect firefighters from hazardous chemicals coming off from burning PV modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. During a fire or explosion, the frame of PV modules releases cadmium telluride, gallium arsenide, phosphorus fumes, and boron gases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Although different materials produce different chemicals when burning, the fact that chemicals released are toxic and hazardous is undeniable. Wearing SCBAs and full PPE in a firefighting scene and overhaul operations will mitigate the inhalation hazards originating from chemicals engulfed in PV fire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Disruption Technique and Foams Application</title><p id="Par36">The process of turning off the array is not similar to operating a disconnect switch. When the PV array receives light or gets illuminated, the system components' parts will remain energized. This is where the method to block illumination is addressed to abolish electrical output from the PV modules. One of the methods discussed is to cover panels with 100% light-obstructive material such as salvage cover or tarpaulin or tarps. Tarps offer varying degrees of effectiveness to interrupt power generation from a PV array, independent of cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Heavy, densely woven fabric and dark plastic films reduce PV power to near zero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As a general guide, if light can be seen through a tarp, it should not be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Caution should be exercised during the deployment of tarps on damaged equipment as a wet tarp may become energized and conduct hazardous current if it contacts live equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the following are the thought points regarding the subject method: (a) How do firefighters adjust tarpaulin size to fit roof structure size? (b) How do firefighters maneuver a giant tarpaulin to the rooftop when there is an existing fire for a large-scale building? (c) How do firefighters maintain the position of the tarpaulin when there is a strong windblown or due to other externalities? Therefore, broader research can be explored on this account.</p><p id="Par37">Firefighting foams, as an alternative disruptor, there was an experiment conducted to study its efficacy in disrupting power generation from PV modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It was determined that a foam ranging from 0. 5 to 10 cm thick could significantly reduce the open-circuit voltage of the array. Nevertheless, maximum voltages under load still represented an electrocution hazard to humans, capable of generating currents in excess of 20 milliamperes through human skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Underwriters Laboratories claimed firefighting foams should not be relied upon to block light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In moving forward, a portable thin-film technology that incorporates fire-resistant and detachable properties would highlight the industry to perform complete isolation during fire scenes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Stairway Access to Roof and Attention to Roofline</title><p id="Par38">In performing roof operation safely, it is recommended to utilize stairway access to the roof as one of the safety requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The Italian Safety and Health of the Workplaces Act (Legislative Decree 81/2008) requires PV systems to be designed with safety pathways provided on the roof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Japan, as stated in the directive by the Tokyo Fire Department, installers must design space for firefighters' passage on the rooftop for an installation area that exceeds 300 m<sup>2</sup> and limits the distance between any passage and the center of PV array within 24 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> illustrates the setback rule, which is essential for the water stream to reach the fire from the passageway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Responding personnel must stay away from the roofline in the event of modules or sections of an array sliding off the roof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Setback rule of PV module installation.</p><p>Source: Figure recreated from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10694_2022_1269_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Water Stream Properties and Safe Distance</title><p id="Par39">Regardless of the mode of operation, either offensive or defensive, it is crucial to incorporate water stream application to diminish the potential of fire ignition, fire spread, thermal heat, or flash-over. However, the application of a water stream has a drawback for the firefighter, which is an electric shock hazard when water is aimed at live electrical equipment such as switch boxes or combiner boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. During water application, attention must be paid to fire-damaged components that remain energized, contributing to the potential shock hazard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The safe distance is dependent mainly on the type and the diameter of the nozzle and water conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. For PV systems of a 1000 voltage DC source, Underwriters Laboratories recommends the mandatory characteristics of water application in exempting electrical shock are as follows: (a) a minimum 10-degree fog pattern of the cone shape, (b) saltwater use is prohibited, and (c) a distance of minimum 20 feet (6 m) from energized source (1). An experiment confirmed that the safe distance to be applied increases when the bigger diameter of the nozzle is used because of the resistance reduction due to the greater jet cross-section area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. It was pointed out that the resistance rate is affected by the conductivity of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The higher the conductivity, the lesser the resistance. It was emphasized that the higher nozzle pressure employed, the stream becomes stronger hence more breakage of droplets forming discontinuous filaments and higher jet resistivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In fact, the Note PROTEM 622/867 of 18/02/2011 states that during firefighting operations performed by means of water suppression systems, a proper distance from live wires or other electrical components must be assured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The NFPA Fire Protection Handbook states that safe distance values are not wholly consistent because the results of different tests vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

The results of this review had answered these two research questions. The data analysis proved a gap or deficiency in publications associated with safety practices during PV fire through selected discipline databases with corresponding search strings. Only 3% constitutes discussion about safety practices during PV fire from the academic database, out of 264 documents available from the finding. Results obtained either imply the knowledge of interest has not yet been adopted in the growing development of PV, or current knowledge is at an early stage that deserves further study and exploration to adhere to the PV population.</p><p id="Par42">Safety practices during PV fire for emergency responders that were studied in this review are summarized, which represent the hallmark of safety practices during PV fire for firefighters:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par43">Wear complete PPE, including voltage-rated gloves and footwear.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Operate all emergency disconnects, rapid shutdown, and other disconnecting means when found.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">The fire department to prepare a list of certified electrical professionals to be reached for isolation verification.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Severing PV components is not recommended, be cautious with inadvertent direct contact.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">Look out for warning labels and markings to better understand the system encountered.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Wear SCBA during rooftop operation and interior operation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">Disrupting light from reaching modules using salvage or tarpaulin may not be a good option for large-scale rooftop PV.

This study provides a research agenda basis to expand the knowledge field. Developing these safety practices would significantly reform the fire safety chapter within the national building code, particularly on PV. For instance, the Uniform Building By-Laws 1984 or UBBL 1984 of Malaysia comprises Part VIII—fire alarms, fire detection, fire extinguishment, and fire fighting access, which presents a special section for these safety practices to be integrated. Moreover, potential future research can be extended to explore non-scholar sources such as brochures and short articles on a webpage to investigate the consistency of content and its reliability associated with existing safety practices that have been found.</p><p id="Par53">Furthermore, key findings from this review could serve to be a part of survey research among firefighters to refine the safety framework's practicality when encountering PV fire. Results from this review would stand as a guideline to enhance maturity level development of best safety practices during PV fire. Key points would be essential in identifying further gaps and providing improvement opportunities across the firefighting department in contributing to more resilient and adaptable suppression tactics. For instance, a study about the application impact of disconnection switches on firefighters' response, an experiment about PPE and SCBA efficiency in the actual PV fire incident, research about portable thin-film technology incorporating fire resistant and detachable properties to perform complete system isolation during fire scene, and an investigation about the safety of state-of-the-art firefighters' equipment used during a fire involving PV components.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research is funded by Malaysian Electricity Supply Industries Trust Account (AAIBE) under the auspices of Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (KeTSA) with the project code JAAIBE 3/2019/11/Bil.3 and Grant Number of 6300252-10801.
