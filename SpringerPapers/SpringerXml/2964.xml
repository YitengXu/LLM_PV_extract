Different distributed, interconnected generation units, loads, and energy storage units make up a typical microgrid system. The increased energy efficiency of these units on microgrids is gaining popularity day by day. Because of their stochastic behavior, renewable generation causes an imbalance in the power system, which needs microgrid energy management. To solve these issues, a variety of novel approaches have been explored in the literature. For the stand-alone microgrid in this research, efficient energy management and control mechanism is adopted. A photovoltaic system, a wind turbine, and a battery energy storage device make up this stand-alone microgrid. The power stability of the hybrid system is ensured by a sophisticated controller. The main purpose of this study is to regulate the DC/DC bidirectional converter (DBC), which connects the Li-ion battery to the DC bus of the stand-alone microgrid. This paper describes the development of a wind/photovoltaic power generation system to the load, as well as MPPT techniques like perturb and observe (P&amp;O). The system is simulated and the results are presented using MPPT techniques. There is no requirement for a specific power model in the suggested method. Only power and voltage system data are used by DBC. A stand-alone microgrid system was simulated using MATLAB.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microgrid</kwd><kwd>Maximum power point tracking</kwd><kwd>Photovoltaic</kwd><kwd>Wind energy</kwd><kwd>Battery energy storage</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/43067_2022_Article_46.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par24">Renewable energies are the new trend in power production with their clean and environmentally friendly power. Because of the high dependence on weather and climate conditions, in numerous cases, the best possible system is the renewable energy hybrid system (based on renewable sources) with energy storage systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The hybrid microgrids are generally used to provide electricity for multiple consumers like homes or farming areas that are out of grid extension based on smart control. A microgrid consists of loads, energy storage systems, small-scale production systems, and a control center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Microgrids are used in communication systems for real-time management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Microgrid (MG) when joined to a network can also operate in isolation. Depending on the sort of energy source, the microgrid can be categorized as alternating current (AC), direct current (DC), or hybrid AC/DC. Microgrid energy management systems face difficulties in managing renewable energy sources like solar power and wind.</p><p id="Par25">Hybrid energy systems are among the most promising systems for using renewable energy. The phrase hybrid energy system points out electric power generation systems that use multiple sources. The combination of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, biomass, wind power, solar photovoltaic, or small hydroelectric power plants can be a compliment or an alternative to the diesel generator sets generally used to produce electricity in remote areas. In general, hybrid energy systems are created to fulfill energy needs ranging from simple lighting to total electrification of villages or small islands, and hybrid systems are established by the selected criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Different research work has discussed multiple aspects of microgrid, such as a study of experimental systems installed in several countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and microgrid protection and energy management systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The energy management system is referred to as an information system that supported by a platform, in which the required functions to verify that production and distribution give energy at the lowest possible price. When the main grid goes down, keeping a dependable power supply to customers takes precedence over economic benefits. As a result, the operation goal of microgrids is to maximize load satisfaction while minimizing operating costs. It means that wind and solar power should be used to compensate for the lack of electricity, and a portion of the load could be turned off to balance power when required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If the consumer to be electrified is a group of isolated buildings, such as a village in an area with a very low population density, or difficult to access, an alternative solution is to reproduce the pattern of distributed generation, but on the scale of a small independent network, called a microgrid. Faced with the difficulties of connecting to the main grid, this solution then becomes economically feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Generation sources must then be small in size, which makes renewable energy sources very interesting. They must be chosen and placed according to the availability of the driving source: wind, sunshine, a river. They can be centralized where the energy is available, or placed next to the buildings to be powered; in all cases, this distance must remain limited to minimize line losses. Energy efficiency is indeed vital in this type of system to ensure economic profitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to the most recent research, the goal of microgrid energy management is to reduce operating costs while maintaining a balance between the energy produced and the load demanded and the cost of electricity purchased and operating maintenance costs from the main grid. The energy management approach proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is based on two market policies that only consider power balance. Security is not considered in the microgrid operation. Other papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have discussed various approaches for microgrid control and renewable energy resources integration. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] presented energy management approaches for micro-grids. Various stand-alone microgrid and grid-connected hybrid network designs are discussed. The control goals of microgrid energy management systems and supervisory controllers have been shown in another review report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The proper energy management, operation, and control of the microgrid are significant for an energy-saving smart electrical grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The performance and quantity level of DSTATCOM's power circuit and control parameters are assessed during the design and selection process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The control of power factor in a radial distribution system has been assessed by comparing two algorithms backpropagation control algorithm (BPCA) with synchronous reference frame theory (SRFT) techniques. These control methods are used to create switching pulses for IGBTs in DSTATCOM's voltage source converters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The author presented a self-excited induction generator (SEIG) with DSTATCOM that mitigates voltage sag, compensates for reactive power, and improves power factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Microgrid energy sources combine renewable modules like wind turbines (WTs) and photovoltaic (PV) panels with non-renewable ones like diesel generators, etc. The PV panels and wind turbines are used to collect the highest power, which is governed by MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) blocks. It is a goal of the energy management system of microgrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The asynchronous machine was the first type of generator used for bigger wind turbines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Robust and inexpensive, it has no wearing parts (no collector brush system), thus reducing maintenance costs. In addition, the need for electronic equipment is reduced by joining the stator directly to the grid. Recently, the article reviews modeling powerful (WTs) systems to optimize and efficiently make use of the output power of the turbine via the MPPT method. The use of changeable speed (WTs), which quickly adjusts the rotation speed of the (WTs) in response to changeable wind speed, can produce higher efficiency in providing a wind source. With these techniques acquired by the MPPT controller which collects the highest power, we can find fuzzy inference system (FIS), nonlinear control, perturb and observe, and power signal feedback (PSF) control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Photovoltaic (PV) energy is sustainable energy that can be an alternative to fossil fuels. To this end, researchers are considering its future energy needs. Currently, the technology for manufacturing PV modules is greatly improved in terms of quality and manufacturing cost. The temperature and irradiation have a direct effect on the performance of a photovoltaic cell resulting in the degraded performance of the solar panel. The current–voltage features of a photovoltaic cell changed linearly with all changes in the solar irradiation. Because of the cloudy season (PV), module production has consistent fluctuations in insolation. The MPPT controller is used to magnify (PV) cell power by accordingly modifying the duty cycle of the (DC–DC) converter. In multiple works of literature, various MPPT techniques for PV solar have been suggested. Incremental conductance (INC) compares the slope of the power curve to determine whether the duty ratio should be increased or decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Perturb and observe (P&amp;O) observes the voltage level and perturbs the voltage until it holds the highest power point and the P&amp;O technique that uses the power variation as an error signal and calculates the required perturbation step using a traditional PI controller is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], a progressive approximation register type MPPT algorithm is presented; this method follows the MPPT by increasing the perturbation step in a binary manner starting from the least important bit. After spending the MPPT, a monotonically decreased step system is then utilized to find the exact MPPT. Furthermore, modified variants of the (P&amp;O) algorithm with minor changes in the results have been suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to reduce steady-state oscillations.</p><p id="Par28">Previously that was to maximize the production of sources and thus validate the objectives of energy autonomy and material profitability. The principle is to define a sequence recursive function of the power to be optimized, which always converges toward the maximum point, and this despite climatic variations. At each calculation step, one element of the sequence is evaluated and must be applied as a command instruction. We will see how to exploit the power characteristics of the wind turbine and PV panels, to design adapted MPPT algorithms; the battery energy storage system (BESS) is composed of static components and has a very fast dynamic reaction compared to typical generators. It can support a variety of different applications ranging from short-term power quality control to long-term power management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The incorporation of BESS into smart grids and microgrids systems considerably moves forward the computational complexity of the optimal power flow (OPF) difficulty, as it addresses the issue of dynamic OPF promptly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The optimal use of BESS is determined by network topology, meteorological conditions, and the state of charge (SoC) of the BESS. The battery systems suffer significant lifetime declines when undercharged or overcharged so the SoC limits are especially important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, due to their low output voltage, very low SoC batteries are unable to supply power to the network. The SoC of the BESS systems will also have an impact on the optimization actual function after battery efficiency is dependent on the SoC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For distributed systems, in the microgrid, or isolated sites, a good solution can be mixed-coupling, associating an AC and DC bus. Among the sources and storage units, we have presented are photovoltaic panels and batteries that operate at DC power. Instead, wind turbines operate on alternating power. Finally, the loads can be either continuous or alternating, depending on the case. This solution makes it possible to connect each one to its corresponding bus, then to exchange the load or loads power between buses employing reversible DC/AC converters.</p><p id="Par29">We pursue to define the possible structures for a power system in an isolated site, thus generating little but having to ensure the management of its energy produced in total autonomy. Two components are then essential to its architecture: an energy source, if possible renewable, available close to the structure to be fed, and a storage unit capable of both storing excess production and returning it to complete it. MATLAB software is used to design an optimal structure and sizing scheme for the hybrid microgrid to supply load in this analysis. A hierarchical energy management system is suggested to increase the economy and robustness of the overall system by increasing the robustness and versatility of the island PV/wind/battery hybrid AC MG.</p><p id="Par30">This article uses MPPT control methods to control the converters of distributed generation for energy management in the microgrid.</p><p id="Par31">The rest of the paper is presented as follows: In stand-alone mode, Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> explains the device modeling of each part of the microgrid.

It combines numerous energy sources such as (PV panels, micro-turbines, small hydropower, fuel cells, small diesel generators, and mini-wind turbines), storages systems as a backup energy system, and AC/DC load for the energy consumption as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The microgrid can run in two modes: grid-connected and islanded. Research on microgrids in the literature mainly focuses on DC (constant voltage)- and AC (variable voltage)-type microgrids, which are defined by the nature of the voltage at the bus used. The DC bus connects all of the microgrid’s components in a DC-type microgrid. In an AC microgrid, all system components (sources and load) are joined to an AC bus using power converters. In this work, we will use a hybrid microgrid, which is an incorporation of the DC and AC bus. The system has some advantages over both AC and DC systems. AC or DC loads can be supplied without the need for an additional converter interface, increasing the efficiency and reliability of the system.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of an islanded microgrid</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43067_2022_46_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par33">As we can see from Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the microgrid system is composed of a battery, PV array, and wind turbine for the storage system.

Therefore, it results in two different modes of processing which are the surplus or absence of energy at the DC bus. The proposed single-phase hybrid energy system is simulated using MATLAB. The hybrid system has isolated DC sources. In this simulation, each energy source is connected with a boost converter to extract the maximum puissance from each source. So, the P&amp;O MPPT technique is used for tracking the maximum voltage and current for the PV panel and wind turbine. The simulation runs for 3 s with 1e-5 sampling time, to present the voltage at the DC bus for different values of solar irradiation and wind speed. To show the robustness of our management strategy against the cruel variations of the meteorological condition, we have selected different scenarios containing multiple irradiation changes to represent all possible scenarios as we can see in Figs. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> and <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Solar irradiation scenario with (W/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43067_2022_46_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig><fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Wind speed scenario with (m/s)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43067_2022_46_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par58">As we can see from Figs. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> and <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> two proposed scenarios for the irradiation and the wind speed for three seconds.

The key obstacle for the stand-alone system is the intermittent existence of solar PV and wind sources. By integrating the two resources into an optimum microgrid, the DC bus or AC bus with an energy storage system as a backup system, the impact of the variable nature of solar and wind resources can be partially resolved and the overall system becomes more reliable and economical to run. This report presents the hybrid microgrid system, composed of multiple renewable energy resources. These renewable energy resources include a 2-kW solar plant, 2 kW for the wind turbine, and 2 kW provided using the battery system. The output voltage of each system has been connected to the DC bus to provide 400 V at the DC bus. Inverter input is powered by DC bus bar voltage. The full-bridge inverter converts direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) and is controlled in an open loop. The system has been tested with a variety of wind speeds and PV panel irradiance values. The results show the robustness of the proposed system in synchronizing the AC output voltage, frequency, and amplitude of the load AC. The system has produced the desired outcomes. The voltages at the converters' outputs, despite variable variations (solar irradiation and wind speed), were observed as a result of the analysis to quickly reach the reference voltage of 400 V and remain stable at this value, thanks to the proposed control algorithms (MPPT-PID) proposed on the DC bus bar side.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The design of the work was done by SK.
