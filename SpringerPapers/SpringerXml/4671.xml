Here we show that nanostructured iron (III) oxyhydroxide on nitrogen-doped carbon enables high Faraday efficiency (97.4%) and selectivity to acetic acid (61%) at very-low potential (âˆ’0.5â€‰V vs silver/silver chloride). Using a combination of electron microscopy, operando X-ray spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory simulations, we correlate the activity to acetic acid at this potential to the formation of nitrogen-coordinated iron (II) sites as single atoms or polyatomic species at the interface between iron oxyhydroxide and the nitrogen-doped carbon. The evolution of hydrogen is correlated to the formation of metallic iron and observed as dominant reaction path over iron oxyhydroxide on oxygen-doped carbon in the overall range of negative potential investigated, whereas over iron oxyhydroxide on nitrogen-doped carbon it becomes important only at more negative potentials.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Trapping carbon dioxide within usable chemicals is a promising means to mitigate climate change, yet electrochemical Câ€“C couplings are challenging to perform.

As a consequence, the electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) over different electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> is increasingly investigated with the biggest challenge being the formation of products &gt;C1. Copper has shown an incomparable efficiency to form hydrocarbons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, but despite this, a poor stability, selectivity, and high overpotentials are limiting factors. The opportunity to facilitate one selective path amongst the others relies on the possibility to kinetically control the energetics of adsorbed reaction intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, on a specific surface structure. This demands new ideas in catalyst design attainable through a molecular level understanding of the reaction mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">With respect to the selectivity issue, molecular catalysis can be product specific and highly efficient, however redox processes are limited to the transfer of only a few electrons, thereby leading to products of lower technological interest such as CO.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, it was shown that the immobilization of molecular species such as Co porphyrins on graphite and graphene opens up opportunities for multistep reduction products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We have also demonstrated the synthesis of acetic acid via CO<sub>2</sub>RR over Cu on carbon nanotubes (Cu/CNTs) electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. With respect to the multistep synthesis of acetic acid from fossil fuels, the direct CO<sub>2</sub>RR allows lowering of the carbon footprint by a factor of 5â€“6, due to the combination of process intensification, use of CO<sub>2</sub> as raw material and use of renewable energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Nitrogen species in carbon have been also reported to convert CO<sub>2</sub> to C1 products, such as CO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Compared to metal-free nanocarbons, C supported metal nanoparticles allow improving performances and lowering CO<sub>2</sub>RR overpotentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction is also favored. Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported high CO<sub>2</sub>RR efficiency to acetate and formate over Si/N-doped nanodiamond with high Faraday efficiency of 91.2â€“91.8% at âˆ’0.8 to âˆ’1.0â€‰V vs RHE, where the high overpotential for the HER was the favorable factor.</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we explore the CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity of Fe oxyhydroxide nanostructures supported on O- and N-doped graphitic supports in a CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.05â€‰M KHCO<sub>3</sub> solution. We report the outstanding performance of ferrihydrite-like (<italic>Fh-</italic>FeOOH) clusters on N-doped carbon (N-C) with a total CO<sub>2</sub>RR Faraday efficiency above 97 % and high selectivity to acetic acid at very-low potential (âˆ’0.5â€‰V vs Ag/AgCl). We apply operando hard X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy to obtain insights into: the nature of the sites responsible for CO<sub>2</sub>RR at low potentials, particularly those enabling Câ€“C coupling (to form acetic acid); and dynamic structural changes upon potential changes. This study reveals the reversible redox chemistry of <italic>Fh</italic>-FeOOH nanostructures on N-C in low concentration bicarbonate solution, characterized by the formation of Fe(II) species at potentials relevant for CO<sub>2</sub>RR, whereas at more negative potentials those species turn into Fe<sup>0</sup>. In contrast, there is no significant formation of Fe(II) species in the <italic>Fh</italic>-FeOOH supported on O-containing carbon in this voltage range, and the only structural modification observed is the reduction of some of the <italic>Fh-</italic>FeOOH clusters to Fe<sup>0</sup>. The H<sub>2</sub> evolution is indeed correlated to the transformation of Fe(III) into Fe<sup>0</sup>. By a combination of ambient pressure soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations we prove that a chemical interaction occurs between Fe sites of ferrihydrite and the pyridine N species on the carbon surface. As a consequence of the favorable Feâ€“N interaction, Fe species, initially present as single atoms or clusters decorating the N-functionalized edges of the graphitic planes, are stabilized as Fe(II) species at a potential consistent with the carbonation of ferrihydrite and the formation of a Fe(II)Fe(III) mixed compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This potential range coincides with the highest Faraday efficiency to CO<sub>2</sub>RR products. We conclude that the few relevant species for Câ€“C coupling are an ensemble of chemically interacting (bi)carbonate-bearing Fe(II) species and N atoms, the latter one also capable of chemisorbing CO<sub>2</sub>-related species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This study deepens our understanding of the reactivity of this class of electrocatalysts in CO<sub>2</sub>RR and their structural transformation into HER selective materials and provides guidance for the synthesis of improved electrocatalysts for the CO<sub>2</sub>RR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structure of Fe/N-O and Fe/O-C</title><p id="Par9">In this work, the catalysts were synthesized by impregnation and subsequent thermal annealing of the Fe nitrate precursor on pieces of N and O functionalized C paper.

The thermal annealing of this sample up to 473â€‰K in UHV leads to the decrease of the O and Fe abundances and the increase of the N and C abundances (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The decrease in the amount of O species is due to the condensation of the Fe oxyhydroxide structural units, while the decrease of the amount of Fe is the consequence of the particles size increase due to sintering, which are then not entirely probed by this surface sensitive measurement (ca. 0.5â€‰nm information depth for electron ofÂ  KE 150â€‰eV). The <italic>Fh</italic>-FeOOH phase changes from a predominantly Fe(III) phase to a mixed Fe(III) /Fe(II) (red line in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>).

However, when terminal Câ€“H species at the edge are substituted by pyridinic N species, the interaction energy becomes significantly more negative (âˆ’1.9â€‰eV) as the result of the formation of two N-Fe bonds per supercell. Energy minimization leads to N-Fe bond lengths of 2.0â€‰Ã… and 2.1â€‰Ã…, which are similar to Feâ€“N (pyridine) bond distances reported in the literature. It is clear then that the presence of pyridinic nitrogen at the carbon edge stabilizes the C/ferrihydrite interface, by ~0.4â€‰eV per N-Fe bond formed. The formation of the chemical bond is accompanied by charge transfer from the N atom to the Fe ion, whose Bader charge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> decreases from 1.62 a.u. to 1.26 a.u. indicating a partial reduction.

However, this is not a favorable process as the formation of such interface, including the gas phase species, requires a large positive (5.4â€‰eV) energy.

The cell has a three-electrode configuration: the working electrode (about 0.64â€‰cm<sup>2</sup>) was located at the cathode side, at a small distance from a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode to reduce the solution resistance. A commercial Pt rod (Amel) immersed in the anode compartment was used as the counter-electrode. The anode and cathode compartments were physically separated using a proton-conducting membrane (NafionÂ® 117, supplied by Ion Power). A 0.05â€‰M KHCO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte both in cathode and anode compartments. To assure a uniform distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> in the cathode compartment, the electrolyte solution was introduced into an external reservoir and saturated with a continuous flow of pure CO<sub>2</sub> (10â€‰mLâ€‰min<sup>âˆ’1</sup>). A peristaltic pump was used to continuously circulate the CO<sub>2</sub> saturated electrolyte solution through the cathode compartment and the external reservoir. A potentiostat/galvanostat (Amel mod. 2049â€‰A) was employed to supply a constant bias between the electrodes.</p><p id="Par63">The experiments were carried out at three different voltages (âˆ’0.5, âˆ’1, and âˆ’1.5â€‰V), which were maintained for 30â€‰min. Sampling from the external container was made to analyze the liquid products by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS, Thermo Trace 8000â€‰A EVO, Triple Quadrupole MS, column Stabilwax) and Ion Chromatography (IC Metrohm 940 with conductivity and amperometry professional detector Vario). The gas products were detected by sampling the outlet gaseous stream and analyzed by Gas-chromatography (GC- TCD, Agilent 7890â€‰A, column 5â€‰A Plot). Before starting chronoamperometric experiments, CV measurements were conducted on the electrocatalysts in the potential interval 0/âˆ’2â€‰V (vs Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 10 mVs<sup>âˆ’1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Computational methods</title><p id="Par64">The Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> was used to carry out quantum mechanical calculations within the Kohn-Sham implementation of the DFT.

The number of planewaves in the basis set is controlled by the cutoff energy, which in our calculations was <italic>E</italic><sub>cut</sub>â€‰=â€‰520â€‰eV, 30% above the standard value for the set of PAW potentials. Integrations in the reciprocal space were performed using a fine grid of Ð“-centered <italic>k</italic>-points with a maximum separation of 0.01â€‰Ã…<sup>âˆ’1</sup> in the reciprocal space. All precision parameters were tested for convergence of the total energy to within 1 meVatom<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Spin polarization was allowed in the simulations of iron-based systems, and the magnetic moments were calculated in ferromagnetic configurations for simplicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par65">The authors declare that all data supporting the current findings of this study are available in the main manuscript or in the Supplementary information.
