Consumer products, once they reach the end of their lifespan, are often discarded due to the difficulty in recycling their various materials and designs, which are produced inexpensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The use of rare and toxic materials, which can harm the environment if not properly disposed of, adds to the concern. The emergence of technology with a self-contained life cycle, such as easily recyclable objects, materials that are affordable and renewable, and temporary or biodegradable systems, provides new possibilities in a variety of industries, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, security, and intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Current advancements in robotics are often influenced by the diversity found in nature. This includes a focus on safe interaction between humans and machines, swarm robotics, and autonomous operation without a tether [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Scientists from various fields are working to create soft and lightweight robots that mimic the fluid movements and energy efficiency of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The complexity of nature is a source of inspiration for these developments. Soft robots are drawing considerable attention due to their advantageous qualities. They can deform and maintain their mechanical strength, adapt to their surroundings without endangering humans, and manufacture more cost-effective than their rigid counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the use of soft robots in our daily lives will bring up environmental worries like energy or power consumption and material waste. To solve this, we can make these robots in a way that is better for the environment, like nature does.</p><p id="Par4">Soft robots face unique challenges due to the close relationship between their sensing and actuation devices and their overall function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To overcome these difficulties, the development of soft actuators is crucial. These actuators should be able to respond to various stimuli, show large deformations, and still maintain their mechanical resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These actuators have a lot of promise to be used in areas like sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], artificial muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], microrobots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and micro-manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The advancements are the result of extensive research into soft actuators for various industries aimed at addressing the growing demand for energy and material consumption of soft actuators in mobile devices. The future challenge for autonomous soft robots lies in combining various fields to achieve better performance and sustainability. Collaboration between experts from various disciplines, including material science, chemistry, engineering, biology, computer science, and robotics, will be necessary to successfully integrate components such as actuators, sensors, computing, and power through only one robot.</p><p id="Par5">There are many insightful reviews available on various areas of soft technology, such as soft robots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], electronic skins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], wearable devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], rehabilitation exoskeletons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and textile exosuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Despite the existence of literature related to soft actuators, there is a lack of research works on sustainable soft actuators (SSAs) and fabrication techniques that are explicitly tailored for low or zero power consumption, with minimal material waste. This review emphasizes the design principles and manufacturing approaches that enable the creation of soft actuators that are eco-friendly, consume less power, and produce minimal waste. The article places particular emphasis on SSAs and fabrication methods, beginning with an examination of sustainability and different approaches for reducing the environmental impact of technology. The authors then shift their focus to soft and lightweight multi-responsive and shape-locking soft actuators, which require minimal power to activate or none to maintain their position. The paper outlines the suitability of each actuator through specific examples and assesses the future growth potential of the soft actuators discussed. Notably, the evaluation of biological soft actuators stands out because of their ability to be activated by water or humidity, offering a sustainable option worth considering. Additionally, the article explores the potential of multi-material printing for soft actuators, as this technology minimizes waste production.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Why Sustainable Actuators?</title><p id="Par6">Soft actuators have gained significant utilization in various industries and research disciplines in the last few decades, prompting researchers to focus extensively on this field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The remarkable capabilities exhibited by these actuators have sparked considerable interest across different domains of study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The visualization in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a highlights the most frequently utilized keywords associated with soft actuators since 2010, providing valuable insights into the prominent areas of exploration using the visualization tool named VOSviewer. Additionally, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b from Web of Science data presents a comprehensive overview of the percentage distribution of soft actuator development across different sections, emphasizing the diverse applications being pursued in response to specific requirements. The data elucidates that multiple fields have been actively working on the advancement of soft actuators, tailoring their designs to suit needs. This underscores the versatility and adaptability of soft actuators as a technology.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> The frequently utilized keywords associated with soft actuators. <bold>b</bold> The progress made in developing soft actuators across various research domains. <bold>c</bold> The distribution of soft actuator publications as a percentage over time</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40684_2023_533_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">Furthermore, an intriguing trend has emerged since 2010, as evidenced by a substantial surge in the number of research endeavours focused on soft actuators (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). This exponential growth attests to the escalating interest and recognition of the immense potential held by soft actuators in advancing numerous scientific and technological domains. The expanding body of research signifies the increasing significance placed on harnessing the capabilities of soft actuators to address a wide range of challenges and pave the way for innovative solutions in various fields.</p><p id="Par8">Moreover, soft actuators are devices that are used to produce motion or force through the deformation of a soft material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, developed actuators consume energy to be activated or required a constant power source to hold them in the required position. Meanwhile, they require high electrical voltage like dielectric actuators to be activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Hence, it is vital to reduce energy consumption for long-term tasks or develop actuators with less activation power. SSAs are those that are designed and developed to reduce their environmental impact and promote sustainability.</p><p id="Par9">One of the key considerations in SSAs is the selection of materials and reduce material consumption. The materials used in these devices can significantly impact their sustainability. Sustainable materials can be used to reduce the device’s environmental impact. In addition to material selection, energy efficiency is another important factor to consider when designing SSAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Soft actuators can be designed to be energy-efficient, consuming minimal energy to produce motion or force. This can be achieved by optimizing the design of the actuator and using energy-efficient control systems. Also, multi-responsive soft actuators are an alternative option to reduce power consumption due to the multi-triggering ways to activate them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Another approach to achieving SSAs is to design them to be biodegradable. Soft actuators can be made from materials that are designed to decompose naturally at the end of their lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This can help reduce the amount of waste generated by the device and promote sustainability. Manufacturing processes are also a key consideration when designing SSAs. The manufacturing processes used to produce soft actuators can impact their sustainability. Processes that use minimal energy or produce minimal waste can be employed to reduce the environmental impact of the device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Finally, the end-of-life management of the device can also impact its sustainability. Designing SSAs with easy disassembly and recyclability in mind can promote a circular economy and reduce waste.</p><p id="Par11">While there have been advancements in developing SSAs using various methods and techniques, there are still challenges that need to be addressed and understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Researchers should find a balance between performance and sustainability when selecting materials for soft actuators. Also, energy efficiency is another critical factor in achieving SSAs. Soft actuators typically consume a considerable amount of energy to operate and designing energy-efficient soft actuators is crucial to reducing their environmental impact. This can be achieved by optimizing their design and using energy-efficient control systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Moreover, durability is another challenge that must be addressed when designing SSAs. Soft actuators are often made from soft materials that can be prone to wear and tear, limiting their lifespan. Designing SSAs that can last longer and withstand repeated use is critical. This can be achieved by selecting durable materials and optimizing the design of the device to reduce stress on the materials. Designing soft actuators that can be easily disassembled, recycled, or disposed of in an environmentally friendly way is crucial for achieving sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This requires a holistic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of the device. Meanwhile, there is currently no standardized framework for designing SSAs, making it challenging to compare different designs and assess their environmental impact. Developing a standardized framework for SSA design can help accelerate their development and adoption.</p><p id="Par13">These are just a few challenges of developing SSAs. Eliminating these drawbacks will lead to advance soft actuators which are green and sustainable for a circular economy. The development of SSAs presents several significant challenges that need to be addressed to create more environmentally friendly devices. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach and collaboration between various stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and industry experts. By overcoming these challenges and eliminating the drawbacks, it is possible to develop advanced soft actuators that are more green, sustainable, and suitable for a range of applications in a circular economy. Achieving these goals would benefit the environment and improve the performance, reliability, and lifespan of soft actuators, making them a more viable option for a wide range of industries and applications. Therefore, it is crucial to continue research and development in this field to create more sustainable and efficient soft actuators in the future. In this review, we will investigate low-energy consumption, multi-responsive soft actuators, biological actuators, and manufacturing techniques of soft actuators to reduce material consumption as part of a circular economy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of Soft Actuators</title><p id="Par14">Soft actuators are a type of flexible device that has been designed to mimic the motion and functionality of biological systems such as muscles, tendons, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Unlike traditional rigid actuators, soft actuators are made of soft and flexible materials that enable them to deform and adapt to different shapes, environments, and applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The manufacturing methods for soft actuators can vary depending on the type of actuator and the materials used. There are general steps in all actuators from design to testing via different manufacturing techniques. The processes can be divided into different categories, including 3D printing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], 4D printing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], casting and moulding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], textile processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], electrospinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], laser cutting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], origami/kirigami folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and electrowetting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

There are different ways to activate soft actuators as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. The use of materials that are responsive to different stimuli is a promising way in the creation of soft actuators. Soft actuators and devices often utilize soft materials that are made through low-temperature fabrication processes, making the production process easier and more cost-effective.

These techniques involve processes such as cutting, moulding, spinning, lithography, and 3D/4D printing, among others. Each technique's suitability is determined by the characteristics of the material. In the subsequent section, we will offer an overview outline of these fundamental techniques.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Moulding</title><p id="Par27">Moulding is an economical technique that falls under the category of forming manufacturing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. It enables the production of several thousand parts using a single mould insert. There are five categories of moulding techniques. Since its heating and cooling cycles are short, one of the major processes is injection moulding, which is mostly used for large-scale manufacturing. The second is reaction injection moulding, which uses heat or ultraviolet (UV) light to activate polymer solidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. The third process, hot embossing, entails inserting a film into a mould and creating a residual layer over time. This method is ideal for laboratory settings, as it results in lower stress levels in the polymer and has the potential for higher aspect ratios. Injection-compressed moulding, the fourth step, combines the stamping and injection moulding processes. Finally, the creation of patterns with large aspect ratios is frequently done using the popular thermoforming process. Moulding, on the other hand, is commonly employed in creating soft actuators based on pneumatic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. For the construction of arrays, moulding has several advantages, including quick manufacturing, uniform surface coverage, customizable pillar diameter size, and adjustable pillar spacing. It does, however, have several limits, notably when mixing various materials and building complex constructions. It is great for materials with long solidification durations, including poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and is more suitable for mass production than prototyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cutting</title><p id="Par28">Cutting is a mechanical process used in subtractive manufacturing, usually with blades or lasers. However, laser cutting is a more sophisticated form of cutting that has several benefits, such as greater precision, resolution, and no wear and tear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. To obtain the finest cut with the highest degree of precision, several variables must be tuned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. Laser cutting can be used to cut and engrave a wide range of polymers and metals. This method can be used in making origami and kirigami smart structures or actuators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. This shows that manufacturing using equipment enables better control over designs and raises the standard of fabrication in general. However, cutting, like other subtractive manufacturing techniques, is unable to combine a variety of materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Spinning</title><p id="Par29">Spinning is a method of forming manufacturing that alters the shape of material without adding or removing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. However, not all materials are capable of being formed into fibres. The fundamental condition for fibre creation is that the solidification process must proceed more quickly than the material's rate of relaxation. This prevents stretched liquid objects from reverting to a more energetically advantageous spherical form due to the surface tension force. Based on the process used to harden fibres after spinning, fibre-spinning methods are divided into four categories: wet, dry, melt, and gel spinning. The diameter range for wet spinning is roughly between 250 and 500 μm, and the fibres are solidified in a coagulation bath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. In contrast, to melt spinning, which uses extrusion to solidify a molten polymer in the air, dry spinning uses airflow to dry and solidify fibres. Gel spinning includes extending the partially dried gel to produce fibres after chilling and drying the extruded gel solution with other solvents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Microfluidics is another fibre fabrication method that is a derivative of wet spinning and produces fibres in the micro range. However, the mechanical stability of the fibres obtained using this method is a current issue.</p><p id="Par30">Electrospinning is a type of fibre-spinning method that falls under the category of dry and melt spinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. It involves using an electrical field to draw fibres from a solution or melt, resulting in small-diameter fibres ranging from several nanometers to micrometres in size and with a high surface area. Touch spinning, which starts with the initial contact between the polymer and wire and forms a fluid connection that lengthens once the collector turns and the solvent evaporates, is another technique for creating fibres that are smaller than nanometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. In addition, the fibres produced through spinning are drawn and have strongly oriented polymer chains aligned with the direction of the stretching, leading to increase strength and hardness compared to materials formed through other methods. Multicomponent fibres can be produced by spinning multiple polymers simultaneously. These fibres can exhibit bending and curling behaviour due to their asymmetric composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. One illustration of such a fibre is the Janus fibre, which is composed of two substances with various softening points and is capable of changing shape when one of the polymers experiences a change in property. These fibres can be created using melt spinning and have potential applications in the creation of self-walking structures and multi-responsive soft actuators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Lithography</title><p id="Par31">Based on the type of irradiation, there are many lithography techniques, including photolithography, electron beam lithography, and ion beam lithography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Accordingly, this technique may be utilised to create multi-responsive soft actuators. In photolithography, the desired geometric pattern is created on the surface by exposing a photosensitive polymer to light through a photomask. Depending on the light's wavelength and the optics employed, the resolution can reach hundreds of nanometers. By utilising electrons or ions to irradiate an electron- or ion-sensitive material, electron and ion beam lithography may produce objects with better resolution (30–50 nm) without the need of a photomask. Self-folding tubes and intricate three-layer structures with specialised geometries for cell adhesion have been made using photolithography, which is suited for producing few-layer films [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. This approach can create multilayer structures using various polymers, but it takes a lot of time and expensive equipment.</p><p id="Par32">In photolithography, materials that have been both cross-linked and fixed or removed without a half-tone are frequently utilised.

The time can be varied to create lateral gradients of swelling properties, which enable different shape transformations. Photosensitive compounds, such as photoresists or active polymers, are required for photolithography.

This technique involves extruding a material onto a substrate which then hardens. The nozzle is moved in the X and Y axes by a motor, while the printed layer is built up in the Z-axis by moving the nozzle upwards. This process is repeated until the final structure is completed. The 3D printer liquefier is the main element utilised in this kind of printing. The extruder on the printer consists of two parts: a cold end and a hot end. A stepper motor controls the cold end's feed rate as it extracts the material from the spool using either gear- or roller-based torque. The feedstock is then forced into the hot end, which has a heating chamber and a nozzle, by the cold end. The feedstock is melted in the liquefier, which is a component of the heating chamber. The thin plastic bead that results from pushing this liquid through the tiny nozzle sticks to the surface it is printed on.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>] created a new technique for embedding CNT onto a photo-crosslinked poly (-caprolactone) (cPCL) film using hot pressing, which allowed them to produce a soft actuator that was sensitive to several stimuli. The mechanical and thermal stability of the cPCL films were enhanced by the addition of CNT to its surface. The final multi-responsive actuator maintained its heat actuation while exhibiting good electric actuation. Furthermore, the actuator demonstrated a larger recovery force and a faster rate of recovery compared to cPCL films with just one CNT-embedded surface. It should be emphasised that reversible SMPs can lose some of their inherent actuation capability when CNT is added, therefore finding a means to include CNT without doing so is still a difficult task. Ji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>] developed a soft actuator with a dual-response and self-sensing feature using a 2D metallic molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>). Due to the good electrical property and network structure of CNTs, the great photothermal property of 1 T phase MoS<sub>2</sub>, the hygroscopic expansion of paper, and the thermal expansion of polyimide, this actuator responds to external voltage and light stimulation and generates quick and massive bending deformation. The MoS<sub>2</sub>-CNT composite film's piezoresistive ability was used to detect real-time bending deformation using the actuator's dual function as a flexible strain sensor. The MoS<sub>2</sub>-based actuator has been utilised to create wearable intelligent gloves that automatically close to prevent light irradiation as well as a flexible mechanical gripper that can handle delicate items with uneven forms. Additionally, the sensing capability of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-based actuator is combined to provide a gripper with an integrated sensing function.

The resultant thermosetting soft actuator could effectively and frequently self-heal in the presence of five stimuli, including electromagnetic waves, heat, solvent, light, and electricity, and could also react to four stimuli at once. Due to the characteristics of the vitrimer, the actuator was also durable, sustainable, recyclable, and reprocessable. This makes it a flexible and adaptable instrument for usage in a range of environmental situations. Also, Chen et al.

These actuators are an economical and ecologically beneficial option since they work in conjunction with humidity and sunlight without extra energy input. Vitrimeric materials are categorized as polymers that can maintain their mechanical properties even after multiple processing and shaping cycles.

With 1.5 V electric voltage, the actuator could travel a significant offset distance of 20 mm. The temperature and curvature that corresponded were 32.7 °C and 0.079 mm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The actuator was bionic and could detect temperature variations as well as grab items like how natural flytraps do. The actuator also can walk at a pace of up to 16.52 mm/second. The soft actuator's adaptable characteristics, which may be activated by a variety of stimuli in a variety of situations and circumstances, make it very sustainable. For soft robotics, flexible actuators with high mechanical strength and multiple responsivenesses are crucial. Tang et al.

The biaxially oriented polypropylene layer and the bacterial cellulose layer's hygroexpansion and thermal expansion were the driving forces behind the actuator's dual-mechanism synergistic effect. Contrary to traditional actuators that employed a single actuation, this design offers an architecture that is more conducive to reversible actuation performance under electrical and NIR light stimuli. Compared to other single-mechanism soft actuators that have been described, the actuator achieved the largest bending angle (around 400°) at the lowest 4 V voltage. Being able to be driven by NIR light at a distance of 2 m, it also exhibits exceptional long-distance photoresponsiveness.

Devices that may convert several types of energy into mechanical motion include bilayer multi-responsive soft actuators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>]. These gadgets have a bilayer construction, consisting of two responsive layers, that can react to different stimuli, such as electrical, thermal, and chemical ones. These devices are versatile and adaptable to various applications and environments. The bilayer structure can be composed of a variety of materials like hydrogels, polymers, and composites and consists of two layers with distinct properties, such as different thermal expansion coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>]. The bilayer structure experiences differential expansion or contraction between the two layers in response to a stimulus, leading to bending or curling and producing mechanical motion. For example, Zhong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>] introduced liquid vapour phase transitions to programmable thermochromic soft actuators (PTSAs). PTSAs were programmable thermochromic soft actuators that were susceptible to drastic volume fluctuations because of implanted low boiling point fluid that undergoes reversible liquid-to-vapour phase transitions.

Three alternative modes for starting shape and deformation type might be simply programmed into these actuators' "two-dimensional" design. Multiple stimuli might cause PTSAs to react. They were appropriate for use in a variety of applications, including wearable devices, because of their suitable operating temperature and stretchability. Also, Amjadi et al.

These bending actuators could function at low input electric power per unit area (0.14 W cm<sup>2</sup>), low input voltages (8 V), and low-temperature fluctuations (35 °C). With strong actuation and reversible behaviour, they could change shape with curvature radii up to 1.07 cm<sup>−1</sup> and a bending angle of 360°.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>] used in situ dopamine polymerization along PVA macromolecular chains and the inclusion of ionic coordination between polymer molecular chains (PVA and polydopamine chains) and metal ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) to develop an adhesive and modulus tailorable interface (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). To boost water tolerance and absorption, which is necessary for adjusting the adhesion and modulus of the interface, the Fe<sup>3+</sup> cations encouraged coordination. The resultant interface was used to create a soft, ultra-thin, skin-compliant sensor that is also self-adhesive and multi-responsive with a configurable modulus for locking actuator modes and lowering power consumption. To gain a deeper understanding of the sensing ability of the on-skin sensor, the researchers measured and graphed the resistance change of the sensor when subjected to strain. This study presents a novel approach to addressing interface-related challenges in sensing and actuating.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>] unveiled a brand-new kind of double-layered actuator based on light- and EAP (LEAP). The LEAP actuators have a 250% increase in displacement over standard EAP actuators and can support items that are three times heavier. The LEAP actuators also have a special self-locking capability that allows the bending action to be maintained for several tens of minutes without power. These self-locking LEAP actuators can hold an item for 15 min at a 3 V working voltage and have a significant, reversible bending strain of over 2.0% (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Researchers created a multifunctional artificial muscle based on a concentric tube/rod built of polydopamine-coated LCE and low-melting-point alloy, inspired by the linked behaviour of muscles, bones, and nerves in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>] introduced soft electromagnetic actuators that were integrated with SMP films, enabling them to deform and latch into a wide range of configurations (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). The component was made up of liquid metal coils that were sandwiched between two SMP sheets and an elastomer cover. The SMP's rigidity was greatly decreased by heating it. When a magnetic field was present and current was flowing through a liquid metal coil, the device experienced substantial bending or twisting. Once the SMP was cooled, the shape was locked in, and the device could bear a load. Despite starting as a flat device, complex shapes could be achieved through this process. Also, Lalegani Dezaki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>] provided details of an innovative idea for advanced bi-stable magnetorheological composite actuators (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). A lightweight, bi-stable composite actuator with customizable magnetic patterns was possible because of the use of magnetorheological elastomer composites and 4D printing of conductive SMPs. The actuator was propelled by Joule heating and magnetic fields, and it might be left in the actuated position for a long time without any stimulation. The actuator had the potential used in mechanical and biological systems and had a lifting capacity of 200 g.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold>. (I) The actuator is depicted schematically as being made up of three-square segments connected by three small joints. The segments are composed of liquid metal coils encased in a silicone shell and have a coating of an SMP covering both the top and bottom surfaces. The joints contain stretchable heaters on both sides in addition to having the same internal construction as the segments. (II) By passing electricity through one or more coils, the device is electromagnetically activated, producing a bending or twisting force depending on the direction of the external magnetic field. Due to the SMP's high rigidity and lack of heater current, the hinges do not distort when they are cold. The SMP stiffness decreases by two orders of magnitude and the Lorentz force permits bending or twisting when the hinges are heated above the SMP's glass transition temperature. When the heating current is turned off, the form is locked in place, enabling the coil current to be disconnected. (III) The pictures show several latched states that were attained by a series of bend-and-latch and twist-and-latch procedures. To achieve a variety of distinctive configurations, the sequence and kind of joint deformation can be changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>]. <bold>b</bold>. (I) A diagram illustrating the various stages involve in creating and implementing the proposed actuator. (II) A composite actuator is tested in a vertical position. The actuator is heated through Joule heating and a magnet is brought close to it. The actuator is attracted to the magnet, reaching its maximum temperature and bending angle. After the permanent magnet is removed, the actuator remains in its position. The actuator is heated once more using Joule heating, and it takes 18 s for it to assume its previous form. Throughout the actuator’s energization and attraction phases, heat dispersion is seen.

Pneumatic systems are cost-effective because they may be built using low-cost parts like solenoids and diaphragm pumps. These robots are composed of fibre-reinforced actuators and soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs), which comprise pneumatic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>]. SPAs are very flexible, safe, and capable of significant deformations. They also have strong power-to-weight ratios and are inexpensive to produce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>]. Positive or negative pressures can be used to activate SPAs, and vacuum actuators are best for situations with limited volumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>]. Based on their properties, SPAs display several sorts of movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">249</xref>]. Applications for SPAs include minimally invasive surgery, rehabilitation, helping the elderly, interacting with people and other robots, and handling delicate materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">250</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">252</xref>]. However, SPAs and robots still face challenges and limitations in terms of continuous input power to hold them in a required position. There have been developments in SPAs to make them variable stiffness and lock their shape in the required position. For example, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>] introduced a small soft gripper that uses a variable stiffness module made of polylactic acid (PLA) and a retractable mechanism to achieve a soft-rigid hybrid action. By using the variable stiffness module, the gripper could increase its stiffness by 18 times without losing its flexibility. The variable stiffness module was divided into three regions that can be activated separately to create varying levels of flexibility, while a water-cooling system reduces the cooling time. The retractable mechanism allowed the gripper to adjust its layout, expand its workspace, and perform manipulations by opening and closing its fingers. The soft fingers, combined with the ability to adjust stiffness, can maintain their shape and grip objects with a high load, without the need for repeated heating and cooling. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a, Pal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>] provided a simple method for quickly producing prestressed soft actuators (PSAs) that used elastic energy storage to increase the capabilities of soft robots. PSAs were produced by pouring a silicone elastomer into moulds created by a SLA 3D printer, followed by curing in an oven at 60 °C for 45 min. The elastomer was stretched and affixed to an inextensible blend of polyester and cellulose paper soaked in a liquid prepolymer. The entire assembly was then cured to create different PSAs. The pneumatic channel of the PSAs was connected to a polyethylene tubing using a cannula, and the PSAs were actuated by pneumatic means using a regulated compressed air supply. The prestressed elastomeric layer of PSAs contains elastic energy that can be used to build grippers that can perch upside down at 116° angles and hold up to 100 times their weight without the need for any external power. Both the final shape of the PSA and its actuation sequence may be set by adjusting the direction and strength of the force utilised to prestress the elastomeric layer. Additionally, the short recovery time (of around 50 ms), made possible by the release of elastic energy held in PSAs, greatly increases the actuation rates of soft pneumatic actuators, especially following motions requiring severe deformations. The development of bistable soft robotic systems that leverage elastic energy stored in the PSAs as a source of power amplification for quick movements is another benefit of strategically prestressing PSAs. Employing these methods has proven to be extremely advantageous in terms of reducing the overall energy consumption required for tasks that span extended periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold>. (I) A diagram showing how PSAs are made can be summarized as follows: First, a mould is used to cast and cure a layer of silicone elastomer that contains a network of air-filled channels. Then, a stamp with a textured surface is used to create cone-shaped structures on the elastomer layer's gripping surface. A paper sheet that has been impregnated with elastomer is coupled with the stretched elastomer layer to form the PSA’s strain-limiting layer. The pre-stretched elastomer finally contracts when the PSA is detached from the paper, causing the silicone-paper bilayer composite to curl. (II) When there is external pressure, the resultant PSA opens; otherwise, it is closed. The conical microstructures found on the PSA's gripping surface are shown in the inset of the picture. (III) After a 100 ms burst of pressurised air is given to the PSA's pneumatic channel at a pressure of 10 psi, FEM simulations show how the PSA gets activated (extended) and recovers. The PSA's elongation and subsequent recovery in response to the pressure are seen in the image. (IV) Snapshots depict the PSA catching a ball that is moving at approximately ≈ 10 m s <sup>− 1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>]. <bold>b</bold>. (I) The shape-locking ability of a composite structure made up of a 20-layer jamming structure and a pneumatic soft actuator is shown in this image. Panels 1–4 depict the deformation of the jamming structure into different forms, which are subsequently maintained by adding a vacuum. The jamming structure is shown in panel 5 attached to the soft actuator, which is pressurised to produce the necessary bending angle. In panel 6, the composite structure instantly recovers to its undistracted condition when the actuator is depressurized, and no vacuum is delivered to the jamming structure. However, in panel 7, the system maintains its form with excellent fidelity when a vacuum pressure of 85 kPa is supplied to the jamming structure before depressurizing the actuator. This is shown by a quantity R2 of 0.9835 between the arc of the ventral surface in panel 5 and the same arc in panel 7. (II) A variable kinematics system's FEM and experimental validation are shown in this picture. The system's schematic is shown in panel 1. With hoover on, the maximum-to-mean curvature ratio rose by a factor of 6.65, statistically proving the existence of joints. Panels 2 and 3 depict FEM of varied kinematics behaviour with increasing cable loads. The experimental verification of the variable kinematics system is shown in panel 4. A two-fingered grasper is shown in panel 5; each finger has a variable kinematics system and a rounded fingertip. When no suction was applied to the fingertips, the grasper could conduct a secure wrap grasp on a huge ball and withstand disturbance. The grasper could maintain a secure pinch grip on a ball with a diameter of one-eighth when hoover was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">256</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40684_2023_533_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">Moreover, jamming has advantages over fluidic actuation in terms of maximum stiffness and versatility, making it a popular mechanism in SPAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>]. It allows for the creation of systems that have high stiffness variation while minimizing volume changes. This technique also assists in shape locking and reducing power consumption. Narang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">256</xref>] demonstrated how the nonlinear laminar jamming phenomena may link the ideas of soft robotics with traditional rigid robotics. The authors generated extremely accurate finite element models (FEMs) of multi-layer laminar jamming structures as well as a model for two-layer jamming structures that considers all stages of deformation. Shape-locking and changeable kinematics, two novel properties of laminar jamming that the authors exhibited, showed how this phenomenon may allow soft machines to act like conventional rigid robots reversibly (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b). To demonstrate how jamming might improve the performance of real-world soft robotic systems, the authors also constructed a simple grasper that is capable of performing both pinch grasps and wrap grasps. Also, Crowley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">257</xref>] built a gripper with adjustable stiffness using a technique called positive pressure layer jamming. Utilizing specialised additive printing, the gripper was constructed from two materials: a soft airtight actuation bellow and a somewhat rigid backbone. It was discovered that positive pressure layer jamming technology had a larger performance potential than traditional vacuum layer jamming because it could apply higher pressure, resulting in a 1.6 × higher payload capacity. This technology was created to modify the stiffness of the gripper. Using the positive layer jamming technique, experimental tests revealed that the soft gripper was able to modify its stiffness by 25 × factor.</p><p id="Par61">Moreover, Lalegani Dezaki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258">258</xref>] presented a brand-new design for FDM 4D printed SMP meta-structures on meta-laminar jamming (MLJ) actuators (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Through hot and cold programming, negative air pressure, and both soft and harsh robot behaviour, these SSAs might act. Since they don't require constant negative air pressure to excite the actuator, MLJ actuators offer an advantage over traditional jamming actuators. Three-point bending and compression tests were used to assess the mechanical characteristics of the SMP meta-structures, which were 4D printed in a variety of forms. Using hot air programming, the shape memory effects (SMEs) and shape recovery of the meta-structures and MLJ actuators were examined. Better performance was shown by MLJ actuators with auxetic meta-structure cores in terms of contraction and bending with 100% shape recovery after stimulation. These environmentally friendly MLJ actuators were capable of lifting loads to 200 g in weight and can grip items of a variety of sizes and forms. MLJ actuators found valuable SSAs as grippers in long-term tasks where they could securely hold objects without requiring continuous energy consumption. These actuators were designed to maintain their gripping force over extended periods, making them suitable for scenarios that demand sustained holding capabilities. By utilizing their unique mechanical properties, MLJ actuators offered an energy-efficient solution for gripping tasks, reducing overall power consumption and contributing to longer operation times. Their ability to maintain a firm grip without constant energy input made them ideal for applications that prioritize energy efficiency and long-term stability. For wearable applications, Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">259</xref>] created a reconfigurable self-sensing pneumatic artificial muscle (RSPAM). By converting the soft actuator's expansion into contraction by fabric winding, the RSPAM was a modular multi-chamber soft actuator with a high contraction ratio that avoided compressing human tissue. The RSPAM has locking capability based on positive pressure jamming and self-sensing of contraction stroke based on liquid metal. The actuator's modular construction allows for configuration changes according to the application by varying the actuator quantity and fabric length. The actuator unit may also move independently on the fabric, giving the muscle the capacity to self-adjust. At 3 bar air pressure, the RSPAM was able to provide a driving force and contraction ratio of 70.14 N and 71%, respectively. Through square-wave tracking studies with closed-loop control, the displacement self-sensing capability was confirmed. Additionally, a preliminary evaluation of the RSPAM's capacity to help elbow movement revealed that it can minimise 53.05% of muscle fatigue. By utilizing this approach, individuals and organizations can effectively minimize the amount of energy required to complete a given task over a prolonged period. This reduction in energy usage not only leads to cost savings but also contributes to sustainability efforts by reducing carbon footprint and conserving natural resources. Furthermore, this method can also extend the lifespan of machinery and equipment by mitigating the wear and tear that occurs due to prolonged usage. Consequently, implementing this approach not only reduces energy consumption but also decreases the frequency of required maintenance, thereby saving on repair costs and minimizing downtime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>].<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(I) Fabrication procedure of MLJ actuator.

SMAs are a type of heat-activated smart material that utilizes the SME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263">263</xref>]. This implies that a high current is necessary to quickly move the actuator and create complex structures or robots. The nickel-titanium alloy (NiTi) is commonly used in SMA actuator design because of its excellent strain properties, which can reach up to 7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264">264</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">265</xref>]. Our study will centre around examining soft actuators that employ SMAs to achieve a particular phase-locking capability. These soft actuators are engineered to react to different stimuli and adapt to environmental changes. SMAs provide these actuators with the ability to change shape, which is valuable in numerous applications. With the ability to lock into a specific phase, these actuators can maintain a predetermined form or position, thus enhancing their accuracy and dependability. For example, Gong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">266</xref>] presented a solution to the challenges faced by SMA actuators, which were flexible and lightweight but had lower force density and consume excessive energy. A locking system that can mechanically maintain an actuator's contracted condition without requiring constant current was suggested as the fix. To prevent the actuator from extending in the other direction while locked, the locking mechanism was built using a ratchet structure and pawl. A bistable retractable mechanism was also used to transition between the locking and unlocking states with a single one-way actuation. This solution has the potential to overcome the limitations of SMA actuators and improve their performance in robotics applications. Additionally, since wearable robots run on batteries, it's critical to increase the effectiveness of their actuation mechanism to increase their operating time. Recently, soft wearable robots that employ fabric-type soft actuators have attracted a lot of attention. (FSAs). These actuators are soft, flexible, and light, but they need a steady stream of energy to stay actuated and support any burdens they could be carrying, like an item. Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267">267</xref>] created a locking-unlocking mechanism (LUM) that can maintain the FSA’s contraction condition without requiring a continuous energy supply to decrease the energy consumption needed for holding motions in FSAs. The LUM, which included a ratchet-pawl mechanism, pawl rotating actuators (PRA) with SMA springs, and a wire encoder, was fastened to the top of the FSA. The wire encoder monitors the length of the FSA contraction, and the PRA enabled the pawl to lock and unlock the ratchet. The length of the FSA might be adjusted to a certain displacement using the LUM's displacement controller. The LUM allowed FSAs to sustain loads and retain their contraction condition without having to continuously use energy. With a projected improvement of at least two times, this can greatly increase the operation time of soft wearable robots employing FSAs.</p><p id="Par63">Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">268</xref>] developed a brand-new class of composite actuators that made advantage of SMA to maintain a variety of configurations without requiring constant energy input. Fusible alloy (FA) material, Ni-chrome (Ni–Cr) wires, and SMA wires were incorporated into a smart soft composite (SSC) framework to create the actuators (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a). Continuous deformation was possible thanks to the SMA-based SSC structures' gentle morphing capabilities. By melting the FA structures using NieCr wires, the actuator's stiffness was managed. The actuator's stiffness in low- and high-stiffness states for various applied currents and heating times of the FA structure is measured in this paper, which also provides data on the actuator's design and manufacturing process. The findings demonstrated that the actuator's maximum rigidity was more than eight times greater than its minimum stiffness. Using actuators with one or two segments, the actuator's capacity to retain its form was examined, and the findings were compared to a numerical model. Also, Akbari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269">269</xref>] created soft composite actuators with form recovery and preservation capabilities (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>b). The resistive and SMA wires were inserted in the actuators, together with flexible elastomeric and stiff SMP layers. These materials were utilised to print the hinges for the bending actuators, and the embedded wires were then employed to use Joule heating to modify the temperature and bending stiffness of the hinges. They utilised a nonlinear FEM to forecast the deformation of the actuators and looked at how changing the thickness of the SMP layer affected shape retention and recovery. Without the aid of any outside mechanical force, the resultant actuators are capable of significant bending deformations, can maintain their bent shape, and can regain their original shape.

Through 580 cycles of cyclical testing, the consistency and dependability of the actuator response are confirmed. The soft bistable actuator's quick response time and small size make it ideal for use as an artificial muscle in shape-reconfigurable soft robots that can move in a variety of ways using SMA power. Three soft robots are developed to illustrate this, including a reconfigurable amphibious robot that can walk on land and swim in the water, a multimodal crawler that can crawl and leap, and a rolling robot inspired by caterpillars that can crawl and roll.

The actuator may be retained in a bent position with the help of a pre-stretched elastomer, which results in a decrease in the energy needed to maintain that position. This is important in soft robotics, as these robots are often powered by batteries with limited capacity and reducing energy usage can extend their operational time. Meanwhile, to achieve energy savings, shape-locking features can also be added to secure the target position. This means that energy input is only required to initially bend the actuator, and no further energy is needed to maintain the bent position. Using the pre-stretched technique and shape-locking features can significantly reduce energy consumption in soft robotics, which is particularly useful in portable or battery-powered devices where energy usage is a concern.

The technique is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>a by applying the idea of a twining plant (Dioscorea bulbifera) to a self-tightening splint. D. bulbifera exhibits a squeezing force on its support to offer stability against gravity by the tensioning of its stem helix. In a wrist-forearm splint without external stimuli, the function of self-tightening is prototyped after the squeezing pressures of these bio-inspired motion mechanisms are assessed. By drawing inspiration from the multi-phase motion found in hygroscopic plant structures, Tahouni et al.

The authors showed numerous prototypes, including a self-locking mechanism with a multi-step self-shaping and locking function and an aperture with overlapping pieces that finished their movement sequentially to avoid collision. These techniques, however, are not restricted to 3D or 4D printing processes. Recently, Luo et al.

Due to their hygromorphic bending or coiling actuators, these carriers exhibit great stiffness (4.9 GPa when dry and 1.3 GPa when wet) and enormous bending curvatures (1,854 m<sup>−1</sup>). The carriers can transport payloads of varied sizes and substances, including biofertilizers and plant seeds as large as those of whitebark pine, and have an 80% drilling success rate on flat terrain because of their advantageous resting position.

This is because most materials have soft properties, and the softer the material, the more quickly the actuator can react, but the less weight it can support. On the other hand, if the material’ s stiffness is increased, the reaction time shortens and soft actuators lose flexibility and safety. Therefore, one of the biggest challenges in the development of WR materials is striking a compromise between mechanical characteristics and actuation capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR294">294</xref>]. It is necessary to integrate WR-based smart actuators with sensors, controllers, and other mechanisms to complete tasks since they may function as either an actuator or detectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">295</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">297</xref>]. For this reason, actuators must be compatible with other functionalities. However, compatibility is hindered by material properties, energy supply, and working environment. Actuators are unable to support heavy loads because of their small size and soft material. Since they only need a little amount of deformation to complete jobs in particular application settings, they are frequently utilised as sensors, such as clever switches and smart drawstrings. Wet-sensitive actuators that are integrated with other devices must also have their energy needs addressed because they operate on humidity gradients rather than a power source. Since these actuators operate in humid conditions, integrated devices must be treated for anticorrosion, water tightness, and insulation to guarantee stable functioning after being installed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Multi-Material Printing of Soft Actuators</title><p id="Par71">The use of multi-material AM (MMAM) can decrease the time required for production and does not add any extra cost when manufacturing complex-shaped parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>].

The stiffness of the actuator might be raised by up to 120 times by including a layer of SMP into the completely printed actuator body while maintaining its flexibility and adaptability. The FRST actuator could finish a softening-stiffening cycle in only 32 s thanks to a printed Joule-heating circuit and fluidic cooling microchannel that allowed quick heating and cooling rates. To show the FRST actuator's high load capacity and form adaptivity, three of them were used to build a robotic gripper that could lift and grab items ranging in weight from less than 10 grammes to as much as 1.5 kilogrammes.

The CM 3D printing technology enables non-contact, high-efficiency multi-material switching without touch, in contrast to conventional multilateral switching techniques that need direct contact to remove the leftover resin. With a printing surface of up to 180 mm × 130 mm, the printer is now able to create heterogeneous 3D structures using a variety of materials, including hydrogels, functional polymers, and even ceramics. The CM 3D printing technique has shown to be a great tool for creating soft actuators. In terms of minimising material waste, while creating soft actuators with different materials, this process provides several benefits over more conventional techniques like casting or moulding. Casting or moulding techniques cannot be used to produce these outcomes without difficulty. Also, He et al.

This method made it possible to produce a variety of 3D flexible electronic devices, such as 4D ionic conductor-activated printing, flexible capacitive sensors with high sensitivity and a broad range of measured pressures, and resistive strain and force sensors.

These gadgets are perfect for use in soft robotic applications because of their special quality. The ability to easily customise these reprocessable thermoset soft actuators allows them to be moulded or printed into a variety of forms and sizes and calibrated to get the required result. As an illustration, a two-step polymerization technique has been created to produce 3D printing reprocessable thermosets (3DPRTs), which can be reshaped into a new shape, repaired by 3D printing fresh material on the damaged region, and recycled for future uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR313">313</xref>]. The novel methods offer an effective response to the environmental issues brought on by the expanding usage of 3D printing materials. However, this cannot be done on all materials due to the permanent covalent networks and they cannot be reshaped, repaired, or recycled.

Shape locking technique enables the actuator to sustain its form without requiring extra energy, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the actuator and lowering its overall energy consumption.</p><p id="Par81">They improve efficiency by reducing energy consumption and optimizing performance. As an example, the process of shape locking allows these actuators to maintain their shape without the need for additional energy, which can improve their efficiency and decrease overall energy consumption. By utilizing shape locking, soft actuators can save energy and hold their shape for a longer period. For example, a soft robotic gripper that uses shape locking to maintain its grasp on an object can hold onto it without consuming energy to keep it closed. This can significantly reduce the energy consumption of the gripper and prolong its lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324">324</xref>]. In terms of sustainability, these soft actuators have numerous advantages, including their ability to adapt to changing environments, their energy efficiency, and their use of smart materials that minimize waste during production. However, the production of these devices still requires the use of certain resources and energy, which can have negative environmental impacts. To ensure that the benefits of these actuators are not outweighed by their environmental costs, it is critical to consider their entire life cycle, including disposal and opportunities for recycling or reuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">325</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Moreover, WR materials that draw inspiration from biological systems have significant potential in several fields, including energy harvesting, soft robotics, medicine, and architecture. They possess a unique ability to volumetrically expand, or contract based on changes in environmental humidity, allowing them to utilize humidity gradients and evaporation phenomena to perform a range of functions. Furthermore, these materials can be leveraged to develop humidity energy, which is critical in addressing global energy challenges and promoting sustainable development and circular economy. These materials depend on the contraction and relaxation of fibres or cellulose arrangements to move across the soil surface and reach an optimal position for germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326">326</xref>]. These actuators offer several advantages over conventional actuators. They use water or humidity as their primary energy source, which is readily available and renewable, making them a sustainable and environmentally friendly option, and require minimal energy to operate as they rely on ambient humidity changes rather than external power sources to move. Additionally, their adaptability to their environment, biocompatibility, and responsiveness to humidity changes make them versatile for various applications. There is still a basic problem, though, in that the actuation ability and material characteristics of WR materials are at odds. This is true despite major research efforts to improve material properties and boost actuation ability. Because the majority of WR materials are intrinsically brittle, they cannot support severe weights yet the actuator reacts swiftly. The flexibility and safety of soft actuators will be impacted by increasing the stiffness of WR materials, which will also speed up reaction times. As a result, a significant challenge in the development of WR materials is striking a compromise between mechanical characteristics and actuation abilities. Also, there are still some challenges to overcome, as external humidity gradients are complex and constantly changing, making it challenging to precisely control actuators, including their direction and distance of movement. Therefore, a new approach to stably control humidity gradients without consuming additional energy is required, as neither of the current control methods is perfect.</p><p id="Par83">Furthermore, MMAM's realisation will be a pivotal moment for soft actuators. By modifying the thermal, electrical, mechanical, optical, and multifunctional aspects of components, MMAM opens up new possibilities for the design, complexity, and usefulness of soft actuators with better qualities. Potentially, MMAM may be utilised in soft actuators to combine the benefits of many materials, enabling the quick creation of high-quality structures with unique features. When compared to 3D printing with a single material, MMAM printing is more ecologically friendly, capable of producing cutting-edge 4D soft structures, and yields actuators that are stronger and more durable. MMAM may minimise waste materials and offer sustainability for soft actuators, which is important for production since it reduces material consumption and wastage. Alternative materials including elastomers and hydrogels have not been extensively researched, whereas research has mostly concentrated on specific polymer and metal-based multi-materials. In other instances, researchers have taken use of the drawbacks of connecting materials to introduce flaws into components because the advantages of using various materials in MMAM may not always provide acceptable results. Due to the diverse materials' variances in qualities like heat conductivity, melting temperatures, and expansion coefficients, regulating the additive manufacturing process can be difficult. Before MMAM processing, non-uniform qualities in intended multi-material components require work in material design, characterisation, chemical composition, and manufacturing restrictions. Other difficulties with MMAM include limited production throughput, poor scalability and surface quality, insufficient interfacial bonding, and significant cross-contamination. The lack of design rules on material compatibility and multi-material 3D printability makes it extremely difficult for AM procedures intended for single-material components to be used for MM components.</p><p id="Par84">Although the techniques and features mentioned earlier are widely utilized to create SSAs, it is essential to acknowledge that there are other approaches to accomplish this as well. Researchers have delved into the use of biodegradable and recyclable materials in making soft actuators, while others have explored new manufacturing methods like 3D printing or microfabrication. Moreover, advances in materials science and engineering have led to the development of novel materials that provide improved sustainability and functionality for soft actuator applications. Thus, it is evident that there are numerous techniques and features to generate SSAs, and researchers should continue to investigate these options to propel the field forward.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par85">The development of lightweight and flexible robots that primarily use renewable, environmentally friendly, and recyclable parts has increased in tandem with the movement towards SSAs. These developments help soft robotics in a variety of ways, including lowering weight, material, and energy requirements, encouraging autonomous operation, enabling in vivo deployment, and removing waste problems. Materials scientists are focused on developing sustainable materials that can perform at a high level while keeping production costs low, which will enable these materials to be used in state-of-the-art prototypes. Research goals include creating highly stretchable yet biodegradable actuators that are produced using eco-friendly fabrication methods like MMAM. However, fully integrating these components into autonomous robots presents significant challenges and requires the rethinking of energy consumption and their design. Reduced complexity, self-healing, or biodegradable component designs are advantageous for ideas like repair, disassembly, reuse, and refabrication. Future inventions must include sustainability, which will enable a wide range of potential uses in many ecological niches. In the end, low-energy manufacture of technological items and easier recycling processes will be made possible by renewable, affordable, and conveniently accessible resources. Robotics will play a significant part in this endeavour, but more research is required to close the gap to high-performance solutions or offer whole new routes for sustainable technological development.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author
