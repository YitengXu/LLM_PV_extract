Here we report the design and fabrication of a conductive adhesive-barrier (CAB) that translates &gt;99% of photoelectric power to chemical reactions. The CAB enables halide perovskite-based photoelectrochemical cells with two different architectures that exhibit record STH efficiencies. The first, a co-planar photocathode-photoanode architecture, achieved an STH efficiency of 13.4% and 16.3 h to t<sub>60</sub>, solely limited by the hygroscopic hole transport layer in the n-i-p device. The second was formed using a monolithic stacked silicon-perovskite tandem, with a peak STH efficiency of 20.8% and 102 h of continuous operation before t<sub>60</sub> under AM 1.5G illumination. These advances will lead to efficient, durable, and low-cost solar-driven water-splitting technology with multifunctional barriers.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">High-efficiency photoelectrodes, which integrate light absorption with catalysis, have been limited to costly materials.

Splitting water at 25 °C requires a thermodynamic minimum of 1.23 V, but the kinetics of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions limit the efficiency by raising the minimum practical potential difference to 1.6 V for state-of-the-art catalysts. This large voltage requirement restricts the choice of suitable semiconductor and photovoltaic device material and design options. Several strategies for sunlight-driven, electrochemically mediated green hydrogen generation have emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Comparison of these demonstrations has relied primarily on two key figures of merit: stability (lifetime at a fraction of initial efficiency) and solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, which is defined as:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">STH</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.23</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">FE</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices with buried junctions, wherein the photo-absorber is protected by a barrier material modified to have a catalytically active surface, offer a high device lifetime while minimizing cost. Furthermore, coupling photo-absorbers directly to catalysts and improving solar energy utilization through thermal integration can efficiently facilitate electrochemical reactions and simultaneously cool the photovoltaics to mitigate thermal degradation and enhance their long-term durability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Through judicious choice of materials and design as in this work, each component in an integrated PEC (photo-absorber, barrier, and catalysts) can even retain a substantial degree of modularity, allowing independent production and assembly at point-of-use. These advantages enable reductions in balance-of-systems costs compared with decoupled photovoltaic-electrolyzer systems. State-of-the-art PEC devices have used III-V semiconductor-based multijunction photovoltaic devices protected by thin coatings of titania and decorated with hydrogen or oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, to achieve STH efficiencies exceeding 19% with 2 h of unassisted operation for a device with up to 0.3 cm<sup>2</sup> active area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Greater stability has been demonstrated, up to 100 h, but at a lower STH efficiency of 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Despite their promising STH efficiency, conventional III-V-based PEC platforms are potentially limited by the use of cost prohibitive semiconductors produced using molecular beam epitaxy and also due to their high propensity to undergo photo-corrosion in acidic electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. PECs based on other semiconductors such as metal oxides (e.g., BiVO<sub>4</sub>, hematite, and copper oxide) offer scalable and low-cost solutions but exhibit STH efficiencies well below 10% and overall low stabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, halide perovskites (HaP) have emerged as low-cost solution-processed semiconductors, with several desirable properties such as large absorption coefficients, tunable bandgaps, long diffusion lengths, and charge-carrier lifetimes which have enabled power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 25% for single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The record efficiencies in single-junction HaP photovoltaic devices have been enabled by the greater than 1.0 V open-circuit voltage generated by an archetypical HaP with a bandgap of 1.5 eV. Importantly, PSCs can be combined in series with another HaP or silicon to produce an operating voltage exceeding 1.7 V, which can surmount the potential required for unassisted water splitting at high current densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, to realize an integrated halide perovskite photoelectrochemical device (HaP-PEC), in which at least one interface is in direct contact with the electrolyte, requires preventing the spontaneous dissolution of halide perovskites in an aqueous environment due to their ionic character<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Previous attempts using HaP-PECs have pursued two main approaches. One is to tailor the surface of the HaP and the transport layers through the deposition of ultrathin surface barriers/catalysts such as Ni or titania, or by introducing hydrophobic functional groups and dopants to the transport layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The other common approach is to deposit or mechanically attach physical barriers (low melting point metal alloys, conducting inks, and/or mechanically attached conductive sheets such as metal foil or graphite) directly on the photovoltaic device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. While these strategies can in some cases preserve the short-circuit current density, all reported approaches have resulted in a loss in fill factor and the operating voltage at the maximum power point has limited their capacity for unassisted operation. As a result, the state-of-the-art STH efficiency for integrated co-planar HaP-PEC systems reported sits at about 10.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which is only about 40% of the state of the art in perovskite solar cell PCE. A mandatory advancement for building an efficient and stable integrated HaP-PEC is a lossless anticorrosion barrier, which protects the photo-absorber and transport layers from the corrosive electrolytes without compromising the electronic transport of photogenerated electrons or holes from the HaP to the catalyst deposited on the barrier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Here, we report the design and fabrication of an anticorrosion barrier referred to as a conductive adhesive-barrier or CAB, which enables a seamless, modular integration and conversion of any photovoltaic device to a PEC. The CAB is a bilayer that separates the desired functionalities into a barrier composed of a conductive, inert, and impermeable material such as graphite or titanium (here we used graphite) attached to the photovoltaic component using a conductive adhesive formulated with a polymer matrix and conductive fillers (carbons or metals). We first demonstrated greater than 99% translation of halide perovskite photovoltaic power to the chemical reaction in a standard three-electrode cell with individual PEC devices fabricated by depositing a catalyst-coated CAB on HaP photovoltaics (photocathode: p-i-n PSC|CAB|Pt catalyst, photoanode: n-i-p PSC|CAB|IrO<sub>x</sub> catalyst). These measurements also revealed that our CAB is ambipolar, stably facilitating both reduction and oxidation reactions. We then performed unassisted water-splitting measurements on HaP-based photovoltaics using two different device designs. The first consisted of a CAB-protected photocathode and photoanode connected electrically in series, with optical illumination in parallel geometry, enabling unassisted operation with an STH efficiency of 13.4% with up to 16.3 h of operation to t<sub>60</sub> and a total absorber geometric area of 0.24 cm<sup>2</sup>. We show that the stability of the integrated PEC in the serial case is limited by the n-i-p building block and not by the newly designed CAB. These results demonstrate a record efficiency for this serial PEC design based on HaP, but the practical efficiency of this co-planar architecture is limited to 15.5% due to the current density of the single-junction photovoltaic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, HaP/Si tandems offer a promising low-cost photovoltaic system that has demonstrated a photovoltaic efficiency in the vicinity of 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, to overcome the limitations of the serial co-planar system, we performed unassisted water-splitting measurements using a monolithic HaP/Si tandem photoanode by using an IrO<sub>x</sub>-coated CAB and Pt foil as the cathode. This system achieved an STH efficiency of 20.8% on a 0.44 cm<sup>2</sup> area with 102 h of operation (t<sub>60</sub>), which to the best of our knowledge represents the state-of-the-art for integrated water-splitting PEC devices. More generally, we anticipate that the CAB and its combination with HaPs or any other earth-abundant photo-absorbers will serve as a widely applicable platform for driving other useful reactions and pave a path for developing low-cost technology for solar-to-fuel conversion.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Highly efficient halide perovskite photovoltaic devices</title><p id="Par6">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows perovskite solar cell performance for both p-i-n and n-i-p (also known as inverted and regular, respectively) architectures as building blocks for the photocathode and photoanode, respectively.

Perovskite solar cells typically possess a sandwich-like structure in which the active perovskite photo-absorber film is fabricated between charge-carrier-selective layers (hole transport layer and electron transport layer) for charge separation, with their respective metallic contacts for charge extraction.

The photovoltaic measurements revealed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.1% with short-circuit current of 22.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, an open-circuit voltage of 1.10 V, and a fill factor of 0.76 from our champion p-i-n cells.

This barrier must exhibit three key criteria: (1) low electrical resistance, (2) physical and chemical resistance to the ingress of corrosive electrolytes, and (3) compatibility with HaP surface termination (must not degrade any device layers already deposited). To initially evaluate the protective barriers against these design criteria, we screened multiple barrier materials using a simple qualitative color change stability test consisting of optical imaging of perovskite|barrier assemblies with small (~50 µL) drops of 0.5 M sulfuric acid deposited on top (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) and measured the two-terminal electrical resistance by performing J-V scans (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Our screening measurements implied that no single material adequately satisfied all the design requirements when deposited on perovskite solar cells. As a result, we developed a strategy to separate the desired functionalities into distinct materials whose combination satisfies all the design criteria. First, from our screening tests, we identified several viable barriers (Ti foil, Ni foil, Cu foil, graphite sheets of various origins and thicknesses), which prevent the ingress of the electrolytes and protect the underlying perovskite layer. Next, we developed an in-house composite polymer-conductive filler pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) that can adhere the barrier to the surface of the PSC without introducing solvent between the components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The high conductivity of the PSA was achieved by blending the adhesive polymer with conductive particles (here, silver, copper, and amorphous carbon) to create conductive channels through the PSA to the barrier (see “Methods” for detailed synthesis and deposition steps). The tack, or stickiness, of the composite was tailored to achieve good physical adhesion without compromising on conductivity. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> illustrates the conductive adhesive-barrier (CAB) comprised of an amorphous C-blended PSA and a graphite barrier attached to the HaP electrode to convert it into a photocathode with the different components shown schematically in a magnified view. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the corresponding SEM image of the CAB cross section. We measured the J-V performance of solar cells before and after attaching the CAB compared with systems using other conducting adhesive layers with graphite barrier added as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. Our control solar cell showed a PCE of 17.7% and the addition of optimized CAB caused negligible changes to the PCE and other relevant figures of merit (V<sub>OC</sub>: 1.06/1.07, J<sub>SC</sub>: 22.0/22.7, FF: 0.76/0.73, for control and CAB, respectively). These changes may be ascribed to inter-sample variability rather than to a side interaction between HaP and CAB. In contrast, the commercial C paste-graphite dropped the PCE to about 5% with significant hysteresis and the Ag-paint degraded the HaP solar cell. We conducted continuous illumination MPP tracking for our barrier candidates and observe that our CAB retains 95% of the initial performance whereas the glass-epoxy encapsulated device (control) retained 98% and the C paste-graphite devices lost almost 40% of the initial performance in 10 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>CAB (conductive adhesive-barrier) design for near-perfect preservation of photovoltaic efficiency.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic design of a p-i-n perovskite solar cell transformed into a photocathode, with the circled region highlighted to depict the CAB|catalyst layers.

Here, the entire barrier and the catalyst deposition can be performed separately, in parallel, and adhered to the photovoltaic device using a dry transfer process at ambient temperature, pressure, and environment, thus mitigating the risk of degrading the perovskites due to leaving phases in commercial conductive inks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Because the design and deposition of the CAB directly address all three of the critical design criteria, there is substantial freedom in the selection of specific materials for the subcomponents. We demonstrated negligible changes to device J-V curves in the solid state for CAB-capped devices using alternative conductive fillers and barriers in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>. Intuitively, the lack of material-specific dependence is unsurprising since the only design criteria probed in the solid state are compatibility with the perovskite surface termination, which is unchanged since we use the same method for deposition, and low electrical resistance. We anticipate that this flexibility in materials, which is a key feature of our approach, will enable photoelectrodes for other sensitive photo-absorbers beyond perovskites and for other electrochemical reactions and electrolyte compositions.</p><p id="Par9">The capability of our CAB to create a robust physicochemical barrier with negligible loss in the photovoltaic performance enabled us to transform our high-efficiency photovoltaics into high-efficiency integrated PEC cells. Although the photovoltaic-CAB system is intrinsically capable of operation as a PEC in water, the catalytic activity of the graphite barrier alone for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was minimal (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). To achieve high catalytic activity for HER, we deposited a standard commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) nanoparticle catalyst at 0.5 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> loading with Nafion binder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The J-V curve of the Pt catalyst in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> in black with a characteristically low overpotential at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> of 70 mV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. When deposited on the p-i-n HaP-PEC (with a CAB) and illuminated with AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, the onset potential shifted in the positive direction (anodically) by 1.1 V, matching the open-circuit voltage of the solar cell. The device achieved a photocathode efficiency, which we define as power contributed by the photo-absorber to the half-reaction beyond its standard potential, of 18.6% with a photocurrent of 21 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.87 V vs. RHE (see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> for a discussion of photoelectrode efficiency as a figure of merit, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> for photoelectrode power curves). We note that photoelectrode efficiencies do not translate directly to solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies, but they can be used diagnostically to identify losses associated with the degree of conversion of solar power into chemical, especially when compared with photovoltaic J-V curves. For OER, we loaded the CAB at 1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> with a synthesized nanoparticulate IrO<sub>x</sub> catalyst ink suspension with a Nafion binder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The J-V curve of the catalyst in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> in black shows an overpotential of 370 mV at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. When deposited on the photoanode similarly to the photocathode case and illuminated with 1-Sun simulated sunlight, the onset potential shifted negatively (cathodically) proportional to the open-circuit voltage of the solar cell. We calculated a photoanode efficiency of 11.3% with a maximum power photocurrent of 19.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.66 V vs. RHE (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). As expected, the sluggish kinetics of OER resulted in a higher catalyst overpotential that consumed about 40% of the photovoltage at maximum power resulting in the lower photoanode efficiency. Because of the differences in reaction kinetics, the n-i-p solar cell’s larger PCE (20.9% vs. 19.1% in p-i-n) resulted in a lower photoanode efficiency (11.3% vs. 18.6% in photocathode). Nevertheless, these measurements clearly demonstrate that the CAB|Pt-electrolyte interface can almost perfectly translate the photovoltaic efficiency to drive the HER reaction due to low electronic resistivity and catalyst overpotential. We also show that this is not intrinsic to the specific materials used but to the CAB-catalyst design criteria in general by demonstrating a photocathode using a Ti barrier-based CAB and Pt/C catalyst for HER, which had 19.0% PCE in the solid state and a photocathode efficiency of 18.1% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). These metrics represent a substantial quantitative leap in performance compared to prior photoelectrode-type devices using single-junction perovskites, with the highest half-cell efficiencies and the highest ratios between photoelectrode efficiency and parent solar cell PCE for both photocathode and photoanode (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Co-planar series-connected tandem photocathode-photoanode</title><p id="Par10">After demonstrating that the CAB can effectively translate the efficiency of a HaP photovoltaic to a PEC, we connected the photocathode and photoanode in series to drive an unassisted water-splitting reaction using the design illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. We designed a simple 3D-printed polypropylene semi-batch reactor with two openings in the sidewalls to expose the devices to the electrolyte, and gas inlet and outlet lines to pump inert gas and avoid pressurization in the reactor. We attached the CAB|catalyst layers to the p-i-n and n-i-p solar cell electrodes, encapsulated the surface surrounding the CAB with epoxy, and adhered the devices to the reactor sidewalls. After illuminating the integrated HaP-PEC with a 1-Sun AM 1.5G source, we measured the unassisted water-splitting current over time. The resulting water-splitting reaction is recorded with the visible onset of bubble formation with light illumination (Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). The intersection of the half-cell PEC J-V curves plotted with absolute current density gives the anticipated unassisted water-splitting current density for a 2-electrode system, which we measured to be about 22.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. The initial photocurrent density in the 2-electrode measurement was in good agreement with this theoretical value at about 21.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The Faradaic efficiency of the catalysts was measured to be unity (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>), as expected for Pt-based HER and Ir-based OER in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Accounting for the 2x area contributions because of the two separate photo-absorbers (total area 0.24 cm<sup>2</sup>), the measured current density translated to a peak STH of 13.4%, calculated using Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>. Our system with an STH of 13.4% and a continuous operation of 5 h is among the most efficient and stable for integrated PEC systems using halide perovskites and one of the first to achieve &gt;10% STH, which is regarded as a technoeconomically relevant efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The device maintained an average current density of 20.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for 5 h with a gradual loss in current density (about 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>/h) before rapid failure. To understand the sudden degradation after 5 h, we independently measured the performance of the HER and OER catalysts in a standard electrolyzer geometry and confirmed that both catalyst materials were stable under constant-current control at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for at least 24 h, with only a slight increase from 1.68 to 1.77 V cell voltage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). To further understand the origin of the degradation for the integrated PEC system, we investigated representative post-reaction solar cell J-V curves from devices used in unassisted water-splitting, which reveal significantly degraded n-i-p devices and largely intact p-i-n devices (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Finally, we measured the time-dependent photocurrent of a representative photocathode at 0 V vs. RHE for 60 h and found minimal degradation, although we note that this only highlights the protective ability of the barrier and does not demonstrate stable power delivery or correlate to unassisted water-splitting stability (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). These findings highlight the robust ability of the CAB against corrosion for long time periods and indicate that the origin of the degradation is predominantly from the loss in efficiency of the n-i-p solar cells. We performed 5 experiments on similar PECs and found consistent peak STH (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) but some differences in stability (t<sub>60</sub> from peak photocurrent) from 2 to 16.3 h (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). We note that, unlike for the PSC stability measurements conducted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, the deposition of CABs and encapsulation with epoxy occurred in atmospheric air, which may significantly accelerate the degradation rate of the Spiro-OMeTAD based hole transport layer in the n-i-p building block.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Series photocathode-photoanode unassisted water-splitting performance.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of the unassisted PEC water-splitting system using halide perovskite PECs. <bold>b</bold> Co-plotted photocathode and photoanode polarization curves from most efficient devices showing a maximum theoretical operating current density of 22.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. <bold>c</bold> 2-electrode unassisted water-splitting stability test showing degradation after 5 h. <bold>d</bold> Electrocatalyst-only electrolyzer stability at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. <bold>e</bold> Distribution of STH efficiency across five devices, with an average STH of 12.4 ± 0.7%.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_39290_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Monolithic silicon-perovskite tandem photoanode</title><p id="Par11">Single-junction devices like those used for the co-planar system have a fundamental efficiency limit  due to the parallel orientation of the junctions.

Most devices above 10% STH (dashed line in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) are based on multijunction III-V semiconductors. Our integrated series photocathode-photoanode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) is the most efficient single junction HaP-based system to date and with a high lifetime. Our HaP/Si PEC is to the best of our knowledge the first non-concentrator PEC to exceed 20% STH, regardless of material or number of junctions, and with a relatively high t<sub>60</sub> and an active area of 0.44 cm<sup>2</sup>. These results represent a critical step forward for building integrated high efficiency PEC systems using low-cost photo-absorbers with high efficiency. The CAB platform is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide variety of photo-absorbers and combined with a broad suite of catalysts to photoelectrochemically power arbitrary redox reactions. Furthermore, its method of synthesis and deposition is promising for scaled device fabrication. This technology provides a path to a rich research domain with critical opportunities for solar fuel devices with solar concentration, modularization, and device scaleup. Future studies should focus on the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite-based photoelectrodes, the incorporation of lower-cost catalysts through improved precious metal utilization or incorporation of non-PM catalysts, and reactor designs for improved overall performance and economics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">All chemicals were used as received, as stated in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, unless otherwise stated.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Materials and purity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Chemical</p></th><th><p>Purity</p></th><th><p>Cat No.</p></th><th><p>Supplier</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>DMF</p></td><td><p>99.8%</p></td><td><p>227056</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DMSO</p></td><td><p>99.9%</p></td><td><p>276855</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Diethyl ether</p></td><td><p>&gt;98%</p></td><td><p>676845</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chlorobenzene</p></td><td><p>99.8%</p></td><td><p>AC396970010</p></td><td><p>Acros</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Acetone</p></td><td><p>99.9%</p></td><td><p>A949-4</p></td><td><p>Fisher Chemical</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ethanol</p></td><td><p>&gt;99.2%</p></td><td><p>2701</p></td><td><p>Decon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FTO</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>FTO-P001</p></td><td><p>Kaivo Optoelectronics</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ITO</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>ITO- P001</p></td><td><p>Kaivo Optoelectronics</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PTAA</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>702471</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PbI<sub>2</sub></p></td><td><p>99.99%</p></td><td><p>L0279</p></td><td><p>TCI Chemicals</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PbBr<sub>2</sub></p></td><td><p>99.999%</p></td><td><p>398853</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CsI</p></td><td><p>99.999%</p></td><td><p>203033</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MAI</p></td><td><p>99.99%</p></td><td><p>MS101000</p></td><td><p>Greatcell Solar</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FAI</p></td><td><p>99.99%</p></td><td><p>MS150000</p></td><td><p>Greatcell Solar</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spiro-OMeTAD</p></td><td><p>&gt;99%</p></td><td><p>HT0728</p></td><td><p>One material</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>C<sub>60</sub></p></td><td><p>99.5%</p></td><td><p>379646</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>BCP</p></td><td><p>96%</p></td><td><p>140910</p></td><td><p>Sigma-Aldrich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ag (pellets)</p></td><td><p>99.99%</p></td><td><p>EVMAG40EXEB</p></td><td><p>Kurt J.

Broadly, the catalyst particles were prepared through the chemical reduction of a surfactant/iridium salt mixture in an O<sub>2</sub>-free environment. In this work, particle synthesis was achieved by retrofitting a Friedrichs condenser (ChemGlass 330 mm, 24/40 Joint) as a jacketed reactor. The condenser’s liquid jacket was cooled with a recirculating water bath to maintain a temperature of 15 °C throughout the synthesis. Nitrogen gas (Airgas, 99.9%) was introduced through the upper hose connection which sparged through the inner drip tube to both provide agitation and prevent the introduction of atmospheric oxygen into the system. The lower hose connection led to a beaded pipe-to-hose glass adapter attached to the bottom of a Claisen adapter. The upper port of the adapter serves as an exhaust port to prevent pressure build-up within the condenser while the lower port houses a 125-mL separatory funnel which was used to charge the condenser with the reactant solutions.</p><p id="Par26">In a typical synthesis, the salt and surfactant solutions were first prepared in separate vials: 88.2 mg of iridium chloride hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich IrCl<sub>3</sub> · <italic>x</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O, 99.9% trace metal basis) was dissolved in 50 mL absolute ethanol (Decon) while 1.31 g of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich CTAB, BioXtra ≥99%) was dissolved in 40 mL of absolute ethanol.

We chose to design a tank reactor for simple 3-electrode PEC measurements which we have modified for 2-electrode and bias-free measurements and gas collection. In the 3-electrode case, we used a cube shape with rounded internal edges to facilitate flow and minimize contamination between experiments. The reactor had a square base with a side length 3.8 cm, 4.0 cm height, and 0.2 cm wall thickness. Two holes were also added along the center top side of the reactor with a diameter of 0.8 and 1.0 cm to insert working and reference electrodes into the electrolyte. Two protruding cylinders with an internal diameter of 0.125 inches were included on the top corners for the inert carrier gas inlet and product gas outlet. To minimize losses from incident sunlight, we decoupled the interfaces for light absorption and electrocatalysis. The reactor was designed with a hole centered on a side wall (1.0 cm diameter), using the wall as an adhesion surface to create a seal to which the PEC was adhered.</p><p id="Par35">Printing an enclosed reactor is difficult due to the top “ceiling.” A dual extruder capable of switching between polypropylene and a dissolvable support material was necessary to build a foundation for the top layers of the reactor. In this case, PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) was the ideal support material due to its low cost and solubility in water. Unfortunately, the smooth surface of polypropylene (PP) makes adhesion of the first layer of PVA difficult. If not layered correctly, PVA easily compacts on the extruder nozzle which can cause expensive damage and a ruined print. An alternative is a detachable lid which can be printed separately and additionally allows facile cleaning of the reactor. Threaded twist caps with a fitted O-ring offer a compromise between print complexity and tight sealing, and represent the best opportunity for an easily reusable design, while the enclosed print remains the best option for potential product gas removal.</p><p id="Par36">The PEC reactor body required a chemically inert material to prevent degradation due to the presence of extreme pH and high ionic strength media with extended use. 3D printing with PP filament offered a cheap, inert body that created a watertight seal when layered. To adhere PP coming out of the extrusion nozzle at 428 °F to the 3D printer bed, we increased the bed temperature to 212 °F (from 150 °F) which stopped the rapid cooling and resolved layer misalignment. A brim added extra material to the first layer to broaden the base of the print and reduce permeability. Both changes contributed to reducing the impact of contractive forces after cooling and provided the following layers with a solid base.</p><p id="Par37">For the printing process, we used an Ultimaker 3 with dual extruders of nozzle size 0.4 mm that produced a 0.48 mm line width when laid on the print bed. With these specifications, the layer height was 0.2 mm after material adhesion with a recommended flow rate of 50 mm/s and extruded at 428 °F. Recommended heuristics indicated that the extrusion flow rate should stay between 90 and 110% to reduce the chance of layer misalignment. The Ultimaker 3 comes programmed with pre-determined settings for printer bed temperature, extruder temperature, and infill density for all compatible filaments, and unless otherwise specified default settings were used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by DE-EE0008843 from the HydroGEN Advanced Water Splitting Materials Consortium, established as part of the Energy Materials Network under the U.S. Department of Energy (awarded to A.D.M. and M.W.) and supported by SARIN Energy Inc.
