Polyimide-based aerogel film with varying open-cell content level is developed to be used as the main contact material for the TENG. The fabricated aerogel film is fully characterized to reveal the chemical and mechanical properties of the developed material. It is shown the use of Polyimide aerogel film remarkably enhances the performance of the TENG compared to a TENG with fully dense Polyimide layer with no porosity. This enhancement is due to the increase on the effective surface area, charge generation inside the open-cells of the aerogel, and increase on the relative capacitance of the TENG device. The effect of varying porosity from zero to 70% of open-cell content reveals that the aerogel film with 50% shows the highest performance where the peak open-circuit voltage of 40<italic>V</italic> and peak short-circuit current of 5 <italic>μA</italic> are obtained. These values are higher than those of the TENG with simple Polyimide layer with an order of magnitude. Finally, the performance of proposed TENG under resistive loads and capacitors are tested. Thus, this work presents an effective method for high performance TENG.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2018_Article_38121.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the negative impact and limitation of fossil fuel-based energy sources and batteries, it has always been desired to propose environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources for macro and micro scale applications. Therefore, design and development of energy harvesting systems for scavenging energy from available clean energy sources is a very attractive research topic for the researchers. Within all clean energy sources, the mechanical energy is the most available and widely distributed energy around the world including human activities, automotive vehicles, industrial machines, structural vibrations, water wave, and wind motions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, various researches have been dedicated to propose efficient energy harvesting technologies or to enhance the performance of current systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These researches are mostly based on the conventional electromagnetic or piezoelectric energy conversion technologies and have been used for different sources to some extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Recently, Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) has been introduced as a novel and efficient method for converting mechanical energy into electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. TENG is based on the combination of contact electrification and electrostatic induction and has shown a great potential for various energy harvesting and sensing systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The high efficiency of TENG has resulted in the use of this technology in a variety of applications such as energy harvesting from human activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, ocean waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, wind motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and vibration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Also, the accuracy and precision of TENG-based sensors have led to the development of various sensory systems for measuring pressure and force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, trajectory and speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, chemical parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and so on<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, TENG has shown a promising potential for being combined with other energy harvesting and sensing technologies such as electromagnetic and piezoelectric techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, different platforms have been proposed recently namely hybridized triboelectric-electromagnetic or triboelectric-piezoelectric energy conversion systems for a number of applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Due to the importance and capabilities of TENG for various devices, proposing novel methods to improve the performance of TENG-based systems has always been indispensable and different directions have been considered to fulfil this target. TENG is essentially based on the contact- separation or relative sliding between two distinct materials. Therefore, advanced structural design has been utilized to propose further optimized devices which can effectively transfer the mechanical kinetic energy into the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, interdigitated structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, zigzag shape devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, rolling element configurations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, spring-assisted mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and other advanced structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, have been proposed for better energy transfer and conversion in TENG systems.</p><p id="Par5">In addition, TENG technology is based on an interfacial phenomenon i.e. triboelectrification and therefore, the surface properties of interacted materials play a very vital role in the out performance of TENGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Accordingly, different methods have been developed to improve the surface properties of contact materials, those are mainly based on physical surface modification or chemical surface modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. For instance, furnishing the contact surfaces of materials with micro/nano structures can physically boost the TENG performance owing to increase on effective contact area during the interaction of materials under mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Also, adding functional groups with excellent electron donation/attraction properties into the surface of materials can chemically enhance the TENG outputs due to extensive charge generation on the surfaces after being in contact with other materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Moreover, development of advanced and smart materials, which show high performance while being used in the TENG devices, is a very useful method for enhancing the output performance of the TENG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Such advanced materials can positively influence different parameters in a TENG device such as relative capacitance, dielectric constants, and surface morphologies of the TENG layers due to their exclusive properties and compositions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. As examples, shape memory polymers have been employed recently to effectively harvest the mechanical energy based on the TENG operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Fiber-based materials were introduced into the TENG as the main contact material to upgrade the outputs of the TENG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Foam-shaped materials with nano/micro-porous spongy configurations were also presented as effective materials which can be used as the contact layers of the TENG device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Such spongy structures were mostly fabricated by mixing PDMS with micro/nano particles such as NaCl microparticles and ZnO nanoparticles to be embedded first and then removed from the PDMS structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. For example, using ZnO nanoparticles for fabricating spongy PDMS resulted in the electrical output 3.7-fold of the TENG output with a flat PDMS film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Applying polystyrene micro/nano spheres for porous PDMS fabrication led to the electrical output 5 times as much as that of the solid PDMS film TENG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. A spongy PTFE film in a single-electrode TENG achieved the output voltage 1.8 times more than that of the TENG with simple PTFE film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Also, embedding nanoparticles of silver (Ag), SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and gold (Au) into spongy PDMS enhanced the electrical outputs of the TENG for 4, 5, and 5 times, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, a TENG using PDMS composite film with graphite particles reached the output 2.6-fold of the pure PDMS film TENG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, an advanced material based on Polyimide aerogel is developed to be utilized as the main contact material for the TENG. The Polyimide film contains nano-scale pores distributed through the material structure known as open-cell content without the need of using any external micro/nano particles. A relatively high and controlled open-cell content is obtained inside the material which provides exclusive properties to significantly enhance the output performance of the TENG. Initially, the fabrication process of the aerogel film is fully elaborated. Then, the chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the film are characterized. Afterward, the developed aerogel film with different open-cell content is used in the TENG and the effects of varying open-cell content on the electrical outputs are fully investigated. After determination of the optimum the open-cell content, the effects of various mechanical and electrical parameters such as frequency of operation and external resistive loads on the performance of the TENG are investigated. Finally, the ability of the aerogel-based TENG for charging capacitors are shown. Hence, the developed approach remarkably boosts the performance of the TENG which can be used for various energy harvesting and sensing applications. In fact, the proposed aerogel-based TENG demonstrates a novel material for designing high performance triboelectric nanogenerators to be employed in vibration energy harvesting, energy harvesting from human activities, and so on.</p><p id="Par8">The schematic preparation process of the aerogel film is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and the detailed fabrication process has been discussed in the methods section accordingly. In addition, the schematic components and the fabricated contact-mode TENG device are depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a,b)</xref>, respectively. The metal-to-dielectric contact-mode TENG were considered for the device. The Polyimide-based aerogel film has a negative electron affinity according to the triboelectric properties of materials. Due to high conductivity and appropriate positive electrode affinity, Copper film was used as the TENG electrode as well as the contact material with the aerogel film. The 500 <italic>μm</italic>-thick aerogel film was cut into 20 <italic>mm</italic> × 20 <italic>mm</italic> and a copper film with the same area was placed on the back surface of it to act as the bottom electrode. Another copper film with the same area were used to act as the contact layer and the top electrode simultaneously. Also, two Acrylic sheets were cut into 50 <italic>mm</italic> × 50 <italic>mm</italic> to be used as the top and bottom supports for the tribo-layers and electrodes. Finally, four identical compressive springs were placed at each corner of the device to provide the contact and separation under the external mechanical loads and assist the oscillatory excitation applied by a shaker for further studies shown in next sections.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic preparation process of the Polyimide aerogel film.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_38121_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic configuration of the TENG device, (<bold>b</bold>) fabricated device, (<bold>c</bold>) working mechanism of the metal to aerogel dielectric contact-mode TENG.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_38121_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">The operation of the metal-to-dielectric contact-mode TENG for one cycle is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref> where the detailed working mechanism can be found in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Also, the influence of nano-pores on enhancing the induced charges on the outer contact surface and porous surface of the film is schematically shown in this figure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Based on the contact electrification, when the top and bottom layers are brought into contact, electrons are transferred from copper surface to aerogel surface and create triboelectric charges on the two surfaces owing to the difference between electron affinities of the two materials. As the two surfaces are separated, a potential difference occurs between the two layers which drives the electrons between the electrodes due to electrostatic induction until reaching the balanced condition. When the two layers approach each other, the electrons flow in the opposite direction until the full contact is achieved. Therefore, the repetitive contact and separation of the effective layers will result in an alternating current flow though the external circuit between the two electrodes as the generated electricity.</p><p id="Par10">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref> represents a sample of the fabricated aerogel film based on the procedure discussed in the previous sections. The measured open-cell content by helium pycnometer has shown the value of nearly 87% for the sample which proves the high level of porosity in the layer and therefore very light weight of the film. Also, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref> to (d) depicts the SEM images of the aerogel morphology for different resolutions in which the darker zones in the images are relevant to the air cells. As it is clear from the images, the nano pores are fully distributed through the layer and an interconnected structure is evidently observed in the images. The higher resolution shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d)</xref> can further elaborated the configuration of the aerogel structure and the distribution of nano pores inside the material It should be noted that such pores not only appear inside the structure, but also exist on the surface of the layer which can favorably increase the surface area of the contact layer while being used in the TENG device.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fabricated aerogel film sample.

However, some picks are found around 1535 (cm<sup>−1</sup>) (amide C−N) and 1660 (cm<sup>−1</sup>) (amic acid C=O) bonds which can be attributed to the incomplete imidization of the samples.

It is evident that the onset temperature where the thermal decomposition of the sample occurs is around 606 °C which is relatively high for the sample. There is a small weight loss of nearly 7% within the range of 127 °C to 210 °C which can be attributed to either the presence of NMP or incomplete in the sample. Therefore, the thermal stability of the fabricated aerogel for a wide temperature range can be approved through this analysis.</p><p id="Par13">Due to the application of proposed aerogel film for contact-mode TENG system, it is important to realize that the fabricated material is relatively strong under compression loads. Accordingly, a standard mechanical compression test was carried out on a sample of fabricated aerogel material.

To study the effect of porosity on the output performance, the aerogel film samples were compressed at different rates to partially remove the pores and obtain samples with different open-cell contents. The samples were then evaluated by the pycnometer and accordingly, four samples with the open-cell contents of nearly 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% were obtained. The introduced polyimide aerogel films are mainly involved in mechanical compression according to the targeted TENG design and configuration. Therefore, mechanical compression test was performed on the introduced aerogel samples and the modulus of elasticity of each sample was obtained based on the initial slope of the stress-strain curves, as seen in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Furthermore, the surface area of the aerogel films with different open-cell contents was measured by nitrogen sorption and analyzed based on Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and the results are also presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Accordingly, reducing open cell content results in increasing density and modulus. However, reducing open cell content leads to decreasing the surface area where surface area ranging from 380.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 244.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g is observed. Furthermore, the pore size distribution of different samples has been represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> where the pore size distribution is mainly centred at about 20 nm pore diameter for the samples. It should be noted that the electrode side of compressed layers were carefully sanded and measured to achieve same thickness for all dielectric layers. For comparison, a sample was fully compressed so that the open-cell content was found less than 1% to be considered as the material with no porosity or dense material. All prepared samples were then placed into independent TENG devices and experimented separately to be compared with each other in terms of their electrical outputs.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Properties of aerogel samples with different open-cell contents.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Open-cell content (%)</p></th><th><p>Density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</p></th><th><p>Young’s Modulus (MPa)</p></th><th><p>Surface area (m<sup>2</sup>/g)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>40</p></td><td><p>0.424</p></td><td><p>28.39</p></td><td><p>244.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>0.409</p></td><td><p>27.4</p></td><td><p>308.7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>60</p></td><td><p>0.366</p></td><td><p>24.5</p></td><td><p>362.3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>70</p></td><td><p>0.323</p></td><td><p>21.65</p></td><td><p>380.5</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Pore size distribution for aerogel samples with different open-cell contents.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_38121_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a–c)</xref> show the open-circuit voltage signals for the dense, 40%, and 50% open-cell content films, respectively. The peak voltages of 3.7<italic>V</italic>, 24.6<italic>V</italic>, and 33.8<italic>V</italic> are obtained for the dense, 40%, and 50% cases, respectively.

It should be noted that in all experiments, the frequency and acceleration of excitation were typically selected as 5 Hz and 0.5 g, respectively. It is clear that using the aerogel film can significantly enhance the TENG performance, and this improvement it directly related to the percentage of porosities. In fact, the peak output voltage and peak output current have increase with almost an order of magnitude when the open-cell content of the aerogel is 50%. Therefore, using the proposed aerogel film can remarkably boost the electrical outputs of a TENG compared to the simple material with no porosities. Such increase on the outputs by using the proposed aerogel can be attributed to different reasons. First, the existence of pores on the surface of the contact layer can increase the contact area which leads to further charge generation on the bottom surface as a result of triboelectricity. Also, the compression of inner pores of the aerogel film while being under the contact by the top layer can result in charge generation on the surfaces of inner open-cells which enhances the electrical potential difference between the aerogel film electrode and the top copper layer owing to the electrostatic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, the existence of air cells reduces the effective thickness of the bottom dielectric which will improve the relative capacitance of the whole TENG under operation, and therefore the output of the device will be improved significantly in comparison with a simple dense layer with a compact structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Output Voltage signals for (<bold>a</bold>) dense, (<bold>b</bold>) 40%, and (<bold>c</bold>) 50% open-cell contents.

The results of the experiments on all sample are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> where Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref> shows the variation of peak-peak open-circuit voltage signal with respect to the open-cell content percentage, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> depicts the variation of peak-peak short-circuit current signal versus the open-cell content. As the open-cell content changes from zero to 50%, both peak-peak voltage and current are improved significantly. At 50%, the peak-peak voltage and peak-peak current are nearly 45<italic>V</italic> and 8 <italic>μA</italic>, respectively. After that, the electrical outputs decrease remarkably by increasing the open-cell content. This trend can be attributed to the variation of the capacitance properties of the TENG device. Indeed, one of the main techniques for enhancing the TENG performance is to improve the intrinsic capacitance of the TENG system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This parameter is directly related to the effective dielectric constant or relative permittivity of the applied dielectric layer, and inversely related to the effective dielectric thickness. It is evident from the results that using aerogel film can reduce the effective dielectric thickness due to the existence of air cells. The effective dielectric constant or relative permittivity of an aerogel film is the combination of the permittivity of the air inside the pores and the solid-state material i.e. Polyimide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As the permittivity of air is less than the relative permittivity of Polyimide, the effective dielectric constant reduces by excessive increase of air inside the material. Therefore, there exists a certain range for adding open-cells into the proposed aerogel film to boost the capacitive behavior of the TENG and after that, increasing the open-cell content will degrade the capacitance and so the performance of the TENG. Thus, the 50% open-cell content shows the highest performance among all cases and will be selected as the optimum aerogel film for further studies. It should be noted that even though the outputs are reduced for 60% and 70% cases, but both cases show higher outputs than the TENG with the dense film. Therefore, all aerogel samples are superior to the simple dense layer of the dielectric validating the idea of using proposed aerogel film for performance enhancement of the TENG.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of open-cell content percentage on: (<bold>a</bold>) peak-peak output voltage, (<bold>b</bold>) peak-peak output current of the TENG.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_38121_Fig7_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">To further study the performance of the aerogel-based TENG, the effect of excitation frequency on the open-circuit voltage of the device with 50% open-cell content aerogel film has been examined, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8(a)</xref>. For the lower tested frequencies, the amplitudes of voltage signals are slightly smaller than those of the higher frequencies and by increasing the frequency, the amplitudes become almost identical. The reason is from a specific value of frequency, the applied dynamic force becomes large enough such that the effective contact area will be achieved during the contact and separation. For the larger frequencies than that specific frequency, the open-circuit voltage will be independent from the frequency as the effective contact area remains constant for all frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effect of excitation frequency on the TENG open-circuit voltage, (<bold>b</bold>) mechanical robustness of the aerogel-based TENG under continuous harmonic loads.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_38121_Fig8_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">To investigate the mechanical robustness and durability of the aerogel-based TENG under harmonic loads, the TENG device with 50% open-cell content aerogel film was placed under a harmonic mechanical excitation using a shaker for 10000 cycles with 5 Hz frequency and 0.5 g acceleration.

After chemically and mechanically characterization of the Polyimide aerogel, various aerogel films with different nano-porosity levels were tested. It was shown that the performance is improved when the open-cell content changes from zero to 50% and then relatively degrades for 60% and 70% open-cell contents. The enhancement is attributed to the improvement of the surface area, TENG relative capacitance, and electrostatic induction. The relative decrease on the performance of 60% and 70% open-cell contents can be attributed to the ineffective dielectric constant variation. The highest performance was achieved for 50% open-cell content where the peak open-circuit voltage, peak short-circuit current, and instantaneous power are obtained around 40<italic>V</italic>, 5 <italic>μA</italic>, and 47 <italic>μW</italic>, respectively. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current for 50% porous layer are around 8 times as much as those of a TENG with a flat and solid dielectric film. Using the 50% open-cell content film, the effect of various mechanical and electrical parameters such as frequency of excitation, cyclic loads, and external resistive loads were fully investigated. The capability of proposed TENG for charging capacitors were also demonstrated. Therefore, the proposed Polyimide-based aerogel film can significantly improve the performance of TENG systems which can be utilized for various energy harvesting and sensing applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par22">p-phenylene diamine (PPDA) and biphenyl-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (BPDA) were selected as diamine and dianhydride monomers respectively.

Through preparation of polyimide sol-gels, both PPDA and BPDA monomers are added to 47% of total NMP separately and stirred for 10 min. The BTC crosslinking agent equal to 1% molar fraction of the solids is also added to remaining 6% of total NMP content and stirred until fully dissolved. Then the monomers are mixed and reacted for 5 min to form polyamic acid followed by another 3 min mixing after addition of BTC. Finally, 12.5 ml of acetic anhydride and 11 ml of Pyridine are added to the prepared solutions and stirred 3 min further. After addition of chemical reagents, the solutions are poured into the prepared 80 × 80 × 1 mm square molds and left 24 hours for the aging. After aging, the gels are removed from the mold and soaked in 100% NMP bath for 24 h to scavenge the acetic anhydride and pyridine. Then NMP content of the samples gradually exchanged with acetone in 24 h intervals to prepare them for CO<sub>2</sub> super-critical drying, as CO<sub>2</sub> is not soluble in NMP. The NMP to acetone exchange started with 25% acetone in NMP bath, followed by 75% acetone in NMP and finally the prepared sol-gels left in 100% acetone bath for further 72 h. 200 ml autoclave chambers are employed for the CO<sub>2</sub> super-critical drying process. The process started by placing the gels into the chamber and washing them with liquid CO<sub>2</sub> at 1500 Psi pressure and room temperature until complete elimination of acetone.

Is should be noted that Polyimide aerogel nanostructure assembly is highly sensitive to processing parameters. Therefore, varying processing parameters will result in different morphology, particle size as well as the pore size distribution.
