Such bioelectrochemical systems have a clear advantage over more conventional microbial fuel cells which require the input of organic carbon for microbial growth. However, innovative approaches are needed to address scale-up issues associated with the fabrication of the inorganic (electrodes) and biological (microbe) parts of the biophotovoltaic device. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a simple commercial inkjet printer to fabricate a thin-film paper-based biophotovoltaic cell consisting of a layer of cyanobacterial cells on top of a carbon nanotube conducting surface. We show that these printed cyanobacteria are capable of generating a sustained electrical current both in the dark (as a ‘solar bio-battery’) and in response to light (as a ‘bio-solar-panel’) with potential applications in low-power devices.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Cyanobacteria can be exploited to convert light energy into electrical current, however utilising them efficiently for power generation is a challenge.

The main focus has for a long time been on the use of heterotrophic bacteria to convert organic carbon substrates into an electrical output in so-called microbial fuel cells (MFCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. More recently, photoautotrophic cyanobacteria and unicellular algae have been successfully used to produce a minimal type of MFC, termed a biophotovoltaic (BPV) cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, that operates in the absence of an added carbon feedstock. Instead electrons are released in the light during the process of oxygenic photosynthesis and in the dark during the oxidation of carbohydrate or other carbon-containing compounds synthesised from carbon dioxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, BPV devices are able to provide power in both the light and the dark, in contrast to photovoltaic (PV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> systems which are driven solely by light. Furthermore, BPV devices can repair light-induced damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, in contrast to semi-artificial PV systems containing isolated photosynthetic reaction centres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and are therefore more durable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These features suggest that BPV devices could play a role as environmentally friendly power supplies for use in low-power applications.</p><p id="Par4">Conventional BPV devices are made by gravity-induced deposition of cells from liquid culture onto an electrode surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Such an approach has a number of drawbacks for scalability: the devices are relatively bulky due to the presence of a liquid reservoir, the sedimentation process is lengthy, and there is limited scope for precision engineering of the electrode <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here we describe three innovations to improve the miniaturisation and large-scale production of BPV cells. Our approach is based on the use of inkjet printing which has been applied previously for the high-throughput patterning of various types of living cell onto solid supports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and is widely exploited for the deposition of sub-cellular components such as DNA and enzymes as well as the industrial-scale production of printed electrical conductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Firstly, we demonstrate the feasibility of using an inexpensive commercial inkjet printer to print a ‘bio-ink’ of cyanobacterial cells onto paper under conditions that allow the cells to remain fully viable and to retain their photosynthetic capacity after printing.</p><p id="Par7">Secondly, we demonstrate that inkjet printing can be used to fabricate both the non-biological and biological parts of a ‘bioelectrode’ and that this printed bioelectrode produces an electric current at similar levels to the traditional bioelectrode used in BPV devices and is capable of powering a small digital clock or low-power LED light.</p><p id="Par8">Finally, we use ink-jet printing to fabricate a ‘thin-film semi-dry’ BPV cell in which a water-absorbent gel is used to replace the cumbersome liquid reservoir.

The hydrogel was about 1 mm thick containing the medium (BG-11 high salt), and acted as a salt bridge between the anode and cathode. It was pre-soaked in the appropriate aqueous medium. A commercially available hydrogel (Spenco<sup>®</sup>2nd Skin Squares, Spenco Medical Corporation, USA) was used and was made of superabsorbent polymer holding at least 80 % water. The hydrogel was transparent, allowing unimpeded illumination over the surface of the deposited photosynthetic cells. The electrodes’ contacts were dried, cleaned and connected with carbon connectors. The contacts were insulated to avoid interference from humidity during the measurements. The assembled system was then placed inside a spherical aquarium <italic>biOrb 60</italic> (Reef One, UK) where 100 % relative humidity and white LED illumination (50 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) were controlled to prevent dehydration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Powering a digital clock and LED</title><p id="Par48">The digital clock and its attached electrical circuit were obtained from 4M Industrial Development Ltd. To power the digital clock, an array consisting of 9 Hybrid BPV cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) was organised in 3 clusters connected in parallel. Each cluster had 3 units connected in series.</p><p id="Par49">The ultra-low current LED flasher was fabricated by the Electronics Workshop, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge by following the blueprint available in the supplementary material (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). To power the LED flasher, the array of the 9 BPV cells were organised in series. A pulse generation circuit was placed between the LED and the BPV array.</p><p id="Par50">In both cases, a voltmeter and an ammeter were used to measure the potential (Volt) and the current (Ampere) respectively (UNI-T, UT70B). Constant illumination was provided throughout (100 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) (OSRAM, LED 2700 K Warm White).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Electrochemistry</title><p id="Par51">The two systems were tested for current production:</p><p id="Par52">For the hybrid BPV system, polarisation curves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) were recorded by performing linear sweep voltammetries (LS) in the absence and in the presence of light (100 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), from the voltage equivalent to the open circuit potential, to zero mV, as typically used for the characterisation of MFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Measurements were carried out with an Autolab PGSTAT12 (Metrhom/EcoChimie, the Netherlands) connected to a computer. Current (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) was measured by connecting the BPV device to a potentiostat (P-stat, MultiTrace PalmSens) with a two-electrode system and setting the voltage to 0 V in order to measure the maximum current output.</p><p id="Par53">For the printed BPV system, current (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>) was measured with a UT60-A Digital multimeter (Uni Trend Group Ltd, China) with a 1 MΩ load connected in parallel (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Illumination was provided by white LEDs (50 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and was placed approximately 50 cm above the surface of the printed BPV at which point light intensity was measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical validation</title><p id="Par54">The statistical analysis tool one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether there were any significant differences between the means of independent (unrelated) groups of data.
