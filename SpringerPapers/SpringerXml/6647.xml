In this work, we present two different facile methods of doing this by fitting photoluminescence images taken in two different wavelength ranges or from different sides. These methods, which are based on measuring the ratio of two photoluminescence images, yield absolute values of the diffusion length and are less sensitive to the inhomogeneity of the incident laser beam.

The features of PL imaging are non-contact (without damaging the sample), fast and on-line which make it prominent from other testing methods. What’s more, it can be used in every step of the whole production process from semiconductor raw materials to the finished photovoltaic devices. Applications of PL imaging method contain characterizing raw material quality (for example, dislocation defects within the material)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, local effective minority carrier lifetime and minority carrier diffusion length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It can also characterize the leakage positions within the photovoltaic cells, as well as series resistance and doping concentrations of solar cells, etc.</p><p>At present, methods of characterizing diffusion length changes in space include light beam induced current (LBIC) imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, electroluminescence (EL) imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and photoluminescence (PL) imaging. LBIC imaging has the advantage of high precision on the testing data. But it would cost a very long time, such as detecting a 125 × 125 square millimeters solar cell should require several hours. EL imaging significantly shortens the measurement time (it only needs a few seconds). Whereas, applied voltage must be added to the sample under test in this method which will have some bad influence to the sample more or less. At the same time, as it requires the sample under test with at least an electrode, restricts it to be applied to a semiconductor raw material. PL imaging overcomes the above problems. The excess carriers within the semiconductors are stimulated by laser instead of applied voltage. However, the existing studies dedicated to extracting quantitative information on spatially resolved recombination properties of silicon wafers from PL have one common problem. They rely on further measurement techniques in addition to PL like CDI/ILM (carrier density imaging/infrared lifetime mapping), or require the detailed data of the samples under test and test equipment themselves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recently some researchers have focused on the study of free carrier absorption and minority carrier distribution in the grain boundaries via PL method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Whereas, they have not showed an accurate and feasible method to investigate the diffusion length distribution yet.</p><p>In this work, we present a method of extracting quantified information of the minority carrier diffusion length distribution of a polycrystalline silicon wafer using only basic PL data. To obtain the numerical relationship between the diffusion length and the final PL intensity of each pixel detected by a charge-couple device (CCD), we first study the physical mechanism of the silicon PL effect. The entire process consists of absorption of the laser beam by the silicon, spontaneous radiation within the material, photon reabsorption and transmission inside the wafer and PL signal acquisition by CCDs. From this process, we obtain the direct numerical relationship between the diffusion length (the desired information) and the pixel data on the CCD (the information that can be obtained). However, many other parameters are required to obtain the diffusion length from the data on the CCD, such as the CCD camera’s conversion factor from photoelectrons to digital units <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>AD</italic>,</sub> and the effective solid angle of detection, Ω. Therefore, we also investigate the relationship between PL images taken in different wavelength ranges or from different sides. We find that the ratio of different PL images can also reveal the diffusion length distribution; that is, different values of the ratio correspond to different diffusion lengths. On the basis of this finding, we extract the quantified diffusion length distribution of a polycrystalline silicon wafer by two methods. In the first method, PL images are obtained with and without an 1100 nm long-pass filter. From the ratio of these two images, we can obtain the diffusion length distribution. The second method is consistent in principle with the first, but detects the photoluminescence from the front and rear sides of the wafer. The two methods can be used to verify each other and they can also be applied to other semiconductor raw materials, which would improve our understanding of specific materials and guide device fabrication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental scheme</title><p>A certain wavelength laser is used to irradiate to the surface of a semiconductor, then semiconductor materials absorb the photons and excite electron-hole pairs.

The laser beam is homogenized to a 3 × 4 square centimeters beam by an optical system and then irradiate to the sample. The sample is a 200 μm thickness N-type polycrystalline silicon wafer placed on a stage vertically. A thick surface oxidation layer (about 50 Å) has been formed on the wafer to achieve a certain surface recombination velocity (about 10<sup>4</sup> cm/s). A cooled InGaAs CCD is used to capture the PL signal of the silicon wafer. An 1100 nm long-pass optical filter is placed in front of the CCD camera for choice. The response curves of InGaAs CCD and filter are shown in the Method section at the end of this paper. As the sensitivity range of the camera is from 900 nm to 1700 nm, by only using a long-pass filter, defect band emissions may contain in the PL images. However, in polycrystalline silicon wafers, the effect of defect band emissions to the whole photoluminescence intensity could be neglected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The dependence on the laser power</title><p>To study the effect of the laser power on the PL results, we perform the following experiments. The sample under test is a 200 μm thick polycrystalline silicon wafer. The laser and cooled InGaAs CCD are placed on opposite sides of the sample under test. The output power of the laser is varies from 2 to 34 W in steps of 2 W. All the pixel data in one PL image detected by the InGaAs CCD are added. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows that the light intensity variation curves of the resulting 17 PL images exhibit basically linear variation (because space is limited, we show only 9 pictures on the left corresponding to points from <italic>i</italic> to <italic>ix</italic> in the variation curve). Light saturation does not occur. We can conclude from this result that the laser power in this arrangement causes minority carrier injection in the semiconductor. Consequently, the entire output power of the laser in the available ranges can be used in the following experiments, we choose a relatively high output power to reduce the detection time of the CCD camera.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>PL intensity variation with laser power.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photoluminescence images with different laser power varying from 2 W to 34 W.

At the same time, the applicability of this PL system to different types of polycrystalline silicon wafers must be studied. Therefore, we choose three types of polycrystalline silicon wafers, which are labeled A, B and C, for this experiment. They are classified by visual inspection. Both sides of A are exactly the same, with relatively large and uniformly distributed grains; B’s two sides appear totally different, where the grains are relatively small and nonuniformly distributed; C’s two sides appear the same overall and the grains are also small and nonuniformly distributed.</p><p><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(a–c)</xref> show PL images of these three polycrystalline silicon wafers, where the incident laser has an 808 nm wavelength. The PL intensities of the three wafers detected by the InGaAs CCD differ greatly. The sums of the gray values of each pixel in the three images are 3.86×10<sup>6</sup>, 4.69×10<sup>6</sup>, 5.18×10<sup>6</sup> respectively. However, we could not conclude from the data that B is the best wafer as it produced more photons, indicating fewer defects and a longer diffusion length. The PL intensity is known to depend mainly on the properties of the interior of the semiconductor itself. However, it would also be influenced by other factors such as the homogeneity of the laser beam and differences in the reflectivity at different points on the silicon wafer surface. A laser beam homogeneity of up to 90% can be confirmed and the three wafers are tested by the same homogeneous system. Thus, the laser beam homogeneity would not affect this comparative analysis of the light intensity. However, the reflectivity distribution is expected to be problematic, so we then tested the three wafers using point-by-point reflectivity scanning (the details are discussed in the Method section). As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(d–f)</xref>, these three samples exhibit different reflectivity properties. The average reflectivities of them are 0.45, 0.31 and 0.24, respectively. If we add the effect of the reflectivity to the description of the above three PL images, we could obtain a totally different result. The actual PL intensities of these three wafers are ordered as follows: A &gt; C &gt; B. Considering the features of these three types of wafers, A is most likely to have the highest PL intensity, as it has relatively large and uniformly distributed grains. To confirm this, we made four-point-probe resistivity measurements. The square resistances of them are 63 Ω/□, 83 Ω/□ and 76 Ω/□. The square resistance is inversely proportional to the doping concentration <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>/<sub><italic>D</italic>,</sub> so samples with smaller square resistance values have a larger doping concentration and should produce more spontaneously emitted photons. Samples with smaller square resistance values (such as sample A) lead to have higher relative PL intensities. This is also explained later in this paper near equations <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">(2</xref>) and (<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>) where radiative recombination is a function of carrier concentration or doping. So, radiative recombination is expected to be larger for more heavily doped samples (or less resistivity). This can explain why sample A has the highest PL intensity among these three samples.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) Photoluminescence images of sample A, B and C.

It was obtained using the ratio of the PL intensities in images of the front and rear sides of the wafer with an 1100 nm long-pass filter. The results of the two methods agree well overall. However, we find that the result of the second method does not look as distinct as that of the first one and there may be local regions that cannot be used. This is due mainly to the slight position shift between images of the front and rear sides, which would cause incomplete overlap between these two PL images. However, this will not critically influence the characterization of the minority carrier diffusion length.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The imaging theory of the quantized diffusion length distribution is based on the fundamental nature of the semiconductor itself.

The data are normalized at a long diffusion length. The variation as a function of the diffusion length corresponding to the normalized luminescence signal depends on the filter that is used. For an 1100 nm short-pass filter, a strong dependence of the normalized luminescence signal on the diffusion length <italic>L</italic> is predicted for <italic>L</italic> &lt; 100 μm and relatively little additional variation is predicted for <italic>L</italic> &gt; 100 μm. This can be easily explained by the fact that the additional carriers that diffuse deeper into the wafer for longer diffusion lengths do not affect the measured signal at short wavelengths because of reabsorption. However, for the long-pass filter and without a filter, the photons with long penetration depths are measured. In that case, the variation in the normalized luminescence signal is stronger for long wavelengths. Therefore, we found that the results of the short-pass filter give more information about the carrier density near the wafer surface, whereas those measured without a filter or with a long-pass filter reveal more information about the entire wafer.</p><p>It may appear that we could just use the relationship between the measured luminescence intensity and the diffusion length from the above expressions to determine the diffusion length distribution. We do not do that for the following two reasons. First, it is necessary to calibrate the intensity curve by comparison with the intensity of a standard solar cell or wafer with a known diffusion length. Second, by using multiple PL images, the effect of laser beam inhomogeneity on the diffusion length distribution can be removed.</p><p>We proposed a method that eliminates both of these problems by measuring at least two PL images taken in different wavelength ranges or from opposite sides. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(c)</xref> shows the theoretical results for the ratio of the expected luminescence signals as a function of the diffusion length <italic>L</italic>. The ratio of two relative luminescence signals measured in different ways gives a number that indicates the absolute diffusion length. From the above results, we find that the luminescence intensities do not vary significantly when <italic>L</italic> &gt; 200 μm and S = 10<sup>4</sup> cm/s. The surface recombination velocity is a key element in our proposed model. A deviation in the surface recombination velocity would lead to errors in the final calculated diffusion length. Therefore, we set up the surface recombination velocity in the model the same as the sample to have better fitting. In this case, the analysis of the luminescence intensity ratios yields an effective diffusion length instead of the bulk diffusion length. Therefore, we could determine the numerical value of the diffusion length distribution using this method.</p><p><xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(b,c)</xref> show the numerical value of the diffusion length distribution of sample B obtained by the above method. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(b)</xref> is made by fitting the results for two different wavelength ranges, those in PL images taken without a filter and with an 1100 nm long-pass filter. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(c)</xref> is made by fitting the results for opposite sides, those from PL images detected from the front and rear sides of the silicon wafer. These two pictures agree well overall. As shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(c)</xref>, the intensity ratio of PL images at two different wavelengths (red line) changes very little when the diffusion length exceeds 250 μm.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photoluminescence image of sample B.

The same mean was also used in the method using PL images of opposite sides [blue line in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(c)</xref>], although the correspondence between the color and diffusion length values is exactly opposite to that in the first method. For comparison, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(a)</xref> shows a map of the PL image taken without a filter from the rear side. We choose three different positions on the wafer for comparison with the diffusion length distribution results we obtained. The area enclosed by the rounded square in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(a)</xref> (top right corner) shows a relatively high PL intensity and in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(b,c)</xref>, the areas are also regions of longer diffusion length. The area enclosed by an oval in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(a)</xref> shows a high PL intensity, whereas the same region in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(b,c)</xref> shows a shorter diffusion length. A possible explanation is that this area may contain grain boundaries, which can radiate light at other wavelengths that contributes to the PL intensity. However, they are actually not areas of long diffusion length. The last one we choose to compare is the area enclosed by a square in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(a)</xref> (bottom right corner). Because of incident laser beam inhomogeneity, that area shows low PL intensity, although it is a region of long diffusion length, as shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(b,c)</xref>.</p><p>Sample A and sample C were also tested using the same methods we proposed. The results of diffusion length distribution of them are shown in <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. That could be a verification of our methods. The experimental results of sample A and C are not as well as the one of sample B. One reason is that the diffusion lengths of sample A and C are longer than sample B, which may cause some error in the long diffusion length area. The other reason is that the surface recombination velocities of these three samples would have some deviations more or less which will lead to some errors using the same simulation model.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) Photoluminescence images of sample A and sample C.

Furthermore, they can also eliminate the effects of laser beam inhomogeneity and some other characteristics of the wafer itself on the resulting diffusion length distribution. However, these methods also have some limitations. The variation in the PL intensity ratio with the diffusion length would vary with the surface recombination velocity. Therefore, the surface recombination velocity of each type of sample should be known and recalculated in the model. As the variation curve of the PL intensity ratio is weak for long diffusion lengths, this method become less sensitive to diffusion lengths that are comparable to or larger than the wafer thickness. In addition, surface texturing or nanostructures in the samples under test may cause errors because they affect the internal light path.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We proposed two methods of quantitatively determining the spatially resolved diffusion length. One method is to measure two PL images taken with and without an 1100 nm pass filter from the rear side of wafer. The other method is to measure two PL images taken from the front and rear sides of the wafer. The two methods were discussed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally on a polycrystalline silicon wafer. Three different features of samples under test were tested using these methods. Good agreement was observed between these two methods. These methods can be applied to silicon wafers at all stages of solar cell production, from raw wafers through to finished solar cells. They can also eliminate the effects of laser beam inhomogeneity and some other characteristics of the wafer itself on the resulting diffusion length distribution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Laser beam homogenizing system design for photoluminescence</title><p>Based on waveguide coupling theory, we put forward a scheme for large area uniform laser irradiation and prove it by theoretical simulation and experiment.

Before the laser beam irradiates to the surface of sample under test, it is reflected by a half transparent and half reflecting mirror, then focused by a microscope objective. The final diameter of laser beam on the sample under test is about 100 μm. A CCD camera is placed over the half mirror to detect the reflective light from the sample surface. The sample under test is placed on a two-dimensional translation stage. By moving the two-dimensional translation stage, reflectivity scanning image of the sample could be achieved.
