A compilation of known reactions shows the extent of light-driven interactions between naturally occurring components of land, air, and water, and provides the backdrop for an outline of the mechanisms of these phenomena. Catalyzed reactions, uncatalyzed reactions, direct processes, and indirect processes all operate in natural photochemical transformations, many of which are analogous to well-known biological reactions. By overlaying photochemistry and surface geochemistry, complementary approaches can be adopted to identify natural photochemical reactions and discern their significance in the environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Atmosphere</kwd><kwd>Minerals</kwd><kwd>Natural photoreactions</kwd><kwd>Photocatalysis</kwd><kwd>Photochemistry</kwd><kwd>Soil</kwd><kwd>Surface geochemistry</kwd><kwd>Water</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12932_2017_Article_39.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Geochemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>SC7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Photogeochemistry has been defined as the photochemistry of Earth-abundant minerals in shaping biogeochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and this can be extended to the entire interface between photochemistry and geochemistry to include any chemical reaction induced by sunlight among naturally occurring substances. The term has been used previously on only several other isolated occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but if existing research is surveyed for studies that fit this definition, an appreciable body of knowledge emerges.</p><p id="Par3">The context of a photogeochemical reaction is implicitly the surface of the earth, since that is where sunlight is available (ignoring other sources of light such as bioluminescence). Reactions may occur among constituents of land such as minerals, plant residue, and the organic and inorganic components of soil; constituents of surface water such as sediment and dissolved organic matter; and constituents of the atmospheric boundary layer directly influenced by contact with land or water, such as organic aerosols, mineral aerosols, and gases. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows some examples of photochemical reactions among these substances. Sunlight penetrates up to approximately 0.3 mm in soils and particulate minerals, depending on the wavelength of light and the nature of the particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and many meters in clear water, depending on the concentration of light-absorbing molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Light of wavelengths less than about 290 nm is completely absorbed by the present atmosphere and therefore does not reach Earth’s surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photogeochemistry is the study of sunlight-induced chemical reactions among substances that are found naturally on Earth’s surface and intermingle across its domains.

The reactions that comprise photosynthesis in plants and other organisms, for example, are not included, since the physiochemical context for these reactions is installed by the organism, and must be maintained in order for the reactions to continue (the photoreactions cease if the organism dies). However, if a certain substance is produced by an organism, and the organism dies but the substance remains (e.g., plant residue or biogenic mineral precipitates), photoreactions involving this substance still contribute to photogeochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>History</title><p id="Par5">The most famous example of a photochemical reaction involving natural compounds is the production of indigoid dyes from the secretions of marine mollusks, known since antiquity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; the role of sunlight was emphasized in a study by William Cole in 1685 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The development of modern photochemistry in general was fostered by similar adventitious observations of the effect of sunlight on natural compounds. For example, Hyde Wollaston in 1811 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] observed that guaiac, a tree resin, rapidly turned green in the air when exposed to sunlight (due to photooxidation). Natural photodegradation was also known, as described by Berzelius in 1829 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]: “Light fades and destroys the majority of plant colorants. Every day we see that of the sun weakening the dyes of our fabrics”. This phenomenon was also mentioned by John William Draper in 1845 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Georges Witz in 1883 described the degradation of cellulose by sunlight, remarking on the influence of air and moisture, and further noted that degradation was greatly accelerated by ferric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By the end of the 19th century, photodegradation of organic matter in natural waters was recognized as a universal phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition to degradation, other light-induced transformations were also recorded. Louis Pasteur described how a dark-colored material is produced in cinchona bark under the influence of sunlight, an observation that he confirmed in the laboratory with specific compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and Hermann Trommsdorff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Karl Fritzsche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were also among those who observed changes in natural organic substances when they were illuminated. Many inorganic substances were also known to change (e.g., in color or crystal structure) upon exposure to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, since 1881 it has been known that zinc sulfide, normally white, becomes dark when exposed to sunlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; John Cawley remarked that “I have prepared pigments so sensitive as to be turned almost black when exposed to bright sunlight for one or two minutes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Investigation of the light-induced reactions of this compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which occurs as a natural mineral, provided some additional empirical contributions to photochemistry and the “photochemical metallurgy” of zinc, and its photocatalytic properties are still studied at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Many natural inorganic compounds used throughout the ages as pigments in painting also slowly degrade by exposure to sunlight; artists like Van Gogh were aware of this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some of these compounds, such as mercury(II) sulfide, undergo a number of light-mediated reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] which are environmentally relevant.</p><p id="Par6">Around the time of these and other observations, experiments increased in an effort to reproduce natural processes. The hypothesis of von Baeyer in 1870 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], in which formaldehyde was proposed to be the initial product of plant photosynthesis followed by polymerization into sugars, inspired numerous attempts to obtain formaldehyde from carbon dioxide and water. For example, the formation of lower uranium oxides was observed upon irradiation of a solution of uranium acetate and carbon dioxide, implying the formation of a reducing agent assumed to be formaldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Some experiments included reducing agents such as hydrogen gas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and others reportedly detected formaldehyde and other products in the absence of additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting that reducing power was produced from the decomposition of water during exposure to light. In addition to this main focus on the synthesis of formaldehyde and simple sugars, other light-driven reactions were occasionally noted, such as the decomposition of formaldehyde and subsequent release of methane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Many experiments explored the effect of a catalyst in converting light energy into chemical energy; some effective “transformers” (as they were sometimes called) were similar to naturally occurring minerals, including iron(III) oxide or colloidal iron(III) hydroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], zinc oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and cobalt, copper, nickel, and iron carbonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. By this time, interest had spread to other light-induced reactions involving naturally occurring materials. These studies sometimes reported photoreactions analogous to biological processes, such as oxidation of simple carbon compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or nitrification in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of photogeochemical reactions</title><p id="Par7">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents a selection of documented photochemical reactions (with light &gt;290 nm) among naturally occurring substances, ranging from general reactions such as mineralization of organic matter to specific reactions such as methylation and demethylation of mercury.

Similarly, an abiotic process that converts water to O<sub>2</sub> under the action of light may be described as “photochemical oxidation of water” rather than simply “photooxidation of water” (even though the latter is shorter and often understood to mean a photochemical reaction); this distinguishes it from light-induced biological oxidation of water that might occur simultaneously in the same environment</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Classification of photogeochemical reactions</title><p id="Par8">The same principles that form the foundation of photochemistry can also be used to describe and explain photogeochemical reactions. If specific reactions are known, they may be distinguished as either photosynthetic reactions, photocatalytic reactions, or uncatalyzed reactions. In the most general sense, photosynthesis refers to any photochemical reaction for which the change in energy (ΔG) is positive. The energy of the products is greater than that of the reactants, and therefore the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, except through the action of light in conjunction with a catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or a chromophoric system, for example, that mimics what occurs in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Examples of photosynthetic reactions include the production of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> from water and the reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> and water to form O<sub>2</sub> and reduced carbon compounds such as methane and methanol. Photocatalysis refers to photochemical reactions, accelerated by the presence of a catalyst, that have a negative change in energy and are therefore thermodynamically favored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], such as the reaction of organic compounds with O<sub>2</sub> to form CO<sub>2</sub> and water. Finally, uncatalyzed photoreactions proceed through the action of light alone. For example, many organic compounds absorb light and suffer decomposition as a result. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts a simple scheme for classifying photoreactions based on the requirement for a catalyst and whether a reaction proceeds by a direct or indirect mechanism, as further described below.

A photocatalyst does this by absorbing light, but as described below, other substances that do not absorb light may nevertheless catalyze light-induced reactions. Strictly speaking, the term catalysis should not be used unless it can be shown that the number of product molecules produced per number of active sites on a substance (the turnover number) is greater than one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; this is difficult to do in practice, although it is often assumed to be true if there is no loss in the activity of the substance for an extended period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Reactions which are not definitively catalytic may be designated as assisted photoreactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] or photosensitized reactions. Photosensitized reactions involve transfer of energy from a light-absorbing species (photosensitizer) to another, nonabsorbing species, and therefore facilitate reaction of this nonabsorbing species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. If the photosensitizer remains intact it is effectively a photocatalyst. Furthermore, a substance may initially act as a photocatalyst in a reaction even if it eventually suffers light-induced decomposition. Descriptors such as those given here are most applicable when all of the participants in a specific reaction can be identified, not just individual reactants or products. In contrast, it is hard to classify observations in complex matrices such as soil if the complete reactions responsible for the observations are not first discerned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Direct reactions</title><p id="Par10">Photochemical reactions can be further categorized as either direct or indirect. Direct reactions involve the substance that initially absorbs light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] which reacts with other substances or is itself changed. Many photochemical reactions on Earth may be directly mediated by naturally occurring semiconductors that absorb ultraviolet and visible radiation. These are mostly transition metal oxides and sulfides and include abundant, widely distributed minerals such as hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), goethite and lepidocrocite (FeOOH), anatase and rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>), pyrolusite (MnO<sub>2</sub>), pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), and sphalerite (ZnS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Other types of minerals are also known to absorb light and directly participate in photoreactions, including silicates such as Ag<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and phosphates such as Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)PO<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Light of energy equal to or greater than the band gap of a semiconductor is sufficient to promote electrons from the valence band to a higher energy level in the conduction band, leaving behind electron vacancies or holes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The excited electron and hole in the semiconductor can then, respectively, reduce and oxidize other compounds having appropriate redox potentials relative to the potentials of the valence and conduction bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The band gaps and absolute energy levels of many minerals are suitable, in theory, for a diverse array of photoreactions at interfaces with water, gases, and other solids. Naturally occurring semiconductors are almost exclusively inorganic compounds, with notable exceptions (notable because they occur widely) being melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and possibly cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Natural semiconducting minerals, like most minerals, are rarely pure; additional metals are almost always present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and these substitutional impurities can cause changes in energy levels and conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Such alterations are manifested in photocatalytic activity. For example, the band gap of TiO<sub>2</sub> decreases due to Fe impurities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], which extends its response to a wider range of solar radiation compared to pure TiO<sub>2</sub>; the efficiencies of photochemical oxidation and reduction reactions of TiO<sub>2</sub> are also greater if Fe impurities are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Similarly, the presence of Ti or V in magnetite enhances its photocatalytic activity relative to pure magnetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In addition to atoms of foreign elements, another common “defect” in minerals is deviation from stoichiometry due to vacancies (missing atoms), and this can also affect photochemical properties. For example, sulfur deficiencies in ZnS crystals impart increased photocatalytic activity under visible light to a material that normally absorbs little or no visible light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition to chemical alterations, the photocatalytic activity of materials like these is also influenced by physical properties such as crystal structure and specific surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Like inorganic minerals, many natural organic compounds also absorb sunlight and can react directly with other compounds or undergo reactions themselves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b); these include dissolved organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], “bioorganic” substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], chlorophyll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], atmospheric humic-like substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and soot or black carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Moreover, two species may combine to form a new species with even greater propensity to undergo direct photoreactions, as is often the case with intramolecular or intermolecular charge-transfer complexes among components of organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] or between transition metals and organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

These materials are usually catalysts and act primarily via surface adsorption, which can alter the bond lengths and energies of a substance when it is bound to the catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and consequently alter the amount or wavelengths of sunlight absorbed by this substance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The bound substance then becomes susceptible to photolysis and other photoreactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Depending on the nature of a substance, however, adsorption onto materials such as clay and ash can sometimes impede rather than facilitate photoreactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Indirect reactions</title><p id="Par14">Indirect photochemical reactions are initiated by substances that absorb radiation and subsequently facilitate other reactions that do not involve the original light-absorbing substance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For example, excited electrons and holes can be indirectly generated in semiconductors by light of lower energy than the band gap: the semiconductor itself does not absorb this light, but another substance (possibly even another semiconductor) that does absorb this light may be excited, and if this substance is in contact with the semiconductor and has appropriate energy levels, electrons can then be transferred between the excited substance and the semiconductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The semiconductor, now carrying additional electrons or holes, can participate in redox reactions that would not otherwise occur. For example, TiO<sub>2</sub> has a large band gap and is not normally excited by visible light; however, organic matter and natural chlorophyll derivatives are excited upon absorption of visible light, and in proximity to TiO<sub>2</sub> can transfer electrons to TiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. This process is called charge injection, and is an example of photosensitization—reactions of TiO<sub>2</sub> with additional substances are facilitated by the initial presence of organic matter or chlorophyll derivatives.</p><p id="Par15">A substance may also participate indirectly in photochemical reactions by generating reactive species upon irradiation; these reactive species then engage in other reactions that do not involve the original light-absorbing substance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For example, some aluminosilicates (e.g., zeolites) and non-transition-metal oxides (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO) can react with the oxygen in air upon irradiation to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen and superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Photodegradation of an organic compound was observed in the presence of kaolinite and montmorillonite, for example, and was attributed to the formation of ROS on the surface of these minerals in the presence of molecular oxygen and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Since the organic compound in question does not absorb sunlight and the ROS are produced in a separate reaction, this is an indirect photoreaction, facilitated by the clay minerals which presumably act as catalysts by generating ROS from O<sub>2</sub> upon exposure to light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e).</p><p id="Par16">Along with minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], other substances can indirectly facilitate photoreactions by generating reactive species in sunlight: dissolved and particulate organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], dissolved organic matter and silicate minerals in synergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], lignin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], leaves of phototoxic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], chlorophyll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], nitrite and nitrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>], flavins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>], tryptophan and tyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>], and aqueous iron(III) species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. In contrast to the typically strong oxidizing action of ROS, a strongly reducing species can also be generated which is usually represented as <italic>e</italic><sup>−</sup> (aq), a hydrated electron, although its true nature and features are not completely understood. Hydrated electrons are evident upon irradiation of dissolved organic matter, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. As might be expected, reactive species are formed on exposed soil surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]; both the mineral and organic components of soil contribute to this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Indirect photolysis of organic compounds in soil has been observed to occur at depths of up to 2 mm due to migration of reactive species; in contrast, direct photolysis (in which the degraded compound itself absorbs light) is restricted to a photic depth of about ten times less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Both light penetration and transport processes such as diffusion influence the extent to which compounds are degraded by light in soil and similar media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. Indirect processes may operate during photodegradation of plant material as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>].

Oftentimes photogeochemistry distinctly parallels biogeochemistry. As mentioned above, early research sometimes intentionally used biological phenomena as a starting point to search for analogous photochemical reactions. Other studies simply explored the effect of light on different materials, and as a result also discovered photochemical reactions analogous to biological processes. Photochemical counterparts have since been confirmed for many well-known biochemical reactions. These include photochemical disproportionation of acetic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] which is analogous to acetoclastic methanogenesis, and light-induced depletion of O<sub>2</sub> via a catalytic cycle involving iron and organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>], analogous to consumption of O<sub>2</sub> by microorganisms. Estimates of the environmental significance of photochemical reactions relative to biological reactions have been offered on occasion, as for photochemical production of gases from plant litter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>], and the photofixation of N<sub>2</sub> in deserts, estimated as 20 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, which is about one third of that fixed by lightning and about 10% of that fixed biologically on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>].

Witz, based on his (nonbiological) studies with cellulose and other plant fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], concluded that light is indeed an integral participant in natural decomposition: “In nature, once the life of plants is extinguished, cellulosic matter and other structured matter must no doubt pass progressively under the influence of light, air, and humidity … and are eventually transformed into gaseous compounds and colored humic materials.”<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The study of photogeochemistry reflects the overlap between surface geochemistry and photochemistry.

It may therefore be suggested that this ubiquitous material, commonly deemed environmentally persistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>] and therefore paradoxical (since it does not accumulate in the environment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>], is also degraded upon exposure to sunlight.</p><p id="Par21">The study of photogeochemistry, while purely chemical in nature, may even venture into the domain of biology and identify more of the ways in which compounds derived from living organisms can influence abiotic photochemistry [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], as well as more of the unique relationships between photochemical reactions and biological metabolism known as photobiocatalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Observation of natural phenomena</title><p id="Par22">Specific photoreactions are often planned and conveniently observed in the laboratory, using artificial light sources or sunlight itself, where it is easy to confirm the identity of the substances involved, design reaction vessels, characterize the light, and adjust the reaction environment. However, observations of natural phenomena can offer opportunities to consider unknown photochemical reactions possibly associated with these phenomena. For example, by the 1970s it was generally agreed that nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has a short residence time in the troposphere, although the explanation for its removal was incomplete. Since N<sub>2</sub>O does not absorb light of wavelengths greater than 290 nm, direct photolysis had been discarded as a possible explanation. It was then observed that light would decompose chloromethanes when they were adsorbed on silica sand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>], and this occurred at lower energies (longer wavelengths) than the absorption spectra for the free compounds. The same phenomenon was observed for N<sub>2</sub>O on natural sand, leading to the conclusion that particulate matter in the atmosphere is responsible for the destruction of N<sub>2</sub>O via surface-sensitized photolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. Indeed, the idea of such a sink for atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O was supported by reports of low concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O in the air above deserts, where there is a large amount of suspended particulate matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. In general, simple atmospheric gases (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>) do not absorb ultraviolet and visible sunlight at the earth’s surface, and the cooperation of particulate matter is necessary for photoreactions involving these gases; such reactions are therefore heterogeneous. Other gases, however, such as some of the volatile compounds emitted from living plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>], burning plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>] and soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>], do absorb sunlight and can undergo homogeneous as well as heterogeneous reactions.</p><p id="Par23">As another example, the observation that the amount of nitrous acid in the atmosphere greatly increases during the day led to insight into the surface photochemistry of humic acids and soils and an explanation for the original observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. Fluctuations such as this are often a clue to the existence of photochemical reactions, which operate only during the day. Diurnal photogeochemical cycles often have a significant influence on the amounts of redox-sensitive elements in aqueous environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Furthermore, multiple elemental cycles can be linked via photoreactions that directly affect both elements, as occurs during the concurrent oxidation of organic matter and reduction of iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. The effect of light on one element can also indirectly affect other elements: a daily cycle of photoreduction, reoxidation, and precipitation of iron(III) species affects dissolved As, Cu, and P, which adsorb to iron(III) oxides as they reappear at night and may be subsequently released the next day upon photoreduction of the same iron oxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Contextualization of nonnatural photoreactions</title><p id="Par24">Although photogeochemistry describes reactions among substances known to occur naturally, studies of similar substances may nonetheless point towards greater understanding of natural processes. A general example demonstrates this: it has been shown that samples of clay minerals found in soils can accelerate the photodegradation of synthetic chemicals via production of reactive oxygen species [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]; it may therefore be assumed that many naturally occurring compounds are similarly affected. The conversion of N<sub>2</sub> to NH<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> has been observed upon irradiation with visible light in the presence of Fe<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. While such a compound is not known to occur naturally, it is related to known minerals like ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>), ulvospinel (Fe<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>), pseudorutile (Fe<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>), and various titanium-substituted iron oxides, and can form when ilmenite is heated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]; these naturally occurring minerals might therefore also react with N<sub>2</sub> under certain conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outlook</title><p id="Par25">Principles of photochemistry can be readily merged with geochemistry in investigation as well as education. Given the broad response of natural substances to light, recognizing photochemical reactions in the environment is part of understanding its fabric of interconnected processes, particularly on land, where this has not been explored as much as in water or the atmosphere. As remarked by Formenti and Teichner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] concerning heterogeneous photochemistry, “there are so many different possibilities”, an outlook reiterated by Cooper and Herr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] for aqueous photochemistry which is easily extended to photogeochemistry: “there are a seemingly endless number of combinations and permutations to study.” This does not enjoin an unattainable research agenda, but rather affirms ample opportunity for geoscientists to incline their curiosity toward what happens on Earth when the sun appears.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge discussions with colleagues and guidance from the editor and three reviewers which helped me
