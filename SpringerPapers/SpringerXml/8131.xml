However, the studies on the application of the photocatalytically degraded dye-polluted water and the multi-purpose use of one type of catalyst have remained sparse. In this report, we try to demonstrate a concept of multiple and cyclic application of materials and resources in environmentally relevant catalyst reactions. A magnetic composite catalyst prepared from exfoliated titania nanosheets, graphene, the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, and a polyelectrolyte enabled such a cyclic application. The composite catalyst decomposed a methylene blue-polluted water under visible light, and then the catalyst was collected and removed from the treated water using a magnet. The photocatalytically treated water was then used to prepare the electrolyte in electrochemical reductive reactions and presented superior electrochemical performance compared with the dye-polluted water. The composite catalyst was once again used as the cathode catalyst in the electrochemical reaction. Each component in the composite catalyst was indispensable in its catalytic activity, but each component played different roles in the photochemical, magnetic recycling, and electrochemical processes. We expect the report inspire the study on the multi-functional catalyst and cyclic use of the catalytically cleaned water, which should contribute for the environmental and energy remedy from a novel perspective.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_12504.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Environmental remedy and energy crisis call for scientific contributions with ever increasing urgency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Organically polluted water, closely related with printing and dyeing industry, is a frequent side product of improved human life and civilization. Not only effective pollution decomposition but also appropriate applications of the treated water should contribute to the remedy of waste water. In addition, cyclic and multiple uses of one material for different purposes will also decrease the manufacturing demands and contribute to environmental protection and energy savings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although the catalytic decomposition of organic pollutions in water has been extensively studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, the cyclic use of the treated water and the multi-purpose applications of the catalyst have remained under study.</p><p id="Par3">To explain in detail, special attentions have been paid to developing effective strategies in degrading organic pollutants in water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Visible light photocatalysts have been anticipated to be the promising solution to degrade organic dyes in water, and methods that enhance catalysts’ visible light catalytic power and operability have been heavily pursued after<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Semiconductor photocatalysts have drawn substantial attentions because of their appropriate electronic band structures and their abundance on earth. Previously we specifically focused on 2-dimensional exfoliated titania nanosheets (ETNs) for the following reasons: i) ETNs present an energy gap 0.6 eV larger than bulk anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>, promising their superior catalytic power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>; ii) ETNs offer larger specific surface area and thus more catalytic active sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>; and iii) the high surface charge and small volume made ETNs easily processed using solution assembly techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. One big challenge in bringing ETNs a step closer to applications is to induce visible light activity to ETN-based catalysts. Several strategies have been proposed to address the visible light activity by combining with visible-light active component, including forming composite particles with narrow-bandgap semiconductor (CdS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, noble metal (Pt, Au)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, or visible light responsive materials (Zn-Cr LDHsor CrOx)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as well as elemental doping (with nitrogen or manganese)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Another challenge in applying ETN-based catalyst would be enhancing its recovery ability. Traditionally, recycling of powder photocatalysts in waste solution can avoid the secondary contamination and reduce actual implementation cost, but it is a seriously difficult task due to its small particle size and high environmental temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To prepare magnetic catalyst has been widely recognized as effective in removing the catalysts after the reaction and recycling catalysts for multiple time applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Reports on the applications of the photocatalytically treated water remain sparse. It’s still doubtable how the photocatalytically cleaned water can be used. Due to the existence of residue organic species such as benzothiazole, azure A, maleic acid and other inorganic species such as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, the degraded water is still harmful to drink by human and animals. However, the application of the degraded water in the industrial application might be a viable solution. In developing countries, both the resource of clean water and electric power are sparse. The conversion of polluted water into electricity will impose high potential in addressing both the environmental and energy crisis in these areas. A fuel cell is a promising strategy in exploring the redox active species in environments. The wide varieties of applicable redox species range from the mineral chemicals in oceans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and bacterial metabolic systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Because of the diversity of the potentially applicable redox active species in fuel cells, we want to investigate whether the dye-polluted water, before and after photocatalytic treatment, can be used efficiently as the solvent in reductive reactions of the water-dissolved species and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), which is a widely studied fuel cell anode reaction.</p><p id="Par5">In this report, we propose a concept of environmentally economic use of a bifunctional catalyst and also the cyclic use of the photocatalytically cleaned dye-polluted water in electrochemical electrolyte. The multiple and cyclic application of the catalyst and the treated water depends on the achievement of a magnetic catalytic material which functions as simultaneously an effective visible light photocatalyst and an ORR active electrocatalyst, prepared using ETNs, reduced graphene oxide, iron oxide nanoparticles, and a polyelectrolyte PDDA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Because of the effective photodecomposition and magnetic capabilities of the catalyst, the photochemically cleaned water can be used as an appropriate solvent for ORR reaction. In addition, the catalyst prepared also possessed electrocatalytic activities, and can be used in both photocatalytic water treatment and ORRs. The catalyst was facilely prepared using a flocculation followed by a calcination process. Each component was indispensable in achieving the effective catalytic power, but the component each played different roles in the photocatalysis, magnetic recycling, and electrocatalysis processes. We hope that our report demonstrates a concept of designing multiple functional materials, which should hold high promise in recyclable applications of natural resources, including chemical products and polluted water.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The fabrication procedures of the magnetic composite photocatalyst and (<bold>b</bold>) schematic illustration of recyclable application of the photocatalytically cleaned water and the catalyst: MB-polluted water was first treated using the visible-light photocatalyst to decompose the organic dyes; subsequently the magnetic catalyst was collected using a magnet and the cleaned water was further used as an ORR solvent; the catalyst was also used as the electrocatalyst in the ORR.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_12504_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">Poly (diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride) (PDDA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Tech Co.

The three peaks at 284.8 eV (sp2 hybridized carbon in graphene oxide, C=C), 286.8 eV (carbon in hydroxyl and epoxide group, C-O), and 288.2 eV (carbonyl carbon, C=O)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> displayed clearly different relative intensities in the spectra of GO and in the catalyst.

This clear difference in relative peak intensities in GO and the catalyst indicate that GO was substantially reduced in the composite catalyst. The relative intensities of C-O, C=O, and C=C peaks instructed the reduction status of GO in the catalyst because only GO or rGO presented these groups, and other component in the composite catalyst -PDDA, titania nanosheets, magnetic particles- didn’t carry these groups.

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the magnetic composite catalyst displayed strong absorbance between 200 and 750 nm, covering almost entire UV-vis ranges. Beyond 750 nm, the absorbance gradually decreased and reached a minimum at as far as 1800 nm. Thus not only in the UV-vis range, but also in the NIR range, the composite catalyst absorbed light effectively. This large absorbance range made our composite photocatalyst quite unique as photocatalysts. The partially carbonized PDDA was believed to have contributed mostly to this unique absorbance characteristics and rGO assisted in elevation of the absorbance throughout UV-vis range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.

The repeated cycles of photocurrent generation and diminish cycles indicated effective light responsive nature of the composite photocatalyst. The superior light responsive properties were attributed to the existence of graphene, partially carbonized PDDA, and the magnetic particles. These three components facilitated electron transfer because of electron-withdrawing abilities (PDDA), electric conductive properties (rGO), and an appropriate band position (magnetic particles), and thus assisted in obtaining strong photocurrent intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

The results were consistent with electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis.</p><p id="Par21">The physical-chemical characterizations of the composite particles strongly suggested that these particles would present advantageous photocatalytic properties. The photocatalytic power of our composite particles was demonstrated using methylene blue (MB) catalytic degradation reaction. Commercial titania catalyst P25 and pristine exfoliated titania nanosheets were used as a reference for catalytic performance evaluations. Previous studies indicated that GO fractions in the composite particles strongly influenced the catalytic performance. Serial studies here indicated that GO fraction of 5% gave the optimized catalytic power (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the degradation efficiency of the composite magnetic photocatalysts (GO fraction 5%) clearly outperformed P25 and pristine titania nanosheets. When 99% MB absorbance was removed by our composite catalyst at 215 min, only 25% MB absorbance was removed by P25 and the pristine titania sheets hardly removed any MB absorbance. After the photocatalytic reaction, the composite catalyst could be removed from the mixture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and recycled taking advantage of its magnetic properties. In order to further investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, the trapping method was carried out to identify the catalytic active species. EDTA-2Na, p-benzoquinone (BQ) and isopropanol (IPA) were introduced to act as the scavengers of holes (h<sup>+</sup>) superoxide radicals (•O<sup>2−</sup>) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), respectively. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, the degradation performance of MB was severely impacted when BQ and IPA were added into the system. These results indicated that •O<sup>2−</sup> and •OH were the main active species under the visible light irradiation. And the photocatalytic activity of composite was almost unchanged by the addition of EDTA-2Na, indicating the holes were not the oxidative species. Based on the above information, the proposed mechanism of the photocatalytic process was that under visible light irradiation, the electron was exited from carbonated PDDA or GO, and then injected to the surface of titania nanosheet to form radicals (•O<sup>2−</sup> and •OH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>.

We stopped the reaction when the absorbance reached zero because the absorbance was frequently used as a viable indicator of the completion of the decomposition reaction. However, when we proceeded to test TOC of the residue solution, and obtained a high value of 64.7%, indicating the existence of organic residues in the treated water. The high TOC value highlighted the necessity to further study the possible applications of the degraded water, considering its possible toxicity. Propelled by this consideration, we proceeded to explore the application of the degraded water as a component of the ORR electrolyte.</p><p id="Par23">In order to demonstrate the possible application of the photo-catalytically treated water, we carried out electrochemical reductive reactions in a solution prepared using the treated water. We chose the electrochemical reduction reaction to demonstrate the application of the treated water because a variety of redox active species were believed to be able to contribute to the reductive electric current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> and the possible chemical residues in a photo-catalytically treated water should be allowed in such applications. The prepared composite catalyst was used as the cathode in the reductive reactions. The prepared catalyst was expected to possess ORR catalytic activity because of the existence of Iron oxide. Titania and the carbonized polymer as well as graphene should facilitate the electronic transfer and further enhance the ORR activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Although most studies regarding ORR focused on the development of catalyst, the component of the electrolyte is always a practical issue to be considered in experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. The influences of the electrolyte on Pt/C catalyst have been well documented, and were also studied for Fe-based catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These studies found that the ions in the electrolyte may decrease the ORR performance by blocking the active sites of the catalysts. Thus whether the degraded water can be used as the ORR electrolyte would be a practical issue to be verified. Compared with the solution saturated with Ar which presented only capacitance behavior, the oxygen-saturated electrolyte gave a clear reductive peak and remarkably higher current densities in CVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> inset), indicating that the composite catalyst performed as the catalyst cathode in ORR reaction. In the electrolyte saturated with oxygen, linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were used to study the electrochemical activities of the electrolyte, which should involve the electrochemical reduction of organic compounds and ORR activity. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10(a)</xref> the onset voltage of LSV in the MB-polluted electrolyte was higher than in the regular electrolyte prepared using the deionized water, but the value of the current density in the MB-polluted electrolyte was remarkably smaller (−3.4 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup>) than in the regular electrolyte (−4.2 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup>) at −1.0 v. The reductive current from the regular electrolyte should be provided by the ORRs. A higher onset voltage and a lower current density at −1.0 v in the MB-polluted electrolyte indicated that the reductive current was contributed by not only ORR but also the reduction of other compounds, possibly the organic dye MB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. However, at potentials negative than −0.55 v, the absolute value of the current density was remarkably smaller in the MB-polluted electrolyte than in the regular electrolyte, possibly due to the passivation of the catalyst electrode by the organic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. These results indicate that although the MB-polluted water provided larger types of reductive active species for the electrochemical reaction, the complex solution at the same time passivated the catalyst electrode, resulting in a compromised electrode performance. After photocatalytic decomposition, the treated water was used to prepare the electrolyte and in clear comparison to the previously mentioned electrochemical reactions in the MB-polluted electrolyte, the absolute value of the current density here was even larger than the one in the regular electrolyte. The possible reason for the increase of the current density might result from the existence of extra reactive active species after MB decomposition.

The concept was enabled by a catalytically bifunctional magnetic catalyst that can not only degrade organic dyes in solutions but is also electrochemically active and can catalyst ORRs. The MB solution after photocatalytic decomposition can be used to prepare electrolyte for ORRs. The cyclic use of the photocatalytically cleaned water and the bifunctional use of the composite catalyst should aid in environmental remedy. The catalyst was prepared using a facile “flocculation followed by calcination” strategy, and its multiple uses depended on the delicate choice of the components, each of which was indispensable in its catalytic activity, but each component played different roles in the photochemical, magnetic recycling, and electrochemical processes. Though the overall performance and the performance evaluation method should be further studied and developed for such a concept, we expect this report inspire the researches in the design of multiple application of a single material and provide a novel idea in environmental remedy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the NSFC (51572246), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2652013115, 2652015002, 2652015364), and China Scholarship council.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Q.Z., Y.H.Z. and Q.A. conceived and designed the experiments.
