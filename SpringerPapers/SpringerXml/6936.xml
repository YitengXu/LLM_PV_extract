For over two decades, synthesizing and processing materials at the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm in one dimension) has attracted government, academic, and private attention enticed by the promise of unique properties, including large-surface area, high-aspect-ratio, and highly anisotropic and tailorable electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as unique optical properties. These properties can be applied to prepare high-strength, lightweight, and multifunctional structures; novel sensors; and energy-storage systems with highly reliable environmental control capable of radiation shielding. Despite the level of effort, aerospace adoption of engineered nanomaterials remains tepid, a reflection of both the immaturity of the materials and the qualification costs and certification standards required by the industry and its customers.</p><p>Applications of advanced materials in aerospace are as broad as the industry. Global aircraft production is an approximately USD$200 billion/year enterprise, comprising about half of the yearly sales in aerospace and defense.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> Of that, industry groups estimate that raw materials comprise USD$12 billion of the industry’s costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> This can range all the way from bulk alloys of aluminum in the hundreds of millions of pounds to single-crystal nickel turbine blades. Research and development efforts in nanoscale materials match this application breadth. We have highlighted areas covering thermal protection, radiation protection, electronics and sensors, structural nanocomposites, and space propulsion. Reflecting their relative availability, many of the applications use carbon nanostructures (carbon nanotubes [CNTs] and graphene) and inorganic nanomaterials (silica and metal oxides).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Applications in aerospace</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>General</title><p>Engineered nanomaterials provide substantial improvements for structures and nonstructural components of almost all aeronautical and space systems. These include weight reduction; improved flexibility with maintained mechanical strength; multicomponent monitoring with redundant backup sensors; efficient power production, storage, and transmission; enhanced radiation protection for electronics and people; and sustainable life-support systems for long-duration exploration. We identify and highlight a few of the applications that are of interest to the aerospace and nanomaterials communities. Some of these applications are covered in further detail in the articles in this issue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Propulsion</title><p>Rocket science would appear to be a natural starting point for the application of engineered nanomaterials, in particular, solid rocket motor propellant. Enhanced reactivity and faster burn rates can be achieved from the higher specific surface area provided by nanoscale particles. However, a balance must be achieved between increased reactivity with safe and predictive handling and storage of the material. Any advantages offered by nanoscale particles can be offset by application of coatings or surfactants to stabilize, disperse, or prevent aggregation, thereby reducing the propellant weight fraction. Increases in the reactivity and enhanced burn rates were found for nanoscale aluminum, but agglomeration and increased reactivity under storage conditions were highlighted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> Evidence of hazards associated with this increased reactivity and the tendency for nanoparticles to agglomerate and thereby negatively affect performance were also reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> A rocket flight test using nanoscale aluminum particles and water ice fuel was achieved by The Pennsylvania State University and Purdue University in 2009.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> Since then, efforts to optimize the performance and safety of these nanoengineered fuels have continued.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref> The use of nanoscale particles to improve the performance of the aluminum-water combustion reaction may enable an important driver for aerospace materials, in particular for long duration space flight: <italic>in situ</italic> resource utilization (ISRU).

Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves—ripples in space time—in 1915, occurring as a result of events such as closely orbiting binary star systems, black hole mergers, and the aftermath of the Big Bang. To measure gravity waves, a satellite must be in a completely noise-free environment—even the solar pressure from the Sun must be eliminated.

To do this, it will use inertial sensors, a laser metrology system, a drag-free control system, and an ultraprecise micropropulsion system. The disturbance reduction system (DRS) will demonstrate that a solid body can float freely in space completely undisturbed. Ideally, the two test masses will follow a trajectory determined only by the local gravitational field. The spacecraft position must be continuously adjusted to stay centered about the test masses. In this way, the spacecraft essentially flies in formation with the test masses.</p><p>The ST7 DRS consists of clusters of micronewton thrusters that use sensor information to control actuation and thus keep the test masses completely isolated from external forces. These electrospray thrusters require a precision on the order of 100 nN to counteract the small disturbance forces in a very precise manner. The spacecraft therefore utilizes a CNT-based electron emitter from Busek Co. Inc. (Natick, Mass.) to serve as a low-power neutralizer for the electrospray thrusters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Power and energy</title><p>According to a 2014 report, the Deployable Space Systems of California developed a flexible solar array design that can unfurl in space to generate spacecraft power supplies and then retract for delicate maneuvers and docking to other spacecraft.

He notes the significant advances made over almost two decades of progress, while highlighting challenges such as synthesizing nanomaterials at scale and integration methods that preserve the properties and performance noted at the nanoscale toward bulk implementation. Meyyappan et al. review research and engineering progress made toward nanomaterials-enabled electronics and high-performance sensors whose small footprint, low power consumption, and radiation hardness make them highly suitable for space applications.</p><p>Recent advances made using CNTs toward fulfilling the two decade promise of superlightweight structural materials have rejuvenated hope of system-level benefits. Siochi and Harrison describe these advancements, along with remaining challenges. Thibeault et al.’s topic of materials for space radiation shielding is a prominent example of where the aerospace industry, and its various funding centers, will need to lead. Nanomaterials are seen as having great potential toward multifunctional materials solutions for protection from galactic cosmic radiation and solar particle events with their respective mix of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei.</p><p>In their article, Lozano et al. present a novel nanomaterial- and microelectromechanical-systems-enabled solution for ionic-liquid thrusters, in the realm of electric propulsion for space. Practical manufacturing schemes of nanoengineered materials are suggested for the implementation of microfabricated and nanostructured thruster arrays. The article by Puneet et al. covers an interesting area of controlled CNT architectures for thermal management applications in aerospace. They have identified a possible roll-to-roll nanomanufacturing process for energy-storage devices for aircraft. Finally, in the accompanying sidebars, Suraj Rawal and Jud Ready, respectively, highlight the pioneering integration of nanomaterials for electrostatic discharge applications on the Juno spacecraft that provided cost and schedule savings over traditional solutions, as well as other space missions incorporating interesting applications of nanomaterials in space and exploration programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Opportunities and challenges</title><p>Unlike other historical materials innovations catalyzed by aerospace and defense, such as carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers, innovation in nanomaterials is a global concern, with other commercial applications, such as medicine and energy, driving advancements. Nanotechnology leaders in the aerospace community have noted that for the industry to both drive and utilize nanomaterials, a new level of partnership among commercial, scientific, systems, and production engineering players is crucial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref> Funding from government sources such as defense science and technology programs, at least in the European and US context, is no longer the preeminent driver of advanced materials. The expectation that commercial and defense contractor internal research and development will be harnessed toward the development and integration of nanomaterials for aerospace uses is somewhat unrealistic. There is significant cost and risk in maturing advanced materials synthesis, processing, and application into a well-understood material, one produced at scale and at a price the market will adopt.</p><p>One potential solution to reducing development costs highlighted by Meador is innovative “materials-genome”-level modeling and simulation in concert with experimental testing and characterization methods that could reduce development and qualification costs. It is hoped that this modeling work will also assist in crossing the length scales of nanoengineered materials (i.e., more accurately translating modeled and experimentally verified performance into reality at the macroscale).</p><p>For the global aerospace industry to keep pace with, let alone lead, other commercial sectors in the adoption of nanoengineered materials, targeted and meaningful funding from sources that can accept the risk for the prospect of long-term potential benefits will still remain, for the most part, government-sponsored aerospace science and technology programs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Suraj Rawal and Jud Ready for their sidebar contributions to this article.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list id="BSec1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><italic>2015 Global Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook</italic> (Deloitte, New York, 2015).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zimm</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><source>Aerospace Supply Chain &amp; Raw Material Outlook</source><year>2014</year><publisher-loc>Fairfax, VA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>ICF International</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>De Luca</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Galfetti</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Severini</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Meda</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Marra</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Vorozhtsov</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Sedoi</surname><given-names>VS</given-names></name><name><surname>Babuk</surname><given-names>VA</given-names></name></person-group><source>Combust.
