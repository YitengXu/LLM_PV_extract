The exercise has been made for evaluating the effects of such process for the sustainability of the global economy and society. In this view, we explored how Keynes’ contribution could be useful for the global economy in building a new paradigm of socio-economic development underpinning the transition to circular economy (CE). We also evaluated the adoption of the Global Green New Deal including a case study of Italy for the purpose of suggesting how that topical political programme can be key in the CE transition. Given the urgency of environmental problems, we underline the importance of the adoption of Keynesian expansionary “green mission oriented” fiscal policies with the purpose of allowing the triggering of a virtuous circle of sustainable welfare involving the Green New deal and the transition to CE. At the basis of such virtuous circle, we propose a new paradigm based on a revisited Keynesian paradigm and models of economy within the framework of Genovesi’s “civil economy” that entails an active role and responsibility of all the societal actors (consumers, companies and institutions). In this view, the “spirit” of Keynes in the economy, policy and society could be appreciated once more and be extremely useful along with other scholars’ contributions in accelerating the CE transition and a more sustainable development.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Keynes</kwd><kwd>Circular economy</kwd><kwd>Expansionary fiscal

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Unprecedented and severe environmental problems such as resource scarcity and climate change are challenging worldwide economies, societal assets and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The Royal Swedish Academy of Science pointed out that “we can no longer discuss our economic future without considering the enormous costs of climate change” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">This provides further confirmation to the fact that climate change is strongly affecting the global economy and points out an urgent need to reduce the environmental costs of production and consumption activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and better integrate the environmental issues in economic theories and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Since the last century the environmental awareness towards such problems has progressively increased as showed by the recent mobilisation of the civil society, media and the attention of Governments and institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] also in this Covid-19 emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">However, the political efforts should be much higher, in particular in developed countries, towards implementing strategies that tackle the anthropogenic climate change, as well as for building resilience to the most severe impacts of climate change and environmental degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In this perspective sustainable patterns “must be sought on many different levels, and given the magnitude of the challenges the effects must be significant compared to the existing situation” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In the range of solutions and constraints, we would emphasise the importance of defining and framing the development model underpinning the circular economy (CE), coherently with other authors involved in this endeavour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Jackson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] points out that in developed countries the quantitative economic growth is no more needed to achieve well-being as Governments can achieve full employment, low inequality and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by changing the current linear model of economic growth. At this regard, given the increasing constraints posed by the natural environment, the role of public intervention in developed countries should be oriented in the promotion of new values and concepts at the basis of the growth model that are less consuming for the natural resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> given that a continued quantitative economic growth cannot be taken for granted and be limited by e.g., resource scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since the Rio Earth Summit (1992) it is clear that what is needed to move in this direction is an integrative and shared policy framework for sustainable development at national, subnational and international level capable of putting into practice strategies, programmes and initiatives based on public intervention and aimed at environmentally sound and sustainable economic growth and development in both developing and industrialised countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Indeed, the current and dominant linear model of development, at the global level, mainly oriented to the goal of a quantitative economic growth is based on the economic philosophy of neoliberalism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or new liberalism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] succeeded progressively since 1980s to the Keynesian philosophy<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>. The latter influenced strongly public thinking and policies in particular after the Second World War and was based on Keynes’s thought focused on the analysis of some of the causes of market failures at macro level and on macroeconomic policies as remedies to such failures. In this view, it supported expansionary fiscal policies favouring aggregate demand and the propensity to consume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Currently, for the latter issue, Keynes’s thought could be perceived and labelled as a representative of the linear model of production and consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in general as an “influencer” of consumerism after an economic crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To show this issue, we cite a recent article appeared on an Italian Newspaper last year after the lockdown. The author stated that: “I have no doubt. If John Maynard Keynes was alive, he would appear on TV to incite us to spend as much as possible as he did on the radio during the ‘Great Recession’”. The article recalled the Keynes thinking with the purpose of evidencing the increase of savings of Italian families during the lockdown and the importance of the Government to revitalise consumption and supporting the recovery of the real economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">We underline that Keynes’ promotion of consumption is associated to a particular historical period. No doubt Keynes’ theory of consumption supported the economic growth model in quantitative terms. He did not explore to a sufficient extent the environmental consequences of policies promoting the propensity to consume in spite of some of his papers started highlighting the rise of environmental problems linked to industrial growth around the 20s of the last century. However, his contribution should not be restricted to an issue of consumption in view of searching causes to contemporary challenges and solutions for the transition to sustainable development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Keynes contributed to evidence some of the limits of a market economy by finding solutions to the economic crisis and giving a new vigorous stimulus to the public intervention in social protection as an essential base for the modern welfare state in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As a result, the value of his contribution (including the theory of consumption) can be better understood only by means of an historical analysis involving the genesis of his theories (the Great Depression on 1929), the period of their wider application in political economy (after the Second World War) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] as well as the progressive replacement from the 70s with the rise of new theoretical models including the “monetarism” by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and later the rational expectations by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the neo-institutional view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and in general of a new paradigm (neoliberalism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nowadays, the latter is the dominant conceptual framework that governs the global economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">In this study, as a starting point of our research work, we will briefly explore the evolution of Keynesian thinking and paradigm. This overview is a base for building an original work focused on evidencing how the contribution by Keynes could be useful in the development of a new paradigm underpinning the CE. In this perspective, we explore the so-called “Global Green New Deal” or “Green Deal” launched by the European Union<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> as a kind of expansionary Keynesian fiscal policies. It identifies an orientation in public policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] for the development of a green economy. In this study, we emphasise such topical expansionary fiscal policies to accelerate the current CE transition. In that framework, we also explore the case of Italy, where the past Government announced that the Green Deal implementation in the country will reorient the whole productive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">On the bases of these premises, the structure of the paper is the following: the next section deals with the conceptual framework of the paper and with materials and methods used to analyse the data and information that we considered for the literature review of Keynes thinking and the case study of Global and Italian Green Deal. Moreover, this section briefly outlines the genesis and main features of Keynes’s theory, the adoption of Keynesian thinking in the post-World War II period as well as its progressive decline with the rise of the neoliberalism paradigm. The “<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Revisiting the Keynesian Paradigm in the Light of the Current Circular Economy Transition</xref>” section, in view of the progressive need for replacing the neoliberalism paradigm, revisit some aspects of the Keynes’ theory along with the contribution of recent theories more focused on the responsibility of societal actors such as citizens and companies as a mean for overcoming the limits of public choices. The “<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>” section deals with the potential contribution by Keynes for building and accelerating the transition to a new political, economic and social paradigm embedding the move to CE as well as discusses the main components of the Global and Italian Green Deal. Finally, the “<xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Conclusions</xref>” section concludes the study by summarising the key findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Conceptual Framework</title><p id="Par15">As evidenced previously, the study takes as a basis the analysis of the fundamentals of Keynes’ theory that signed, in particular in the post-World II War, the development of Keynesian paradigm in the economy, policy and society of industrialised countries. We also compared such paradigm with the paradigm of neoliberalism that currently dominates in the global society. In that, the main elements of Keynesian theory have been summarised by relying on his seminal work “The General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and existing several macroeconomics contributes whereas the evolution of the Keynesian paradigm has been investigated by performing an initial search on Web of Science<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> with the following keywords:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par17">Keynes AND new liberalism (period 1950–2020): 7 results (2 articles selected);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Keynes AND neoliberalism (time period 1950–2020): 16 results (2 articles selected);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Keynes AND sustainable development (2000–2020): 16 results (2 articles selected);</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par20">The relative low number of searched articles could be due to the fact that the investigated relationships are more concerned to political interests compared to the scientific research as well as that the topics are of recent evidence as showed by the date of publication of most of the studies that are after the years 2010. This is the period following the economic crisis of 2008.</p><p id="Par21">The search has been further expanded on the search engine “Google” where the same keywords have been used along with others such as “Keynesian paradigm and neoliberalism”, “neoliberalism”, “new liberalism”, “neoliberalism and welfare state”. Other searches have been performed on various Italian libraries, publishers and databanks as well as using cited articles from searched and selected articles. The main aim for the selection of the studies were the need for highlighting the main features of both paradigms and their differences also in the perspective of the existing multiple global challenges related to environmental and social problems as well as CE transition.</p><p id="Par22">The study also briefly evaluates the features and development of the Green Deal at the global level whereas in more detail the Italian Green Deal. For the purpose, the most recent data related to Global Green New Deal and in particular the data of renewable sources development coming from the IRENA last reports (years 2020; 2019; 2017) have been collected. The Italian Green Deal has been analysed by relying on documents of the Italian Government and Ministry of Environment, Territory and Seas, Ministry of Economic Development and Italian Advanced Institute of Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genesis of Keynes’ Theory Within the Challenge of Great Depression</title><p id="Par23">The most important Keynes’ work, “The general Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] has been published during the Great Depression, that continue to be considered by the historians the most dramatic economic downturn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], that shocked and affected the western capitalist countries (in particular US and Germany) in the late 1920s in a way that is unprecedented compared to other previous and subsequent crisis in the capitalist industrial system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">In such work, Keynes underlined the importance of the adoption in an economic crisis of anticyclical compensatory policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The crisis developed for about 10 years from 1929 to 1939 and was characterised by steep declines in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and industrial production, deflation<italic>,</italic> mass unemployment, banking panics, and sharp increases in rates of poverty and homelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In that period, the initial and weak measures of welfare state provided a few supports to the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The economic and social data about the magnitude of the crisis are particularly shocking and do not need comments to be understood: “In the United States, where the effects of the depression were generally worst, between 1929 and 1933 industrial production fell nearly 47 percent, GDP declined by 30 percent, and unemployment reached more than 20 percent. By comparison, during the Great Recession of 2007–09, the second largest economic downturn in U.S. history, GDP declined by 4.3 percent, and unemployment reached slightly less than 10 percent” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">It is not surprising that Keynes focused more on potential solutions to such impressive decline than to their environmental consequences. On the other hand, the environmental issue was “culturally” absent from the public opinion panorama and from the economic and political debate. Nevertheless, the analysis of Keynes thought to free trade reveals his awareness and critique towards the model of continued economic growth without limits as in one of his writings he wrote that: “The same rule of self-destructive financial calculation governs every walk of life. We destroy the beauty of the countryside because of the unappropriated splendours of nature have no economic value. We are capable of shutting off the sun and the stars because they do no pay a dividend ….

The absence of full employment of production factors and the arbitrary and unfair distribution of income and wealth were considered by Keynes the most relevant failures of the market economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Keynes’ contribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] deeply affected the mainstream classical thinking that based on the Say’s law (1803) considered that production generates its own a same amount of aggregate demand. The Say’s law, based on the “laissez-faire” thinking, focused on the capacity of a capitalist system to naturally approach full employment and prosperity without government intervention in the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. On the contrary, Keynes proposed the adoption of Governmental policies to support the aggregate demand as in the short run the demand affects the aggregate production (Blanchard, 2000).</p><p id="Par28">He showed that the normal case in an economy is the equilibrium of “underemployment” and that the volume of employment (or unemployment) depends on the level of effective people demand of goods and services. This evidences that e.g. the level of employment is decided on the market of goods and not in the market of labour as assumed by the classical economists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> The level of income depends on the amount of the aggregated demand that is the sum of consumption (private and public) and investments. In turn, consumption and the multiplier effect of the investments into the income depends on the propensity to consume (the more consumption grows, the more income increases). Indeed, according to Keynes, given that consumption generated by the private demand has a decreasing trend in industrialised countries due to the increasing savings propensity, the private consumption is insufficient in the short run to sustain the aggregate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Consequently, given that the level of income of full employment is not achievable by changes of the production factors prices (wages and interests), Keynes suggests that the increase of income and employment is possible only by an increase of the aggregate demand and in particular by an expansion of public spending and other policies aimed to redistribute wealth and support consumption and investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

The economic paradigm underpinning such good social and economic performances was centred on the advances of technological progress, wide adoption of labour division and the development of mass consumption markets thanks to the favourable prices of consumption goods. In this period the technological progress and exploitation of scales economies also lead to an increase of the size of the companies. In that, the high growth rate of aggregate supply was sustained by a relatively stable growth rate of aggregate demand. This last was achieved by both the consolidation of welfare state and the progressive State intervention in the economy as well as by the adoption of anticyclical Keynesian policies. The latter contributed to reduce the level of uncertainty in the economy encouraging the investments in plants and machineries encouraged by public investments. Moreover, income policies assured the positive adjustment of real wages following the achievements in the technological progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The progressive deregulation of the international trade increased the amount of exported manufactured goods from industrialised countries. The unemployment rate reduced in the post-war period due to the increase in the productivity of labour and in such way it would be possible to reach the full employment rate at the beginning of the 60s. This increased further wages, unit cost of labour as well as inflation. However, the adoption of policies aimed to reduce the rate of inflation were not able to achieve such goal and maintaining the full employment. These problems experienced by industrialised countries at different times caused at the beginning of the 70’ the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreements and the entire system of governance of the international economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The philosophy underlying the Agreements was based on the experience of the Great Depression of 1930s which features showed the need for regulating both the local and international markets. The monetary system introduced by Bretton Woods stated the rules for commercial and financial relations among the participating countries (USA, Canada, Western European countries, Australia and Japan) based on the central role of the US currency. The monetary system created was a gold exchange standard, with fixed exchange rates between currencies, all pegged to the dollar, which in turn was pegged to gold. The progressive trade liberalisation has been one of the pillars of the Agreements which functioning should comply with other international agreements promoted by the United Nations and its divisions (such as UNESCO, ILO, OMS, UNEP, UNDP) with the purpose of achieving social, humanitarian, health and environmental goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The collapse of Bretton Woods Agreements remarkably changed the principles of the governance of the global development as well as within the national economies in the coming years. The economic and political paradigm progressively moved from the Keynesian model to a completely different paradigm (so-called neoliberalism) incorporating the theories and research of scholars of the Chicago School of Economics such as Friedman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and later Lucas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The neoliberalism paradigm was centred on the market as the best institutional form of organisation of economic activities for the achievement of individual and social welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and on monetarism that involved in policies a strict control of the inflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Palley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] evidences that in industrialised countries, in neoliberalism period, the economic agenda has been dominated by policies following the “U.S. model” that involved: “deregulation of financial markets, privatization, weakening of institutions of social protection, weakening of labor unions and labor market protections, shrinking of government, cutting of top tax rates, opening of international goods and capital markets, and abandonment of full employment goals, all under the guise of the natural rate. International economic policy has been dominated by the ‘Washington Consensus,’ which advocates privatization, free trade, export-led growth, financial capital mobility, deregulated labor markets, and policies of macroeconomic austerity” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These policies produced devastating effects in some cases (e.g., financial crisis in Mexico, South-East Asia, Brazil, Russia, Argentina) and an increase of the unemployment and poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">A general criticism that is made to the Keynesian approach lies in the fact that the market demand is determined from above by an invisible hand that knows the needs of people better than people themselves. The Keynesian paradigm was criticised from within by other neo-classical theory-oriented models which contributed to evidence the limits of the market. The neo-institutional theory highlighted that the market failures caused by externalities (e.g. air and water pollution are negative externalities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], asymmetric information (in turn due to uncertainty, opportunism, and bounded rationality of the individuals) and monopolies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] can be tackled by direct bargaining between private actors, vertical integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], collaborative relationships among firms and the formation of social capital based on interpersonal and social trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In this view, Westlund [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] highlighted the key role played by civil society and social capital, which resides in institution (industry, public body) and other organisations. Indeed, the neo-institutional view also represents a critic to the neoliberalism approach whereas in the former the environment (and the market) is regulated by a set of social and legal norms and rules instead that pure market mechanisms.</p><p id="Par36">Another criticism about the market failure notion has been represented by the public choice school of economics. The latter has had great impact on contemporary reforms of the public sector, replacing the Keynesian economics logics themselves that expanded the public service sector. The public choice approach has led to seeking to replace governments with markets to challenge or remedy market failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In social practice, further critics have been raised by James [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in his book where he questions the capacity of capitalism to have fulfilled its expectations made in the early 1980s. As a matter of fact, the achievement of a pleasant life filled with beautiful things paved the way with “anxiety, job insecurity, frustration, difficulty getting to the end of the month, human relations deteriorated and by the pressures of an increasingly devoted to consumerism”. These words well capture the perspective offered by the new liberalism having its emphasis on the absolute autonomy of the individual that rejects any idea of responsibility “of one individual toward the other, of the State toward individuals, and even of individuals towards themselves” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Revisiting the Keynesian Paradigm in the Light of the Current Circular Economy Transition</title><p id="Par38">Within the history of economic thought, the Keynesian can be considered an evolution of the classical liberalism thought.

This does not imply that the cures to the market failures should only find a solution in more public intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The abuses that occurred in this regard in the 1960s translated into cases of conflict of interest and excessive bureaucracy in the provision of public services. These are still current problems that affect negatively the global economies. Consequently, an excess of deregulation should not be followed by an excess of State intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

The adoption of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies are aimed to the improvement of the environmental performances in terms of more cleaner and sustainable products and processes as well as that take into account the impacts on wellbeing of all the stakeholders (e.g. employees, local and global communities, animal welfare etc.). The attention to stakeholders’ impacts date backs to the seminal research work “Strategic Management: A stakeholder approach” by Freeman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] who defined the stakeholders as “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organisation’s objectives” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. It is interesting to note that the management of the impacts to the stakeholders by the companies involves the allocation of resources to CSR strategies with the final goal of achieving “win-win” results, in the medium-long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. On the other hand, it does not mean that managers can manipulate stakeholders to reach the most favourable trade-offs. “Stakeholder management aims to allocate resources adequately given the outcome of prospective scenarios; it also aims to repair previous damages traditionally left to society’s kind-heartedness, which are referred to as ‘externalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]”.</p><p id="Par49">The strategies and goals of CSR can be introduced in the conventional companies mainly perceiving goals of economic efficiency (profits) or by modifying their legal framework to achieve other goals than economic efficiency as in the case of benefit corporations or economy of communion, born in Brazil on the experience by Chiara Lubic on 1991 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The first commits to create public benefits and sustainable value in addition to profits (e.g. agree to have lower profits to favour the social climate and relationships with the employees) whereas the economy of communion requires the companies to split the profits into three parts: development of the company, cultural training of employees and support to poor people.

The final goal of this change in V Programme in stimulating the involvement and the interplay between these economic actors (and in the employment of a broader range of instruments which will include, in particular, market-related incentives) is balancing the short-term benefit of individuals, companies and administrations and the longer-term benefits of society as a whole.</p><p id="Par52">However, the adoption of more responsible patterns of production, consumption and living is not an easy task to initiate given the gap between the costs and the perceived (environmental) benefits in adopting such patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The recognition of the gap is a key to put into practice the virtuous circle at the base of the “civil economy” and the related movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] as it is a potential cause of blocking or slowing the transition to CE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].

In the classical liberalism, e.g. Adam Smith (the father of liberalism) foresaw an active role of the State in the economy and its intervention in the provision of a specific legislation (e.g. he recommended a reform of agrarian contracts), or essential public services for the society and its development such as primary public education as well as in avoidance monopolies in the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Contrary to environmental economics that have been mainly concentrated on market instruments to correct the environmental externalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], the ecological economists placed their critical analysis on the complex interplay between the natural ecosystems and the economy, on the concept of limits of the natural environment, on an intrinsic value of nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. On a macroeconomics perspective Spash and Schandl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] introduced the analysis of economic growth and environment, arguing that the approach by Post-Keynesian economics has similarities to the one of ecological economics but differs with the regard to the concept of “growth” that is not envisioned within the limits of natural environment. On the contrary, they underline that Keynes considered “capital accumulation as a means to an end not an end in itself”, evidencing that it was a temporary measure. “Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still.

The highest daily values of cumulated rainfall have been recorded in the year 2018 in three Italian regions (Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Calabria) in October where in some days (4th, 27th, 28th) the cumulated rainfall ranged between 300 and 400 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>].</p><p id="Par100">The Climate decree devotes financial resources to a wide range of measures (some of them are summarised in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) in the forms of incentive, voucher, funds intended for example to sustainable public and private mobility, reforestation, green corners, reduction of plastic and waste, improvement of air quality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par101">This study briefly analysed the evolution of the Keynesian paradigm for the purpose of highlighting its main features and how it could be useful in view of the CE transition and the need for facing the global multiple challenges related to the environment, energy and food. The Keynesian paradigm mainly adopted in industrialised countries (such as in Europe) after the Second World War lead to the creation of the welfare state and a period of high economic growth, employments rates and increased well-being in a context of growing use of natural resources. Moreover, in such period at international level important agreements have been promoted by the United Nations with the purpose of achieving social, humanitarian, health and environmental goals. The Keynesian paradigm has been progressively replaced since 1980s by the neoliberalism paradigm that redesigned the State intervention in the economies of industrialised countries to a idifferent extent as well as the governance of social, humanitarian, health and environment issues at the global level. The central feature of the neoliberalism is the strong focus on the market economy as a mean to satisfy the wellbeing of the society without considering the resource constraints. However, the wellbeing of the society depends on many goods and services that do not have a market price such as the environmental quality, a decent job, healths, housing and educational systems and so on. This calls for the urgent adoption of a new paradigm underlying the current cultural, economic, environmental, political and social landscapes. We emphasised a model of economy underpinning CE transition based on a revised Keynesian paradigm that implies a redesign of the current role of the State intervention as well as the role of responsible consumers, companies and institutions with the purpose of creating a virtuous cycle between these three fundamental actors. Given the dominant neoliberalism paradigm and its limits, such “virtuous cycle” can be triggered and implemented only by a political intervention as civil responsibility actions and practices are costly. This explains why the number of responsible consumers and companies is still low and is not able to widen their share on the basis of their market power. However, the reliance of an active role and a higher responsibility of the consumers and companies is essential to assure that the political intervention occurs according to the social, environmental and economic goals. In our view, in such a framework the Green New Deal that we evaluated as a kind of Keynesian expansionary policy has the potential to break the wall of the neoliberalism paradigm and create the bases for the “virtuous circle of the sustainable welfare” which also involve and trigger the transition to a circular economy and in general a more sustainable wellbeing within the limits of the natural environment. Nowadays, Keynes famous sentence “The government should pay people to dig holes in the ground and then fill them up” should be revisited “The Government should pay people to dig holes and plant trees instead of filling simply them up again”.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Università Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

At this time the wide spread unemployed workers, machines, and immense surplus stocks of coal above ground and other raw materials, were apparent for all to see. He suggested that the government rather than run surpluses or balance budgets prepare to run a deficit .... a proposal against all canons of sound finance of neoclassic doctrines. It is important to recognise that during the interwar period when Keynes was most prolific, the economy was afflicted by persistent under-use of virtually all real resources. It was therefore reasonable to assume the supply of labor, capital, and raw materials were in great abundance given the high degree of under employment that obviously existed. Thus, a small increase in price would bring onto the market any amount of real resources of capital, raw materials, fuel and labor necessary.</p></fn><fn id="Fn6"><label>6</label><p id="Par39">The new liberalism shared with the classical liberalism the features of individual autonomy, private property, and limited government intervention (Furner, 2001).</p></fn><fn id="Fn7"><label>7</label><p id="Par44"><ext-link xlink:href="http://treccani.it/enciclopedia/l-economia-civile_" ext-link-type="uri">http://treccani.it/enciclopedia/l-economia-civile_</ext-link>(Il-Contributo-italiano-alla-storia-del-Pensiero:-Economia)/</p></fn><fn id="Fn8"><label>8</label><p id="Par46"><ext-link xlink:href="https://sfenvironment.org/consumer-responsibility" ext-link-type="uri">https://sfenvironment.org/consumer-responsibility</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="Fn9"><label>9</label><p id="Par58">For a comprehensive review of the value of nature and the contribution of the different scholars from pre-classical, classical, neoclassical and environmental economics until the years 2000 see Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010.</p></fn><fn id="Fn10"><label>10</label><p id="Par64">Even if the concept date backs to the 1930s where there were also the initial political and social responses (such as the creation of International Labour Organization, ILO) to the liberal tradition and “laissez-faire” ideology.</p></fn><fn id="Fn11"><label>11</label><p id="Par85"><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.fotovoltaiconorditalia.it/mondo-fotovoltaico/sviluppo-fotovoltaico-benefici-occupazione" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.fotovoltaiconorditalia.it/mondo-fotovoltaico/sviluppo-fotovoltaico-benefici-occupazione</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="Fn12"><label>12</label><p id="Par87"><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.fotovoltaiconorditalia.it/idee/quanto-costa-elettricita-prodotta-da-fotovoltaico" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.fotovoltaiconorditalia.it/idee/quanto-costa-elettricita-prodotta-da-fotovoltaico</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="Fn13"><label>13</label><p id="Par97"><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.minambiente.it/comunicati/decreto-clima-un-primo-importante-passo-contrastare-i-cambiamenti-climatici" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.minambiente.it/comunicati/decreto-clima-un-primo-importante-passo-contrastare-i-cambiamenti-climatici</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group></back></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Applied Science, multidisciplinary</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environment</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environmental Economics</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Science, multidisciplinary</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Sustainable Development</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Waste Management/Waste Technology</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"><facet-value count="1">Circular economy</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Expansionary fiscal policies</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Green new deal</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Keynes</facet-value></facet><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">Circular Economy and Sustainability</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2021</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"><facet-value count="1">China</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Italy</facet-value></facet><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
