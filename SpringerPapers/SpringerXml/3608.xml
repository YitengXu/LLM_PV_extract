For this, an electron balance method was developed using the chemical oxygen demand concept to quantitatively analyze the partitioning of nutrient electrons into H<sub>2</sub>, cell biomass, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and soluble microbial products (SMP). Overall, these four electron sinks were accounted for greater than 85% of the electrons provided by the nutrients. Glucose, lactate, succinate, fumarate, and pyruvate were individually provided as the main carbon source, and in all cases, glutamate was provided as a nitrogen source in order to enhance H<sub>2</sub> production. About 25–35% of the electrons ended up in H<sub>2</sub> during growth, while up to 60% of the electrons partitioned into H<sub>2</sub> in some stationary phase cultures. The other two major electron sinks in the growth phase were cell mass and PHB, while in stationary phase, SMP were accounted for &gt;30% of the substrate electrons utilized. In general, the largest portion of SMP comprised low-molecular weight (&lt;3 kDa) compounds mostly produced during stationary phase, although larger-size molecules were also detected in both phases. Overall, the fractions of electrons that partitioned into H<sub>2</sub> (0.21 to 0.35) and PHB (0.06 to 0.21) were highly correlated with the standard free energy change of the substrate oxidation half-reaction equation, normalized per electron equivalent. In a PHB(−) mutant, electron redistribution increased H<sub>2</sub> production, the extent of which depended on the carbon source provided.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biofuel</kwd><kwd>Hydrogen</kwd><kwd>Electron balance</kwd><kwd>PHB mutant</kwd><kwd><italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2009</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12155_2009_Article_9072.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Genetics and Genomics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Breeding/Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Ecology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Wood Science &amp;

Strategies to achieve efficient biological routes for the production of these fuels require not only an understanding of the pathways by which cells partition the carbon skeletons and reducing power needed for fuel production, but also knowledge about the competing processes that detract from biofuel production. Using H<sub>2</sub> as a model biofuel, we are interested in determining how cells partition available reducing power into different electron-accepting pathways. The goal of these studies is to identify competing pathways that can potentially be eliminated to optimize H<sub>2</sub> production.</p><p>Biologically based H<sub>2</sub>-producing systems have the potential to reduce the amount of fossil fuels used for the fertilizer, chemical, petroleum, or steel industries, since H<sub>2</sub> synthesis for their use accounts for approximately 10% of the national fossil fuel use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, about 95% of the current global H<sub>2</sub> is produced by individual industries to satisfy their own needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Such a decentralized production approach is an attractive model for the implementation of biological H<sub>2</sub> production technologies.</p><p>The biological sources of H<sub>2</sub> currently under consideration include both fermentative and photosynthetic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Among the photosynthetic microbes already known to produce H<sub>2</sub> are photoheterotrophic bacteria, which have the ability to simultaneously use energy derived from light and organic compounds to drive H<sub>2</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and therefore, can be used to develop solar-driven biofuel production processes for the utilization of renewable organic substrates in a biofuel economy. In addition, the potential for recycling organic waste into H<sub>2</sub> via photoheterotrophic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or a combination of dark and light fermentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] has also been advocated, potentially leading to on-site reutilization of organic wastes by industries that currently use H<sub>2</sub> produced from nonrenewable resources.</p><p>In this study, we quantitatively determined the fate of electrons in H<sub>2</sub>-producing batch cultures of the purple nonsulfur bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> during growth and stationary phases. <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> is known to catalyze light- and nutrient-powered H<sub>2</sub> production at significant rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Past studies of H<sub>2</sub> production by this and other related bacteria have implicated nitrogenase activity as a source of this compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, genetic and genomic techniques are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and can be used to test predictive models for how individual pathways impact the flow of reducing power to H<sub>2</sub>.

Thus, our work sought to develop methods to assess the partitioning of reducing power into H<sub>2</sub> production when wild type or mutant strains were provided light and different organic substrates.

Cultures to be analyzed were inoculated by transferring 200 μL of photosynthetically grown cells into test tubes (∼21 mL total volume) with 20 mL of fresh medium containing the same carbon source.</p><p>Photosynthetic cells were grown at 30°C continuously illuminated by an incandescent light source that produced approximately 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as measured with a Yellow–Springs–Kettering model 6.5-A radiometer through a Corning 7–69 filter. Cell turbidity was monitored using a Klett–Summerson photoelectric colorimeter (Klett MFG Co., NY). Turbidity readings were converted to colony-forming units per milliliter using previously described conversion factors for photosynthetic cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>To measure the amount of gas produced, cultures were capped gastight with a rubber septum and the 1-mL headspace connected to an AER-200 respirometer (Challenge Technology, Springdale, AR) via a needle (≥20 G) and either 3/32-in. Tygon FTM tubing provided by the manufacturer or 2.06-mm Masterflex Viton extension tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). The data acquisition and control software for the respirometer was set to anaerobic mode, during which, the number of bubbles passing through the unit was recorded in real time and converted to volume (milliliter) using factory-derived calibration constants.</p><p>Two or three cultures (biological replicates) were sampled at different phases of growth and gas production. For the analysis of gas composition, ∼3–7 mL of gas was removed from the culture headspace. Subsequently, 2 mL of culture was sampled and immediately frozen for total COD analysis, while the remaining culture was centrifuged (6,000 rpm, 12 min, 4°C). The supernatant was filtered through 0.2-μm syringe filters, and the filtered supernatant and cell pellets were immediately frozen and stored for analysis of SMP and PHB, respectively.

A flame ionization detector (FID) (set at 200°C) coupled to a methanizer (380°C) and a thermal conductivity detector (100°C) were used for measuring CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The column oven temperature was 60°C. Argon was used as the carrier gas. For quantification, a standard of 80% H<sub>2</sub> and 20% CO<sub>2</sub> (Airgas, Carol Stream, IL) and a Scotty 48 standard (Scotty Specialty Gases, Plumsteadville, PA) were used. The FID–methanizer system was capable of detecting volatile organic compounds such as ethylene, formic acid, and ethanol, although no significant amounts of these compounds were observed from the culture headspace samples tested (data not shown). Peaks for H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub> gases were typically detected, with the latter two being derived from small amounts of air introduced during the processing of samples from the cultures. A correction was therefore applied to calculate the H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure in the cultures by removing the contributions of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. The amount of H<sub>2</sub> produced was calculated as the average H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure during a batch times the total gas volume quantified by the respirometer.</p><p>Organic acids in culture supernatants were quantified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS; GC-2010 gas chromatograph coupled to a QP-2010S mass spectrometer detector; Shimadzu Scientific) after derivatization with methyl chloroformate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and using benzoic acid methyl ester (BAME) as an internal standard. The carrier gas was helium, and the GC column was a SHRXI-5MS (Shimadzu Scientific). The temperatures for column oven, injection, ion source, and interface were set at 60°C, 180°C, 220°C, and 275°C, respectively. Standards of known concentrations were used to generate calibration curves for the quantification of identified peaks.</p><p>Sugar analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (model 10A-vP equipped with an RID-10A refractive index detector, Shimadzu Scientific) using operational settings established by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Briefly, freeze-dried cell pellets were weighed, digested overnight in acidified methanol and chloroform at 105°C, mixed with deionized water to induce phase separation, and analyzed by GC–MS. Column oven and injection temperatures were set at 50°C and 210°C, respectively. PHB quantification was based on a PHB standard (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and with BAME as an internal standard.

For example, the moles of O<sub>2</sub> required for the complete oxidation of 1 mol of lactic acid (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) can be calculated from Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref> to be equal to 3 mol of O<sub>2</sub>. Since the molecular weight of O<sub>2</sub> is 32 mg/mmol, the theoretical COD of lactic acid is 96 mg COD per millimole. Since the lactic acid experiments had an initial concentration of 39.5 mM, this corresponds to 3,800 mg COD per liter. Glutamic acid (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>N), the nitrogen source in all experiments, also contributes to the initial COD in the cultures. From Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref> follows that 4.5 mol O<sub>2</sub> is required for the complete oxidation of 1 mol of glutamic acid. Thus, the theoretical COD of glutamic acid is 144 mg COD per millimole, and since 8.1 mM of glutamic acid was used in all experiments, this corresponds to approximately 1,200 mg COD per liter. Consequently, the targeted initial COD in the medium, for all experiments, was about 5,000 mg/L. For PHB, a theoretical COD of 144 mg COD per millimole of monomer (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was calculated. For H<sub>2</sub>, the theoretical COD is 16 mg COD per millimole.</p><p>For mixed or unknown organic material, the COD cannot be calculated from Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>, but can be obtained experimentally.

Individual growth curves were fit to a single Gompertz sigmoid function (cell density = <italic>a</italic> (exp (<italic>b</italic> (exp (<italic>ct</italic>)))) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], where <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, and <italic>c</italic> are functional constants, and <italic>t</italic> is time) by adjusting the time variable and finding a unique set of constants that defined a characteristic shape of the growth curve for the entire set of cultures. The best-fitting sigmoid curves were in good agreement with experimental data (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.99), which meant that individual growth profiles had similar shapes, and thus, the fitting could be used to synchronize these individual profiles within the same time frame, irrespective of the phase differences between cultures (i.e., because of variations in the lag phase). This procedure allowed the definition of five specific points in the growth curve in which electron partitioning was analyzed. These sampling points are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, which shows growth and gas production results for a lactate-fed set of batch cultures. The first sampling point was at the onset of gas production and coincided with midexponential growth (designated as me). The second was shortly after the transition from exponential to arithmetic growth and was defined as a postexponential (pe) sampling point. The third sampling point was at the beginning the stationary (st) phase and was characterized by having the maximum gas production rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Samplings in the middle of the stationary (mst) phase and at the end of batch (eob), when gas production stopped, completed the set of sampling points.

The COD profiles of the lactate-grown culture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) indicated that about two thirds of lactate electrons had been utilized by the end of the growth phase (st point), and that the end of growth corresponded to the point where glutamate, the nitrogen source, was nondetectable. The remaining lactate was consumed by the cells during stationary phase. The difference between the measured soluble COD in the media and COD from the remaining carbon and nitrogen sources corresponded to SMP accumulation (see below for SMP analysis). In the case of lactate, SMP accumulation occurred mostly during stationary phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).</p><p>In addition to soluble COD, H<sub>2</sub> evolved from the culture and biomass accumulation was quantified at each sampling point. For the calculation of COD from H<sub>2</sub>, the gas composition was measured at regular intervals, and an average for the entire experiment was derived (e.g., H<sub>2</sub> represented 87 ± 3% of the evolved gas in lactate-fed cultures). The PHB component of the biomass was quantified separately, to complete COD calculations for all four major electron sinks depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the cumulative amount of electrons directed toward H<sub>2</sub> production continuously increased, with 55% of the total produced during the growth phase and the rest in the stationary phase. Cell synthesis and PHB were important electron sinks only during the growth phase, while the importance of SMP in the electron balance significantly increased in the stationary phase. Furthermore, COD<sub>other</sub> was less than 15% of the utilized COD for all time points, indicating that we can quantitatively account for most of the electrons derived from media components by measuring the products included in the study.

The phases are defined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, as the postexponential growth phase (PEGP) and the stationary phase (STP). Notably, PEGP was characterized by a somewhat steady rate of H<sub>2</sub> production at the single cell level, as the rate of gas evolution per cell and the percentage of H<sub>2</sub> in the gas train did not vary significantly during this period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The electron partitioning in each phase was calculated by subtracting the COD values at the beginning point of each region from those at the end, and standard deviations were recalculated using standard error propagation techniques. During PEGP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), biomass production was the main electron sink, followed by H<sub>2</sub> and PHB production. During STP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), biomass formation was generally negligible, and the main electron sinks were H<sub>2</sub> and SMP. One exception to this generalization is the relatively large fraction of electrons accumulated in PHB by stationary phase cells in the glucose-fed culture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), while in cultures fed with organic acids, net formation of PHB occurred only during growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). The negative values in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> indicate product consumption rather than formation, and therefore, a general trend in the stationary phase was the utilization of small amounts of biomass and PHB as electron donors, except for the glucose culture, as explained above. Also, the net loss of SMP in PEGP by the pyruvate-fed culture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) indicates a large production of SMP before the initiation of PEGP in this particular culture.

The biogas composition was similar in all cultures (average H<sub>2</sub> content of 87 ± 3%), but the amount of gas accumulated and the gas production rates per cell depended highly on the substrate. When the fraction of electrons going to H<sub>2</sub> at each phase is normalized with respect to the amount of electron donors consumed (f<sub>H2</sub> in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the organic acid-fed cultures show a higher utilization of H<sub>2</sub> as electron sink in stationary phase than in the growth phase, but the glucose-fed culture shows by far the smallest partitioning of electrons into H<sub>2</sub> in stationary phase, which correlates with the observed PHB accumulation during stationary phase in this culture. Thus, from the perspectives of maximizing H<sub>2</sub> production, PHB formation seems to be an important competing electron sink during growth phase in all the cultures, but in the glucose-fed culture, PHB is also a competing electron sink during stationary phase.

In this study, we applied COD-based approaches to quantify electron fate during H<sub>2</sub> production by the photosynthetic microbe <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>. However, the assays and approaches described in this paper are applicable to other types of biofuel production by this and other microbes provided that electron donors and acceptors are either directly converted to COD units, or indirectly quantified in COD units by measuring products of their reactions.</p><p>During anoxic growth of photoheterotrophic organisms, reduced compounds present in the growth medium are the major source of electrons, as light energy capture is a cyclic process with no net electron gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, by measuring the gaseous, liquid, and solid products of photoheterotrophic activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we were able to calculate an overall mass balance of electrons after converting the measurements to the common unit of COD. The unaccounted proportion of electrons (i.e., f<sub>other</sub> in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was generally 0–15%, indicating that the electron sinks considered in our conceptual model were the major ones.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Comparison of H<sub>2</sub> Production by Growing and Resting Cells</title><p>H<sub>2</sub> production by cultures of photoheterotrophic bacteria has been explored using resting or immobilized cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to eliminate biomass formation as a competing reaction. However, to develop continuous flow H<sub>2</sub>-producing bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], a growing culture is needed so biomass is a significant competing electron sink. By comparing electron partitioning analysis during growth and stationary phases (i.e., PEGP and STP regions defined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), our analysis provides a direct comparison of biofuel production efficiency during each stage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It is evident from our results that the efficiency of fuel production depends not only on the growth conditions, but also on the ultimate aim of the process to be engineered. For instance, although the highest rate of H<sub>2</sub> production is achieved at the end of exponential growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), electron partitioning into this fuel is still relatively low at this stage (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) since biomass production is a major competitor. In contrast, the fraction of electrons routed to H<sub>2</sub> is higher in stationary phase, while production rates follow a decreasing trend as one or more nutrients becomes limiting. Thus, if the goal is to maximize H<sub>2</sub> production rates, flow-through bioreactors with a capacity for high cell concentrations might be desirable, even though light penetration might be a concern with photosynthetic microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, if the goal is to maximize the conversion of one or more renewable substrates to H<sub>2</sub>, immobilized nongrowing cultures are predicted to be optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

In that case, the electron balance of the entire experiment, including growth and stationary phases, may be a better guide for process design, although the discovery that a significant fraction of electrons can be partitioned to SMP suggests a limit in the removal efficiency of organic substrates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Correlations of H<sub>2</sub> and PHB Production with Free Energy of Organic Substrates</title><p>Analysis of our data allows two noteworthy correlations regarding electron partitioning in various cultures, which could potentially lead to a new approach for predicting H<sub>2</sub> and PHB formation in photoheterotrophic cultures as a function of the organic substrate. Firstly, the fraction of electrons partitioned into H<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) inversely correlate with the free energy changes of the electron donor half-reactions, on a per electron equivalent basis (<italic>r</italic> = −0.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These free energy values were calculated based on free energies of formation of individual species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] for a stoichiometrically balanced half-reaction normalized per unit of electrons transferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The correlation suggests that electron partitioning into H<sub>2</sub> could be predicted by the free energy change in the degradation of the substrate to a common oxidized intermediate, rather than the initial oxidation state of the substrate. Indeed, while lactate and glucose have the same oxidation state, they were on the opposite ends of the H<sub>2</sub> production spectrum. Secondly, the fraction of electrons going to PHB is also related to free energy changes of the substrate half-reactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), in this case with a positive correlation (r = 0.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, the sum of f<sub>H2</sub> and f<sub>PHB</sub> was nearly constant (0.42 ± 0.02) over the five different carbon sources, as can be inferred from the slopes of H<sub>2</sub> and PHB lines, whose absolute values are almost identical (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Thus, the inverse relationship in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> clearly shows the competing nature of PHB and H<sub>2</sub> formation for substrate electrons, although the mechanisms behind this competition and the free energy relationships are not clear. In contrast, there was no obvious correlation between SMP production and substrate free energy (<italic>r</italic> = 0.25, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.65), possibly reflecting the diverse chemical nature of the SMP pool observed with different organic substrates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

However, the magnitude of the effect of blocking PHB synthesis on biofuel production depended on the substrate being utilized. For lactate, the net gain in H<sub>2</sub> production by the PHB mutation was 7%, compared to H<sub>2</sub> production in wild-type cultures (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Overall, the electron flux that was deviated from PHB was captured in H<sub>2</sub> production (33% of electron flux), cell synthesis (44%), and SMP (22%). For glucose, there was a 30% higher H<sub>2</sub> production in the PHB(−) mutant (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, only 24% of the electron flux originally going to PHB in the wild-type cells contributed to increased H<sub>2</sub> production in the PHB(−) mutant, as SMP was the most significant electron sink, receiving 52% of the deviated electron flux. The remaining flux corresponded to cell synthesis (9.5%) and an increase in the unaccounted COD<sub>other</sub> fraction.</p><p>Electron partitioning of the PHB(−) mutant was also analyzed during PEGP and STP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the lactate-fed PHB(−) mutant culture, the absolute values of H<sub>2</sub> COD, as compared to those of the wild type, did not reflect the elimination of PHB production during growth and lack of electrons from PHB degradation during stationary phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This can be explained by considering the different amounts of total COD utilized during PEGP and STP in the cultures. When the total COD was used to normalize data, the fraction of H<sub>2</sub> electrons in PHB(−) mutant was more than that in wild type during PEGP and less during STP (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), as expected.</p><p>In the growth phase of the glucose-fed mutant cultures, there were approximately twofold increases in gas production rate and in H<sub>2</sub> accumulation compared to glucose-fed wild-type cultures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Accordingly, the fraction of glucose utilized during PEGP by the PHB(−) mutant increased significantly. During the stationary phase, the PHB(−) mutant yielded less H<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), despite the fact that PHB formation was a significant competing electron sink for the wild-type culture in this phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This decrease is consistent with substrate utilization during growth, as less glucose was available at the initiation of the stationary phase in the PHB(−) mutant culture.</p><p>The increased H<sub>2</sub> production in the PHB(−) mutant cultures was comparable to H<sub>2</sub> production by wild-type cultures fed with pyruvate or fumarate (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This is important since biofuel production processes might use mixed organic acids for photoheterotrophic H<sub>2</sub> production, following a dark fermentation step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this case, the benefit of utilizing a PHB(−) mutant would be small, since H<sub>2</sub> production by wild-type cells is already high when fed organic acid substrates. On the contrary, the benefit of eliminating PHB accumulation would be more important during direct photoheterotrophic conversion of sugars to H<sub>2</sub>, because of the lower H<sub>2</sub> production from sugars by the wild-type cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>SMP as a Major Electron Sink</title><p>A surprising finding in this study was the observation that SMP can be a major electron sink, thus taking a large amount of reducing power away from biofuel production, especially in resting cells. SMP accumulation was shown to be considerably larger than PHB formation, and therefore, a logical target for further attempts to optimize H<sub>2</sub> production would be the control of genetic and metabolic systems that lead to SMP production. Under the conditions described in this study, only a small fraction of the SMP corresponded to common metabolites such as lactate and TCA cycle intermediates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and most remained unidentified low or high (&gt;3 kDa) molecular weight material. In general, there is a fundamental lack of knowledge regarding SMP formation during photoheterotrophic growth, and in addition to the products identified in this study, formate is the only other organic acid that has been described as a byproduct of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> photoheterotrophic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], although this compound was not detected in any of the cultures in this study.</p><p>It is possible that the large fraction of high-molecular weight unidentified SMP could be extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are known to play a major role in cell aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Although cell aggregation did not seem to occur to a significant extent in growing and early stationary phase cultures, there was noticeable cell sedimentation in late stationary phase, consistent with the possibility of EPS formation. Thus, the &gt;10-kDa SMP observed in the cultures could possibly correspond to EPS precursors, a hypothesis that requires further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, a COD-based method was developed and used for the quantitative assessment of electron partitioning in H<sub>2</sub>-producing <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> cultures. This approach is useful for evaluating biofuel production by wild-type and mutant cultures in both growing and resting cells. The results with selected organic substrates revealed correlations of H<sub>2</sub> production and PHB accumulation with the free energy for oxidation of the substrate, normalized on an electron equivalent basis. We also showed that the method is applicable to the analysis of the redistribution of reducing power, when a known electron sink, PHB synthesis, is removed by genetic modification. SMP was a significant electron sink competing with biofuel production, so future studies should target identification and removal of the pathways that will divert electrons from H<sub>2</sub> or other desired biofuel products to SMP. Finally, the data generated on the distribution of reducing power for growing and resting cells can be useful to inform genome-scale metabolic network models of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> that will provide predictions on the flow of reducing power needed to further improve biofuel production.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Office of Science, Department of Energy, under grants DE-FG02-07ER64495 and DE-FC02-07ER64494.
