Although incorporating insulating, inorganic nanostructures into dielectric polymers promotes the temperature capability, scalable fabrication of high-quality nanocomposite films remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report an all-organic composite comprising dielectric polymers blended with high-electron-affinity molecular semiconductors that exhibits concurrent high energy density (3.0 J cm<sup>−3</sup>) and high discharge efficiency (90%) up to 200 °C, far outperforming the existing dielectric polymers and polymer nanocomposites. We demonstrate that molecular semiconductors immobilize free electrons via strong electrostatic attraction and impede electric charge injection and transport in dielectric polymers, which leads to the substantial performance improvements. The all-organic composites can be fabricated into large-area and high-quality films with uniform dielectric and capacitive performance, which is crucially important for their successful commercialization and practical application in high-temperature electronics and energy storage devices.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Dielectric polymers are widely used in electrostatic energy storage but suffer from low energy density and efficiency at elevated temperatures.

The building up of extreme-environment electronic devices, circuits, and systems entails high temperature-capable electronic materials, among which dielectric polymers for high-voltage capacitors are becoming the bottleneck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The high temperature operation of dielectric polymers is limited by a fundamental issue that the thermally and electrically assisted charge injection, excitation and transport can lead to exponential increase of leakage current, and hence low discharged energy density (<italic>U</italic><sub>e</sub>) and poor discharge efficiency (<italic>η</italic>, defined as the ratio of discharged to stored energy densities)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, despite the numerous synthetic and modification approaches to high-temperature dielectric polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, appreciable <italic>U</italic><sub>e</sub> (&gt;2.0 J cm<sup>−3</sup>) remains accessible only below 150 °C and is usually accompanied with low <italic>η</italic> that would cause massive waste heat (Joule heating) and even thermal runaway of the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recent studies demonstrate that insulating, inorganic nanostructures (e.g., boron nitride nanosheets) can be utilized to impede the transport of charge carriers in dielectric polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The resultant polymer nanocomposites show improved capacitive performance at elevated temperatures, achieving concurrent high <italic>U</italic><sub>e</sub> (varying from 2.2 to 4.8 J cm<sup>−3</sup>) and high <italic>η</italic> (~90%) up to 150 °C. Nevertheless, as the temperature increases further, both the energy density and efficiency of the nanocomposites decline abruptly. At 200 °C, the maximum <italic>U</italic><sub>e</sub> above 90% <italic>η</italic> is only 0.5–1.3 J cm<sup>−3</sup>, which is far below the room-temperature energy density (~4.0 J cm<sup>−3</sup>) of the commercial benchmark capacitor dielectric biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although higher <italic>U</italic><sub>e</sub> can be achieved at the expense of a much reduced <italic>η</italic>, the significant heat generation could cause damage to the device. Such performance falls well short of the requirement for conversion and control of electrical energy in many of the emerging applications ranging from distributed power converters in electrified aircraft to electrical compressors in deep oil and gas extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, where the operating temperature can reach or exceed 200 °C. Moreover, the insulating nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> are synthesized in low yields (e.g., nanosheets and nanowires), have high surface energies (i.e., unsatisfactory compatibility with polymers), and are loaded at high concentrations (c.a. 10 vol.%), rendering the manufacture of large-area and uniform nanocomposite films challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we depart from the previous approaches and show that a scalable all-organic composite comprising dielectric polymers blended with a low concentration (0.25–0.75 vol.%) of high-electron-affinity molecular semiconductors can attain record energy storage performance up to 200 °C. The rationale of our material design (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) is that the molecular semiconductors possessing significantly higher electron affinities (EA<sub>ms</sub>, e.g., 4.2 eV) than those of the dielectric polymers (EA<sub>p</sub>, e.g., 2.7 eV, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) can capture the injected and excited electrons via strong electrostatic attraction. This would give rise to a large trap energy level (<italic>Φ</italic><sub>e</sub> = EA<sub>ms</sub> − EA<sub>p</sub>, e.g., 1.5 eV) for the captured electrons to escape from the trap sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This is fundamentally different from the insulating nanostructures in the previous high-temperature polymer nanocomposites, which introduce trap sites mainly through modification of the polymer chain conformation and arrangement in the particle/matrix interface (the <italic>Φ</italic><sub>e</sub> is usually below 1.0 eV) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that the deep traps introduced by the molecular semiconductors would firmly immobilize the free electrons in the polymer even under high temperature and high electric field conditions if the molecular semiconductors are thermally stable and their concentrations are well below the percolation threshold. And these deep traps are anticipated to affect both the charge injection and transport.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Design of the dielectric polymer/molecular semiconductor all-organic composite.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Band diagram showing the possible charge transfer in the all-organic composite. <bold>b</bold> Schematic illustration of trap energy level introduced by the molecular semiconductors in the all-organic composite.

These molecular species are thermally stable below 300 °C (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), and are commonly used in organic solar cells based on donor-acceptor blends as they have highly electronegative elements and provide strong electron-accepting abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The electronegative elements in these molecules are displayed in the density functional theory (DFT) computation of the electrostatic potential distribution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d–f</xref>). The quantitative molecular surface analysis reveals more positive electrostatic potential on their surfaces, suggesting the attractive nature to electrons. The thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) measurement confirms that blending the molecular semiconductors into a typical heat-resistant dielectric polymer (PEI, i.e., polyetherimide) brings extra carrier trap sites in the resultant all-organic composites, with the trap energy level estimated to be around 1.5 eV (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). We found that the all-organic composites exhibited significantly higher electrical resistivity with respect to the pristine polymer at the optimal compositions (0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 vol.% of the semiconductors for the PEI/ITIC, PEI/PCBM and PEI/DPDI composites, respectively) (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). For example, under an electric field of 200 MV m<sup>−1</sup> and 200 °C, the electrical resistivity of the PEI/PCBM is 8.54 × 10<sup>12</sup> Ω m, over two orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine PEI (7.82 × 10<sup>10</sup> Ω m). This is unexpected from the knowledge that the molecular semiconductors have higher electrical conductivity than the dielectric polymer, and that they have marginal impact on the dielectric constant, dissipation factor (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) and thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>) of the composite. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) investigation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>) suggests that there is no significant interaction between the dielectric polymers and the molecular semiconductors after mixing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Charge injection and transport</title><p id="Par7">To demonstrate that the exceptional electrical property of the all-organic composites results from the effect of the molecular semiconductors on the charge injection and transport, we first carried out a spatially resolved detection of surface potential using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to gauge the injected charges (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The all-organic composite sample PEI/PCBM was cast between a pair of metal electrodes with the electrode/dielectric interface clearly exposed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, and see “Methods” for details). The PCBM tends to form ultrafine clusters of a uniform diameter (~2 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> that are found to be dispersed homogeneously in the polymer matrix (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). Charge injection was implemented prior to the KPFM measurement using an external circuit, which was then disconnected during the scan (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Interestingly, when scanning across the cathode edge of the PEI/PCBM sample, there is a distinct line signal of negative surface potential along the <italic>y</italic> direction at the dielectric side (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The average amplitude of surface potential plotted as a function of the distance to the cathode edge in the <italic>x</italic> direction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) reveals a negative peak value in the vicinity of the electrode/dielectric interface. Since this line signal is absent either in the pristine PEI or in the PEI/PCBM without implementing the charge injection (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>), it is attributed to the injected electrons captured by the PCBMs. The steeply decreased amount of electrons (i.e., increased surface potential) along the <italic>x</italic> direction toward the dielectric side suggests that the immobilized electrons form a charge-accumulated region near the electrode/dielectric interface (the width is below 800 nm) and establish a built-in electric field in the opposite direction to the applied field, which suppresses further net inflow of electrons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) measurement at an applied electric field of 200 MV m<sup>−1</sup> and 100 °C confirms that such built-in field repels the charge injection (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Mechanism to the suppression of electrical conduction.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of the KPFM testing.

The fitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> of current density versus field measured at 200 °C implies that a transition from charge injection-governed conduction (Schottky emission) to the transport-limited hopping conduction occurs in the pristine PEI as the field strength increases from 25 to 300 MV m<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The all-organic composites display very similar pattern to the pristine PEI in the fitting curves but the fittings reveal unmatched dielectric constants necessary for validating the typical Schottky emission model in the lower electric field regime (Supplementary Note 3). We speculate that the presence of the built-in field restricting the charge injection leads to the modified conduction mechanism in the lower electric field regime because other plausible conduction mechanisms are excluded (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). In the higher electric field regime, the transition to transport-limited conduction in the all-organic composites is most likely due to the saturation of charge trapping near the electrode/dielectric interface (hence the saturation of the built-in field strength). The fittings in the higher electric field regime suggest that the all-organic composites possess greater population density of the trap sites (i.e., shorter mean spacing between trap sites, <italic>λ</italic>, 0.89–1.24 nm) than both the pristine PEI (<italic>λ</italic> = 1.84 nm) and a nanocomposite comprising PEI and 10 vol.% of boron nitride nanosheets (PEI/BNNS, <italic>λ</italic> = 1.67 nm) (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

It is noteworthy that this level of energy density above 90% efficiency achieved at 200 °C is even comparable to the room-temperature value (~4.0 J cm<sup>−3</sup>) of BOPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which implies the all-organic composites are directly applicable in the extreme-environment electrical and electronic systems. In order to testify the generality of this approach, we employed various common heat-resistant dielectric polymers other than the PEI as the matrices, including polyethersulfone (PES), fluorine polyester (FPE) and polyimide (PI).

To exemplify this point, we exerted a constant DC field superimposed with an AC ripple on the materials to simulate the operation of capacitors in the power inverter of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), and calculated the heat generation from the energy loss in this process. Note that BOPP capacitors are currently employed in the power inverter to convert the DC power supplied by the battery to the AC power required to drive the traction motor. In the HEVs, an auxiliary cooling system is used to reduce the temperature of the power inverter from ~140 °C to below 70 °C for stable operation of the BOPP capacitors. The <italic>D</italic>-<italic>E</italic> loops of the PEI/PCBM measured under the superimposed DC (200 MV m<sup>−1</sup>) and AC (50 MV m<sup>−1</sup>, 1 kHz frequency) voltage are compared with those of the BOPP films (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). We set the DC electric field at 200 MV m<sup>−1</sup> in consideration that the capacitor films in power inverter of HEVs are usually around 3 μm in the thickness, upon which a DC voltage of ~600 V is applied. For the AC ripple voltage, it is relatively low in comparison to the DC voltage, and is highly dependent on the working condition of the power control unit. Here we set the AC amplitude at 50 MV m<sup>−1</sup> for the evaluation. Indeed, BOPP shows a slim loop at 70 °C, characteristic of a low energy loss (i.e., 0.9%). However, at 100 °C the loss reaches 7.1%. Such energy loss is dissipated as Joule heat, and the power density of heat generation can be calculated by <italic>P</italic><sub>J</sub> = <italic>U</italic><sub>l</sub> × 2<italic>f</italic><sub>AC</sub>, where <italic>U</italic><sub>l</sub> is the energy loss density in half the AC time period and <italic>f</italic><sub>AC</sub> is the AC frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The <italic>P</italic><sub>J</sub> of BOPP at 100 °C is 14.8 W cm<sup>−3</sup>, more than eight times that at 70 °C (1.8 W cm<sup>−3</sup>), which can lead to overheating of the device in the absence of active cooling.

Even at 200 °C, the <italic>P</italic><sub>J</sub> of the PEI/PCBM estimated from the <italic>D</italic>-<italic>E</italic> loop is still as low as 2.3 W cm<sup>−3</sup>, implying that the material can be used in the HEVs with advanced wide-bandgap semiconductor electronics operating at higher temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, e.g., silicon carbide HEVs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Film quality</title><p id="Par11">Given the fact that dielectric polymers for electrostatic capacitors are in the form of continuous films with very few defects, we finally evaluated the ability of the all-organic composites to form uniform and high-quality films. We cast a large all-organic composite film of 20 × 30 cm<sup>2</sup> area from PEI/ITIC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), and measured the breakdown strength and discharged energy density at different film regions at 200 °C. The results show a high consistency across the different film regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), suggesting that the film is overall uniform. We also analyzed the performance with increased electrode diameters to see if the molecular semiconductors deteriorated the film quality (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Clearly, the retention of the characteristic breakdown strength of the PEI/ITIC film as the testing electrode diameter increases from 3 to 20 mm is 87%, which is comparable to that of the pristine polymer film (83% retention). This result implies that the molecular semiconductors have no perceptible adverse impact on the film quality. By contrast, the PEI/BNNS nanocomposite shows only 70% retention of the breakdown strength. This is likely due to the presence of particle agglomeration and imperfect polymer/particle interface associated with the large concentration of inorganic nanofillers. The all-organic composite also outperforms the pristine polymer and the PEI/BNNS in the cyclic charge–discharge tests (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), indicative of greater long-term reliability. These experimental results indicate that the dielectric polymers and the molecular semiconductors are well miscible with each other, and serve to emphasize the advantage of the all-organic composites in forming large-area and high-quality films, which represents a substantial advance over the conventional polymer nanocomposites containing inorganic inclusions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Reliability and stability evaluations.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Photograph of a PEI/ITIC composite film (0.25 vol.% ITIC) of 20 × 30 cm<sup>2</sup> area.

The charge trapping is a result of the high-electron affinity of the molecular semiconductors, while the electronic conduction of excited charges is determined by the energy bandgap of the molecular semiconductors. At very low volume concentrations, the high-electron-affinity molecular semiconductors can trap most of the free electrons in the composites, and the electrical resistivity increases with increasing the concentration of the molecular semiconductors due to the increased population density of trapping sites. With further increasing the concentration of the molecular semiconductors, the mean spacing between the adjacent molecular semiconductors becomes smaller and smaller, and the probability of electronic conduction of the excited charge carriers becomes significant, which begins to dominate the electrical property. Therefore, the optimum performance seen at particular concentrations of the molecular semiconductors (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>) could be a result of the competition of the aforementioned two factors. The reason to the moving peak volume concentration for different molecular semiconductors is most likely due to their distinct energy bandgap values, i.e., 1.7, 2.3, and 2.5 eV for ITIC, PCBM, and DPDI, respectively. A larger bandgap of the molecular semiconductor would lead to shift of the peak towards higher volume concentration because the charge carriers need a higher energy to be excited from the valence band to the conduction band and thus the electronic conduction is of a lower probability to occur at the same volume concentration.</p><p id="Par13">In conclusion, this study offers a novel material strategy for tailoring the high-temperature capacitive performance of dielectric polymers. Further improvement of temperature capability and performance can be accomplishable through tuning the combinations between the molecular semiconductors and dielectric polymers other than those reported in this study.
