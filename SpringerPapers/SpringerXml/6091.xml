Combined-accelerated stress testing (C-AST) is one such method which has demonstrated reliable reproduction of some field-failures which were not reproducible by standard certification tests. To increase confidence and assist in the development of C-AST, and other new testing protocols, it is important to validate that the failure modes observed and mechanisms induced are representative of those observed in the field, and not the product of unrealistic stress conditions. Here we outline a method using appropriate materials characterization and modelling to validate the failure mechanisms induced in C-AST such that we can increase confidence in the test protocol. The method is demonstrated by applying it to a known cracking failure of a specific polyamide (PA)-based backsheet material. We found that the failure of the PA-based backsheet was a result of a combination of stress factors. Photo-oxidation from ultra-violet (UV) radiation exposure caused a reduction in fracture toughness, which ultimately lead to the cracking failure. We show that the chemical and structural changes observed in the backsheet following C-AST aging were also observed in field-aged samples. These results increase confidence that the conditions applied in C-AST are representative of the field and demonstrates our approach to validating the failure mechanisms induced.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi"

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">During deployment, photovoltaic (PV) modules are exposed to a suite of stressors that can lead to a number of degradation modes including; encapsulant discoloration, delamination, hot spots, cell cracking, solder fatigue, potential-induced degradation, glass fracture and backsheet failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Aging from ultraviolet light exposure, moisture, and temperature can cause chemical changes such as polymer crosslinking or chain scission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, mechanical stressors such as thermal expansion and wind loads can lead to cell cracking and solder or metallization fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Determining PV module design robustness against these stressors for their projected lifetimes requires validated accelerated testing methods that can reliably reproduce real-world conditions. PV module backsheets are a crucial component in conventional silicon PV modules. Their primary function is to insulate the electrical circuitry from exposure to external stressors and minimize safety risks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Backsheet failure occurs when the insulating barrier is compromised, often upon the formation of cracks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Failure of the backsheet poses serious safety hazards through arcing or electrical shocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In some cases, cracked backsheets have also led to increased leakage currents and inverter tripping, resulting in energy yield losses. Backsheet failure can also lead to an acceleration of secondary degradation mechanisms such as corrosion due to increased moisture permeation through cracks in the polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par3">Polyamide (PA)-based backsheets gained popularity in the last decade as a less-expensive and more-recyclable alternative to historically prominent materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) based backsheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. One of the first PA-based backsheets to reach commercialization was a co-extruded, three-layer composite known as âAAAâ. Unfortunately, widespread failure (cracking) of AAA backsheets has been reported following as little as 4Â years of field-exposure, withâ&gt;â90% failure rate within 7Â years of deployment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The failure manifests as cracking through the entire backsheet film which presents a significant safety hazard. This typically leads to large-scale warranty claims and total module replacement efforts, incurring a significant financial cost, made more difficult by the bankruptcy of the backsheet manufacturer. With upwards of 12 GW of total deployed AAA capacity, the failure of the material is an unmitigated disaster.</p><p id="Par4">Conventional accelerated stress testing (AST) protocols, such as those specified in the IEC standard 61,215-series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, failed to reproduce the cracking failure of AAA observed in the field. Recently, more advanced accelerated-stress testing protocols, such as the combined-accelerated stress test (C-AST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or the module-accelerated stress test (MAST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> have demonstrated the ability to reproduce the observed field-failure of AAA. C-AST and MAST employ combined and/or sequential stress protocols to better show PV module weaknesses. While these new testing methods have been able to reproduce observed field failure <italic>modes</italic> (e.g. cracking), it is important that the enabling <italic>mechanisms</italic> (chemical, mechanical and structural changes) are similar to those which develop in the field. When not only failure modes but failure mechanisms can be reproduced, there is greater confidence in the testing methods and conviction that the test-induced failure is not the result of unrealistic stress application. For the C-AST method, this is of particular importance as the experimental design is based on the philosophy that no stress levels are applied that could be deemed unrealistic or unobservable in the natural environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The development of C-AST has opened a new path forward for reliability testing of PV modules and materials, but further validation of the degradation mechanisms induced is an important step to justifying widespread application. In this work, we apply various techniques to characterize the chemical and structural characteristics of unaged, field-aged, and C-AST-aged AAA backsheet samples. These techniques include optical microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), X-ray transmission imaging, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), along with Finite Element Modelling (FEM) of respective stress environments. Through this characterization, we compare changes in material properties from the field to C-AST and determine that the mechanisms induced by C-AST are representative. The results of this work provide support for C-AST as a valid accelerated stress testing protocol and outlines an approach to validating novel stress testing protocols which goes beyond just demonstrating reproducibility of degradation <italic>modes.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization techniques</title><p id="Par6">Various techniques are employed to characterize the backsheet materials.

The macrocracks in C-AST-2 coincide with the cell tabbing, where the crack is located directly over the cell tabs, as in Mode A cracking. The convex shape of the backsheet over the ribbon is expected to give localized tensile stress (facilitating crack formation and propagation) at the outside (air-facing) surface of the backsheet. In addition to the macrocrack in the C-AST-2 sample (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) the outer surface of the backsheet sample demonstrates a network of microcracks (verified on the sample at greater magnification), suggesting that a change in mechanical characteristics (i.e., fracture toughness possibly due to chemical degradation as well as biaxial shrinkage) is occurring in that layer. Microcracks are not observed in the inner (cell side) layer. The combination of tensile stress and change in mechanical characteristics is believed to result in macrocrack development, with the crack propagating from the outer layer to the inner layer.

In this case, Mode B macrocracks are seen to develop within the spacing between the cells. The local thickness of the encapsulant is reduced between the cells because no cell is present at that location and the encapsulant is able to locally flow during lamination. The concave shape of the inner backsheet layer between the cells would be expected to give a localized tensile stress at the inside (cell-side) surface of the backsheet. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c shows a micrograph from another location of the Rome sample, also taken in the spacing between two cells. In this case, propagating cracks are observed at the cell-side of the core layer of the backsheet (circled in red). Closer examination of the Rome sample (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,c) reveals that the inner layer of the backsheet has numerous smaller microcracks and is also locally delaminated from the rest of the backsheet in the region between cells. Between cells, UV light can reach the backsheet material through the cell-side of the module. Microcracking and delamination suggest a change in mechanical characteristics of the backsheet; the locations of those features suggest degradation is facilitated by photo-degradation. Microcracking and delamination were not observed on the cell-side of the backsheet in regions masked by PV cells. As in the C-AST-2 sample (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, the macrocracking observed in the Rome sample (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,c) is believed to result from the combination of tensile stress and change in mechanical characteristics. The location of the cracks in the Rome sample (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) is consistent with crack initiation on the cell side of the backsheet, with subsequent propagation occurring through the core in the direction of the air side. Once formed, subsequent crack propagation may result from misfit stress from the mechanical- or thermomechanical-history of the module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Overall, we observe that the local topography (underlying cell tabbing or recess between cells) may facilitate the development of macrocracks, which are likely initiated from microcracking of the inner or outer layers. With sufficient aging, damage can continue at the local topography site (including the formation of a network of cracks and/or delamination), resulting in loss of a region of the backsheet from the module as in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The propagation of macrocracking due to local topography is a consistent observation in both C-AST-aged samples and field-aged samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Finite-element analysis of C-AST mechanical stressors and locations</title><p id="Par17">Simulation results of the C-AST MiMos were examined to identify the environmental situations promoting macrocrack formation. Results showed that mechanical loading alone produced concentrations in backsheet stress over cell gap areas as observed in Mode B cracking (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). However, the magnitude of these stresses was significantly lower than thermally induced stresses due to encapsulant and backsheet contraction and stiffening, particularly at âÂ 20Â Â°C where the largest stresses overwhelmingly occurred in Mode A over rigid interconnect topology, regardless of whether mechanical load was applied (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a,b). At 90Â Â°C, stresses throughout the MiMo were reduced due to decreasing material elastic modulus with increasing temperature, which also limited the apparent impact of mechanical load (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c,d). Key insights from the finite element model were that low temperature excursions (âÂ 20Â Â°C) leading to Mode A cracking were the most likely failure mode to be expected for C-AST, consistent with the Mode A cracking observed in the C-AST-2 sample. In addition, although they were of a lower magnitude than thermal stresses, Mode B cracking stresses were still activated during mechanical loading at moderate temperatures, consistent with the sampled field environments of the Rome and Bergamo modules where Mode B cracking was observed. Only extreme high temperatures of C-AST were found to be minimally influential to crack activation. C-AST conditions can thus be considered a conservative replication of the thermal mechanical stressors of field environments, since they enter conservatively low temperature regimes favouring the observed Mode A cracking, but nonetheless successfully activate the same Mode B cracking stresses observed in field samples.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simulated principal stress on backsheet for C-AST MiMos at (<bold>a</bold>) âÂ 20Â Â°C without mechanical load, (<bold>b</bold>) âÂ 20Â Â°C with mechanical load, (<bold>c</bold>) 90Â Â°C without mechanical load and (<bold>d</bold>) 90Â Â°C with mechanical load showing stress concentrations over cell tabbing lengths but minimal change due to mechanical loading.

Chemical changes in polymers are often associated with a change in mechanical properties. Two primary observations are made. First, the broadening of the shoulders around the 3300Â cm<sup>â1</sup> peak from the air-side of the C-AST-2 sample, suggesting the formation of hydroxylated products and/or primary amines, such as carboxylic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The second observation is the increasing intensity of the peak in the range of 1700â1740Â cm<sup>â1</sup>. On closer inspection there are two distinct peaks present here (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, inset). The first peak which centers at 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup>, and a second peak which centers at 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup>. The 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> peak is associated with imide groups which can be the product of photo-degradation reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Imides are known to be unstable and convert to carboxylic acids in the presence of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The peak at 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> suggests carbonyl group products, namely carboxylic acid, and could be explained by moisture-induced breakdown of imide groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The photo-oxidation peaks 1715â1740Â cm<sup>â1</sup> are only observed for the air-side layers of AAA, which were exposed to UV. The same peaks are not observed in the cell-side layers, which are not exposed to UV light. In previous studies, the photo-oxidation process has been attributed to a breakdown of the amorphous regions of PA-12 which is then followed by chemi-crystallization leading to a change in mechanical characteristics (i.e. a reduction in fracture toughness)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Similar increases in the 1700â1740Â cm<sup>â1</sup> peak intensities are observed in each of the fielded samples as compared to the C-AST-aged samples. The consistent peak increase in C-AST- and field-aged samples suggests that a similar photo-oxidation mechanism is happening on the outer surface (exposed to UV), which leads to the observed microcracking. However, there are some differences in the intensity of the 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> and 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> between the fielded samples, where the Tonopah sample demonstrated a more pronounced peak at 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> (the imide groups), while the other samples demonstrated more pronounced 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> peaks (carboxylic acids). The lower humidity and moisture conditions of Tonopah, AZ could explain the more pronounced imide group peak, where the lack of moisture means the imide groups do not break down into carboxylic acid as in the other samples, which experience more humid environments. Previous work has demonstrated that imide groups are favoured at the inner layer of fielded modules, except in the case where macrocracking is present and moisture can more easily penetrate the backsheet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In the case of the C-AST-aged samples, we see that C-AST-1 (which exhibited no macrocracking) demonstrated a higher imide-to-carboxylic acid ratio than C-AST-2 (which exhibited extensive macrocracking). Similar peak intensity increases have also been widely reported for field-aged and some laboratory aged AAA samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c shows the change in normalized peak intensity for the carbonyl peak 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> for the C-AST- and field-aged samples from the outer layer of the backsheet. Previous studies used the height ratio of the carbonyl peak at 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> to the normalization peak at 1465Â cm<sup>â1</sup> as a measure of polymer decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The peak intensity could be interpreted as the degree of UV photodegradation. We show that C-AST-2 has the highest change in intensity on the outer layer, however, it is worth noting that C-AST-2 was aged in C-AST for an additional 3Â weeks after the initial formation of macrocracks. Of the fielded samples, Changshu had the greatest change in peak intensity, followed by Rome, Tonopah and Bergamo. Rome and Bergamo were the only samples to demonstrate Mode B macrocracking, which was initiated from the inner layer. Additionally, these samples demonstrated minimal outer layer microcracking under magnification. The severity of the cracking of the Rome and Bergamo samples would suggest that some other chemical degradation is occurring which allows for macrocrack formation at the inner layer of the backsheet. Acetic acid is a known by-product in EVA resulting from the hydrolysis of the vinyl-acetate monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. A recent study demonstrated that the chemical degradation of free-standing AAA exposed to the outdoors could be accelerated in the presence of acetic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">To further understand the observed mechanisms, and decouple the effects of UV and temperature, an additional backsheet two samples were subjected to a dark temperature soak (90Â Â°C, 5% <italic>RH</italic>) and UV soak (0.4Â W/m<sup>2</sup> at 340Â nm, 45Â Â°C) for 2000Â h and 1500Â h, respectively. FTIR-ATR spectra were collected from the air-side layers of each of these samples, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d. Neither the T nor UV sample demonstrates strong changes in peak intensity comparable to those observed for the samples aged in C-AST or the field. However, the UV sample does show a slight emergence of the 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> peak to suggest that some amount of photo-oxidation is occurring. The total UV dose applied to the UV sample was 2.16Â MJ/m<sup>2</sup> at 340Â nm. By comparison, C-AST-1 and C-AST-2 samples were exposed to 0.25Â MJ/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Â MJ/m<sup>2</sup> at 340Â nm, respectively. Chalking was also observed for the T sample, but there was no evidence of substantial chemical degradation in the FTIR spectra. The T sample was exposed to 2000Â h at 90Â Â°C. In C-AST, samples C-AST-1 and C-AST-2 were exposed to a total of 720Â h and 1440Â h at 90Â Â°C, respectively. This suggests that while photo-oxidation can occur with exposure to UV light, the reaction appears to be thermally activated such that UV exposure at lower temperatures (as was performed on the UV sample) does not facilitate the same degree of chemical degradation as C-AST. Most crucially, the FTIR measurements imply that C-AST causes chemical decomposition of AAA backsheets to a similar magnitude as does field aging. In addition, the small changes in the FTIR spectra that were present for samples T and UV favoured the 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> peak, to suggest the formation of imides, and not carboxylic acids. Neither UV or T samples were exposed to elevated moisture or relative humidity conditions, which further supports the humidity requirements for formation of carboxylic acids from imide groups, as seen in both the field and in C-AST.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Analysis of polymer crystallinity</title><p id="Par22">X-ray scattering can provide insight into the crystalline phases present in the backsheet. Here we use WAXS to determine if any structural changes are occurring in the backsheets from aging. We also examine the potential impact of lamination on the backsheet by comparing laminated and unlaminated. Many previous studies focus on the aging behaviour of unlaminated, freestanding backsheet samples. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows scattering data for the unaged (laminated and unlaminated), C-AST aged (C-AST-2, 184Â days), and a representative field-aged (Changshu) AAA backsheet sample. The sharp and intense peaks are indexed to the rutile-TiO<sub>2</sub> pigment present in the backsheet. The remaining broader peaks, mostly located in the lower Q region, below 2.0 Ã<sup>-1</sup>, are due to scattering from the semi-crystalline polyamide polymer. There are no major changes to the scattering for any of the samples studied here, which allows us to make two major conclusions. First, the lamination process does not appear to affect the polymer or TiO<sub>2</sub> structure. A major change in the structure of TiO<sub>2</sub> might compromise the barrier coating on that material, enabling photodegradation of the backsheet from within by TiO<sub>2</sub>, rather than UV protection by optical scattering. Second, we observe no additional peaks after aging both in the field and through C-AST, suggesting the chemical changes observed in FTIR do not present as novel crystalline phases in the backsheet. The C-AST and Changshu samples show a slight increase in the intensity of the polymer peaks compared to the laminated sample suggesting a slight increase in the overall crystallinity of the backsheet. However, quantification of crystallinity by WAXS is challenging and more insight can be gained through DSC.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>WAXS of unaged and aged AAA backsheets.

The most significant increase is observed in the C-AST-2 sample. No significant change in crystallinity is observed in for the polyamide-12 component. Of the field-aged samples, Changshu is shown to have the highest crystalline content for the polypropylene component, higher than Rome. However, Changshu only exhibited outer layer micro-cracking, and not macrocracking. Whereas Rome exhibited significant macro-cracking in Mode B (from the inner layer), and less outer layer microcracking. The C-AST-2 sample demonstrated significant macro-cracking in Mode A (over the cell tabs), as well as the most significant microcracking of the outer layer and degree of outer layer photo-oxidation as measured by FTIR (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). The DSC results presented does not allow for a correlation between change in crystallinity and occurrence of either microcracking of the outer layer, or macrocracking through the entire backsheet film.</p><p id="Par27">Previous work has demonstrated a change in the crystallization properties of polypropylene in the AAA backsheet following damp heat aging (85Â Â°C/85% <italic>RH</italic>), followed by a reduction in elongation-to-break properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The change in crystallinity observed for each of the fielded samples in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a demonstrates a correlation with climate classification, where Changshu is classified as humid sub-tropical, Rome is humid continental and Tonopah is cold desert, according to the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. As such, Changshu and Rome would have been exposed to high humid and high temperature environments, with Changshu presenting the more severe conditions. Whereas Tonopah would have been exposed to low humidity conditions. This is also supported by the presence of the imide to carboxyl group ratios from the FTIR data (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), where Tonopah saw a higher ratio of imide groups than the other samples since there would have been insufficient moisture to convert the imides to carboxylic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A similar correlation was observed in the elastic modulus of individual layers of AAA backsheet from modules fielded in the same location, where in this case the elastic modulus was used as a proxy for fracture toughness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">While Changshu demonstrated the greatest increase in crystallinity of the propylene content, it did not suffer macrocracking in the same way as Rome, which did not increase as much. However, it is again worth noting that Rome exhibited Mode B cracking (inner layer, between cells), which was likely driven by another mechanism such as acetic acid attack. The C-AST-2 sample demonstrated the greatest increase in polypropylene crystallinity but was the only sample in this study to demonstrate Mode A cracking (over cell tabs). The C-AST-1 sample also demonstrated an increased polypropylene crystallinity approximately equivalent to Rome, but less than Changshu. The C-AST-1 sample did not exhibit any macrocracking.</p><p id="Par29">The results here show that crystallization of the polypropylene in the core layer of the AAA backsheet is occurring. This crystallization could be responsible for a loss of mechanical characteristics which allow macrocracks to propagate throughout the entire backsheet stack. Furthermore, it would appear as though a greater degree of crystallization is required to induce Mode A cracking (over cells tabs) than Mode B cracking (between cell gaps).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par30">The results presented in this work point to multiple, complex degradation mechanisms leading to two different cracking failure modes of the AAA backsheet. From microscopy and FTIR, a UV-induced photo-oxidation mechanism is attributed to the observed chemical degradation on the outer (light exposed) layers of the AAA backsheet, which is not observed in areas of the backsheet shaded from light exposure (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Two peaks at 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> and 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> could be observed in the FTIR spectra (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a and b) which are associated with photo-oxidation mechanisms. The peak at 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> could be associated with imide groups, which are a product of photo-oxidation. Imide groups are unstable and susceptible to breakdown into carboxylic acids in the presence of moisture. A discrepancy was observed in the peak intensities of 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup> and 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup> between the samples, more specifically, the sample from Tonopah, AZ, exhibited a greater peak intensity at 1735Â cm<sup>â1</sup>, while the other samples exhibited a great peak intensity at 1715Â cm<sup>â1</sup>. This discrepancy could be explained by the lower <italic>RH</italic> in Tonopah, AZ, which limits the imide group breakdown into carboxylic acids.</p><p id="Par31">Through FTIR analysis it was shown that the C-AST-2 sample exhibited the highest amount of chemical degradation and demonstrated severe cracking over the cell tabs (i.e. Mode A). Of the field-aged samples, Rome was the most damaged, having suffered significant macrocracking in the space between cells (i.e. Mode B). However, in FTIR, Rome exhibited less chemical degradation than Changshu, which saw no macro-cracking. Cross-sectional optical microscopy of the backsheets revealed that the macro-cracking mode observed in the Rome sample was likely initiating from the inner layer (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Polyamide is known to be vulnerable to acids (degradation catalysed by acids), and photo-oxidation of the AAA backsheet inner and outer layers is demonstrably accelerated in the presence of acetic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, a possible explanation for the discrepancy in cracking modes observed in field-aged samples from different locations could be due to the quality of the EVA encapsulant.</p><p id="Par32">DSC suggested that an increasing crystallinity of the polypropylene content was occurring with aging in all samples but Tonopah (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). It has been previously shown that this change in crystallinity can occur as a result of exposure to the damp heat condition (85Â Â°C/85% <italic>RH</italic>), and leads to a significant reduction in elongation-to-break, to suggest that it negatively affects the mechanical characteristics of the AAA core layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Similar changes in mechanical characteristics have been observed for elevated temperature exposures with lower <italic>RH</italic> conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Crystallization of polypropylene can be caused by extended exposures to elevated temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. A correlation was identified between deployment time of the fielded samples, and the degree of crystallinity of the polypropylene, where the greatest change in crystallinity was observed for samples deployed in the field for the longest time (Rome and Changshu, 5Â years and 4Â years, respectively). While elongation-to-break may not be directly related to the fracture potential of the polymer, additional work has demonstrated a similar correlation between climate and elastic modulus of the backsheet, which further supports the notion that elevated humidity leads to a detrimental change in mechanical characteristics of the AAA backsheet and could be directly related to cracking potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this study, C-AST-2 had the greatest increase in polypropylene crystallinity, which could have alluded to possible unrealistic stress conditions in C-AST. However, C-AST-2 was the only sample to demonstrate Mode A cracking (over cell tabs). The Changshu sample had the second-highest degree of crystallinity (after C-AST-2), but demonstrated no macrocracking, while the Rome sample demonstrated significant macrocracking in Mode B (between cells), with a lower crystallinity. All of this suggests that Mode A cracking (over cell tabs), requires additional aging with increased polypropylene crystallization and outer layer photo-oxidation to initiate compared to Mode B cracking (between cells). Had the Changshu sample remained in the field for longer, it would have likely developed Mode A cracking like that of the C-AST-2 sample. To validate this, analysis could be conducted on a field-aged sample which exhibits Mode A cracking.</p><p id="Par33">Cracking of the AAA backsheet is seemingly a two-step process requiring chemical degradation to initiate micro-cracking, crystallization of the polypropylene core layer, and subsequent mechanical loading to propagate macrocracking through the entire backsheet. The FEM presented in this work shows that localized stress concentrations are present on the backsheet in the regions directly above the cell tabs, and in the space between cells. These stresses are driven largely by thermal cycling, where the mechanical loading conditions applied in C-AST were not shown to induce significant stress on the backsheet.</p><p id="Par34">In addition to the field- and C-AST-aged samples, two samples were subjected to a UV soak and a thermal soak. Both of which had exposures greater than the C-AST samples, but exhibited little to no degradation. This further supports that the degradation of the AAA backsheet does indeed require a combination of stressors as delivered through C-AST. Existing certification protocols and test standards such as IEC 61215 or IEC TS 62788â7-2 do not deliver the required stress combinations to appropriately evaluate the AAA backsheet, which is the reason that AAA failure was not discovered until after field-deployment. Mode A cracking (over cell tabs) requires a combination of UV, temperature and thermo-mechanical loading (as per Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of the two-step process for Mode A cracking of AAA, demonstrating the required combination of stressors which are applied in C-AST.

We found that AAA cracking in the field is complex, with multiple enabling degradation mechanisms, but ultimately is a multi-step process requiring chemical degradation of the inner or outer layers, crystallization of the polypropylene and mechanical loading to initiate fracture. Two cracking modes were defined. Mode A, where macrocracks develop over the cell tabs, and Mode B, where macrocracks are initiated from the inner layer and develop in the gaps between the cells. Both modes require a combination of stressors including UV exposure, thermal cycling and elevated humidity to be induced. All of these conditions are applied in C-AST. Additionally, they are applied appropriately and within the right limits such that no unrealistic degradation modes or mechanisms are being induced.</p><p id="Par36">Here, we have outlined a more comprehensive approach to materials development and testing which goes beyond the current certification protocols. This includes more appropriate stress testing using combined stressors which more accurately simulates the natural environment, followed by in-depth materials forensics to identify, and understand potential weaknesses prior to commercialization and deployment. While WAXS is not always a readily available characterization technique, FTIR, DSC and microscopy are more readily available techniques and are deemed crucial to characterizing changes in material properties. Through this approach, more robust materials may be developed, thus minimizing the risk of early, widespread failures and extending lifetimes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Michael D.
