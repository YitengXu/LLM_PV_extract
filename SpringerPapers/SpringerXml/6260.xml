In the United States of America about 20% of all primary energy sources are being consumed for the purpose of lighting. Under realistic projections of the development and commercialization potential of high brightness semiconductor LEDs, as much as 28% of that amount can be saved. This amounts to the equivalent of 222 million barrels of crude oil every year. By 2002, research, development, and commercialization of high brightness LEDs has led to a 1.82 Billion-$/year world market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is about the volume of the US retail market sales for scented candles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Market projections, however, foresee an averaged annual growth of the order of 20% for high brightness LEDs quickly outpacing the more traditional lighting market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The potential and projected energy savings rely on the concept of generating visible light without the heat that comes with the use of conventional incandescent lighting. A simulation of the solar spectrum in the visible range requires a light source to emit a spectral continuum from 400 nm to 680 nm. The human eye distinguishes only red, green, and blue colors in photopic vision (the actual maximum of sensitivity of the respective cone cells in the human eye are at 560, 530, and 420 nm, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). It therefore should suffice for human vision to limit the generation of light to the three colors of red, green, and blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to color theory, the sensation of white light can be generated in different ways, e.g., by mixing of the three primary additive colors red, green, and blue, and by mixing of complimentary additive colors like primary blue and secondary yellow. The impression of any subject’s color, (i.e., subtractive red or subtractive green), however, is possible only when the object is illuminated by white light that contains the wavelengths corresponding to that color. For example, a red tomato will only appear red when it is being illuminated with light containing red light and green foliage will only appear green when it is being illuminated with green light. White composed of merely blue and yellow cannot render green or red subtractive object colors. Light that generates the impression of white is not sufficient. For a good color rendering of various colors it therefore is necessary to provide white light sources that comprise all three, i.e., red, green, and blue (RGB) light emitters.</p><p>The current technology of white LEDs typically employs a combination of UV LEDs that excite a mix of phosphors optimized for RGB emission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Due to their common primary excitation in the UV, such systems are strongly limited in their power efficiency. The wavelength transformation of each UV photon to a maximum of one photon in the visible implies an energy loss that scales with the emission wavelength. The loss is particularly large for emission in the green and red spectral range. The energetically better way is to eliminate the optical transformation process of the phosphor and to employ RGB emitting LEDs directly in a white RGB module.</p><p>Stat of the art direct emitting RGB modules employ AlGaInP red LEDs at 670 nm, AlGaInN blue LEDs at 470 nm, and AlGaInN green LEDs at 525 nm. The current best performance of each subsystem characterized by the quantum efficiency is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> adapted from Refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The total quantum efficiency, i.e., the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is the product of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and light extraction efficiency. The former describes the light generation efficiency and is primarily the result of epitaxial growth optimization and layer design. The latter is strongly controlled by die processing, contact metallization, and die shaping. From Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> it is apparent that performance in the green (525 nm) and deep green (545 nm) spectral ranges is significantly lagging that of blue and red. Despite significant progress over the last decade, particularly by implementation of blue and UV AlGaInN group-III nitride LEDs, a substantial performance gap in the green and deep green spectral range forms a bottleneck for further technological and economic progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Both control the electron and hole injection properties, their confinement to the active region, their interband transition energies as well as their probabilities to recombine either radiatively or merely result in heating of the die. Over the recent years, we have developed a detailed understanding of the electronic band-structure in GaInN/GaN thin films and quantum well (QW) heterostructures, the system that holds the highest promise for this spectral range from 495 – 560 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We identified the unique role that huge piezoelectric and pyroelectric polarization plays in the optical absorption and light emission properties of such structures on a direct and quantitative basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In particular, by combination of various optical spectroscopy techniques, we have directly quantified the polarization dipole strength acting across each QW and so laid a quantitative basis for bandstructure calculations and LED optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Using an interpolation of GaN and InN bandstructure parameters we determined all possible interband transition energies in effective mass perturbation theory. This allowed us to label and identify the transitions observed in emission and absorption-type spectra of 30 Å Ga<sub>1−x</sub>In<sub>x</sub>N/GaN QWs of variable InN-fraction <italic>x</italic>. A direct extrapolation of these results suggests that 525 nm green LEDs should be possible using active light emitting layers comprising 30 Å Ga<sub>1−</sub><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>In<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>N (<italic>x</italic> = 0.20) QWs embedded in GaN barriers. We subsequently developed a 525 nm green LED production scale process using vertical flow metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) reactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For un-encapsulated die we obtain a 525 nm dominant wavelength performance of 2 mW at 20 mA for a 2 inch wafer median and as high as 2.5 mW at 20 mA for individual die. Upon full packaging of these (400 µm)<sup>2</sup> sized die, we expect a performance of 5 mW at 20 mA equivalent to 250 mcd of luminous flux. These values closely correspond to the best currently available by US companies, namely the Lumiled Luxeon II chip. Here we lay out details of the critical steps and achievements of this development.</p><p>This review is organized as follows: We first summarize our characterization results of multiple quantum well (MQW) material by means of optical spectroscopy to identify the proper device structure. We then present our green LED die implementation effort including epitaxy optimization, device development, and production yield optimization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>2 Bandstructure Spectroscopy</title><p>The analysis of the electronic bandstructure in GaInN/GaN has been the subject of some stimulating controversy. This in part has been spurred by discrepancies in the interpreted bandgap energies from absorption-type and emission-type experiments and by frequently observed lateral phase separation of GaInN alloy into In-rich and In-poor regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The reported length scale for such interpreted fluctuations varies by the characterization methods employed and ranges from ~25 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to ~1µm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A proper assignment is ultimately difficult since GaInN/GaN sample material strongly varies with a wide range of growth parameters and growth processes.</p><p>In our approach, GaInN/GaN MQW sample material has been optimized for homogeneity of the crystal growth morphology as identified in x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Epilayers for this study have been grown by MOVPE in a horizontal flow reactor from TMGa, TMIn and NH<sub>3</sub>. A set of pseudomorphic Ga<sub>1−</sub><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>In<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>N/GaN MQW structures with variable composition was grown on (0001) sapphire in <italic>c</italic>-plane growth using the technique of low-temperature deposited AlN buffer layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On top of a 2 µm GaN epilayer five sequences of <italic>L</italic><sub>w</sub><italic>=</italic> 30 Å Ga<sub>1−</sub><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>In<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>N QWs embedded in <italic>L</italic><sub>b</sub>=60 Å GaN barriers were grown with <italic>x</italic> in the range of 0 ≤ <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.2. For all samples, the well and barrier regions are nominally undoped at residual donor concentrations of about 10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>. Excellent compositional homogeneity of the material on the length scale 1 &lt; <italic>r</italic> &lt; 50 µm was assessed by spatially resolved micro photoluminescence (PL) at excitation power densities of 1 mW/µm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] The full width at half maximum variation of the peak energy was typically &lt; 20 meV. Photoreflection (PR) was measured using a Xe white light source and above-barrier band gap excitation at 325 nm by a 40 mW HeCd laser for photomodulation. A mechanical chopper at 1.4 kHz and lock-in technique was employed for the detection. To form the PR signal the ac component was normalized to the dc part. Due to the excitation geometry, thickness interference fringes did not occur in the ac part nor in the dc part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All experiments were performed at room temperature.</p><p>PL spectroscopy under both, high and low excitation power density has been performed on a series of samples with different InN-fraction as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Under low excitation density, broad spontaneous emission is observed in <italic>N</italic><sub>3</sub>. Stimulated emission in the range from 420 — 450 nm is seen under high excitation and labeled <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub>. This emission occurs at substantially higher energies than the spontaneous one. The discrepancy can amount to 265 meV for <italic>x</italic> = 0.18 and exemplifies the great difficulties to develop longer wavelength laser diodes. In some works it was argued that there is a continuous transition from emission in the equivalent of <italic>N</italic><sub>3</sub> to <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> with increasing excitation density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In our studies it appears as if both transitions were of different nature without a continuous connection. In a different experiment on the identical samples, PR spectroscopy was performed as shown also in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Here the white light reflection was spectroscopically analyzed in sync with an on-off modulated above-bandgap photoexcitation by a 5 mW 325nm laser beam. This UV photoexcitation delivers photocarriers to the QWs and locally modulates acting internal electric fields. The resulting spectra are a partial field-derivative of the spectral reflectivity of the sample. As such it is very sensitive to the critical points in the joint density of states (DOS) of the QW structure. In contrast to the luminescence experiments, it does not emphasize any low-density-of-states trap and localization levels. In this low excitation power density experiment significant spectral features are observed near both levels, i.e., the low excitation density PL emission maximum near (<italic>N</italic><sub>3</sub>) and the stimulated emission maximum (<italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub>). At higher energies, additional levels are identified in <italic>N</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub>. In <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> a set of oscillations starts stretching out to higher energies. These have been identified as Franz-Keldysh oscillations (FKOs) in the presence of a large static electric field marking a three dimensional critical point in the joint DOS in <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>N</italic><sub>0</sub> is identified as the GaN interband transition between valence and conduction bands of the barriers. The oscillation period of the FKOs allows an accurate determination of the acting electric field strength <italic>F</italic> within the QW. The energetic splitting <italic>E</italic>(<italic>N</italic><sub>0</sub>) − <italic>E</italic>(<italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub>) = <italic>Fe L</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> is found to correspond to the polarization dipole across the well of width <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub>. The close correspondence of both quantities in a number of samples with different <italic>x</italic> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> provides an accurate measure of the actual electric field values within the individual structures and the corresponding polarization charges at the interfaces. It therefore forms a solid basis of detailed bandstructure calculations for such MQW systems.

The bandstructure parameters employed in this calculation are primarily those of GaN. Where parameters of InN are known, linear interpolations have been used. The value of the bandgap energy of GaInN was taken directly from an interpretation of PR data in GaInN thin films [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The fact that the bandgap energy of InN has recently been reassessed at 0.67 eV has no implications on our experimentally determined bandgap values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Among the most commonly cited alternative interpretations are alloy fluctuations of GaInN that could induce local potential minima that are too low in DOS to be observed in absorption-type experiments but efficient enough in photocarrier trapping to be emphasized in radiative recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In another model, well thickness fluctuations are being considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

There seems to be supporting evidence for all those models and the large variety of different sample materials makes it difficult to unify the models at present.

Resulting <italic>x</italic>-values are in the range of 0.15 to 0.20 as determined by x-ray diffraction analysis. There is no intentional doping in the active region and carrier injection layers are all nominally identical for electrons and holes, respectively. The p-side was formed by a 30 nm Al<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>Ga<sub>1−</sub><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>N electron blocking layer (<italic>y</italic> ≅ 0.08) and 300 nm of GaN.

We made no use of methods such as lateral epitaxial overgrowth to reduce threading dislocation densities below typical values of ~ 10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>. Samples are characterized at various stages of the process, i.e., prior to deposition of a p-side, the full pn-structure in epi form, and fully processed and separated bare die mounted on TO-18 header. None of our dies have been coated or specially shaped for any enhancement of light extraction. The final LED dies are (350 µm)<sup>2</sup> or (400 µm)<sup>2</sup> along the edges.</p><p>In several approaches we have used different optimization paradigms to obtain highest possible emission power in electroluminescence (EL) at the target wave-length of 525 nm. Overall a total of some 850 epi runs have been performed until a winning strategy has been identified leading to a highly stable production-worthy process. Within the LED development and manufacturing process, epitaxial wafers and dies were characterized at various stages in order to monitor material quality and development progress. Among the standard tools, PL was employed on the unprocessed epitaxial wafers, EL was performed on both, unprocessed and processed, wafers.</p><p>For the development of blue LEDs, PL emission, i.e., emission wavelength and emission intensity, are known to be good primary feedback parameters for growth optimization. One example of this optimization paradigm is the class of growth Condition A, which has led to the development of high performance 470 nm blue LED dies. Measured at the bare die, the light output from our dies reaches 3 mW at 20 mA drive current. In fully mounted and encapsulated form this performance typically doubles to 6 mW.</p><p>In other approaches, the primary focus was on the morphological homogeneity of the active layer, in particular in terms of the nanometer roughness of the growth surface. This was quantified by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Growth Condition B and Condition C are early and late stages of this paradigm, respectively.</p><p>A comparison of the growth Conditions A, B, and C in the terms of the growth morphology is shown in (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Surface topography of the last barrier that covers the last of 5 GaInN/GaN QWs is shown in a surface height profile. No p-doped layers are present. Areas of 5 × 5 µm<sup>2</sup> for conditions A, B, and C are shown using very different full scale height ranges of 50 nm (A), 10 nm (B), and 2 nm (C). Characteristic is the density and size of dark appearing pits. These have previously been identified as V-defects originating at the intersection of Ga<sub>1−</sub><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>In<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>N layers and threading dislocations emanating in the underlying layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Along the sequence of conditions, the density of pits decreases from 16 × 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> (A), over 8 × 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> (B), to 3.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> (C), when counted using the image contrast of the given height scales. In parallel, the roughness decreases most notably from 15.4 nm root mean square (RMS) (A), over 0.96 nm (B) to 0.14 nm (C). The morphology in our high performing 470 nm blue LEDs is very similar to the data under Condition A. Apparently tremendous improvements in growth morphology over that of high performing blue emitting epi is possible within our optimization scheme.

All PL traces within the same panel use the same signal scale but different panels use different scales. Under Condition A, a broad emission band stretches from 500 — 700 nm with full width at half maximum (<italic>δ</italic>) of 120 nm. Fringes of layer thickness interference are found to be superimposed. Under Condition B, the spectrum is dominated by a strong blue line at 460 nm. In this case, green emission appears only as a low energy tail (<italic>δ</italic> = 70 nm). In Condition C finally, all emission occurs in the green, yellow, and red spectral range and with a rather large line width of <italic>δ</italic> = 130 nm. All of the described features are characteristic for these conditions while the exact wavelengths and intensities vary with common process parameters from epirun to epirun.

The very broad line shape for all cases would likely raise big concern about the epitaxial quality of such wafers. It would be likely to attempt to optimize the growth process at this early stage of device fabrication for a much smaller luminescence line width such as 20 or 30 nm. In fact, the 470 nm blue LED process was developed in this way. For Condition B and Condition C, however, we refrained from such an approach and limited ourselves to the above mentioned optimization for morphological homogeneity as assessed by AFM.</p><p>Usefulness of any of the growth conditions for high power green LED dies, however, cannot be judged until these layers are implemented in full LED structures including highly doped n- and p-type layers. In the next step therefore, full LED epi wafers have been analyzed that embed active regions of growth condition A, B, and C inside a pn-junction.</p><p>The PL of the full LED structure is included in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (labeled LED). Little variation in peak position and bandwidth with respect to the MQW data is observed under Condition A (peak near 570 nm, <italic>δ</italic> = 120 nm). This condition indicates properties that are rather insensitive to the presence of the p-side. In Condition B, the emission peak has shifted strongly towards the green at 520 nm at a constant <italic>δ</italic> = 70 nm. Here apparently the presence of the p-side plays an important role, and a LED performance conclusion based on data of the MQW alone would have been very misleading. In Condition C, however, we observe a strong narrowing of the emission band to <italic>δ</italic> =35 nm over that of the MQW. Again, optimization of the epitaxial growth to the PL of the MQW alone would have excluded our development of such a condition. The line narrowing after capping with a p-side can be explained by lateral charge transfer in the conducting n- and p-regions to compensate for spatial variations of the electrostatic and piezoelectric properties of the active region. Such a lateral compensation and equalization of the electrostatic potential is much less likely in the MQW samples where the piezoelectric highly charged active region is not capped by a conducting p-side. This is another manifestation of the strong electric fields controlling the electronic band-structure and emission spectra.</p><p>All of the above considerations are meaningful only when they lead to a useful device which will be quantified in terms of EL performance. EL therefore is shown for the same samples of the full LED structure (labeled EL LED) (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Under Condition A (peak at 503 nm, <italic>δ</italic> = 32 nm), emission is significantly shifted to shorter wavelength versus the PL in bare MQW and LED. Despite the apparent insensitivity of PL to the presence of the p-side, electrical carrier injection in EL leads to entirely different results. Such an outcome is not surprising since the carrier injection mechanisms are entirely different in PL and EL. In photo excitation, carriers of both polarities are generated in the same location, while for electro-injection those carriers arrive from opposite sides of the wells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Electrons arrive from below the active region and flow along the polarized (0 0 0 1) direction, while holes flow opposite to this direction. Carriers consequently arrive from opposite sides to the asymmetric QWs which could be responsible for carrier thermalization and recombination processes that are different from those under same-side injection. In Condition B (peak at 515 nm, <italic>δ</italic> = 34 nm) and Condition C (peak at 525 nm, <italic>δ</italic> = 33 nm), however, the EL emission closely tracks the PL in the LED structure in peak and line width resulting in the desired EL emission near 520 nm.</p><p>The above findings give rise to our following interpretation. It has been established that threading dislocations penetrating the ternary well layer act as nucleation centers for V-defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These defects are characterized by high index growth surfaces that offer enhanced In-incorporation efficiencies to an otherwise highly compressed InN-rich well layer. Similar to the well-documented case of enhanced Al-incorporation at high index growth surfaces in the growth of AlGaN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], growth of high InN fraction GaInN layers competes with effective In accumulation along such penetrating defects. This, on the one hand, may explain the great difficulty to shift the emission wavelength to longer wavelength into the green. On the other hand, it may explain the reduced light output, due to a reduced available area of (0 0 0 1) oriented alloy material and a possible increase in recombination shunt current through low energetic states within the In accumulation areas. It should be noted that in this interpretation the active green emission does not originate in the In accumulation areas but rather in the (0 0 0 1) oriented alloy layers that would tend to loose their In to such defects. The strong correlation of our die performance with surface roughness and pit density suggests that significant die performance improvements should become possible for MQW growth on GaN material that is free from threading dislocations.</p><p>Together these results provide a strong basis for the development of green LED dies. We here specifically find that Condition C, based on morphological and structural optimization of every component, provides the key for highest spectral performance in the desired green spectral range.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>4 Wavelength-Power Behavior</title><p>Synonymous for the difficulty to develop high light emission power green LEDs is the observation of a strong decrease of the emission power when the emission wavelength is increased from the blue spectral range to the green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is well represented in the trends of Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The lacking performance of green emitters is apparent and particularly surprising since the same material system is employed for blue and the green. In order to assess the limits of the AlGaInN technology as a function of the emission wavelength, a large number of samples is required to compensate for fluctuations that are beyond the controllability of the epitaxial process. Natural run-to-run variations, be they intentionally controlled or uncontrollable process fluctuations, can easily cloud an analysis where statistical methods were more appropriate. In this approach, we analyzed the data of hundreds of growth runs during different development stages of the green LED epi production process. Relative epi performance can be determined on unprocessed LED epi wafers by applying a constant current of 100 mA through standardized In-contacts. In this step the spectral emission and integral emission power are analyzed. Performance data of LED epi manufactured on a single reactor over the time frame of several months and development stages are shown in the three panels of Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Preferably an entire epi wafer shall produce exactly identical devices in all aspects.

The limited external quantum efficiency of about 3.4 % (5.3 %) reveals the strong potential for further improvements currently underway.

Such processes are known to produce significant extraction gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, all data was obtained on bare, i.e., un-encapsulated, die. For standard packaging and encapsulation with index matched layers and polymers we typically obtain a performance enhancement by a factor of 2.0. This or higher values are commonly observed throughout the industry when sapphire substrate based material in epi-up geometry is being packaged. Therefore, after full encapsulation we expect these dies to deliver a radiant flux of 3.2 mW (5.0 mW) at 20 mA and a luminosity of 130—160 mcd (200—250 mcd) based on experience with blue die material.</p><p>A typical device operation point of 20 mA was useful in LEDs for indicator applications. For lighting purposes, however, light output per production cost and/or operation cost is crucial. Therefore optimization aims at highest possible conversion efficiencies and current densities, i.e., highest light output from the smallest epi area. For this reason, devices for lighting applications are typically operated at current levels of 100 mA for a (350 µm)<sup>2</sup> device or above.</p><p>A comparison of the die performance with Lumileds Luxeon II lamps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] is possible when EQE is shown as a function of the drive current density. Under the assumption of the junction area of the Luxeon II (1 mm)<sup>2</sup> and a typical light extraction enhancement factor of 2.0 for proper die encapsulation of our die, we obtain the data in Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. It is apparent that our material reaches 95% of the performance of the Lumileds Luxeon II reference. In addition, it should be noted that the Luxeon lamp uses flip-chip technology while our dies use standard transparent p-contacts. This typically gives the Luxeon device a 25 – 40% advantage in light extraction. An extrapolation of our data under such an assumption is included in Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> as a hatched band. This comparison suggests that epi material grown with our processes at the present stage can surpass the Luxeon II reference when processed and packaged in a similar way. Our material and processes therefore perfectly qualify for relevant and meaningful development and analysis. In particular, these results also lend relevance to the scientific exploitation of sample material obtained under the here described conditions.

Additional extrapolation of the (400 µm)<sup>2</sup> die data for typical gains by flip-chip mounting yields the hatched blue band which surpasses the commercial reference.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43583_2005_1001002_Fig12.jpg" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p>The strong improvements in die performance leading to bare green die powers of 2 mW and above are accompanied by a significant variation of the power roll-off behavior with wavelength. This lends support to the idea that the roll-off is not an inherent limit to the system but instead can be controlled on a rather high performance level by material and device optimization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>7 Future work</title><p>Our analysis also provides a direction for further device performance improvement. Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> summarizes the discussed values of observed roughness of the active layer together with emission power and power roll-off fraction in the green spectral range as a function of the counted V-defect density for growth conditions A, B, and C. Indicated also are rough linear extrapolations on the presented scales as hatched bands. Under the assumption of a causal correlation of the data as suggested in these clear trend lines we should expect zero power roll-off for a vanishing V-defect density, i.e., &lt; 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>. Under such conditions, the roughness should be of the order of 0.01 nm RMS, which is not so likely to be achieved experimentally. The emitted power of (350 µm)<sup>2</sup> devices should scale from 1.6 mW to 2.0 – 2.5 mW at 20 mA without any other modification to the structure. Inversely, an extrapolation to zero emission power allows an estimate of the emission-dead area of the V-defect. For a V-defect density of 2.5×10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> we expect that no regular emitting area is left corresponding to a diameter of emission-dead area associated with individual V-defects of 220 nm. This is in reasonable agreement with the V-defect sizes observed in the AFM data of Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.
<fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of characteristic quantities versus the observed V-defect density under growth Conditions A, B, and C. The AFM roughness increases with the V-defect density (blue triangles, right y-axis). In extrapolation the roughness should fall to values of 0.02 nm RMS for vanishing V-defect density. The magnitude of the power roll-off in the green spectral range (500 – 550 nm) dies decreases with decreasing V-defect density (green circles, far left y-axis). The roll off should disappear altogether for vanishing V-defect density. The power of un-encapsulated (350µm)<sup>2</sup> increases with decreasing V-defect density and should reach values of 2.5 mW for vanishing V-defect density, i.e., below 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> (red squares, left y-axis).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43583_2005_1001002_Fig13.jpg" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p>We consequently see two possibilities to improve green LED die performance on the epi level. The first would be approaches to further reduce the V-defect decoration of existing threading dislocations. The second would be to avoid threading dislocations altogether, i.e., by means of advanced lateral overgrowth techniques or by use of single crystalline bulk substrates. The latter approach also bears the potential to increase the performance beyond our 2.5 mW extrapolation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>8 Conclusion</title><p>On the basis of detailed electronic bandstructure analysis results, we have devised and laid out an epitaxy optimization scheme that results in high light output power performance of 525 nm green LED dies. This process optimization goal is substantially different from that of 470 nm blue LED dies. We find that optimization to epitaxial homogeneity of the active region is relevant to the achievement of a high yield, uniform performance, and highly reproducible epitaxy process or green LED dies. We presented all respective performance parameters and extrapolate to future device performance upon the likely further reduction of structural defects. Our materials and processes resulting in die performance equivalent or better than industrial reference points proves a relevant platform for meaningful device characterization and further performance development along the goals of Solid State Lighting and energy conservation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully appreciate the technical support and dedicated effort of all employees of Uniroyal Optoelectronics, Tampa, FL, in the early phase of this work, in particular Dr. D.C.
