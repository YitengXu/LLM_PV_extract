However, despite the advances in performance disclosed in recent years, understanding the internal processes occurring within these devices is challenging. In order to shed light on these mechanisms, here we report an operando magnetic resonance imaging approach that can provide quantitative spatial maps of the electrolyte temperature and redox ion concentrations in functioning thermo-electrochemical cells.

Such heat is generated by industrial processes, automobiles, natural sources (e.g., solar or geothermal) and even the human body, and represents a vast and largely untapped energy resource<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Thermo-electrochemical cells (also referred to as thermogalvanic cells, and hereafter as thermocells) are devices capable of generating electricity from waste heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In their simplest form, they consist of two parallel plate electrodes and an electrolyte containing a redox couple with a temperature-dependent redox potential. Under an applied thermal gradient, either oxidation or reduction will dominate at the hot electrode depending on the sign of the reaction entropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, with the opposite process occurring at the cold electrode. This generates an electric potential across the cell (the Seebeck effect), and when an external load resistance is connected to the electrodes the drawn current will drive further redox reactions, resulting in the continuous generation of power with no fuel consumption or emissions for as long as the temperature gradient is maintained. Thermocells have many advantageous features such as no moving parts or potentially deleterious effects such as plating, stripping, interphase formation or intercalation processes, which will be beneficial for longevity, and they utilise much lower cost materials than traditional semi-conductor based thermoelectrics, making them promising for large scale, low-cost applications. Recently, significant progress has been made in developing wearable thermocells to harvest body heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as in developing new thermocell designs that incorporate separators or membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, material phase transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, crystallisation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and improved electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> materials to boost their Seebeck coefficient and efficiency.</p><p id="Par4">Despite the simplicity of their design, there are a large number of distinct physical processes that can occur within the thermocell electrolyte. These include the redox reactions and accompanying changes in ion clustering and solvation, the establishment of local concentration gradients and resulting diffusion along these gradients, self-diffusion (due to Brownian motion), thermophoresis (the migration of species along a temperature gradient, usually from hot to cold, also known as the Soret effect), electrophoresis (the migration of charged species along a potential) and convection. All of these processes will be highly inter-dependent, for example convection can be caused by the applied temperature gradient but also by variations in the electrolyte density resulting from the redox reactions and concentration gradients. Moreover, these processes will also depend on various external parameters such as the shape, size and orientation of the electrolyte chamber, and due to the effects of the chamber walls they will potentially show distinct spatial variations in all three dimensions. This multitude of interacting factors is complex enough during the steady-state operation of the device, but they will also vary as a function of the applied thermal gradient and load resistance, both of which may be time dependent in real-world applications. Understanding and quantifying these phenomena, their relation to the cell design and their impact on the performance of the device is therefore a major challenge.</p><p id="Par5">Thus far, the most viable way to visualise these processes has been via numerical modelling, and a number of previous publications have used this approach to predict the spatial variations in temperature and concentrations of the redox species for cells operating under steady-state conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These studies have provided valuable insights, for example Sokirko’s model predicted linear concentration gradients for the redox species in the absence of convection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and, when convection is present, the existence of diffusive layers at the electrodes (regions of enhanced concentration of redox species due to their generation at the electrode surface) with a neighbouring “inversion layer” showing a reduced concentration of that species relative to the bulk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These features are predicted to be more pronounced at the cold electrode due to the slower local diffusion. Salazar and co-workers used their model as a basis for the optimisation of cell designs and geometries, and showed that stacking cells in series could significantly boost conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, such models inevitably necessitate various simplifications. For example, Salazar’s model was restricted to two dimensions, thus could not consider any effects of the interior side walls of the cell, and also had to neglect the effects of thermophoresis under the assumption that other mass transfer effects are dominant in a functioning cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">To the best of our knowledge, the experimental observation of the various inter-related and spatially-dependent phenomena occurring in a working thermocell has not yet been achieved. The vast majority of experimental studies have focused on electrochemical measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> carried out on thermocells featuring different electrode and electrolyte materials, and with different cell geometries, orientations and designs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. While these are extremely useful and can be used to quantify the device performance, they provide little information on the processes occurring within the electrolyte and certainly no insights into spatial variations in the cell. Said and co-workers have used infrared (IR) thermal imaging to study the temperature distribution across thermocells incorporating polymer membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, while Yu and co-workers also used this method to image temperature distributions in their thermosensitive-crystallisation boosted devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. While IR imaging certainly provides useful data, it only strictly reports on the temperature across the outer surface of the device, while spatial variations in temperature within the electrolyte interior may be hidden.</p><p id="Par7">Operando magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile and non-invasive technique that has been used by a number of research groups to study energy storage devices such as double-layer capacitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, allowing the mapping of ion concentration gradients in electrolytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, studies of device charge state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and current distributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and the observation of processes such as Li and Na ion intercalation into electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, the growth of metallic dendrites from the electrode surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and magnetohydrodynamics in the electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Readers wishing to learn more about operando MRI methods for electrochemical devices are referred to two informative review articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This technique is particularly well-suited for studies of thermocells given the inherent paramagnetic nature of many redox species that will result in enhanced relaxation-based image contrast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, as well as its ability to quantitatively probe translational molecular dynamics including diffusion and flow.</p><p id="Par8">To this end, we have constructed custom thermocells designed specifically for operando MRI characterisation using a microimaging probe with a 25 mm inner diameter radiofrequency coil. The basic cell layouts are shown schematically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, while additional 3D design images are shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>. The cell housing is made of polyether ether ketone (PEEK), an inert material that is easily machined and is thermomechanically stable. The electrolyte is contained in a central chamber between two 0.25-mm-thick platinum plate electrodes held in place using butyl rubber gaskets. The electrode temperatures are controlled in situ using hot and cold gas streams that flow over the outer surfaces of the electrodes (shown for the vertical electrode cell in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and whose temperatures and pressures can be individually controlled. Due to the design of the imaging probe used and space restrictions inside the magnet, the hot gas is required to enter the cell from below with the other gas connections located at the top (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Despite this restriction, the modular design of the horizontal electrode cell allows either hot-above-cold or cold-above-hot orientations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). As the electrolyte temperature is measured directly during the experiments via the MRI images obtained, no thermocouples are required. However, benchtop temperature measurements were also carried out using thermocouples at various positions within the cell (inside the electrolyte, and near the outer surfaces of the electrodes) to verify the reproducibility of the electrolyte temperature as determined by MRI (±2.5 °C) and the stability of the gas flow temperatures over time (±0.5 °C). Electrode connections are achieved using wires extending from the top of the cells and these are connected to a potentiostat located outside of the magnet using shielded cables.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematics of the thermocell designs for operando MRI experiments.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Vertical, <bold>b</bold> horizontal hot-above-cold and <bold>c</bold> cold-above-hot electrode orientations.

The cobalt cation can exist in either the paramagnetic Co<sup>2+</sup> or diamagnetic Co<sup>3+</sup> oxidation states, with two or three associated TFSI anions, respectively.

An initial assumption is made that local variations in the concentration of the redox species are negligible at open-circuit voltage, where no external electron transfer occurs to drive the redox reactions at the electrodes. This allows the acquired <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> map to be directly converted to a temperature map via the (independently measured) temperature variation of the <sup>1</sup>H <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> for the particular electrolyte used (in this case MPN containing 0.05 M Co<sup>2+</sup>(bpy)<sub>3</sub>(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> and 0.05 M Co<sup>3+</sup>(bpy)<sub>3</sub>(TFSI)<sub>3</sub>). This requires the temperature map to be recorded as quickly as possible after establishing the thermal gradient in order to minimise the effects of thermophoresis, which can occur over a time scale of hours (vide infra). Subsequently, an external load resistance is applied and the cell begins to operate, with both the current and potential continuously measured via the potentiostat. A second assumption is then made that the resulting redox reactions, accompanying mass transfer processes such as diffusion and electrophoresis, and other effects such as Joule heating of the electrodes, do not significantly alter the temperature distribution within the electrolyte, which remains dominated by conductive and convective heat transfer between the electrodes. This allows the temperature map obtained from the unconnected cell to be used as a restraint in calculating the local concentrations of the redox species from subsequent <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> maps acquired from the functioning cell. This conversion is achieved using the polynomial function obtained from the surface fit of the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> data in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> (see Supplementary Information for more details), which were acquired using separate calibration measurements carried out on individual samples prepared with different Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> concentrations. We note also that various other assumptions inherent to operando MRI studies of electrochemical devices also apply, for example that Lorentz forces on the electrolyte ions and eddy currents on the electrodes play a minimal role in the device functionality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Temperature maps and effects of convection</title><p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows temperature maps obtained from the liquid and gel electrolytes within the vertical electrode cell under a target temperature differential of 90 °C (although a narrower actual temperature difference across the electrolyte within the device is observed in both cases and this is attributed to the thermal gradient across the electrode itself).

Each image took ~27 min to obtain and the times quoted are the completion times for the acquisition of each image. First, Co<sup>2+</sup> concentration maps were obtained from the cell in its open-circuit state to observe the stability of the electrolyte over time under the effects of the applied thermal gradient (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b–<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). The initially uniform Co<sup>2+</sup> concentration across the whole electrolyte can be seen to change over a period of several hours, with an apparent clustering of Co<sup>2+</sup> species on the cold side of the cell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) that eventually begins to sink to the bottom of the electrolyte (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e–<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). These observed changes are due to thermophoresis, whereby the cobalt species (of both oxidation states) migrate towards the cold side of the cell, gradually increasing the local electrolyte density and causing it to sink. This process coincided with a small reduction in the cell voltage (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). Note that this process results in a departure of the local net cobalt concentration from 0.10 M, and so the calibration data in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> no longer applies, hence we have labelled the concentration scale in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> as “apparent” Co<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The thermophoresis effect therefore limits the accurate quantification of the redox species concentrations when this effect is dominant. Nonetheless, although these particular images are not truly quantitative, the contrast reliably illustrates the effects of thermophoresis and the time evolution of the spatial distribution of the cobalt species within the cell.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Imaging competing mass transfer effects in the vertical electrode cell.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Temperature map and <bold>b</bold>–<bold>m</bold> apparent Co<sup>2+</sup> concentration maps obtained from the vertical electrode cell with the MPN with 0.05 M Co<sup>2+/3+</sup>(bpy)<sub>3</sub>(TFSI)<sub>2/3</sub> gel electrolyte at times <italic>t</italic> indicated.

These images report on the local concentrations of the TFSI anions, which due to ion clustering will in turn depend on the local concentrations of the cobalt redox cations. <sup>19</sup>F image intensity arising from the PVDF component of the gel is negligible due to its much broader NMR line width. In the image obtained from the unconnected cell with no temperature gradient applied (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), the spin density is fairly uniform across the electrolyte as expected.

We have observed thermophoresis occurring inside a gel electrolyte in an unconnected cell, and have shown that other mass transfer processes induced by the redox reactions when a load resistance is applied are dominant over this process and reverse its effects. The image acquisition times used were short relative to the time scale of the observed concentration changes, allowing them to be monitored as a function of time and applied load resistance. The <sup>1</sup>H relaxation-based MRI approach we present in this work should be applicable to any electrolyte system containing a protonated solvent molecule (e.g., water, or organic solvents) and a redox couple where one of the redox states is paramagnetic to provide enhanced relaxation contrast. Spin density imaging, also demonstrated here using <sup>19</sup>F, may be applicable to non-protonated systems, redox couples with no paramagnetic state, or solid or mixed-phase electrolytes provided they contain magnetic nuclei with sufficient sensitivity and suitable relaxation times. In this work, we have focused on 2D imaging, but multi-slice imaging or more advanced pulse sequences could be used to provide 3D images featuring spatial information in all directions. Other MRI modalities such as diffusion and velocity mapping will provide further insights into mass transfer processes such as electrophoresis and convection.
