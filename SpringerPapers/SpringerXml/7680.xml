To address this challenge we have developed a method for the direct modification of the aromatic backbone of a conjugated polymer, post-polymerisation. This is achieved via a quantitative nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar) reaction on a range of fluorinated electron-deficient comonomers. The method allows for facile tuning of the physical and optoelectronic properties within a batch of consistent molecular weight and dispersity. It also enables the introduction of multiple different functional groups onto the polymer backbone in a controlled manner. To demonstrate the versatility of this reaction, we designed and synthesised a range of emissive poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-<italic>alt</italic>-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT)-based polymers for the creation of mono and multifunctional semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) capable of two orthogonal bioconjugation reactions on the same surface.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Functionalisation of conjugated polymers is essential for performance in many applications, yet there are limited approaches to achieve this.

The key to their application in these areas is the ability to tune both the electronic and physical properties of the polymer and introduce functional groups onto the backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To date most approaches to manipulate such properties have relied on the copolymerisation of appropriate monomeric materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. For example, the incorporation of varying amounts of electron-deficient monomers into an electron-rich polymer backbone has a significant impact on the optical band gap due to the hybridisation of the frontier molecular orbitals. Similarly the polymer crystallinity and processability can be tuned by inclusion of monomers with branched or linear sidechains. However, the establishment of structure–property relationships in such copolymers is complicated by the necessity to synthesise batches of varying comonomer ratios, which is both time consuming and challenging to control. Therefore, it is often difficult to disentangle the influence of changes in the backbone chemistry from variations in the molecular weight, end-groups and dispersities of different batches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In principle, the above-mentioned difficulties could be overcome by direct modification of the aromatic backbone of the conjugated polymer post-polymerisation, thus enabling the synthesis of libraries with consistent dispersity and length. In order to have a practical significance, any such reaction on a polymer backbone should be both highly selective and quantitative in yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Click reactions fit these criteria well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and have had an important and growing influence in the field of materials science over the last decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Many of the common click reactions have also been applied to conjugated polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but almost exclusively these have involved functional groups that are decoupled from the aromatic backbone via a saturated alkyl spacer, and thus have limited influence on the electronic properties of the polymer. Post-polymerisation reactions directly on the aromatic backbone itself have rarely been reported, mainly due to issues with selectivity and incomplete reactions. Those that have been reported utilise unusual building blocks like dibenzocyclooctyne<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> or very specific chemistries like benzannulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Furthermore, it is often desirable to introduce functional groups onto the backbone. For example, groups such as acrylates, carboxylic acids, azides, alkynes and so-on have been added to facilitate self-assembly, to enable crosslinking and photopatterning or to promote interactions with metal oxide interfaces. Typically such reactive groups are not able to survive the polymerisation conditions and are introduced via functional group interconversions after polymerisation. In many cases it would be desirable to have two or more different functional groups on the same polymer backbone. For example two orthonal click groups like an azide and an alkene could be used for crosslinking and subsequent surface functionalisation or for dual sensing applications. The preparation of such conjugated polymers via current methodologies is complex, and as such they are rarely reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Direct backbone functionalisation offers an attractive method for such functionalisation. This is of particular interest in the field of SPNs, which are relatively challenging to functionalise. Existing strategies to SPN functionalisation include encapsulation by an inorganic shell and subsequent chemical modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, or coprecipitation/emulsification with amphiphilic molecules containing reactive groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This later approach relies on non-covalent interactions between the polymer and the functionalised counterpart, which can dissociate over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, particularly at elevated temperature. All of these approaches also rely on dilution of the emissive component, which inherently limits the brightness of the particule for a given size. Covalent attachment of functional groups directly to the semiconducting polymer backbone overcomes these problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but has been synthetically challenging, particularly if multiple functional groups are required.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we report a widely applicable strategy to directly modify the conjugated backbone via a quantitative nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar) reaction on fluorinated electron-deficient comonomers within the polymer backbone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Such functionalisation results in significant changes to the optoelectronic and physical properties of the polymer. It also enables the facile introduction of reactive handles for further functionalisation or cross-linking. Multiple reactive groups can be introduced in a controlled one-pot reaction. Our approach to synthesising these materials enables the facile creation of functionalised polymers and particles with multiple different reactive handles covalently linked on their surface.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>General reaction scheme and example reaction. <bold>a</bold> Scheme for the modification of semiconducting polymers containing either fluorinated benzotriazole or benzothiadiazole comonomers with a thiol or alcohol. <bold>b</bold> Synthesis of P1-SR from two different strategies: (i) 9-(9-heptadecanyl)−9H-carbazole-2,7-diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester, Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, toluene, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (aq), 120 °C 3 days.

Initial experiments focused upon displacement reactions with alkanethiols due to their high nucleophilicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus treatment of the carbazole copolymer <bold>P1-F</bold> with an excess of octanethiol in the presence of base in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/DMF was found to result in complete substitution of the fluoride after 30 min at 120 °C, affording <bold>P1-SR</bold> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Given that the performance of semiconducting polymers in electronic devices like organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) is very sensitive to the presence of chemical defects or impurities, the performance of both polymers was also investigated in bottom gate, bottom contact OTFTs. Gratifyingly both polymers exhibited similar overall performance, with comparable charge carrier mobility (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), providing further evidence that the displacement chemistry does not adversely affect polymer performance.</p><p id="Par8">To further probe the utility of the reaction, we moved to a more soluble polymer, poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (<bold>P2-F</bold>), which could be readily prepared at a higher molecular weight (<italic>M</italic><sub>n</sub> ≈ 113 kg mol<sup>−1</sup>) than the carbazole copolymer (<bold>P1-F</bold>) (<italic>M</italic><sub>n</sub> ≈ 4 kg mol<sup>−1</sup>).

A new absorption peak is also observed around 370 nm, which increases in intensity as function of thioalkyl substitution. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra do not signficantly change as function of substitution (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).

Azide and alkene terminated polymers were synthesised via protected thioacetates (<italic>S</italic>-(3-azidopropyl)thioacetate and <italic>S</italic>-(10-undecenyl)thioacetate respectively), due to the relatively poor stability of the free thiols. An in situ deprotection of the thioacetate by treatment with NaOH in the mixed chlorobenzene (CB)/DMF solvent was performed and full substitution onto the polymer backbone was achieved after 10 min at 100 °C. In the case of carboxylic acid and thioacetate functionalised polymers, substitution of all fluorine atoms resulted in an insoluble polymer.

The resulting polymers exhibited a slightly different UV–Vis spectrum to the thiol analogue, with a similar drop in the ICT intensity but with a small red shift, when compared to the fluorinated precursor. However, they did not exhibit the new band at 370 nm which was seen in all thiol-containing polymers.</p><p id="Par13">This approach can even be used to incorporate water sensitive cross-linkable sidechains, such as trimethoxysilanes. Although such groups are commonly used surface modifiers and cross-linkers in commercial polymers they have been rarely utilised as functional groups in conjugated systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, likely due to their incompatibility with typical polymerisation conditions. Here though we could readily incorporate such groups by treatment with an excess of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane under anhydrous conditions. The resulting polymer (<bold>P2-Silane</bold>) could be cross-linked into intractable films simply by exposure to ambient air (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>), a very mild crosslinking condition which could be beneficial for a number of device applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">We also investigated the synthesis of a graft copolymer. Due to the reduced reactivity of polymer chain ends, coupled with the typically poor reactivity of polymer backbones, this can be considered as the ‘gold standard’ in terms of establishing reaction utility.

Copolymers of 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole with indenofluoroene (<bold>P3-F</bold>) were shown to be amenable to substitution of both of the fluoro groups upon treatment with excess thiol. Polymers containing fluorinated benzotriazole groups (<bold>P4-F</bold>) were also quantitatively substituted, despite the reduced electron accepting nature of benzotriazole compared to FBT. In both of these examples substitution was shown to result in a significant blue shift of the absorption maxima (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22a and b</xref>), due to a combination of backbone twisting upon inclusion of the larger thioalkyl group and a reduction in the acceptor strength due to the fluoride substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The backbone twisting could be alleviated by inserting a vinylene spacer group between the BT unit and the comonomer (<bold>P5-F</bold>). Upon substitution, little change in the UV–Vis spectrum was observed (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22c</xref>). Notably no side reactions were observed between the thiol and the vinylene groups. Fluorinated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene is a prevalent acceptor in many high performance solar cell-based polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and is also amenable to complete substitution of the fluoride under these conditions (<bold>P6-F,</bold> Supplementary Figure 22d).

Further control experiments, with particles that did not bear azide functional groups, also did not exhibit FRET under similar conditions further indicating that covalent attachment is responsible for the observed effect and that non-specific binding plays an insignificant role (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">37</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Amide bond forming reactions are another extensively used bioconjugation technique and there are many examples of carboxylic acid-coated nanoparticles, including SPNs, that have been functionalised with amines via this method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

However, allowing the EDC coupling of biotin to occur (with 10 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> biotin–NH<sub>2</sub>), then adding DBCO dye gave rise to the characteristic quenching of the donor (nanoparticle) and enhancement of the acceptor (dye) in PL spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).

The capture settings of the NTA were kept consistent for all samples at a screen gain of 1 and a camera level of 11 and the process settings were kept consistent at a screen gain of 11 and a detection threshold of 5. Samples were prepared for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) by drop casting onto TEM grids with holey carbon support films. The imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectoscopy (EDX) was carried out in scanning TEM (STEM) mode using a JEM-2100F microscope at 200 kV. Polystreptavidin test strips were purchased from Mologic and photographs were acquired on the camera of a Samsung S8 mobile phone whilst the strips were illuminated by two 6 W black light bulbs (BLB-T5/6 W) in a dark room.
