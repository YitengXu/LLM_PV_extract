While exploiting energy from sunlight, they co-utilize sugar and CO<sub>2</sub>. This photomixotrophic mode enables fast growth and high cell densities, opening perspectives for sustainable biomanufacturing. The model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 possesses a complex architecture of glycolytic routes for glucose breakdown that are intertwined with the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. To date, the contribution of these pathways to photomixotrophic metabolism has remained unclear.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Here, we developed a comprehensive approach for <sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 during steady state photomixotrophic growth. Under these conditions, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and phosphoketolase (PK) pathways were found inactive but the microbe used the phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) (63.1%) and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPP) shunts (9.3%) to fuel the CBB cycle. Mutants that lacked the ED pathway, the PK pathway, or phosphofructokinases were not affected in growth under metabolic steady-state. An ED pathway-deficient mutant (<italic>Δeda</italic>) exhibited an enhanced CBB cycle flux and increased glycogen formation, while the OPP shunt was almost inactive (1.3%). Under fluctuating light, <italic>∆eda</italic> showed a growth defect, different to wild type and the other deletion strains.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The developed approach, based on parallel <sup>13</sup>C tracer studies with GC–MS analysis of amino acids, sugars, and sugar derivatives, optionally adding NMR data from amino acids, is valuable to study fluxes in photomixotrophic microbes to detail. In photomixotrophic cells, PGI and OPP form glycolytic shunts that merge at switch points and result in synergistic fueling of the CBB cycle for maximized CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. However, redirected fluxes in an ED shunt-deficient mutant and the impossibility to delete this shunt in a GAPDH2 knockout mutant, indicate that either minor fluxes (below the resolution limit of <sup>13</sup>C flux analysis) might exist that could provide catalytic amounts of regulatory intermediates or alternatively, that EDA possesses additional so far unknown functions. These ideas require further experiments.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux

The experimental design was conducted for different flux distributions which all yielded the same findings. One of the scenarios is exemplarily discussed below (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The concurring outcome for the other flux distributions can be taken from the supplement (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figs. S4–S6).

Different setups using different combinations of <sup>13</sup>C tracer substrates and <sup>13</sup>C labelling data were analyzed for achievable flux precision and accuracy, assuming a flux scenario with zero flux through the ED and the PK pathway. Here, the key fluxes of upper and lower carbon metabolism, i.e., through the ED, OPP, EMP, and PK pathways, the CBB cycle, and the TCA cycle, are shown. Each setup was evaluated by a Monte-Carlo approach that mimicked 100 repetitions of the corresponding flux study while taking experimental errors into account. The sensitive substrates [1-<sup>13</sup>C], [3-<sup>13</sup>C], [6-<sup>13</sup>C], and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>] glucose seemed useful for the following reasons.

In short, several triple combinations, each using three of the four tracers, plus the quadruple approach, using all four tracers, appeared useful. Only triple tracer strategies that exclusively relied on labelling data of protein-based amino acids somewhat underestimated the EMP pathway and created larger errors (independent if the <sup>13</sup>C labelling patterns were derived from GC/MS, NMR, or from both tools together). It therefore appeared important to integrate the complementary labelling information from sugars and sugar derivatives. This was likely due to the fact that the analytes glucose (from storage carbohydrates), glucosamine (from cell wall constituents) and ribose (from RNA) represented the <sup>13</sup>C labelling pattern of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and ribose 5-phosphate, respectively, which are central hubs in the photomixotrophic metabolism of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It should be noticed that the addition of NMR-based amino acid labelling patterns, i.e., positional <sup>13</sup>C enrichments, to the data set resulted in the highest precision (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), making this strategy attractive for scenarios that aim at the discrimination of small flux differences. From a practical point of view, the approach four parallel isotope studies on the different tracers plus GC/MS labelling analysis of amino acids, sugars, and sugar derivatives appeared most suitable.

For this purpose, we evaluated changes in the abundance of mass isotopomers upon changes in a flux parameter of interest. Precisely said, the ratio between two different mass isotopomers of the same analyte was considered as readout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Mass isotopomer ratios were sensitively influenced by a change in flux. Exemplified for the ED and the PK pathways, sensitive analytes were amino acids fragments, originating from pyruvate, such as leucine <italic>m/z</italic> 274, and, furthermore, sugar fragments like ribose <italic>m/z</italic> 307 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S7). On a first glance, this suggested the possibility to use such a fragment as indicator for the activity of a certain pathway. However, none of the labelling patterns responded to only one single flux parameter alone because the highly intertwined network structure connected several pathways to the labelling state of a particular analyte. As example, pyruvate (derived amino acids such as leucine) can be derived from glucose through the EMP, the ED, the OPP pathways, and the CBB cycle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, also carbon from the TCA cycle can fuel the pyruvate pool. This made the independent estimation of a single flux parameter infeasible.

From a flux perspective, the sugar (except for a small amount being used for anabolism) exclusively fueled the CBB cycle and thereby maximized the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub>. At the G6P node, the sugar flux was distributed into the PGI shunt (63.1% phosphoglucoisomerase flux) and, to a lesser extent, into the OPP shunt (9.3% G6P dehydrogenase flux). The remaining amount of G6P was used to synthesize glycogen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). At the level of F6P, the glycolytic influx from G6P (63.1%) merged with a slightly higher CBB cycle flux from the carbon-three intermediate GAP (87.2%). GAP itself mainly supplied DHAP (176.9%) toward the formation of S7P via FBP aldolase and ended up in the regeneration phase of the CBB cycle via the action of transketolase (115.7%). Because the ED pathway was inactive, carbon-three intermediates were not generated from 6-phosphogluconate.

In fact, the extra carbon, arriving at the 3PG node, was exclusively cycled back to the regeneration phase of the CBB cycle. Hereby, the flux was distributed among the parallel routes that finally merged at Ru5P, including fine adjustments among pentose isomerases, transaldolase, and the two transketolases in the PP pathway.

A GAPDH2 deletion strain was constructed in this work to get a first impression on the impact of the enzyme. It was unable to grow under photoautotrophic conditions (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This was to be expected as the regeneration of the acceptor for CO<sub>2</sub> should be difficult in this mutant. Under photomixotrophic conditions, i.e., upon addition of glucose in the light, growth of the mutant was (partly) rescued, however, with a significantly impaired growth rate in comparison to the wildtype. This observation confirmed that the supply of carbon via GAPDH2 was crucial to replenish and operate the CBB cycle at full rate. On the other hand, it showed the importance of the glycolytic PGI and OPP shunts which seemingly could serve as a backup to fuel the CBB cycle under photomixotrophic conditions. Notably, it was impossible (four independent trials) to delete <italic>eda</italic> in the <italic>Δgap2</italic> mutant under photoautotrophic or photomixotrophic conditions as the resultant mutants were not viable.

Photomixotrophic metabolism is particularly promising for the future commercialization of cyanobacteria because the co-utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> and organic carbon provides additional building blocks and energy. This mode enables enhanced production and higher cell density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and confers industrial feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Remarkably, photomixotrophic production has increased titers up to five-fold over traditional autotrophic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. To further exploit this growth mode, recent efforts have even installed photomixotrophy in cyanobacteria that are obligate photoautotrophic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Therefore, our approach displays a valuable tool to further characterize and develop cyanobacterial cell factories.

Notably, microbes are well known to compensate the knockout of a pathway by redirecting flux through such alternative routes or redundant enzymes, often without a notifiable growth phenotype.

Likewise, also the PK pathway, phosphofructokinase and malic enzyme appeared dispensable. Under the metabolic steady-state conditions used here, glucose (except for a small fraction used in anabolism) was exclusively fed via the PGI and the oxidative OPP shunts into the CBB cycle. Stoichiometrically, this flux pattern maximized the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and can be regarded optimal about growth efficiency, an important performance indicator when applying cyanobacteria as cell factories.</p><p id="Par32">On a first glance, the lack of detectable fluxes via the ED route in vivo seems to contradict the previously assumed picture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] but a closer inspection of the experimental conditions suggests that the supply with light might render the ED route active or inactive. Here, the microbe was grown under continuous light. In contrast, the previous setup, a several centimeter thick glass tube, was well illuminated only in outer zones, whereas the core of the culture (covering up to 90% of the volume) was darkened (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S11). Cells traveling across the tube, obviously faced dark–light cycles. When mimicking this setup by fluctuating light supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), we could interestingly “activate” the limited growth phenotype of the <italic>∆eda</italic> mutant, observed before under photomixotrophic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It appears possible that the ED pathway gets activated when cells face changing light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Naturally, cyanobacteria frequently face changing light, including fluctuations across time and gradients across space. These changes also occur during cyanobacterial chemical production in bioreactors. Clearly, the microbes must be well prepared to handle such changes.</p><p id="Par33">Mutants in which either the OPP shunt or <italic>eda</italic> were deleted, display a delayed reactivation of the CBB cycle when transferred from darkness to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. It was put forward that the CBB cycle is either replenished via the OPP shunt or a combination of the PGI and ED shunt at the onset of light. Glycogen-derived G6P is decarboxylated via the OPP shunt and directly yields ribulose 5P. However, the PGI shunt yields fructose-6P. To replenish the CBB cycle, two molecules of F6P must be combined with one molecule of GAP (DHAP). Under photomixotrophic steady state conditions, there is a substantial flux via the PGI shunt which merges with GAP (DHAP) from the CBB cycle provided by GAPDH2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The CBB cycle is regulatory tightly connected to the light reaction of photosynthesis. Fluctuating light conditions that perturb photosynthesis and the CBB cycle might transiently cut back the supply of GAP via GAPDH2 from the CBB cycle. It is likely that this is the condition under which the ED shunt gets activated and supplies GAP to be combined with two molecules of F6P from the PGI shunt. In line with this, we were unable to delete <italic>eda</italic> in a <italic>∆gap2</italic> mutant which lacks GAPDH2. This combination plays apparently no or only a minor role under steady state conditions, if the CBB cycle operates smoothly. However, it is highly remarkable, that the OPP shunt is substantially downregulated in <italic>∆eda.</italic> One possible and obvious explanation might be that there is indeed a very small flux via the ED shunt also under steady state conditions (not detectable here), which might result in the accumulation of KDPG, which again remains below detection limits but regulates the first enzyme of the OPP shunt G6P dehydrogenase (<italic>zwf</italic>) as shown for <italic>P. putida</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. This kind of regulation might require only catalytic amounts of KDPG. This idea requires further experimental examinations. However, the downregulation of the OPP shunt in <italic>∆eda</italic> obviously impedes the injection of glucose into the CBB cycle, which results in the formation of higher amounts of glycogen in the mutant and furthermore accelerates CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by enhanced CBB cycle fluxes. It is due to these enhanced CBB cycle fluxes, that the photomixotrophic growth of <italic>∆eda</italic> can keep up with the growth of the WT even though it forms higher amounts of glycogen. However, as soon as conditions get more natural by fluctuating light, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> obviously requires a higher metabolic flexibility and additional glycolytic shunts to counteract these perturbations and keep high growth rates.</p><p id="Par34">Under photoautotrophic conditions, glycolytic routes form as well shortened glycolytic shunts that replenish and fine-tune the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle as anaplerotic reactions to support transitions from darkness to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].

Notably, photomixotrophic steady state growth in these studies differed in light and CO<sub>2</sub> supply. Here (this work) and before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], CO<sub>2</sub> was supplied from the gas phase at atmospheric level, mimicking natural availability. In contrast, other setups supplied elevated amounts of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (2 g L<sup>−1</sup>) under a sealed atmosphere, leading to a markedly increased CO<sub>2</sub> level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Obviously, this boosted CO<sub>2</sub> uptake over glucose uptake, leading to a molar uptake ratio of 6:1 between CO<sub>2</sub> and the sugar; in this work using ambient CO<sub>2</sub> the ratio was only 2:1. In another flux study, CO<sub>2</sub> was even quantitatively removed from the aeration stream so that the cells could only fix CO<sub>2</sub> that stemmed from glucose oxidation, while the light supply (125 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) was more than twice as high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. It seems plausible that these differences affect pathway fluxes.</p><p id="Par38">It was suggested for cyanobacteria that the regeneration of pyruvate from malate may become beneficial when cells enter into a state, in which NADPH needs to be replenished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Photomixotrophy, offering the ability to generate ATP and NAPDH by using light, however, does not appear to trigger NADPH limitation. Under these conditions, the cells even maintain the ATP and NADPH costly recycling of GAP to refuel of the CBB cycle at very high flux (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In this regard it appears that the flux through the OPP shunt (generating less than 10% of the total NADPH) presumably contributed to a coordinated fueling of the CBB cycle, rather than to supply redox power, which would be the case for heterotrophic microbes. The picture could be different for conditions of limiting light, since a dependency of NADPH regeneration on light is known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Here, we assured that cells were constantly supplied with sufficient light, making supply of NADPH from decarboxylating reactions suboptimal due to the loss of carbon. Notably, (under photoautotrophic conditions) the C<sub>4</sub> shunt via malic enzyme responds to light supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Furthermore, also the OPP pathway flux is affected by the inhibition of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

The aim of the simulations was to identify optimum strategies for flux analysis in the photomixotrophic microbe. Different setups using different tracer substrates and labelling data were analyzed for the achievable precision and accuracy to determine a flux scenario with low flux (5%) through the ED and the PK pathway. Key fluxes of upper and lower carbon metabolism, i.e., through ED, PP, EMP, and PK pathways, CBB cycle, and TCA cycle, are shown. Each setup was evaluated by a Monte-Carlo approach that mimicked 100 repetitions of the corresponding flux study while taking experimental errors into account. Double, triple, and quadruple tracer studies were evaluated. The substrates shown here, were [1-<sup>13</sup>C], [3-<sup>13</sup>C], [6-<sup>13</sup>C], and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>] glucose for the following reasons. The combination of [1-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose and [6-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose well discriminated the fluxes through the EMP, the PP, and the ED pathway in glucose-grown pseudomonads, revealing a similarly cyclic pathway architecture as cyanobacteria [42]. Metabolization of [3-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose (based on the underlying carbon transitions) via the ED route should selectively lead to <sup>13</sup>C label enrichment at the C1 of pyruvate (and amino acids derived therefrom), providing a sensitive readout, should this pathway be active. The use of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>] glucose appeared beneficial, likely because it helped to estimate the relative uptake of <sup>13</sup>C sugar versus (non-labelled) CO2, as previously demonstrated for <italic>Basfia succiniciproducens</italic>, grown on sucrose under high rates of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation [22].

Simulating the light supply for this geometry, using the obtained Lambert-Beer correlation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S1), revealed large inner zones of insufficient illumination, when considering the determined threshold of 35 μE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Already at OD750 = 1, cells largely faced limiting light supply, and the light-limited areas became even more pronounced at higher cell concentrations, comprising up to more than 90% of the culture volume. The show modelled light intensity profiles in 200 mL Kniese tubes, illuminated with 50 μE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> from the back and the front side, during cultivation of <italic>Synechocystis </italic>6830. The calculation was based the measured relationship between cell concentration and light absorption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The relative light intensities are encoded by different colour and range from green (100%) to black (0%). The colour code shows all areas, illuminated with a light intensity below 35 μE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and shown to limit growth, in dark. The values were calculated at a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm. <bold>Figure S12. </bold>Southern blot of wildtype (WT) and Δ<italic>gap2</italic>.

This result confirmed that Δ<italic>gap2 </italic>was segregated and that no wild type copies were left. In addition, an unspecific fragment of about 4500 bp was detected in Δ<italic>gap2 </italic>as well. <bold>Figure S13. </bold>Southern blots of wildtype (WT), <italic>Δxfp1 </italic>and <italic>Δxfp1/Δxfp2</italic>.
