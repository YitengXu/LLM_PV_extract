One or both of these cycles govern intertidal organisms’ behaviour and physiology, yet little is known about the molecular clockworks of tidal rhythmicity. Here, we show that the limpet <italic>Cellana rota</italic> exhibits robust tidally rhythmic behaviour and gene expression. We assembled a <italic>de-novo</italic> transcriptome, identifying novel tidal, along with known circadian clock genes. Surprisingly, most of the putative circadian clock genes, lack a typical rhythmicity. We identified numerous tidally rhythmic genes and pathways commonly associated with the circadian clock. We show that not only is the behaviour of an intertidal organism in tune with the tides, but so too are many of its genes and pathways. These findings highlight the plasticity of biological timekeeping in nature, strengthening the growing notion that the role of ‘canonical’ circadian clock genes may be more fluid than previously thought, as exhibited in an organism which has evolved in an environment where tidal oscillations are the dominant driving force.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2018_Article_23167.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="CrossLinking"><sec><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46787-4" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46787-4</ext-link>.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Life on earth has evolved under constant environmental change. The daily, tidal, lunar and annual cycles are the most significant, affecting different life forms in their respective habitats. Consequently, organisms time their biochemical, physiological, and behavioural processes in the most advantageous manner, in phase with the predictable environmental change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, orchestration of the endogenous clock with the environment enhances the organism’s fitness and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Almost all organisms, from bacteria to humans, have evolved an endogenous clock with a periodicity around 24 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, driving high levels of cyclical gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The architecture of circadian clock networks arise from the interactions between two transcriptional/translational feedback loops comprised of positive and negative elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, there are differences in the specific clock components and their interactions between taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The intertidal zone is an exceedingly complex habitat subject to a multitude of cyclic environmental stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The predictable cycle of inundation and exposure brings about rapid changes in temperature, salinity, hydrostatic pressure, food, and predation pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, tidally-timed endogenous rhythms have evolved in most intertidal organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As with the circadian clock, these endogenous rhythms persist for some time under constant conditions without tidal cues, can be entrained by appropriate stimuli, and are temperature compensated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, very little is known about the underlying molecular clockworks of tidal rhythms. Studies on intertidal animals have shown that putative circadian clock genes are not always expressed in a typical circadian pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, applying RNAi silencing on them does not affect circatidal rhythmicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, inhibition of a known circadian clock gene, <italic>Casein kinase I</italic>, lengthens the circatidal rhythm of swimming behaviour in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>pulchra</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, the presence of an independent 12 hour clock has recently been identified in mammalian cells, suggesting a possible evolutionary remnant of an ancient tidal clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, progress is being made toward the characterization of the molecular underpinnings of tidal rhythmicity; however, this field is still in its infancy.</p><p id="Par4">Here we explored the rhythmic behaviour, at sea and in the laboratory, in conjuncture with temporal gene expression profiles of a key intertidal mollusc, the Red-Sea limpet <italic>Cellana rota</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. From an evolutionary perspective, an understanding of tidal clocks is of much importance to the general field of chronobiology. The ‘tidal clock’ governing the rhythms of intertidal organisms is manifested in some of the most ancient animals. Clock mechanisms would have developed before the divergence of the major animal clades, existing in a common ancestor, occupying bodies of water in which tidal cycles would have been as ecologically important, if not more so than the circadian cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> activity in the field</title><p id="Par5">In order to establish the limpet’s rhythmicity under natural conditions we monitored a boulder with a population of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> over an extensive period of time (initially 15–20 individuals, then up to 100 after further settlement; See limpet identification in materials and methods). Time-lapse images of the boulder were taken every 5 min’s, during the day and night. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> exhibited significant tidal rhythmicity throughout all the periods analyzed (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>; Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that limpets have either a circatidal or mixed circatidal/circadian rhythm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> exhibited three locomotor modalities. During most periods there was a clear bimodal tidal periodicity; the first activity bout commencing with the rising tide until immersion, at which point they cease movement. The second bout began with the falling of the tide and continued until the boulder began to dry (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S1B–D,F,H, and I</xref>). During other periods there was a distinct unimodal pattern, whereby the limpets were active between the falling of the tide, throughout most or all of the low tide, and continuing with the rising tide until immersion (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S1E and J</xref>). As the sea level moves from neap (low amplitude) to spring (high amplitude) tide there is a clear shift in behaviour (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S1A and I</xref>). During the third modality, observed only in September and October of 2013, the limpets exhibited tidal rhythmicity with an additional diel component (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1I and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S1G</xref>). During these periods <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> was active at night from the rising of the tide, throughout the entire high tide (immersed) and then ceasing movement as the boulder dried. Activity bouts were significantly longer at night than during the day in September 2013 (Mann-Whitney U test; U = 0, n = 7,4 p = 0.006). Why <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> adopts this diel modality for a short period of time is unclear. Hulings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> reported similar findings during the same period of the year. A possible explanation is a gradual rise in sea level which occurs during September<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The change in sea level may be a cue for some other behaviour, such as breeding, which occurs during the later summer - early winter months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, limpets modulate their optimal timing of activity according to specific local abiotic and biotic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moon phase significantly affects <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> rhythmicity (nested ANOVA; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>F</italic> (5, 8706) = 111.14), the highest proportion of activity being during the first quarter (0.73 ± 0.30; Tukey post-hoc test; p &gt; 0.01 for all comparisons), and the lowest during the full moon (0.32 ± 0.39). Season has an impact on limpet locomotion (nested ANOVA; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>F</italic> (<italic>3</italic>, <italic>8731</italic>)<italic> = </italic>103.04), with a higher proportion of activity during the winter (Tukey post-hoc test; Winter &gt; Autumn &gt; Summer &gt; Spring; p &lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons). Similar seasonal patterns of activity have been observed in other limpet species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Given Eilat’s arid climate, with high temperatures and desiccation stress in the spring and summer, this behaviour pattern seems favorable. Thus <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> adopts a range of temporally distinct rhythmic patterns in its natural environment, revealing a complex and sophisticated plasticity of rhythmic behavior which takes into consideration a range of short and long term rhythmic environmental variables.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>Cellana rota</italic> behaviour in the field.

Limpets collected directly from the sea and placed under constant and varying light conditions maintained a significant circatidal rhythm (~12.4 h) for at least several cycles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Exp. 1–3). A previous study showed that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radiata</italic> (junior synonym of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic>) has an endogenous circatidal rhythm of oxygen consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A second significant ~8 hour activity peak was also present in some of the limpets (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Exp. 2; Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S5</xref>), with a further fraction being arrhythmic. Circatidal rhythms are known to be notoriously noisy and often mixed with other apparently non-environmental periodicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a recent study on mammalian cells found robust 24, as well as 12 and 8 hour rhythms with potential biological significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. From an evolutionary perspective there is presumably an adaptive advantage to a wide-ranging repertoire of ‘circa’ periodicities, particularly when residing in a complex environment such as the intertidal zone. After establishing their rhythm immediately post collection and ruling out the effect of light phase as an entraining cue, concurring with the majority of our observations in nature, experiments were conducted in order to entrain the limpets to a simulated tidal spray (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Exp. 2–4). The limpets were maintained under constant spray and light conditions (DD) for 2 weeks prior to entrainment in an attempt to desynchronize their rhythm. As expected, during the initial constant phase, most of the limpets exhibited no significant rhythmicity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Interestingly, some still maintained significant circatidal rhythmicity even after a month in seclusion from any apparent tidal cues. Once starting the spray entrainment regime, the limpets regained significant circatidal rhythmicity, with several remaining arrhythmic (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Finally, the limpets, which were previously entrained, were monitored once again under constant spray and light conditions.

There are significantly more cycling genes during midday compared to night (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C and E</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.4, df = 1, p &lt; 0.0001). These findings are in good agreement with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic>’s dominant tidal rhythmicity in nature and the laboratory. Furthermore, our 4 hour sampling resolution provides more statistical power to 24-hour over 12-hour genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, thereby reinforcing our result that there are many more tidal than diel cyclers. In stark contrast, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>californianus</italic> was found to exhibit ~10 times more circadian than tidally oscillating transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Invariably, the fundamental differences between mobile and sessile organisms inhabiting the tidal zone will contribute to this major difference. There is presumably a far greater adaptive value to having an accurate circatidal timepiece in mobile intertidal animals who can relocate and chose when and where to be active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A fundamental and unresolved issue is whether circadian and circatidal rhythms are governed by the same, shared, or unrelated mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We identified 12 transcripts with a significant tidal rhythmicity, which are related to the circadian clock mechanism at varying levels of importance, as well as several others involved in anaerobic metabolism, hypoxia/oxidative stress, biomineralization and calcium signaling (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). Among them, we identified one putative circadian clock gene, P<italic>rotein phosphatse 4c</italic>, which is involved in circadian period length (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. <italic>COP9 signalosome complex subunit 8</italic> (<italic>CSN8</italic>) was one of the most robust tidal cyclers in our analysis.

A sampling of limpets was conducted from three locations along the Eilat shore – IUI, Marine Observatory and the north shore marina. See below for further details.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Field observations</title><p id="Par11">A population of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> was monitored over the course of the years 2012–2015. A boulder with a stable <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> population was found on the border between the IUI marine laboratory and the Eilat marine observatory (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). In order to constantly monitor the limpet’s movements on the boulder we used a trail-camera (Trophy Cam HD; Buschnell co.; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The camera was placed in a custom made waterproof housing. The housing was mounted on a galvanized iron pole which was welded into a boulder adjacent to the target one. The camera was positioned approximately 1 meter above the target boulder at a slight angle in order to maximize the field of view (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and was set to take an image every 5 minutes during the day and night (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C and D</xref>). At night the camera employs an IR flash (850 nm) which is invisible to the human eye. Previous studies have shown that limpets are not sensitive to IR wavelengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Our preliminary observations concurred with this as we did not notice any irregular behavior from limpets which were shone with an IR lamp of the same wavelength. The limpets were identifiable from both the day (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) and night (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>) images. The acquired images were saved on a memory stick in the camera and downloaded periodically. The camera was powered by 12 AA batteries, enabling several weeks of image acquisition. In practice, periodical camera failures (presumably due to prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures) reduced the total time of camera activity. Thus, approx. 300 days of images were acquired at a 5 minute resolution, equaling some 100,000 images. In total, 33 entire days were quantified, during 10 periods of time. Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> presents a list of periods for which images were acquired and analyzed (further details below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Behavioural analysis – Movement</title><p id="Par12">In order to assess and quantify the rhythmic behaviour of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> we gathered time-lapse images as described above. The movement of the limpets was quantified manually as the high levels of “noise” (changes in light, water spray, algal growth, other animal movement etc.) inhibited the use of a computer based program as was used in the lab (see below). Movement was defined as any observable relocation from one point to another, or rotational movement at a particular point (commonly observed limpet behaviour). Since it was not possible to observe the boulder in its entirety, and it was only monitored from one angle, the analysis was conducted at the population and not individual level. Quantification of this nature is most common in limpet studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Thus, we noted the total number of limpets, and those moving between one image to the next and calculated the fraction of active limpets. Individuals often moved down a side of the boulder and were “lost”, thus only the number of visible limpets out of the total observed at a given time was recorded. The angle of the camera gave coverage of over 60% of the boulder, hence we felt confident that what we observe reflects the total activity on the boulder. Over the course of the study visual inspections were conducted around the boulder, above and below the water, during day and night, in order to verify this. A total of 10 periods, at different stages of the tidal phase and year were analyzed (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). After scoring the behavior further analyses were conducted (see Statistical analyses).

Artificial sea water was prepared from an instant mix (Red-Sea Co.) and maintained at the same salinity as in Eilat (40 ppm). Since the aquariums were not connected to an external reservoir, water changes were conducted every other day. Salinity, pH and other chemical water tests were conducted regularly and maintained at the recommended levels. Evaporation was compensated by a float connected to a purified water tap. Water and air temperature were maintained at stable levels throughout each trial, corresponding to those in Eilat for each collection period. Each aquarium was 1/3 filled with water. Preliminary observations and trials indicated that this was the optimal water level as the limpets spend the majority of time on the interface between the water and air or on the sprayed surface out of the water. The experimental setup was placed in a dark room with the windows and door covered in order to attain optimal control of the lighting conditions per experiment. Up to 15 limpets were held in each holding aquarium. Limpets held in the general holding aquarium were placed to adhere on the walls of the tank. Prior to the limpets’ collection algae was grown on the walls of the aquarium for grazing. The experimental tanks were identical to the holding ones but had in addition a slab of glass, matching the height and width of the aquarium, divided into five 10 centimeters wide, 50 centimeters long arenas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Thin glass barriers were used to define the arenas and prevent the limpets moving from one arena to the other. One limpet was placed in each arena, adhered to the wall of the glass slab. As with the holding tanks, algae were grown on the glass slabs prior to the experiments. Unsurprisingly, initial observations suggested that without algae for grazing the limpets would move very little. A timer controlled fluorescent lamp was placed above the aquarium and set according to the specific experimental conditions for each trial (LL – constant light, LD – 12:12 hour light dark, or DD – constant darkness). Typically, 2 adjacent aquariums were used for the experiments, allowing for a total of 10 individual limpets. Three 880 nm IR LED arrays (IR-56, Microlight infrared illuminators) were equally spaced behind the aquarium setup to provide illumination for the video tracking (details below). A sheet of white plastic was taped to back of each aquarium in order to maximize the diffusion of IR illumination around the arenas. As mentioned above, this wavelength is unobtrusive to the limpets.</p><p id="Par16">Preliminary observations suggested that the limpets would move very little unless there was a constant spray of water on them. Previous studies in similar limpet species have indicated as much<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. A spray system was devised to this end. A 350 Liter/hour power head pump (ViaAqua Co.) was placed in the front corner of each aquarium so as to not obstruct the view of the limpets. The pump was connected to a plastic tube which was ran along the side of the aquarium and then along the entire length of the tanks back wall (above where the limpets were placed). Five small garden drippers (Netafim Co.) with a 5-millimeter opening were connected to the main tube at equal spaces, each right above one of the five arenas. Consequently, it was possible to provide a constant spray of water on the limpets and keep the algae grown walls moist. Initial calibrations were conducted to optimize the water flow. This spray system was always on except for tidal entrainment experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p id="Par17">The primary purpose of the behavioral assays was to establish whether the limpets possess an endogenous clock (circadian and/or circatidal).

Each high tide was approximately 12.4 hours apart, and with a daily shift forward of ~50 minutes. The spray was timed to turn on 1.5 hours before high tide, and turn off 1.5 hours after high tide, mimicking the average time spent by the limpets awash during a typical tidal cycle (corroborated with field observations). The purpose of this stage was to see if the limpets would entrain to the artificial rhythmic cue provided.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Constant conditions (spray and light) – This stage was aimed at seeing whether the limpets indeed became entrained to the previous stages manipulation.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par22">Upon completion of each trial the limpets were returned to the holding tanks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Acquisition setup, data collection and analysis</title><p id="Par23">We employed the video based tracking system Ethovision XT10 (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands) for the monitoring of limpet movement during the trials. Limpets were placed in an aquarium, as described above, and were tracked using Ethovision. The limpets were placed in the aquarium at least 2 hours before the start of a trial in order to acclimatize. Two Panasonic CCTV video cameras (WV-CL930/G) were positioned in front of the aquarium, one per tank (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The cameras had a 4.5–12.5 mm lens (Computar, Japan), enabling an adequate field of view. The cameras were placed on tripods and secured in place. An 850 nm IR filter (RG850, Heliopan Gmbh, Germany) was fixed to the lens of each camera in order to enable tracking of the IR illuminated aquarium, and at the same time prevent the change in ambient lighting conditions interfere with the tracking. The cameras were connected to PC (Dell Precision T3500) and controlled via Ethovision. The detection setting of the program was set to detect moving black pixels. As the application of the Ethovision tracking system in limpets is novel, a series of calibrations was required in order to best utilize the setup for our purposes. Ethovision is commonly used for either fully dry or fully wet conditions. The application at hand, with changes in water level and constant spray, required some challenging adaptations. In order to calibrate the signal to noise ratio and detection settings of the program, immobile and mobile limpets were monitored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. To set the lowest threshold of activity for distance (measured in centimeters), the basal activity of 10 immobile limpets was measured for 10 minutes. The average values of “immobile” movement were defined as the lowest threshold of activity and concurred with visual observations conducted at the time. The program parameters for detection were set as follows: grayscale, range set between 1 and 100, subject size of minimum 1 pixel and maximum 8,000 pixels, contour erosion set at 1, contour dilation set at 5, pixel smoothing, and video sample rate of 1 frame per second. These parameters were tweaked for each particular trial as the difference in limpet size and algae background required slight alterations. After setting up the detection settings each trial was recorded. Typically, the program only records the tracking information and not the entire video recording due to the large volume of computer space required. For some of the trials video recording was also conducted in order to verify the tracking. Also, once recorded it is possible to re run the tracking under different parameters in cases where a limpet was ‘lost’ during the original experiment.</p><p id="Par24">After the completion of a trial the raw tracking data was subjected to the programs filtering as follows: distance threshold set at 0.08 cm; time threshold, averaging interval of 1, start velocity of 0.1 cm/s, and stop velocity of 0.09 cm/s; nested movement calculation set for not moving. The data were converted into 10 min time bins for further analysis. Smoothing (lowess) was set based on 10 samples before and after every sample point. This step further insures the elimination of noise. In the event tracking was lost for small periods of time the interpolation function was implemented. These changes were verified on the video recordings when available. The data was then exported to Excel (Microsoft) for further analysis. The cleaned movement data was plotted against the time, sea level (at collection location; sea level data was downloaded from <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.meteo-tech.co.il/eilat-yam/eilat_en.asp" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.meteo-tech.co.il/eilat-yam/eilat_en.asp</ext-link>), light phase, and experimental spray cycle if altered.

Individuals of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> were collected directly from the sea. For this purpose, an appropriate collection site was identified. An emphasis was placed on conducting the sampling at a site as close and as similar as possible to the one used for the behavioural observations. We chose two adjacent boulders with large <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> populations (&gt;200) opposite the IUI – Marine laboratory, approximately 100 meters south of the boulder used for monitoring behaviour. The limpets were sampled on two occasions, a week apart, at 4 hour intervals during two consecutive days (24 sampling points × 5 limpets = 120 samples). The first sampling started on the 25/12/2012 at 06:00 and ended on the 27/12/2012 at 02:00. The second sampling was conducted between the 1/1/2013 at 06:00 and the 3/1/2013 at 02:00. The weather during over the course of the collection was fairly constant, very partial cloud cover with no rain. The air temperature ranged between 17–20 degrees Celsius, and the sea temperature was constant around 23 degrees Celsius. The first week sampling was conducted during the waxing, three days right before a full moon (92–99% illumination), and during the second sampling the moon was waning (85–68% illumination). The rationale behind the sampling times was that the solar day length between one week to the next changes very little. However, the tidal phase shifts approximately 50 minutes forward every day. So, for example, a sampling during the first week at 10:00 would be high tide, whereas during the second week it would be low tide. Thus, by sampling at the same solar times during the two weeks we would be able to identify both tidal and diel rhythmic genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>RNA extraction</title><p id="Par30">Total RNA was isolated from each of the collected limpets separately. Each limpet was removed from the freezer and placed on ice. Using a scalpel, each limpet was removed from its shell and head cut off right above the “shoulder” mark. In order to minimize the chances of contamination from consumed food the head was chosen for extraction. Also, preliminary extractions suggested this amount of tissue provides more than enough RNA for further use. The extraction was conducted with a Total RNA Mini kit (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Each RNA extraction was divided into three aliquots and frozen (−80 degrees Celsius). Electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel was run to check for RNA degradation. NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) was used to estimate concentration as well as to obtain the purity A260/A280 ratio (&gt;2.00). All the samples were then analyzed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to confirm adequate RNA integrity. Commonly, RNA with a RIN &gt; 9 is considered undamaged and adequate for further use. The RIN is calculated as a function of the 28 s/18 s rRNA ration. However, in the case of some protostomes, molluscs among them, the 28 s peak is not clearly visible or absent, resulting in a very low RIN number. The denaturative hydrogen bond breaks due to the extraction process, causing co-migration of the 18 S and 28 S bands, thus often only one clear peak is evident. Consequently, the 28 s/18 s rRNA ratio and RIN are not applicable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.

JTK_Cycle is a statistical non-parametric based algorithm designed to efficiently identify and characterize cycling variables in large data sets. We used the aforementioned transcript list with expression values for each of the samples time points. We conducted two separate analyses of the data. The first analysis was performed in order to detect tidally oscillating transcripts. The data collections of the two 48 hour samplings were considered to be biological replicates. They were staggered to align tidal phase change between sampling weeks. Thus from 24 time points (12 per sampling) the rhythmicity was computed for 13 total time points, 2 replicates in the middle, and one at each end. The parameters were set at detection of 12 hour oscillations. For the diel analysis the two samplings were considered as biological replicates and averaged, resulting in 12 time points. The parameters were set at detection of 24 hour oscillations. For both the tidal and diel analyses we only looked for transcripts with a precise 12 or 24 hour rhythm, and not a range (e.g. 10–14 or 20–28 hours) as is commonplace. This was done primarily to further ensure a small but high confidence data set. A total of 38,482 transcripts were applied to the analysis, including transcripts with no or low confidence annotation. For both analyses only transcripts with an expression median &gt; 0 were used. Amplitude confidence level set at 95%. For both analyses we assessed the number of significant cycling transcripts, taking into account the false detection ratio (q values; Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). All transcripts with a resulting p &lt; 0.005 (corresponding to q ≥ 0.48 for the tidal and q ≥ 0.78 for the diel analyses) were considered as confident cyclers. The FDR is crucial when dealing with large genomic experiments, and the choice of threshold is experiment dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. For the purpose of investigating genes of interest that arose from the analyses were retained the stringent filtering methods mentioned above, however for the purpose of creating heat maps we did not use these measures as the transcripts with a low confidence annotation are presumably <italic>bona fide</italic> cycling transcripts unique to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rota</italic> proteome with little or no similarity to the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> or Uniprot databases.

The IPA canonical pathways display genes/proteins involved, their interactions and the cellular and metabolic reactions in which the pathway is involved.

In addition we further filtered the gene list in order to assure the validity of the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> annotations, removing those with a low confidence sequence identity and coverage, resulting in 260 tidal and 150 diel cyclers, respectively. The analysis was run against the curated IPA database using default settings. Expression values were z-score normalized and a comparison was conducted in order to identify enriched pathways with a significant differential expression between the sampled time points (13 tidal and 12 diel, as above). We further noted IPA’s predicted upstream regulators.
