The weakly oxidized copper thin film sandwiched between zinc oxide films exhibits good optoelectrical performance (an average transmittance of 83% over the visible spectral range of 400–800 nm and a sheet resistance of 9 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>) and strong oxidation resistance.

A flexible transparent conducting electrode (FTCE) is required to obtain the high electrical conductivity, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility and long-term chemical stability that cannot be achieved using conventional single-film-type transparent conducting oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO). At present, the best FTCEs are based on an expensive metal, Ag, in the form of nanopatterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and continuous films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Carbon-based FTCEs, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, exhibit optoelectrical properties that are far inferior to those of Ag-based FTCEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Considering that FTCEs are one of the most expensive components in optoelectronic devices, it is important to replace the currently available Ag-based FTCEs with an alternative that is based on a low-cost electrode material.</p><p id="Par4">Cu has received much attention as a promising candidate for replacing Ag within FTCEs because of its low electrical resistivity (1.68 μΩ cm at 25 °C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> that is comparable to that of Ag (1.59 μΩ cm at 20 °C), and its competitive cost, which is ∼100 times less than that of Ag (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Among the various possible Cu-based FTCEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, optimal optoelectrical performances have been achieved using Cu nanowires with transmittances of 80% at sheet resistances of ∼20 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). However, these values are far inferior to those of Ag-based FTCEs that exhibit transmittances greater than 90% at sheet resistances much lower than 20 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). In addition to the high propensity of Cu to oxidize under ambient conditions, the unique structure of Cu nanowires, with large surface areas and nanoscopic diameters, triggers oxidation on exposure to ambient environments, which seriously degrades their electrical conductance. There have been several efforts to resolve the oxidation problems in Cu electrodes without any significant accompanying degradation of their optoelectrical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Recently, Wiley <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the protection of Cu nanowire films against oxidation through the electrodeposition of transition metal shells, followed by shell oxidation, on the nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Hatton <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that highly conductive ultrathin Cu films can form when using a molecular adhesive layer, and their oxidation can be passivated effectively by coating with a sub-1-nm-thick aluminium oxide film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, an effective solution that allows the fabrication of highly transparent and conductive Cu-based FTCEs with long-term stability has not yet been established.</p><p id="Par5">The insertion of Cu between transparent oxide films in the form of a continuous, smooth and ultrathin film in an oxide–metal–oxide configuration could be a realistic approach for use in preventing Cu oxidation by inhibiting the penetration of molecules of oxygen and water vapour via the encapsulation of the Cu by the oxide films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. An oxide–metal–oxide structure that contains a ductile metal layer also provides improved structural durability against serious mechanical deformation when compared with single-film-type oxide electrodes. However, despite the advantages presented by Cu-based oxide–metal–oxide electrodes, these have not been widely accepted as FTCEs because of their poor optoelectrical performance compared with the aforementioned alternate FTCEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A deleterious compromise between optical transmittance and electrical conductivity is inevitable in the case of Cu films because an increase in the film thickness, accompanied by a strong reduction in the transmittance, is necessary to improve conductivity. Therefore, achieving a completely continuous and smooth Cu film with an ultralow thickness that is far lower than any thickness value ever reported for continuous Cu films is viewed as an essential requirement for the development of competitive, efficient Cu film-based FTCEs. However, because Cu, along with Ge (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>), Ni (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>) and Cr (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>) is considered to present excellent wettability on heterogeneous surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, further improvements in wettability present a challenge, and no currently available technique provides a solution to this issue.</p><p id="Par6">Here we disclose that a completely continuous and smooth Cu film was produced at an ultralow thickness of ∼2 nm as a result of a significant improvement in the wettability of the Cu that was sandwiched between two ZnO films. This development was achieved through a significant improvement in film wettability owing to the successful suppression of nanoscopic cluster migration with limited Cu oxidation during the very early stages of Cu growth, and without any degradation in its electrical conductivity. We found that coalescence between neighbouring Cu clusters through active surface migrations, known to occur universally during the nucleation and early growth stages in conventional metal deposition processes, was substantially suppressed in our weakly oxidized Cu (Cu(O)) films. The oxide–metal–oxide FTCE that employed an ultrathin Cu(O) film exhibited excellent optoelectrical properties, which far surpassed the best values previously reported for any Cu-based electrode. A flexible organic solar cell employing the Cu(O)-based oxide–metal–oxide FTCE exhibited a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.5%, outperforming a flexible organic solar cell that used an ITO electrode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication of an ultrathin Cu(O) Film</title><p id="Par7">To fabricate continuous, ultrathin Cu films, a method is required to suppress growth in the Volmer–Webber mode, which is described as a three-dimensional (3D)-island growth, during the growth of the metal on heterogeneous substrates. Very recently, we reported the possible suppression of the 3D-island growth mode in oxygen-doped Ag films; however, the exact role of oxygen doping in this morphological improvement was not clearly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate that the abrupt morphological transition from rough and granular 3D films to highly smooth and continuous two-dimensional (2D) films during the very early growth stages is facilitated by limiting the oxidation of Cu films using precisely controlled oxygen doses.</p><p id="Par8">This morphological transition was observed using ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM972">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>). The oxidation level of the Cu films was controlled by introducing a mixture of Ar and O<sub>2</sub> gases with various input O<sub>2</sub>/Ar flow ratios during the reactive sputtering process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM972">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This was evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM972">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) and Cu 2<italic>p</italic> peak spectra measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM972">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The optimal oxidation levels of the Cu films were achieved using O/Cu ratios of 5.0% and 6.3%, represented as Cu(O=5.0%) and Cu(O=6.3%), respectively. This approach ensured that oxygen inclusion in the Cu films was relatively low to minimize deterioration of the electrical conductivity. The continuous Cu(O) films exhibited a smaller percolation threshold thickness compared with that of the pure Cu film (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–l</xref>). Ultrathin continuous films of 2.5 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) and 1.5 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>) were achieved for Cu(O=5.0%) and Cu(O=6.3%), respectively. However, a continuous pure Cu film was only obtained at thicknesses greater than 5 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c–d</xref>). The morphologies of the Cu(O) films, which contained much smaller and flatter granules than the Cu film, were effective in reducing the surface roughness (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m–o</xref>). The root-mean-square roughness was estimated to be ∼0.3 nm for a 5-nm-thick Cu(O=5.0%) film, whereas that of a Cu film of the same thickness was estimated to be ∼0.6 nm.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Morphology of Cu and Cu(O) films.</title><p>Field-emission scanning electron microscopy images showing morphological differences between 1.5-, 2.5-, 5.0- and 7.0-nm-thick (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>) pure Cu, (<bold>e</bold>–<bold>h</bold>) Cu(O=5.0%) and (<bold>i</bold>–<bold>l</bold>) Cu(O=6.3%) films deposited on 20-nm-thick ZnO films.

The distinct morphologies of the Cu and Cu(O=5.0%) films could be ascribed to differences in the coalescence between neighbouring nanoscopic metal clusters. It is generally accepted that the formation of noble metal films is a result of drastic and uncontrollable cluster coalescence that occurs immediately after saturation of the nucleation. The FE-SEM images (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a–h</xref>) demonstrate that the early growth of pure Cu was accompanied by coalescence between neighbouring clusters via the active migration of nanoscopic island-like Cu clusters, as described by the well-known process of cluster-mobility coalescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This cluster coalescence induced a continuous increase in the size of the evolving clusters, accompanied by a reduction in the cluster density. The cluster size of the Cu film exhibited a continuous evolution, even when the film reached a thickness of 5 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a–d</xref>). Meanwhile, the evolution of the Cu(O) films exhibited a distinct coalescence mechanism, which indicated coalescence via a neck (or bridge) connection between neighbouring clusters, without active cluster migration (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e–h</xref>). The clusters in the Cu(O) film were connected by irregularly shaped necks, even at a low thickness of 1.5 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). A continuous Cu(O) film evolved at a thickness of 2.5 nm because of the successive growth of the necks (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>); this is known to consequently reduce the total surface energy of the cluster geometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The suppression of cluster migration was confirmed by the cluster size, which was clearly smaller than that of Cu clusters at the same thickness. Once the film formed a continuous morphology at a thickness of 2.5 nm, there were no obvious changes in the cluster size and density of the evolving Cu(O).

The multilayers were subsequently deposited under vacuum conditions. The ITO film was deposited using an ITO target (Advanced Nano Products Co, Ltd) in the sputtering system under the same sputtering conditions used for the ZnO films. The electrodes were deposited on 125-μm-thick PET substrates (Panac Co, Ltd). The oxygen concentrations of the Cu and Cu(O) films were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Escalab 200 R, VG Scientific) measurements with a scan pass energy of 100 eV at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The highly magnified surface morphologies of the Cu and Cu(O) films were observed using UHR FE-SEM (S-5500, Hitachi Co.) at the Jeonju Center of the Korea Basic Science Institute (Jeonju, Republic of Korea). The surface morphologies were also investigated by tapping mode AFM (NX10, Park System) using a tip with a radius of curvature of less than 10 nm. The surface roughness was averaged from the field of view of at least three different 1 μm × 1 μm surface domains (scan areas) for each sample, using a formula for the root-mean-square height of the surface. The crystallography of the 200-nm-thick Cu and Cu(O) films with different oxygen concentrations was determined in the 2<italic>θ</italic> range of 30–60° using GI-XRD (PANalytical, Empyrean) using Cu K<sub>α</sub> radiation (1.54 Å) at the Daegu Center of the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu, Republic of Korea). The ratio of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu phases was determined from the Cu<sub>2</sub>O(111) and Cu(111) intensities that were obtained using a single X-ray diffraction measurement for each sample. The thicknesses of the thin films were determined using X-ray reflectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM972">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>) at the aforementioned Institute or by surface profiler (P-11, KLA-Tencor) measurements. The total transmittance and reflection spectra were determined in the wavelength range of 300–2,200 nm using ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrophotometry (Cary Series, Agilent Technologies). The spectra were measured by excluding the spectra of the PET substrates. The optical absorbance was determined by ascertaining the total transmission and reflection. The sheet resistance was measured using a four-point probe system (MCP-T600, Mitsubishi Chemical Co). The results obtained from three specimens with dimensions of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm were averaged for each electrode sample. The carrier concentration and mobility were determined through the van der Pauw method using a Hall-effect measurement system (8400 series HMS, Lake Shore Cryotronics Inc.). The ultraviolet radiation test was carried out using a fluorescent lamp (Vilber Lourmat, VL-4.LC) with a power of 4 W at a light wavelength of 365 nm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Organic solar cell fabrication and characterization</title><p id="Par20">PTB7-Th (1-material Chemscitech Inc.) and PC<sub>71</sub>BM (Solemme BV) were mixed at a ratio of 8 mg:12 mg in chlorobenzene (1 ml) solution. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 12 h, and Diphenyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich) was subsequently added at a volume ratio of 3%. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM solution was filtered using a 0.2-μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) syringe filter and subsequently spin-coated on the FTCEs at 600–1,200 r.p.m. for 40 s in a glove box. The thickness of the deposited active layer was <italic>ca</italic>. 100 nm with thickness deviations of within 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM972">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). A layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was deposited from a solution mixture of PEDOT:PSS and isopropyl alcohol with a ratio of 1:10. The samples were dried in a glove box at 80 °C for 10 min. Finally, to fabricate the top electrode of the solar cells, using a shadow mask, a Ag metal layer was deposited by thermal evaporation of Ag at 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Torr; the size of the solar cell device was defined using a metal aperture mask with a size of 0.38 cm<sup>2</sup>. The <italic>J−V</italic> characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit under the illumination of an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) with an intensity of 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, which was calibrated using a standard PV reference monocrystalline silicon solar cell (2 cm × 2 cm) that was guaranteed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, Colorado, USA). The external quantum efficiency spectra were determined by a solar cell spectral response/QE/IPCE measurement system (PV Measurements Inc.). The series resistance was determined from the slope of the dark current curves, and the IPCE spectra were determined by a quantum efficiency measurement system (Oriel IQE-200) with a monochromator, an optical chopper, a lock-in amplifier, a calibrated silicon photodetector and a 250-W quartz tungsten halogen lamp as the light source. Five samples were characterized and the average results were recorded for each solar cell. The mechanical flexibility of the solar cells fabricated on the PET substrates was determined as a function of the bending radius using an irreversible two-point bending test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional information</title><p id="Par21"><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Zhao, G. <italic>et al</italic>.
