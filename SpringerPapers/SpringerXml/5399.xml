One of the main objective is to rehabilitate/increase the density of existing network, by providing data from new sites and from sites that are difficult to access and inhospitable. Despite the increasing number of AWS’s deployed, many remote sites are still not covered by surface observations. The goal is to improve AWS network planning, especially in regions where the scarcity of local trained personnel and funding availability to manage the instrumentation are relevant issues. Some consultancies performed in the past aimed to support, remotely and/or locally, National weather services, Public agencies, Local authorities and International organizations in defining and evaluating AWS’s siting and selection. The efficacy of the results mainly depends on the accurate choice of the sites of installation (network plan), on the correct selection and description of instrumentation type to prepare the international tenders, on the training process to improve the AWS’s management efficiency. The present chapter would discuss some of the main issues arisen from the experience gained during the institutional activities and consultancies in international projects.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Remote</kwd><kwd>Automatic weather station</kwd><kwd>Sensor</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-319-59096-7_Chapter_2.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An automatic weather station (AWS) is defined as a “meteorological station at which observations are made and transmitted automatically” (WMO 1992a). Despite the increasing number of AWS’s deployed, many remote areas are not covered yet by surface observations. The lack of local trained personnel and funding availability to manage the instrumentation, together with the risks associated with the safety of the equipment in remote and possibly insecure areas, represent the most relevant constraints. All the National weather services, public agencies, domestic organizations share these problems resulting more acute in developing countries (DC).</p><p id="Par3">Furthermore to introduce and understand the role that AWS’s can play in DC, we cannot limit ourselves to evaluate the performances of a standard AWS, but we should put them in the local specific context. As such the AWS “per se” do not change the efficiency of a Meteorological/Hydrological/AgroMeteorological Service if:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par4">They are not combined with others technologies such as computer science, remote sensing, GIS;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par5">the preparation of personnel is not very different from the past in terms of ability to deal with computers, electronic instrumentation, data transmission, data analysis, data combining on a geographical basis, choice and adaptation of models;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par6">there is not an international effort to prepare the tools such as manuals, software and learning procedures, to train personnel in an efficient and modern way (Maracchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par7">FAO, GIZ, ICIMOD, AghryMet, World Bank, are international organizations that promote projects and cooperation, to sustain local Authorities in developing affordable weather observing networks. The efficacy of the results mainly depends on the sensors/systems selection (technical specifications), the accurate choice of the sites of installation and the evaluation of the observation network sustainability (economic and technical).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Why RAWS?</title><p id="Par8">In the international scenario of AWS’s, most of the developed countries have gone in for automation in their surface observational system since early 1970s. Countries like USA, Australia, Canada, China, India and many European countries are in the forefront. At the same time, it should be noted that no country has completely withdrawn their existing set-up of conventional surface observatories (WMO ET-AWS Final report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>). AWS are being installed to enhance their meteorological observational network and many countries have their AWS installed in Antarctica or other reference sites (i.e. Himalaya, Nepal—EVK2CNR, Pyramid laboratory–Italy) for research purposes. Though AWS is unmanned by design, to check its security, exposure conditions and to do preventive maintenance, inspections to the sites are required for the upkeep of the AWS.</p><p id="Par9">Moreover the availability of though, low power electronic equipment, encouraged the installation of RAWS’s. In the past years, consultancies that I provided for FAO to draw technical specifications for AWS and AHyS to be installed in Northern Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan confirmed this trend.</p><p id="Par10">Example of RAWS networks are HKH-HYCOS (Regional Flood Information System Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.icimod.org/hycos" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.icimod.org/hycos</ext-link>), SHARE (Station at High Altitude for Research on the Environment), SNOTEL (Snow Telemetry, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/</ext-link>), THAMO (Trans-African HydroMeteorological Observatory (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.thamo.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.thamo.org</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par11">WMO Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS) aims at an improved collaboration and coordination between NMHSs and relevant national and regional organizations. It embraces the Global Observing System (GOS), the observing component of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the WMO Hydrological Observing Systems (including the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS)) and the observing component of the Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW)—(<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/wigos/wir/index_en.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/wigos/wir/index_en.html</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par12">Snowfall/snow depth measurements, undisturbed air quality observations, climate change studies, lead to select remote sites for ideal displacement of sensors (Nitu and Wong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). Even agrometeorology and hydrology applications are often dealing with the remoteness of rivers, valleys, mountains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transition from Manual to AWS</title><p id="Par13">The WMO ET-AWS-5 Geneva 2008 (WMO report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>), agreed that human observers were able to integrate and classify a wide range of information needed for full description of weather events. With the advent of AWS, particular areas such as visual observations, cloud classification and weather type identification are handled poorly or not at all, by an AWS unattended by observer. On the other hand, AWS provide benefits in frequent, regular, objective and consistent measurements and can be located in any environment, including extremely remote and harsh conditions.</p><p id="Par14">The transition to AWS is often instigated by a perception that these systems are cheaper to operate and easier to manage than human observers. This was not the experience of a number of member countries. Therefore, it identified a number of responsibilities and costs that may not be immediately apparent to those that adopt automatic systems. (Shanko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">The change for automation is a reality in all networks (India, Nepal, Lebanon, Niger, Ethiopia, etc.) and the careful management of the transition process is needed to protect data user needs. Canada created a Change Management Board (CMB), to provide a forum for network planners, operational managers and data stakeholders to discuss strategic issues regarding the transition process.</p><p id="Par16">Before embarking on automation of their network, Members and/or local organizations should consider (i) the resource requirements, (ii) potential gains and losses, (iii) how to manage this transition, (iv) Training/professional improvement, (v) homogenization of different datasets.</p><p id="Par17">M.J. Molineaux (Molineaux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>) suggested a preliminary list of guidelines which would assist in the process of converting to automatic systems:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par18">Management of network change</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Defining and assigning responsibilities</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">System costing</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Parallel testing (Traditional vs. automatic)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">Metadata</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Data quality and reliability</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">User requirements</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Access to data and metadata</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par26">In the last years, many AWS manufacturers have improved their products, allowing researchers, field assistants and operators to set up unattended data collection with several options depending on the field of application. Despite the availability of relatively cost-effective automatic stations, traditional instruments can still play an important role, as an alternative or back-up for the automatic network, especially in areas where a lack of personnel trained in electronic equipment is a limiting factor (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 2.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between traditional and automatic system</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Advantages</p></th><th align="left"><p>Disadvantages</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Manual recording</p><p>(Direct reading)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Simple use</p><p>Rapid installation</p><p>Immediate utilisation</p><p>Reliability</p><p>No power required</p></td><td align="left"><p>It needs an operator for data observations</p><p>Slow data transfer from paper reports.

The meeting considered the report prepared by the CCl ET on Climate Database Management Systems (ET-CDBMS), in particular the observing requirements and standards for climate. The importance of retaining some manual stations for optimizing the complementary aspects of AWS and manual stations was emphasized. For a GIZ consultancies in Nepal I suggested to install RAWS together with a new set of manual sensors in order to facilitate the transfer process from traditional observing procedures to new technologies (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>). The observer should be kept in charge until the met service is not ready to rely on automatic equipment and to build up a dataset from manual and automatic stations in order to evaluate how this process may affects the observations.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 2.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chainpur Nepal—Manual and AWS</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/427002_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Rara Nepal—Manual station in Stevenson Screen</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/427002_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.gif" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>RAWS Configuration and Requirements (Technical Specifications)</title><p id="Par28">The Manual on the Global Observing System (WMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>), states the General requirements of a meteorological station as follows: “All stations shall be equipped with properly calibrated instruments and adequate observational and measuring techniques, so that the measurements and observations of the various meteorological elements, are accurate enough to meet the needs of synoptic meteorology, aeronautical meteorology, climatology and of other meteorological disciplines.”</p><p id="Par29">The requirements for AWS instruments have to take into consideration all aspects related to the ability to provide relevant and representative measurements over their entire life cycle.</p><p id="Par30">The requirements for sensors installed at AWS can be ranked into three basic categories, all contributing to the long term sustainability of AWS data:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par31">Requirements related to the measuring performance of instruments: the ability of an instrument to provide measurements with a stated uncertainty over the specified operating range and condition;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Requirements related to maintaining the traceability of measurements over the operational cycle; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Requirements related to the operational reliability of AWS sensors, which include features that enable their operation for extended periods, within the expected measuring performance, with minimum human intervention over their entire operating range.

These networks are now available almost everywhere in many emerging countries. GPRS hardware is much cheaper as compared to satellite systems. GPRS networks may be used wherever they are available whereas satellite communications (such as IRIDIUM or ORBCOMM) have been used where GSM/GPRS networks are unavailable.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>Power.</bold> Solar panels with backup batteries are a useful power source for AWS at remote areas. Solar panels and batteries are easily available and affordable in many regions. Sometime the use of wind turbines has been investigated at some sites, to integrate solar power (i.e. in CMA, China network). For specific sites, especially during wintertime, with low solar intensity and low temperatures, solar solutions alone do not supply reliable off-grid power, especially in critical weather and the dark seasons, so the use of fuel cell deserve mention. (i.e. New-Zealand remote snowfall stations)</p><p id="Par37"><bold>Sensors.</bold> Robust and high quality sensors are suggested for remote areas. Sensors and the platform employed should be suitable for remote diagnostics and troubleshooting in order to avoid frequent inspection visits..</p><p id="Par38"><bold>AWS equipment.</bold> The cost of the data loggers and communication devices has come down drastically with recent advances in electronics technologies, BUT equipment, which can work over an extended temperature range, are still expensive. Robust data loggers and communication devices are required which can work in extreme environments e.g., temperature and prolonged time with high humidity values.</p><p id="Par39"><bold>AWS enclosure.</bold> In extreme weather areas waterproof box should be rust proof and salt resistant. Normally we go for standard IP65-66 or NEMA 4 protection grade. These enclosures should be made of suitable material or properly shielded so that inside temperature does not increase considerably, causing malfunction to the electronic equipment or batteries. High rainfall rates can cause water infiltration, so the connector and core hitches exposure to the environment mast be minimal.</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Radiation shields.</bold> Radiation shields should be rugged and allow free airflow over the sensors, so wooden or plastic Stevenson screens should be employed. Normally fan-aspirated shield are not suggested unless strictly required.</p><p id="Par41">E<bold>arthing.</bold> AWS equipment is often damaged by lightning strikes. Appropriate conventional or maintenance-free earthing, could be very effective in the long run. State-of-the-art lightning arrestors together with maintenance-free earthing at the site could reduce AWS faults due to lightning.</p><p id="Par42"><bold>Calibration of sensors and maintenance of stations.</bold> Tropical; mountain and dry regions have peculiar problems in maintenance of AWS sensors due to dust deposition or frost/snow damages. Though AWS are generally unmanned by design, regular visits to a site are required to check its security, exposure conditions and for performing preventive maintenance. The costs of maintenance, calibration and running expenses for an operating AWS network far outweigh the initial purchase expense, so these expenses should be kept in mind before planning the siting and installation of an AWS network. Calibration of sensors should be performed at least once or twice per year. Availability of manpower and funds are major constraints in accomplishing these tasks.</p><p id="Par43"><bold>Safety.</bold> In remote regions security of AWS equipment has become a major concern. It is quite common that there are many thefts of solar panels and batteries from the AWS sites. I had experienced 2 solar panels stolen and 1 cup anemometer broken for pure vandalism, The general public now understand that solar panels and batteries can be used in domestic or mobile applications (i.e. Van, Campers). Public participation of local people and awareness programs can help to reduce these events. The participation of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) can be also considered. The installation near military camps or police stations is often adopted as a suitable compromise between safety vs RAWS representativeness. Adoption of WMO siting classification guidelines, is important for exhaustive description of sensors exposure. M. Leroy of Météo-France proposed a standardised method to describe siting classification for the main variables measured at AWS, that are now incorporated in the WMO-CIMO reference guide (WMO Technical Guide n. 8 2012)</p><p id="Par44">When deciding to buy an AWS the first step is to design the exact configuration (i.e. the type of sensors, amount of memory of the data-logger, power required, etc.). The main characteristics should be: Reliability; Robustness (toughness); Simple operation; Reduced level of maintenance; Installation of few sensors and estimation of other parameters.</p><p id="Par45">Some examples:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par46">Instead of using a standard “A” Pan evaporimeter tank, which requires frequent interventions, it is better to estimate the evaporation from the other meteorological variables such as air temperature and humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, etc.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">For wind speed and direction, bi-dimensional sonic anemometers can be used which can replace traditional cup anemometers and vane sensors.

This technology is free from transmission fees, but the hardware is <italic>very expensive</italic> (especially the base station). It relies on the phenomenon of reflecting radio waves off the ionized trails left by micrometeors as they enter the atmosphere and disintegrate. These trails exist in the 80–120 km region of the earth’s atmosphere, and reflect the RF energy between two stations. The height of the trails allows over-the-horizon communication at distances up to 2000 km. This option is particularly well suited for long-range, low data rate applications for both messaging and data acquisition, like SNOTEL network. <italic>(</italic>Schaefer and Paetzold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">Common communication methods can be via dial-up modems, leased-lines, radio (licensed or unlicensed frequencies) and satellite. Combinations of these can be used as well. For example, RTS Kathmandu (Nepal) developed a device equipped with CDMA, GPRS and Satellite modems: if the CDMA and/or GPRS line fails the systems automatically switch to satellite modem to ensure data transmission. The negative aspect is that the customer has to keep two contracts active instead one, but when a reliable early warning system is required, this option may result of great interest.</p><p id="Par67">Each data transmission method has its advantages and disadvantages (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2.2</xref>). Frequency of polling and speed should be balanced with cost and power supply availability at the remote station. Site requirements may dictate that communications be close to real-time or not, depending on the applications. With radio systems, it is especially important that enough time and money be allocated to design and implement the best system possible. Generally, communication speed and availability relate directly to cost. Some modems support a communication scheme that can substantially reduce power requirements, resulting in a battery and panel size reduction of over 50%.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between different types of data transmission systems</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Advantages</p></th><th align="left"><p>Disadvantages</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Modem,</p><p>landline</p><p>phone</p><p>(PSTN)</p></td><td align="left"><p>PSTN = Public Switched Telephone Network</p><p>Utilises the normal landline phone service</p><p>Data transmission speed starts from 1200 bps</p><p>Possibility to manage a network from a main site</p><p>Low modem cost</p></td><td align="left"><p>Possibility of line interruption</p><p>service not available in remote locations</p><p>Expensive installation in remote locations</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Modem,</p><p>GSM</p><p>Cell phone</p></td><td align="left"><p>GSM = Global System for Mobile Communication)</p><p>Low cost of modem installation also in remote locations</p><p>Speed of transmission up to 9600 bps</p><p>Normally several types of contracts are available</p><p>Cost of the modems is reducing</p><p>SMS service for data transmission</p></td><td align="left"><p>Coverage not complete in several zones</p><p>Possibility of interruptions due to electromagnetic interference</p><p>Phone calls more expensive</p><p>Voice call priority higher with respect to data call</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Modem,</p><p>GPRS</p><p>Cell phone</p></td><td align="left"><p>GPRS = General Packet Radio Service</p><p>Low cost of modem installation also in remote locations</p><p>Higher speed of transmission with respect GSM</p><p>Data sent to a remote server (also a third party server, i.e. of AWS manufacturer)</p><p>Sometime no software required for data receiving (just an ftp connection)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Coverage not complete in several zones</p><p>SIM card maintenance (expiration date, credit available, etc.)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Modem,</p><p>CDMA</p><p>Cell phone</p></td><td align="left"><p>CDMA = Code Division Multiple Access</p><p>Low cost of modem installation also in remote locations</p><p>Comparable speed of transmission with respect GSM</p><p>Data link to internet.
