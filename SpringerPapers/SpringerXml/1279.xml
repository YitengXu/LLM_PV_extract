renewable materials can reduce the depletion of limited material resources while
obtaining energy savings in small electronic applications and their energy storage.
In this work, bio-based poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and recycled polyethylene
terephthalate (rPET) were fabricated in film extrusion process and utilized as a
substrate in ultra-thin organic photovoltaics (OPV). In the device structure, metals
and metal oxides were replaced by printing PEDOT:PSS, carbon and amino
acid/heterocycles. Scalable, energy-efficient fabrication of solar cells resulted in
efficiencies up to 6.9% under indoor light. Furthermore, virgin-PET was replaced
with PLA and rPET in printed and hybrid integrated electronics where surface-mount
devices (SMD) were die-bonded onto silver-printed PLA and virgin-PET films to
prepare LED foils followed by an overmoulding process using the rPET and PLA. As a
result, higher relative adhesion of PLA-PLA interface was obtained in comparison
with rPET-PET interface. The obtained results are encouraging from the point of
utilization of scalable manufacturing technologies and natural/recycled materials in
printed and hybrid integrated electronics. Assessment showed a considerable decrease
in carbon footprint, about 10–85%, mainly achieved through replacing of silver,
virgin-PET and modifying solar cell structure. In outdoor light, the materials with
low carbon footprint can decrease energy payback times (EPBT) from ca. 250 days to
under 10 days. In indoor energy harvesting, it is possible to achieve EPBT of less
than 1 year. The structures produced and studied herein have a high potential of
providing sustainable energy solutions for example in IoT-related
technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Printed electronics manufacturing</kwd><kwd>Printed solar cells</kwd><kwd>Poly(lactic acid)</kwd><kwd>Recycled PET</kwd><kwd>Life cycle assessment</kwd><kwd>Climate impacts</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Academy of

pre-industrial times calls for drastic reductions in the global greenhouse gas
emissions within the next decades. Sustainable use of material resources and
full-scale utilization of renewable energy are among the key solutions for limiting
of greenhouse gas emissions. In this respect, the European Commission has adopted an
Ecodesign directive to improve the environmental performance of products through the
product-specific regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
Transition from the excess consumption of fossil-based materials and energy towards
technologies based on sustainable and safe materials needs to take place.
Furthermore, the low utilization of side/waste stream materials has to be
improved.</p><p id="Par3">According to Cisco, 50 billion devices from smart wearables to smart
cities and from households to industries will be connected to the Internet by 2020
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. From the consumption point of
view, more off-grid energy will be needed especially as the use of gadgets and
mobile devices keep on increasing. The known lithium reserves are likely not enough
to satisfy the growing demand of batteries, so energy-autonomous solutions have to
be implemented. The predicted market growth for batteries and accumulators is so
high that inadequate resource availability could become a limitation even with
efficient recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore,
alternative and supplementary sources of energy are needed.</p><p id="Par4">Solar energy technologies provide an excellent opportunity to address
the challenges mentioned above. Replacement of conventional fossil energy sources
through solar power is one of the key technologies for climate change mitigation.
Furthermore, solar energy has limitless potential in providing electricity in
different environments and, it is available for everyone, everywhere. Printed and
hybrid integrated devices provide opportunities such as material and energy savings,
among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Manufacturing
technologies that are currently being implemented allow decreased material
consumption up to 75%, mainly by reducing the use of plastics and PCBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have obtained power conversion efficiencies
(PCE) up to 17% under solar irradiation and up to 28% under indoor light conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Systems with energy-autonomous devices have the potential of
replacing disposable batteries. Fabricating the lightweight, flexible and ultra-thin
devices using printing technologies enables extremely low consumption of materials
and further eliminates energy-intensive inert or vacuum stages, by replacing them
with processes that can take place at ambient condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Overmoulding of printed and hybrid
integrated systems using injection moulding leads to 50–70% lighter devices and up
to 90% thinner thermoplastic-electronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Carbon footprint values of
20.7 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq./m<sup>2</sup> have been
presented for ITO-free OPV processes in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This translates into
55.1–92.8 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq./kWh electricity, which is considerably
lower than for example the emission factor for natural gas (approximately
200 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq./kWh electricity). In a study by Tsang et
al., energy payback times (EPBT) of OPVs were found to lie between 220 and 460 days
depending on the application scenario, thus being 50–60% lower than those of the
amorphous silicon panels in the same study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Organic electronics enable exploiting device materials extracted from
nature or synthetic derivatives of natural molecules. Steps has been taken towards
using materials such as pigments like indigo, ß-carotene, cellulose and its
derivates and small molecules like amino acids or peptides, e.g. in transistors and
solar cells as a semiconductor, dielectric or interfacial layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Until now,
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene napthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC)
and polyimide (PI) have been the most common substrate material used in printed and
hybrid integrated electronics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Success of PET has been based on optical transparency,
dimensional stability at higher temperatures, solvent resistance, flexibility and
affordability of the price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The choice of substrate is
relevant since the substrate can comprise 40–80% of the weight or volume of entire
thin film device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Within bio-based alternatives, silk, gelatin, natural resin shellac and
cellulose-based papers are one possibility to exploit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Solar cells
have been fabricated on top of paper, coated with polymer or glue with an efficiency
of 3–4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the surface roughness, lack of
transparency, barrier properties and moisture resistance are limiting the use of
paper substrates. Another alternative is to replace PET substrate with cellulose
nanofiber films to obtain optically and mechanically high-quality film with desired
barrier properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. PCE of 1.4%
was reported when OPV was prepared directly on nanocellulose film and 4.25% when
perovskite solar cell was prepared on nanocellulose film with acrylic coating
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In polymeric solutions, the approaches to utilize bio-based
polymers as substrate material have focused on transfer strategies where the device
or part of it has first been prepared on different substrate, or by coating the
polymeric material on top of another substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Within bio-based polymers, poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) is one of the most promising material. It is stiff, transparent and
commercially available in various grades. However, due to its low heat resistance
and slow crystallization rate, the use of PLA in printed electronics instead of PET
is challenging. Increased crystallization, and thus improved mechanical performance
and heat resistance of PLA, can be achieved, e.g. by nucleation, strain-induced
crystallization through orientation or stereocomplex blends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In contrast to biodegradability and disposability, recycled polymers
provide an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional polymers by saving
virgin raw material resources, thus contributing to a circular economy and detaching
from fossil dependency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Among the
recycled polymers, PET derived from post-consumer bottles is one of the few recycled
plastics available in commercial scale with high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The aim of this work was to reduce, replace and reuse materials in
renewable energy production and in electronics while still maintaining or even
improving the functionality of the technology. In this work, the use of virgin raw
materials was minimized by replacing fossil-based materials with recycled and
bio-based alternatives. Recycled PET (rPET) and PLA thin films were prepared in cast
film extrusion process and used as a substrate in the preparation of printed and
hybrid integrated electronic devices. OPV structures for energy harvesting under
indoor light conditions were printed on PET, rPET and PLA substrates. The
alternatives to replace sputtering process and wet deposition of metal oxides and
metals was realized by gravure and screen printing PEDOT:PSS, amino
acid/heterocycles, e.g. histidine and carbon. In the processing of printed and
hybrid integrated electronics, surface-mount devices (SMD) were die bonded onto
silver-printed PLA and virgin-PET films to produce LED foils followed by an
overmoulding with rPET and PLA. In order to assess the impact of these changes on
the carbon footprint and energy consumption of printed OPV with selected device
structures on rPET, PLA and polyethylene furanoate (PEF) substrates in comparison
with a reference structure based on virgin-PET, a life cycle assessment (LCA)
methodology was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental section</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and methods for production of sustainable printed

printed and hybrid integrated devices: recycled PET and bio-based PLA.
High-quality Pramia rPET food-grade GR granulates made from PET bottles obtained
through Finnish bottle recycling system were purchased from Pramia Plastic Oy,
Finland. High-viscosity Luminy LX175 PLA homopolymer suitable for film extrusion
was purchased from Total Corbion PLA BV. rPET and PLA grades were obtained as
crystalline white pellets, having densities of 1.4 and
1.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, glass transition temperatures of
78–82 °C and 55–60 °C and melting points of 245 and 155 °C, respectively.</p><p id="Par11">The laboratory-scale fabrication of rPET and PLA substrates was
performed with Brabender Plastograph EC Plus 19 mm single screw extruder with
120 mm cast film die. For rPET, the temperature profile was 280–290–280–280 °C
from zone 1 to die, with a screw speed of 26–27 rpm. The film was extruded onto
a chill roll having temperature of 83–84 °C and processed into cast films
through calenders to a final film thickness of 200 μm (unoriented films) or
360–400 μm (films for biaxial orientation). For PLA, the temperature profile was
240–230–230–220 °C from zone 1 to die, with a screw speed of 50 rpm. The chill
roll temperature was 48 °C and the final film thickness before biaxial
orientation was approximately 750 μm.</p><p id="Par12">Part of the produced cast film was biaxially oriented to achieve
lower film thickness and improved mechanical properties. Biaxial orientation was
performed with biaxial laboratory stretcher (Brückner Karo IV). The used
parameters for rPET were the following: preheating time 100 s, temperature
91 °C, orientation ratio 2.4 × 2.4, final thickness 60–70 μm. For PLA, the

higher conductivity.</p><p id="Par35">For indoor use, emissions ranged between 12 and
1972 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq./kWh, thus being quite high for
structures 1–3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). In comparison,
the GHG emission factor of electricity produced from natural gas is ca.
475 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq./kWh and that of hard coal electricity is
about 950 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq./kWh) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, for structures 4–6 emission estimated values
range between 12 and 108 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq./kWh (except structure 6
with 3% efficiency and 10 years lifetime), thus being relatively competitive
with other energy sources. Notably, the examined OPV structures 1–3 are
considered more efficient in outdoor light conditions and, respectively, the
structures 4–6 in indoor light conditions and/or at low light conditions. For

growing challenge. Thus, even small consumption of a depleting, toxic or
hazardous material might have a huge impact globally, causing serious damage. In
printed and hybrid integrated electronics devices, substrates are the main
consumers of materials. Therefore, waste management/recycling processes are
determined by the substrates. In all of the studied structures, a critical
aspect concerning their recyclability is how easily (if at all) the different
layers can be separated from one another. Another central question is whether
the solar panel is integrated into another product. If this is the case, the
determining factor for recycling is more likely dependent on the product in
which the panel is integrated. Ag, ITO and zinc (Zn) contained in the structures
1, 2 and 3 have the most potential for recycling, particularly Ag. With
increasing prices due to growing demand and more developed separation methods in
the future, waste from electrical and electronic equipment could even become a
source of raw materials for new products, thereby potentially making it
profitable to recover these substances from the residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. On the other hand, if the solar cell
materials are safe and non-hazardous, they could potentially be processed
together with the substrate as part of its recycling/recovery chains.</p><p id="Par38">Among the structures studied, structures 4, 5 and 6 were estimated
to also have the lowest resource consumption (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Thus, they can be considered as the most compatible with
the principles of a circular economy. There are no virgin fossil materials used
in the substrate material, and these structures contain no metals or critical
minerals either.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Qualitative assessment of resource consumption,

materials, and their availability is therefore limited.
Thus, the overall availability of bio-based plastics as
replacers of fossil plastics is limited.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">This study showed that printed and hybrid integrated electronics can
minimize the use of virgin raw materials as well as fossil-based alternatives,
resulting in increased sustainability of small electronic devices/systems and their
energy systems. Herein, rPET and PLA thin films were fabricated in film extrusion
process and utilized as a substrate material in printed and hybrid integrated
electronics. Fabricated PLA and rPET films were compatible for printed and hybrid
integrated electronics manufacturing, even for the fabrication of ultra-thin OPV
structures. Scalable, energy-efficient printing technologies can replace
energy-intensive vacuum processes. Gravure and screen printing of PEDOT:PSS, carbon
and amino acid/heterocycles can help replacing/reducing use of metals and metal
oxides. As a result, 6.9% solar cell efficiency was reached under indoor light
illumination.</p><p id="Par40">Higher relative adhesion of PLA-PLA interface were obtained in
comparison with rPET-PET when printed and hybrid integrated LED foils were
fabricated on PLA and PET films and sealed by using rPET and PLA for overmoulding.
In overmoulding, the processing and handling of PLA and rPET was comparable to
virgin-PET and engineering thermoplastics. The obtained results are encouraging from
the point of utilization of scalable manufacturing technologies and natural/recycled
materials in printed and hybrid integrated electronics.</p><p id="Par41">The assessment of climate impacts, energy consumption and waste
production of selected OPV structures showed that a considerable decrease in climate
impacts and energy consumption can potentially be achieved through the replacement
of Ag and virgin fossil-based PET. Furthermore, OPVs can potentially be used in
combination with Li and other types of batteries. When used in combination with
OPVs, the lifetime of Li batteries could be lengthened from the present ca. 1 year
to 5–10 years. By extending the battery lifetime and thereby reduce the need for new
batteries, OPVs can contribute to considerable reduction in their carbon footprint
and saving of Li resources.</p><p id="Par42">OPV comprising rPET substrate and Ag replaced with other materials had
the lowest climate impacts. Furthermore, increased lifetime and production
efficiency result in a decrease of the overall environmental impact of the
structures. EPBT decreased from about 250 days to less than 20 days. However, it
should be noted that several sectors are interested in recycled plastics, and there
is likely to be a high growth in their demand. Moreover, there is also an increasing
pressure on land area resulting from both food and fuel production. Thus, there is a
limit to the potential growth of these materials in the use of electronic devices.
In summary, the carbon footprint and EPBT of the studied OPV structures are very low
in comparison with other PV technologies, or even other renewable energy
technologies. In addition, replacement of Ag and other critical minerals enable
solutions that contribute to solving the challenges related to resource
availability. The OPV structures produced and studied herein have a high potential
of providing sustainable energy solutions for example in IoT-related
technologies.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par43">Bio-based PLA and recycled PET films fabricated in film
