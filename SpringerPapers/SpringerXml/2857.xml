For increasing efficiency in hydrogen production, currently, the most exciting and thriving strategies are focused on efficient and inexpensive catalysts. Here, we report an innovative idea for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) utilizing plasmon-activated liquid water with reduced hydrogen-bonded structure by hot electron transfer. This strategy is effective for all HERs in acidic, basic and neutral systems, photocatalytic system with a g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (graphite carbon nitride) electrode, as well as in an inert system with an ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode. Compared to deionized water, the efficiency of HER increases by 48% based on activated water <italic>ex situ</italic> on a Pt electrode. Increase in energy efficiency from activated water is 18% at a specific current yield of −20 mA <italic>in situ</italic> on a nanoscale-granulated Au electrode. Moreover, the onset potential of −0.023 V vs RHE was very close to the thermodynamic potential of the HER (0 V). The measured current density at the corresponding overpotential for HER in an acidic system was higher than any data previously reported in the literature. This approach establishes a new vista in clean green energy production.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16263.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep16263" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep16263</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to growing environmental pollution, renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, are being considered as clean energy sources. Splitting water for hydrogen production using light, or electrical energy, is the most developed ‘green technique’. For increasing efficiency in hydrogen production, currently, the most exciting and thriving strategies are focused on efficient and inexpensive catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The electrochemical decomposition of water is possible with visible light of an appropriate energy, while for photochemical splitting a semiconductor-based material is popularly employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Importantly, the successes of these technologies for energy conversion in hydrogen production relies on the development of efficient and earth-abundant catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Other methodologies have been also developed e.g. the construction of a monolithic photovoltaic-photoelectrochemical device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, with attempts to decouple hydrogen and oxygen evolution using an electron-coupled-proton buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Water has a tetrahedral structure with two O-H bonds that enable it to form a flexible dynamic hydrogen-bonded network, which has been successfully examined using Raman spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The facts that increasing the electrolysis temperature can lower the electrolysis voltage for electrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and that water has a more disordered structure with weaker hydrogen bonds at evaluated temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> have inspired us to utilize prepared small water cluster (SWC) at room temperature for efficient hydrogen evolution. Based on this strategy, Au nanoparticles (NPs) with well-defined localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), are often employed in studies focused on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and in a clinical setting for the photothermal ablation of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In our previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, they were used to achieve the hot electron transfer needed to break the hydrogen bonds of water. The weak/reduced interaction energy within water molecules provides the potential application in the development of efficient catalyst-free hydrogen production <italic>via</italic> lowering the onset potential. In this work, the prepared pure water with SWC is innovatively utilized for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The effect of <italic>in situ</italic> preparation of SWC on the correspondingly increased efficiency in HER is also demonstrated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and characterization of degree of reduced hydrogen bonded water (RHBW)</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> indicates that the supported Au NPs in water had a distinct surface plasmon absorption band centered at 538 nm and a broader band extending over the entire visible light region. This LSPR of Au NPs suggests that the effect of hot electron transfer to break hydrogen bonds of bulk water can be achieved under illumination with full-wavelength visible light (to produce RHBW based on fluorescent lamp) and can be further enhanced using light at an optimized wavelength (to produce highly reduced hydrogen bonded water, HRHBW, based on green light-emitting diode). Unless otherwise noted, the blank water was prepared under illumination on deionized (DI) with an indoor fluorescent lamp. In preparation of the blank water, Au NPs were absent. The process of treating water with Au NPs under illumination with a green light-emitting diode (LED, λ<sub>max</sub> 530 nm) is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Process of preparing highly reduced hydrogen-bonded water (HRHBW) under resonant illumination on Au NPs.</p><p>The HRHBW was characterized by Raman spectra.

A blank was obtained using similar preparation conditions to those used to prepare the RHBW, but without illumination. These Raman spectra were further deconvoluted into five Gaussian sub-bands based on methods in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Deconvolution of the five-Gaussian components with center wavenumbers of 3018, 3223, 3393, 3506 and 3624 cm<sup>−1</sup> was adopted for all samples. Moreover, the full widths at the half maximum (FWHMs) of individual components in the five-Gaussian fit were equal for all samples. The respective values were 234, 201, 176, 154 and 112 cm<sup>−1</sup> for bands at 3018, 3223, 3393, 3506 and 3624 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Bands on the low- and high-frequency sides are respectively related to strongly and weakly hydrogen-bonded OH features. In this work, the three components on the low-frequency side were assigned to hydrogen-bonded water, while the remaining two high-frequency-side components were assigned to non-hydrogen-bonded water. The degree of non-hydrogen-bonded water (DNHBW) was defined as the ratio of the area of the non-hydrogen-bonded OH stretching bands to the area of the total stretching bands. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>, respective values of the DNHBW for DI water, RHBW, blank water and HRHBW were 21.43 ± 0.05% (21.48% for DI water stored for 4 weeks), 24.32 ± 0.08%, 21.52 ± 0.17% and 26.33 ± 0.11% (<italic>n</italic> = 3). The smaller difference between values for fresh and stored DI water suggests that 21.43% is a reliable reference value for bulk water used in the DNHBW. Similar values of 21.43% and 21.52% for the DI and blank waters indicate that HRHBW cannot be obtained in the absence of LSPR effect from light-illuminated Au NPs. Encouragingly, the DNHBW significantly increased from 21.43% to 24.32% by utilizing the LSPR effect from the supported Au NPs. This was an increase of 13% for the DNHBW, which could be enhanced to 23% by illumination with a green LED, suggesting that this light is more effective for decreasing hydrogen-bond structures. This effect was also observed in static preparations of treated water based on a fluorescent lamp and a green LED (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supporting Information, SI</xref>). Moreover, water treatments confirmed the LSPR effect with respect to the corresponding RHBW, with different DNHBWs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Tables S1 and SI</xref>). Values of the DNHBW listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref> range 21% ~ 30%. The energy efficiency, η, when preparing HRHBW was estimated from the ratio of the energy required to break hydrogen bonds in bulk water to that provided from the light energy of the LED, as defined here:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16263_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where the energy of hydrogen bonds, E<sub>HB</sub>, of 20 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> was used. To obtain 75 g (or 75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a density of 1 g cm<sup>−3</sup>) of HRHBW, the mole of bulk water, M<sub>water</sub>, in which hydrogen bonds were broken, was calculated from the mole (4.2 mol) multiplied by the difference in DNHBW of DI water (21.46%) and HRHBW (26.23%). The power of the LED used, P<sub>LED</sub>, was 16 W and the illumination time, t, for 75 cm<sup>3</sup> of DI water passing through the glass tube was ca. 1500 s. Therefore, the energy efficiency for preparing HRHBW was approximately 4.0 kJ/24 kJ = 17% if energy losses from scattering of the LED and penetrating glass tube of light were ignored.</p><p>Samples of DI water, ceramic particle-treated (CPT) water and Au-coated CPT water were prepared at a temperature of 50 °C and compared to DI water, blank water and RHBW, which had been prepared at room temperature. The measured Raman spectra of OH stretching of these samples (prepared at 50 °C) at room temperature after cooling in ambient laboratory air are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref>. Corresponding values of DNHBW were 21.37%, 21.36% and 21.35%, respectively, for DI water, CPT water and Au-coated CPT water. Comparing values of DNHBW of 21.46%, 21.24% and 26.23% for DI water, CPT water and HRHBW (prepared at room temperature), respectively, indicates that the amount of joules used for heating contributed less to the successful preparation of HRHBW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The effect of electroactive species in (H)RHBW</title><p>As recently shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, the electrochemical properties of phenols and quinones in organic solvents are strongly influenced by hydrogen bonds. As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, the first (E<sub>p</sub><sup>red(1)</sup>) and second (E<sub>p</sub><sup>red(2)</sup>) reduction peaks of benzoquinone (BQ) shifted toward less-negative potentials, while the potential difference (ΔE<sub>p</sub>) between them decreased when DI water was added to CH<sub>3</sub>CN to form hydrogen-bonded species. These phenomena were more significant with treated water, especially with HRHBW prepared under LED illumination. For example, with H<sub>2</sub>O (0.69 M), decreases in ΔE<sub>p</sub> were enhanced by 6.3% and 11% (compared to DI water) respectively using RHBW and HRHBW (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S2</xref> for reduction peak shifts). This reveals that there was more ‘free water’ in treated water with weaker hydrogen bonding, which could strongly interact with BQ by hydrogen bonding. The evidence of more ‘free water’ was further demonstrated by mixing with ethyl alcohol. DI water and HRHBW both at 10 wt% were individually dissolved in two samples of ethyl alcohol. The measured water contents using volumetric Karl Fischer titration (Metrohm 870 KF Titrino plus) were 10.87 and 10.34 wt% for DI water and HRHBW, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Because the HRHBW with weaker hydrogen bonding could form more hydrogen bonds with ethyl alcohol, the measured content of available water decreased by 4.8%, compared to DI water. Moreover, the novel property of HRHBW was examined by calculating the diffusion coefficient of K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in water from cyclic voltammetric data through the Randles-Sevcik equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>:<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chemical behaviors of BQ and K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in the different waters.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Voltammetric data record for BQ in CH<sub>3</sub>CN containing 0.2 M <italic>n</italic>-Bu<sub>4</sub>NPF<sub>6</sub> as the supporting electrolyte and different waters with 0.69 M H<sub>2</sub>O at room temperature.

The calculated diffusion coefficient increased from 6.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> to 8.4 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup> for an increase of 29% when using RHBW instead of conventional DI water (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Moreover, the diffusion coefficient increased 85% when using HRHBW (12 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>). In addition, the reduced ΔV (the potential difference between anodic and cathodic peaks in a couple) observed for treated water suggests that the oxidation-reduction reaction of K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in treated water was more easily reversible.</p><p>Also, the chemical activity of steam produced from HRHBW compared to that from DI water was examined with respect to the room-temperature reduction of an Au-containing complex to Au NPs in the presence of Ch. The results suggested that steam produced from HRHBW acts as a weak reducing agent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2, S3, SI</xref>).

HER currents were recorded and compared at −0.4 V (see insert of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), to avoid interference from the produced hydrogen bubbles. As expected, absolute values of the currents increased with increases in electrolyte concentrations. Encouragingly, the HER was significantly promoted in treated water. Compared to DI water, the efficiency of hydrogen evolution respectively increased by ca. 17% and 48% using RHBW and HRHBW [in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at −0.4 V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S3</xref>)]. Moreover, the increased efficiency of metastable treated water was dependent on the storage time (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, the calculated Faraday efficiencies in hydrogen productions are 84.0 ± 5.4% and 86.2 ± 3.5% for systems of DI water and HRHBW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">See SI</xref>).</p><p>The Pt electrode is recognized as an excellent catalyst for electrolyzing water. The above result demonstrates that HRHBW possesses efficient hydrogen evolution reaction compared to DI water based on the Pt-electrode system. To exclude the effect of Pt during electrolysis, an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was substituted for the Pt electrode. As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, compared to the Pt electrode, the current at −0.6 V was much smaller, indicating that the ITO electrode was not favorable for electrolyzing water. In addition, the increased efficiencies of HER at potentials of –0.2, –0.3, –0.4, –0.5 and –0.6 V are 204%, 374%, 424%, 200% and 36.2%, respectively (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). The continuously increased efficiency in cathodic scan from –0.2 to –0.4 V is ascribed to the lower required onset potential in HER utilizing HRHBW instead of DI water. At lower cathodic potential, the difference in efficiencies of HER is predominantly decided by the difference of interactions within water molecules. However, this superiority is reduced as the cathodic potential increases further from –0.4 to –0.6 V. It indicates that more efficient water splitting accompanied by overcoming the difference of interactions within water molecules between HRHBW and DI water is occurred as the applied cathodic overpotential is high enough. In comparison, discussion regarding overpotential is based on the same reference electrode in this work. These results reveal that high efficient HER can be also performed in the HRHBW-based system even using inert ITO electrode.</p><p>Moreover, famous HER catalyst of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> was deposited on ITO electrode to evaluate the effect from utilizing HRHBW on the increased efficiency of HER in 0.5 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has drawn consider considerable attention in recent years for its catalytic activity in visible-light photocatalytic water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It is a visible-light-active polymeric semiconductor with a band gap of ∼2.7 eV, corresponding to an optical wavelength of ∼460 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This appropriate band structure makes it available for both efficient water reduction and oxidation. As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, the recorded current density on the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/ITO electrode in HRHBW system is higher than that in DI water system in the cathodic scan from 0 to –0.6 V. In light free condition, the current density is −3.79 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> at –0.6 V for HRHBW system. It is an increase of 12.1% in HER efficiency compared to the DI water system (−3.38 μA cm<sup>−2</sup>). In addition, the current densities obtained in light free condition increase 5.6% and 3.4% for DI water and HRHBW, respectively, under illumination of white-light LED. Compared to the DI water system, the lower increased current density obtained in HRHBW system can be attributed to the lower effect of charge transfer from photocatalyst of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to water under illumination. In preparation of HRHBW this similar charge transfer had occurred on treated DI water from hot electron transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, charge transfer from g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to HRHBW contributes less to HER in electrolytic water splitting. Under illumination of white-light LED, the current density is −3.92 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> at –0.6 V for HRHBW system. It is an increase of 9.8% in HER efficiency compared to the DI water system (−3.57 μA cm<sup>−2</sup>). Conclusively, these results suggest that the utilizing of HRHBW in the improvement of HER is available for all types of electrodes, including active (Pt), photocatalytic (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) and inert (ITO) ones. Further inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) analysis indicated that the concentration of slightly dissolved Au metals in the RHBW was ca. 0.62 ppb (ca. 0.65 ppb for HRHBW). The dissolved Au ions may be deposited on the Pt electrode and this may contribute to the increased current in HER. This influence of slightly dissolved Au ions in the RHBW on the correspondingly efficient HER is excluded, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S7</xref> (Similar experiments as performed in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). After the first HER on polished Pt electrode based on DI water, the used Pt electrode was just rinsed with DI water without further polishing treatment in sequent experiments based on DI water, HRHBW, DI water and HRHBW in sequence. The HERs in the first and the third experiments based on DI water are similar. The HERs in the second and the fourth experiments based on HRHBW are similar. Therefore, the influence of slightly dissolved Au ions on the effective HER in HRHBW is excluded.</p><p>In addition, the effects of HRHBW with weak hydrogen bonds on the corresponding hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral and alkaline systems were further evaluated. As shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, in the HRHBW-based system, the overpotential (at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>) at pH −0.3 was 0.24 V, reduced 0.03 V compared to DI water-based system. Also, in the HRHBW-based system, the overpotential at 1 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> was 0.21 V, reduced 0.01 V compared to DI water-based system. In addition, it had a smaller Tafel slope (43.0 mV decade<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hydrogen evolution reactions performed at inert-catalytic electrode (ITO) in electrolyte with various pH values.</p><p>LSV curves recorded on Pt electrode in (<bold>a</bold>) 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (pH −0.3), (<bold>b</bold>) 0.2 M KCl (pH 7) and (<bold>c</bold>) 2 M KOH (pH 14.3).

It is noteworthy that unlike the acid electrolyte, achieving high efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral and alkaline systems is considered a formidable challenge. For instance, the HER in acidic medium is higher by about 2 ~ 3 orders of magnitude than in alkaline medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Still, compared to DI water-based systems, Tafel slopes of HRHBW-based systems at all pH values decreased by nearly 5%. This clearly shows that interactions within water molecules are one of the main factors in improving the efficiency and will be useful for all pH systems. Also, as discussed in SI, hydrogen bonds within water molecules can be directly broken on the electrochemically roughened Au substrate under fluorescent illumination.</p><p>Therefore, the <italic>in situ</italic> reduction of water’s hydrogen bonds combining the HER was evaluated on the Au NP-deposited Au electrode under illumination. An SEM image shows that abundant Au NPs were deposited on the Au electrode by an electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycle (ORC) method (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). In addition, the mechanism of improving the HER through synchronously forming and electrolyzing HRHBW was proposed (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). It can be observed that the onset potential of the cathodic HER was more positive when the roughened Au electrode was illuminated with a fluorescent lamp and especially so under green LED illumination (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). As expected, the HER was significantly promoted when the Au electrode was illuminated with a fluorescent lamp (compared to a light-free condition) or with a green LED. Compared to the light-free condition, the efficiency of hydrogen evolution was significantly increased by ca. 31% and 59% based on experiments performed under illuminations of lamps and LED, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Tables S5, SI</xref>). This increase was enhanced to 84% based on <italic>in situ</italic> formation of HRHBW using the green LED when DI water was further replaced by HRHBW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S6</xref>). Moreover, the increased energy efficiencies from HRHBW compared to bulk water were 18%, 16% and 14% at specific current yields of −20, −30 and −40 mA, respectively (See SI).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Linear sweep voltammograms of hydrogen evolution in DI water containing 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at an electrochemically roughened Au electrode under illumination with different light sources.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SEM image of the roughened Au electrode (0.283 cm<sup>2</sup>) which was prepared by using electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycles (ORCs).

In water electrolysis, two strategies are generally adopted for improving efficiency: lowering the cathodic overpotential and increasing the specific surface area of the electrode. Although Pt-based electrodes are widely deemed useful as catalysts in water electrolysis, the high cost of this noble metal is a concern. Therefore, scientists have attempted to develop cheaper but novel materials to fabricate efficient electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, on the other hand, investigations regarding interactions within intrinsic water molecules that affect electrolysis efficiency have generally been neglected. Our experimental results indicate that the onset potentials, which are defined as the cathodic currents, rise rapidly as more negative potentials are applied and on the Pt cathode using DI water-, RHBW- and HRHBW-based electrolytes were −0.268 (−0.046), −0.253 (−0.031) and −0.245 (−0.023) V vs AgCl (vs RHE). These onset potentials for the RHBW- and HRHBW-based electrolytes were very close to the thermodynamic potential of the HER (i.e., 0 V vs RHE). To the best of our knowledge, the current density at the corresponding overpotential for the HER with HRHBW-based electrolytes is higher than anything reported in the literature for systems of Pt or Au catalysts in acidic electrolytes (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Values of the degree of non-hydrogen-bonded water (DNHBW) were calculated as the method and definition mentioned before and shown in the text, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Chemical activity of water steam in reduction preparation of Au NPs</title><p>First, an Au-containing complex (ca. 250 ppm) was electrochemically prepared in DI water using a method similar to that described in a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Typically, when preparing the Au-containing complex, the Au electrode was cycled in a deoxygenated aqueous solution containing 1 M NaCl from −0.28 V (held for 10 s) to 1.22 V (held for 5 s) at 500 mV s<sup>−1</sup> for 500 scans. Subsequently, 2 g L<sup>−1</sup> of Ch was added to the Au complex-containing solution under light stirring for 10 min to prepare a stock solution as a precursor of Au NPs. Then 10-mL stock solutions were dropped onto qualitative filter paper (with pore size of 11 μm and a diameter of 90 mm, lot no. 10809161, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Japan). The wetted paper was immediately placed on the opening of two glass sample cells (50 mL), which each contained DI water and highly RHBW (HRHBW) of 40 mL, in ambient laboratory air for 3 days. The oxidation states of the Au NPs and Au salts (precursors of Au NPs) were examined using high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS). In the measurements, a ULVAC PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with monochromatized Al K<sub>α</sub> radiation, at 15 kV and 25 W and an energy resolution of 0.1 eV was used. To compensate for surface-charging effects, all HRXPS spectra are referenced to the C 1 s neutral carbon peak at 284.8 eV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Electrochemical Measurements</title><p>The electrochemical behavior of K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> was evaluated in a three-electrode system consisting of a Pt electrode (0.07 cm<sup>2</sup>), a Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively.

Then the mixture was dropped onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) before heating at 200 °C for 1 h to improve adhesion of catalyst on ITO electrode.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Hwang, B.-J. <italic>et al.</italic> Innovative Strategy on Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Utilizing Activated Liquid Water. <italic>Sci.
