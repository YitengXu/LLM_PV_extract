Electrochemical energy-storage materials are the key for Li-ion and next-generation batteries. Researchers reported their results on characterization studies that connect atomic-level materials science with device-level performance.</p><p id="Par14"><bold>Haimei Zheng</bold>, a senior staff scientist in the Materials Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a 2019 MRS Medalist, and her colleagues develop custom materials characterization techniques to probe battery materials, with their recent efforts focused on understanding the current-driven growth of lithium electrodes. In particular, they have advanced liquid electron microscopy to observe the spatial and temporal growth of lithium electrolyte interfaces. They have designed custom cells for such studies that not only conform to transmission electron microscopy sample holders but also control electrochemical aspects like electrolyte exposure to the electrodes of interest. In a representative study, Zheng showed that coating the electrodeâelectrolyte contact with a soft polymer can considerably alter the lithium growth from irregular to more stable. The polymer is soft enough that it does not mechanically influence the growth, and the observed differences directly correlate to the chemical changes at the interface. This difference also translates to the stripping of lithium as current is passed in the opposite direction. Such controlled experiments are informative to battery development as they selectively explore some of the phenomena occurring at these interfaces. Zheng and her group are now interested in looking at this interface with better spatial resolution and more chemical information.</p><p id="Par15">The complexity of materials in batteries, both chemical and geometrical, makes it nearly impossible to probe using a single technique. Hence, <bold>Chongmin Wang</bold>, a laboratory fellow at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and recipient of the 2016 MRS Innovation in Materials Characterization Award, and his colleagues use a combination of techniques that complement each other to construct a more descriptive picture of the interactions underlying novel battery designs. In one study, the researchers used the tip of the atomic force microscope as a mechanical cantilever to probe the mechanical behavior of lithium under different conditions. For example, the group found that even with the same materials, the mechanical behavior of lithium is strongly dependent on the morphology of the deposited lithium. This suggests that perhaps one mechanical strategy is not sufficient to control its growth given the underlying geometrical inhomogeneities and morphology-dependent mechanical behavior.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Amy Marschilok</bold>, associate professor and co-principal investigator of the Institute for Electrochemically Stored Energy at Stony Brook University,Â The State University of New York, and her colleagues have been examining an iron oxide material for lithium intercalation. Theoretically, it promises to substantially increase the amount of stored energy for the same weight of these batteries. Additionally, iron is one of the most abundant materials, thus potentially lowering battery costs. The elegance of Marschilokâs study lies in the groupâs finer control over the size of individual particles as well as their aggregation and electrode specifications. With such systematic changes in the electrode geometry combined with multiple theoretical and experimental techniques, the researchers found that both bulk phase transformations and multiple reactions at the particle-electrolyte contact interact differently to exhibit macroscopically dissimilar battery responses. Based on this understanding, the group showed that the bulk behavior of solid lithium-storing materials can be appreciably altered by varying liquid electrolyte composition.</p><p id="Par17">Developing a new battery is an arduous process, and researchers prefer to make surgical modifications without having to reinvent everything from scratch for a new battery. One such modification is to use the same intercalation materials but replace the working ion, for example, swapping lithium for the sodium ion. Such an approach allows researchers to lean on the decades-long developmental efforts in lithium-ion batteries. However, even such a seemingly minor change alters the behavior of the same materials now intercalating a different ion. So researchers still have to understand the behavior of the materials in this new context. Using first-principles statistical mechanical theories, <bold>Anton Van der Ven</bold>, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his research group have examined how thermodynamics and kinetics of ion intercalation change across lithium, sodium, and magnesium ions. Such fundamental studies are useful in elucidating the design space available for building next-generation batteries.</p><p id="Par18">There has been a lot of buzz about solid electrolytes and how they are poised to replace the liquid electrolytes in state-of-the-art lithium batteries. The use of carbon interlayers has proven to be a promising materials modification strategy. Such an amendment has been shown to improve performance but an accurate understanding of how this works is still missing, thus limiting further systematic adjustments to the interlayer. <bold>Hongli Zhu</bold>, an associate professor at Northeastern University, and her research team have set up <italic>in situ</italic> neutron imaging experiments to map the distribution of lithium over time throughout the cell. Zhu reported that the lithium is stored at the interface between the carbon interlayer and solid electrolyte. With the passage of time, lithium gets stored in the carbon particles and deposits on the other side of the interlayer.</p><p id="Par19">While there have been considerable breakthroughs in materials development of solid-state batteries largely based on intuition, a game-changing idea is being able to systematically design such materials by choosing atomic constituents. To pursue such a rational design approach, researchers need to understand the connection between the underlying materialsâ structure and the resultant lithium conduction behavior. <bold>Gerbrand Ceder</bold>, the Samsung Distinguished Chair in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research at the University of California, Berkeley, and recipient of both the MRS Medal (2009) and the MRS Materials Theory Award (2016), and his group have been pursuing such overarching research using theoretical calculations. Based on detailed studies of exemplar lithium-conducting solid electrolytes, Ceder outlined some of the principles that correlate specific geometrical features in the crystal structures of these materials that translate to superior conduction. Such principles are powerful as they can be easily used to accurately screen many solid-electrolyte materials for conductivity without running expensive simulations to predict conductivity. With such formal rules, researchers can expect a new theme of materials discovery for solid electrolytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Photovoltaics</title><p id="Par21">Thin-film electronics have a wide range of applications in circuits, photonics, and energy. <bold>Stephen Forrest</bold>, the Peter A. Franken Distinguished University Professor of Engineering and Paul G. Goebel Professor of Engineering at the University of Michigan and a 1999 MRS Medalist, highlighted the influence strain can have on thin-film properties and addressed challenges in lowering cost while maintaining performance. In his studies, he employed an epitaxial liftoff and transfer technique to realize the films on both developable and non-developable surfaces. Forrestâs procedure for film fabrications involved growth, metallization, cold welding, nondestructive epitaxial liftoff, and surface cleaning. He said that curved focal plane arrays are challenging to prepare with semiconductor materials because they are in a plane subjected to bending. This can impact the spacing of the pixels and thus lower the resolution. Forrest solved this challenge by combining two rows of pixels and filling a gap to interconnect the two rows. In terms of applications, Forrest introduced thin-film thermal photovoltaics as a sustainable source of energy that transmutes waste heat into electrical energy. He presented some work that investigated Si as an alternative to Type IIIâV semiconductors to reduce cost. Although it presented some new challenges, such as its larger bandgap, Forrestâs research team was still able to prepare devices with similar power-conversion efficiencies to the Type IIIâV semiconductor counterparts.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Stephanie Essig</bold>, head of the Workgroup High-Efficiency Solar Cells at UniversitÃ¤tÂ Stuttgart, addressed challenges in fabricating perovskite/Si tandem solar cells. Silicon-based solar cells are highly efficient when combined with other top cells having much wider bandgap, which is referred to as tandem solar-cell design. Increasing the number of junctions (cells) increases the efficiency beyond 30 percent. However, the efficiency does not increase indefinitely as 6-junction devices were found to have comparable efficiency as the 3-junction devices. This results from the extra complexity associated with the increase in number of top cells. These cells can be interconnected by different designs, the most notable of which is a 2-terminal tandem design. Essig showed how the solar-cell efficiency could also be increased through the 3-terminal and 4-terminal tandem designs. A 4-terminal GaInP/Si 2-junction tandem device had efficiency improved beyond 30 percent. Essig also demonstrated that the challenges associated with the 3- and 4-terminal designs can be overcome by having an optimal voltage ratio between the top and bottom cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec66"><title>Other highlights</title><p id="Par24">Keeping sustainability in mind shapes research projects as materials researchers consider energy efficiency, carbon dioxide reduction, water purification, and impact on the environment. In her work on low-entropy phase transition for integrated photonic memory, <bold>Tiantian Li</bold>, an associate professor at Xiâan University of Posts and Telecommunications, reports the finding of low-entropic structural transitions in layered In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> structures for producing the energy efficiency and speed constraints of memristive circuits and devices. In her quest for improved optical phase-change materials (O-PCMs)âwhich serve as an attractive candidate in memory and logic units for optical signal processing and storageâLi and her colleagues investigated the two-layered crystalline states ofÂ Indium (III) selenideÂ materialsÂ for optical memory. She demonstrated nonvolatileÂ switchingÂ of the hybridÂ In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>-Si resonator driven by a single nanosecond pulse. Liâs materials are a vast improvement compared to amorphous-crystalline transitions. Liâs group collected experimental and computational data using differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, and density functional theory. Some applications of O-PCMs include nonvolatile optical memory, nonvolatile photonic switch, neuromorphic photonics, reconfigurable photonics devices, and recently, optical neurosynaptic networks capable of supervised and unsupervised learning.</p><p id="Par25">Cement production is one of the leading causes of global CO<sub>2</sub>Â pollution, inspiring researchers across the globe to rethink the cement industry for a greener future. Production of cement clinker is a key step that can be reformulated. Clinkers are made via the sintering of limestone and clay, and their microstructure is the key aspect defining their usefulness. To reformulate this step, researchers want to correlate various processing attributes to changes in the clinker microstructure. Although visualizing the microstructure is not a difficult task and typically optical microscopy gives desired resolution, analysis of the microstructure is effort-intensive. Usually, one manually identifies various materials phases in such images based on an empirical understanding of underlying materials phases. <bold>N.M. Anoop Krishnan</bold>, an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, and his colleagues are using machine learning to automate this step to accelerate the overall research in rethinking cement production. Although multiple machine learning algorithms for image analysis have been proposed by tech companies like Facebook and used by various researchers for their scientific studies, there remains a challenge of a lack of a reliable image dataset of clinker microstructures. Accordingly, Krishnanâs group first developed a database of hundreds of microstructural images with corresponding phases identified manually. Once such a database was ready, the researchers tweaked and trained Detectron 2âa convolutional neural network-based algorithm proposed by Facebook to detect objects in imagesâon such an image database. The results show that the various phases in the clinker microstructure can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Although the algorithm needs improving to decrease errors like missed particles and misclassifications, Krishnan and his colleagues plan to use these interpreted images for further analysisâespecially to correlate different cement manufacturing processes to clinker microstructures.</p><p id="Par26">Sustainability is a major challenge in semiconductor research. An important tradeoff to consider is whether device performance parity or even compromise is acceptable if it offers a major reduction in environmental impact. Nanomaterials are a viable option for printed electronics because they can be printed in solution. <bold>Aaron Franklin</bold>, the Addy Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, presented work from his group that used aerosol jet printing to print transistors. When an ink is aerosolized, it flows to prevent clogging of the nozzle. This allows access to greater ranges of ink viscosities and thus opens the door to more types of nanomaterials that can be printed. Franklinâs research team focused on printing carbon nanotube (CNT) films because of their resistance to such environmental conditions as thermal and mechanical strain, and good electrical properties. Franklinâs group achieved high uniformity and stability of the printed CNT films and found that regulating the ink temperature allowed tuning of the nanotube density and mobility during printing. He shared some recent work that aimed to print multiple components of the devices simultaneously, which allowed for fewer steps and less processing. In addressing the growing problem of electronic waste, Franklin said there is an increased need for electronics that are biodegradable and/or recyclable. His group was able to print inks with nanocellulose, a sustainable material, as an ionic dielectric. These devices had good performance and were stable for at least a year. The researchers were then able to recover the CNTs used as an ink through a sonication extraction process and reprint the inks into new devices, thus demonstrating recyclability.</p><p id="Par27">In contemplating new materials for devices, <bold>Neil Graddage</bold>, a research officer for the National Research Council in Canada, reported on silver chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) asÂ an alternative material for near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors. These QDs offer the advantages of narrow bandgaps and reduced toxicity relative to their lead-based counterparts. His research team implemented a hot injection approach to synthesize Ag<sub>2</sub>Se and Ag<sub>2</sub>Te QDs. Tuning of parameters such as capping ligands and feed ratios influenced the synthesis by changing viscosity and diffusion rates during QD formation. These factors impacted the QD size, photoluminescence peak position, the quantum yield, and stability. Graddageâs research team then implemented these into devices but faced some challenges they aim to address in the future by optimizing the charge extraction. NIR photodetectors have several promising applications including tissue imaging, food inspection, autonomous transport, and bioinformatics.</p><p id="Par28">Colloidal nanocrystals have a vast potential for applications and technological solutions but tuning such properties as shapes and sizes remains a challenge. Currently, several NIR technologies existÂ that work very well; however, they are challenging to make, which drives up their cost. <bold>Raffaella Buonsanti</bold>, an associate professor at Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne, shared how valuable <italic>in situ</italic> studies of nanocrystal synthesis reactions can be in expanding the library of accessible nanocrystal shapes. She used <italic>in situ</italic> x-ray absorption near-edge structure by coupling a reaction flask to a synchrotron, which allowed insight into the reaction intermediates. Buonsanti also conducted <italic>in situ</italic> x-ray diffraction, <italic>in situ</italic> small-angle x-ray scattering, and <italic>in sit</italic><italic>u</italic> solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. One system she studied included copper nanocrystals. Copper is an excellent catalyst for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) but can lead to the formation of 16 different products. Factors such as the composition, size, exposed facets, and surface modification all dictate the product, and the facet is especially important. Using <italic>in situ</italic> studies enabled a better understanding of the copper reaction intermediates and allowed tuning of parameters to achieve new structures. These shapes could be designed to expose a single-crystal facet, allowing better selectivity for the CO2RR. Buonsanti used similar studies on coreâshell particles, which helped stabilize them. <italic>In situ</italic> studies helped determine important factors that contributed to the formation of shells and allowed for improved design strategies.</p><p id="Par29">Carbon QDs are a unique class of optically emissive nanomaterials that are composed mainly of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Unlike their inorganic QD counterparts, carbon dots do not require ligands to coordinate and stabilize them. In addition, they are highly dispersed in water, very stable, easily dried, and have low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. The emission mechanism has puzzled researchers in their efforts to answer the question of whether carbon dots are molecule-like or QD-like. It turns out that they can be both and their emissive properties depend highly on their synthesis conditions that include both top-down or bottom-up strategies. <bold>Rafik Naccache</bold>, an associate professor at Concordia University, presented a type of carbon dot that his group synthesized and this has both blue and red emission bands when excited at 405Â nm. He determined that the carbon dots had a coreâshell-like structure and that the blue emission originated from the core, while the red emission originated from the shell. Interestingly, the red band could beÂ quenched upon exposure to different metals. In constrast, the blue band remained unchanged, which demonstrates the potential of these carbon dots for applications such as ratio-metric sensing. Certain samples also showed selectivity toward sensing metal cations such as mercury or lead that show promise for applications such as water purification and water sensing. Naccache also presented data showing promise in using the surface states of the carbon dots for catalyst applications.</p><p id="Par30">In the area of emergent materials for low power electronics, <bold>Shuolong Yang</bold>, an assistant professor at The University of Chicago, reported on the realization of topological superconductivity in thin films of FeTeSe grown by molecularÂ beam epitaxy (MBE). The topological states in FeTeSe thin films could be adjusted by either tuning the composition or thickness of the films. Using MBE and circular dichroism light-source angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), Yang grew and characterized films that showed clear signs of a three-dimensional (3D) topologically insulating phase at tellurium contents above Teâ=â0.7 in the FeTe<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Se<sub>1â<italic>x</italic></sub> compositional series. There was a clear 3D-to-2D transition in the experimentally probed band structure from ARPES at thicknesses above two monolayers, which demonstrates the thickness dependence of these films. Yang is looking toward future experiments to realize robust topological superconductivity in FeTeSe in the monolayer limit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec67"><title>Wearable electronics and materials for health monitoring</title><p id="Par32"><bold>Jennifer Dionne</bold> of Stanford University opened her talk by sharing the fact that the research community has explored only about 5% of the Earthâs oceans. They are vast,Â extreme, and contain enormous amounts of data in biological ecosystems. Organisms shed a large amount of biological material into the ocean; however, current methods to map species for abundance or changes over time such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, polymerase chain reactions, cell cultures, and mass spectrometry are not suitable for high throughput screening.</p><p id="Par33">Dionne, the Senior Associate Vice Provost of Research Platforms/Shared Facilities and director of Photonics at Thermodynamic Limits USÂ Department of Energy-Energy Frontier Research Center at Stanford and recipient of the 2017 MRS Outstanding Early-Career Investigator Award, and her group developed high-throughputÂ <italic>in situ</italic>Â sensors that can detect genes, proteins, metabolites, and whole cells. She achieved this using an optical sensor based on a silica metasurface that creates miniaturized lenses and waveguides and enhanced detection of the analytes of interest. Optimization of the design allowed for her group to achieve a high-quality factor (high-Q) with improved temporal and spatial control and improved performance. These high-Q metasurfaces were excited below the bandgap of Si, enabling longer integration times and avoiding sample heating and damage. Dionne demonstrated how these metasurfaces could be applied to a range of bio-analytes such as amino acids, bacterial pathogens in wastewater, and drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. This method achieved significantly faster acquisition times than traditional methods and could be used for label-free detection; and this method of detection could be expanded further to a wide variety of biological systems.</p><p id="Par34">The sense of touch involves skin receptors that detect various forms of stimuli. While scientists continue to recreate the sense of touch in virtual reality, a common design approach is stimulating touch sensations in the hands. However, unveiled robotic designs like the HaptX VR gloves are often bulky and cumbersome. <bold>Marcia OâMalley</bold>, who is Associate Dean for Research and Innovation in the George R. Brown School of Engineering and the Thomas Michael Panos Family Professor in Mechanical Engineering at Rice University, and her research group introduced an alternative approach for designing novel wearable devices that provides several haptic feedbacks (skin stretch, squeeze, and vibration cues) to the wrist and arm. These devices that simultaneously provide multiple cutaneous cues are a vast design improvement compared to everyday wearables that focus on a single vibration modality of feedback. OâMalley discussed the efforts to design novel wearable haptic devices (e.g., Tasbi and MISSIVE) that deliver the reliable perception of multisensory haptic cues. She presented ongoing challenges along with the current venture of exploring soft textile-based materials for constructing wearable haptic devices.</p><p id="Par35">Wearable electronics are required to be, among other things, highly stretchable, biocompatible, and washable. Considering all these requirements, textiles are the most optimal substrates being used for these electronics. Employing 2D material inks such as graphene and other layered materials for the electronic circuit design reduces the cost of production as well as shows promise of tunability and multifunctionality. Using microfluidic exfoliation, graphene platelets can be obtained from graphite and the aspect ratio of these platelets can be tuned to have corresponding changes in electrical conductivity. In addition, bandgaps of the wearable electronics can be tuned by designing layered materials. <bold>Felice Torrisi</bold>, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London, demonstrated an inkjet printing approach for printing graphene oxide on a cotton substrate. The surface of the cotton was modified with cations to develop a positive charge whereas that of the graphene oxide ink was negatively charged. This was found to improve the adhesion of the ink on the cotton substrate considerably, resulting in stable electronic properties for over 20 wash cycles. In addition, Torrisi showed how cotton wool could be mixed with graphene ink to produce graphene-cotton fiber via a wet-spinning approach. This significantly improved the flexibility of graphene.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>Jisun Im</bold>, a research fellow at the Centre for Additive Manufacturing at The University of Nottingham, presented work aiming to improve gold nanoparticle printing techniques in additive manufacturing. Gold is an excellent alternative to copper and silver inks, because it is very stable and has a high chemical stability. Im presented some strategies that improved the joining of the nanoparticles, reduced the amount of microcracks, lowered the activation energy for sintering, and increased the conductivity. These included adding small molecules to join the particles together, using ligands that could be photocleaved with ultraviolet light, and using polymerânanoparticle composites. Im highlighted the interesting shapes and designs that can be achieved using additive manufacturing while addressing current challenges that affect the performance of conductive inks. Additive manufacturing is a promising technique to achieve complex 3D structures for applications including flexible and wearable electronics, optoelectronics, and sensors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Nanomaterials</title><p id="Par38">Nanoscale lasing has potential for applications such as facial recognition, virtual reality displays, and integrated circuits;Â however, their implementation requires control of the properties of the emitted light including the phase, intensity, and polarization. <bold>Teri Odom</bold>, the Joan Husting Madden and William H. Madden, Jr. Professor of Chemistry and chair of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University and a Fellow of MRS, presented research from her group that combined arrays of metal nanoparticles with QD films. The metal nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance, a phenomenon that allows for fields to be highly localized at the particle surface. The QD films act as a promising gain medium due to their high photoluminescent quantum yields, size control and tunability, and processability from solution phase. Odomâs group explored various parameters such as lattice spacing of the metal nanoparticles, QD film thickness, the addition of shells, and alternative gain materials such as perovskites. Their work demonstrated control over properties such as lasing direction and polarization of the emitted radiation. Odomâs group has an aim to produce continuous-wave electrically pumped nanoscale lasers.</p><p id="Par39">The semiconductor Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has a very wide bandgap of nearly 5Â eV with potential applications in high-power electronics in extreme environments due to its very high thermal and chemical stability. Its light emission properties can be readily tuned by the introduction of defects from dopants and this renders it viable for photonics applications. In fact, a wide variety of dopant ions are available that allow tuning of bands to span from the ultraviolet to infrared. <bold>Emilio Nogales</bold>, a professor at the UniversidadÂ ComplutenseÂ Madrid, investigated the effects of doping with Cr<sup>3+</sup> and introducing defects on Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanowires. The introduction of Cr<sup>3+</sup> causes a red band to appear that has two sharp features. There also is a broad band at room temperature. When the Cr<sup>3+</sup>-doped nanowire is excited, red photoluminescence is observed mainly at the ends of the wire. Nogales then used a focusedÂ ion beam to pattern holes on the nanowire and employed distributed Bragg reflectors to introduce stop bands that allowed him to achieve spatially confined light emission within the nanowire. This system has potential applications in thermometry because spectral shifts could be observed with changes in temperature. This thermometer had both a wide dynamic range and good spatial resolution that allowed measurement of local heating by laser irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational tools</title><p id="Par41">Advanced artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science approaches have revolutionized the design of new materials in recent decades, resulting in an explosion of promising materials for many applications and the development of frameworks to enable their continuous improvement.Â At the same time, with the vast amount of data being collected globally, computationalists have been building databases and algorithms to extract useful information from data sets to accelerate research efforts.</p><p id="Par42">Conventionally used models employ atoms and chemical bonds as materials descriptors, which cannot be readily extended to complex materials structures such as composites. Composite materials structures involve highly complex interactions between the fillers and matrix resulting from phenomena such as cross-linking, phase separation, and filler orientation. <bold>Shun Muroga</bold> of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology introduced a multimodal AI model that integrates conventional AI with other materials descriptors such as the physical and chemical structure. Muroga studied over 80 polymer matrix composites from five matrices, two additives, and three fillers all with different volume fractions. The materials were characterized using optical microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy and the results were fed into the AI model. The model was able to self-generate characterization data and predict the properties of over 100,000 composite materials after the training process. This demonstrates how the multimodal AI approach efficiently accounts for the interplay of complex interactions in composite materials, rendering it more effective at materials prediction than the conventional models.</p><p id="Par43">The mechanical response of structural materials is influenced by grain-boundary interaction with dislocations. Naturally, this interaction is a function of the local atomic environment, which has been characterized across several studies using structural units. <bold>Avanish Mishra</bold>, directorâs postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and his research team took a novel approach to the problem and characterized grain-boundary structures using strain functional descriptors (SFDs). They coupled this characterization with unsupervised learning methods. Using SFDs, the researchers were able to decompose almost 5000 grain boundaries into six classes. The dislocation interactions were analyzed using these classes. The researchers also looked at structural motifs within a cutoff distance for the grain-boundary structures, and are currently building a database for motifs across different misorientation angles and respective metastable states.</p><p id="Par44">Large, high-dimensional data sets consisting of chemical structures and related characteristics are being produced in the sciences at an increasingly high rate. There is, however, a lack of methods available to show such data while maintaining both global and local characteristics with a reasonable degree of detail and computational cost to permit further examination and interpretation. <bold>Axel van de Walleâs</bold> research group at Brown University introduced aÂ new data visualization technique as a potential solution for this issue based on the special quasirandom structure. The research teamÂ provided a variety of computer programs that make it possible to build high-dimensional calculations ofÂ phase diagram (CALPHAD) databases from first-principles computations by adding âshort-range-order corrections, rigorous handling of mechanical instabilities, and interactive visualization of a high-dimensional phase diagram.â Ultimately, this proposedÂ visualization toolÂ enables interactive 3D cross-sectional exploration of higher-dimensional phase diagrams.</p><p id="Par45">The search for application-tailored thermoelectric materials often requires collaborations between experimentalists and computationalists. <bold>Eric Toberer</bold>, professor and director of materials science at the Colorado School of Mines, points out that for these collaborations to be more fruitful, a deeper understanding of defect physics is required to calculate native defect energetics and concentrations prior to experiments. This enables more productive efforts at predicting suitable compounds with desired properties. The considerations space in theoretical defect calculations exceeds those of experiments. Experiments are mostly limited to nominal stoichiometry and processing parameters, whereas theory considers bandgaps, band masses, and elemental chemical potentials, for example. This results in scenarios in which expected phase diagrams may differ between the two approaches. Toberer asserts the importance of ensuring not necessarily perfect agreement between the two approaches but rather close enough agreement within the same order of magnitude. This ensures that predicted defect concentrations in different compounds will be a good representation of reality. He points out that, in the absence of these defect calculations, defect compensation by antisite defects for similar sites with different charges needs to be critically considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Additional highlights</title><p id="Par47">Electronic textiles (e-textiles) is a rapidly growing field of research with a large innovation space in multifunctionality. The electronic circuits and systems in the textiles are required to be invisible to the user to avoid reducing the aesthetic appeal of the clothing. However, the batteries used are so bulky that they end up being visible to users and defeating the purpose of having concealed wearables. There has therefore been the drive away from these traditional batteries into alternative textile-based energy-storage devices such as supercapacitors. Piezoelectric materials can be used to convert kinetic energy associated with straining the textile into electrical energy that can be stored. <bold>Stephen Beeby</bold>, who holds a prestigious Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies at the University of Southampton, showed that ferroelectric materials are able to store more energy in multiple stress states with much increased sensitivity to strains than piezoelectric materials. He also gave an overview of other power harvesting technologies including triboelectric (rubbing textiles together), photovoltaic, and wireless power harvesting (capturing electromagnetic energy). âThe choice of energy harvesting technique is dependent on the application and the energy sources available,â Beeby said. He also showed that a porous polymer membrane can be employed to convert any textile into an e-textile.</p><p id="Par48">In recent decades, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have become competitive participants in advancing solid-state light devices. However, their limiting constraints involve shorter lifespans, high manufacturing costs, and insufficient conductivity of their components, such as the indium-tin-oxide or ITO electrode. An essential requirement is having smooth electrodes that achieve a low surface roughness (Raâ&lt;âseveral nm) to mitigate severe electric leakage. <bold>Satoru Ohisa</bold>, a researcher at Japan Broadcasting Corporation, proposed aluminum foil as a viable candidate for OLED electrode substrates due to their low cost, high conductivity, high thermal tolerance, and gas barrier performance. However, their high surface roughness (Raâ&gt;â200Â nm) causes these substrates to be absent in OLEDs. Ohisa and his colleagues fabricated a thick buffer layer electrode by covering and planarizing the aluminum foil surface with a phosphotungstic acid (H<sub>3</sub>PW<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>) with a noticeably reduced surface roughness (Raâ=â0.5Â nm). As a result, Ohisa achieved an aluminum foil-based OLED with stable light emission.</p><p id="Par49"><bold>G. Jeffrey Snyder</bold> of Northwestern University posed a question to the audience: âWhat makes a good thermoelectric material?â To answer that question, he explored the electronic band structure characteristics of good thermoelectric materials. Excellent thermoelectric properties can be found in materials that have complex Fermi surfaces and high levels of valley degeneracy. Snyder emphasized the importance of correctly quantifying the electronic properties of thermoelectric materials and provided two metrics: the Seebeck effective mass and the thermoelectric quality factor, both of which reflect the favorability of the electronic structure of a given semiconductor material for thermoelectric applications. Using a single measurement of resistivity and thermopower at an arbitrary temperature, the quality factor can be used to assess the maximum possible thermoelectric performance of a given semiconductor. Valley degeneracy was presented even more straightforwardly: the larger the number of degenerate valleys in a given semiconductor, the better the thermoelectric performance. Snyder provided helpful examples of candidate materials where such favorable electronic properties are exhibited, such as Mg<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>, PbTe, and CoSb<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="Par50">Dislocations, when interacting with grain boundaries in crystalline metals, undergo one of the following processes: transmission, reflection, nucleation, or annihilation. These interactions are the underlying physics for the HallâPetch relation that relates yield strength to average grain size in a metal. Such interactions still lack a complete understanding, which motivated <bold>Eric Homer</bold> of Brigham Young University and his team to investigate the phenomenon. They simulated 9 Ni [112] tilt boundaries including metastable states. They noted that despite favorable transmission conditions, only four of the 27 exhibit transmission of the dislocation when it impacts grain boundaries. In a few cases, the research team observed nucleation at a different site than the site of impact. Homer said his team is now pursuing a different angle to this problem that considers the possibility of nucleation and annihilation at grain boundaries not being coupled but rather distinct events, results of which are definitely worth waiting for.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Broader impact</title><p id="Par52">This yearâs symposium on Broader Impact addressed early-career development. Some presenters talked about their experience moving from industry to academia whereas others moved from academia to industry.Â <bold>Jina Ko</bold>, an assistant professor at the University ofÂ PennsylvaniaÂ (Penn), said the top advice she had received from her supervisor was to do what she wanted to do and not only the things she was capable of doing at any given time, with the logic that this is how one grows and evolves.Â <bold>Martin Wilkovitsch</bold>, a postdoctoral researcher at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Wien, echoed Ko on the importance of guidance from a strong mentor.</p><p id="Par53">After obtaining her PhD degree, Ko held a position as a PhD bioengineering intern at the life science company Verily and she did postdoctoral work as a Schmidt Science Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and theÂ Wyss Institute at Harvard University. After significant soul-searching, including guidance from a mentor on her career journey, Ko decided that she cherished the freedom that academia gave her to generate and pursue novel ideas. This prompted her to pursue a career as a tenure-track professor, ultimately leading to her appointment at Penn. Ko stressed the immense importance of knowing what you want to do when choosing a vocation, emphasizing that deliberate exploration leads to better outcomes than aimless wandering.</p><p id="Par54">Wilkovitsch provided an alternative career path post-PhD, describing how he spun his doctoral work into a biotech startup company. Also emphasizing the value of a good mentor, Wilkovitsch said it was his supervisor who agreed to support him in starting his company. In preparation, Wilkovitsch first pursued a postdoctoral position to further grow and expand his network. This is an important part of the academia-to-tech transformation, he said. Wilkovitsch advised on the importance of choosing the âright peopleâ when starting a company, recounting the cautions he received when he decided to co-found his company with his friend of eight years. It was important in such a case, he said, to communicate clearly and delineate roles. He suggested that those looking to co-found a company should split their workload between the technical and business side of things, with either co-founder focusing more on either side of the enterprise. Another key lesson he learned was to generate and patent useful IP to increase the attractiveness of fledgling tech startups to investors.</p><p id="Par55"><bold>Jonathan Fauerbach</bold>Â of Miltenyi Biotec in Germany andÂ <bold>Aaron Franklin</bold>Â of Duke University provided âhow-toâ advice on transitioning from one type of institution to another. Fauerbach, who moved from academia to industry, alluded to the importance of reading job postings carefully in order to tailor each application to the job in question. He provided tips regarding the job application âvocabularyâ for PhDs and postdocs, mentioning that PhD jobs typically have obvious titles such as âScientist,â but also less obvious titles such as âProject Managerâ or âTeam Coordinator.â To be most successful, he said, it is important to highlight hard (technical) skills as well as soft (people) skills. The best way to convey soft skills, he said, is through stories and that this required a significant degree of self-awareness and self-reflection.</p><p id="Par56">Based on his move from industry to academia, Franklin gave powerful insights into the faculty recruiting process, and what faculty look for in unconventional candidates, such as those coming from industry. âKnowledge transferâ is important, he said, both in finding a mentor and in serving as one. Aspiring industry professionals looking to make the jump over to academia should keep one foot in each door in terms of networking, he said. They should also maintain a visible track record of innovation by filing patent applications and publishing articles.</p><p id="Par57">According toÂ <bold>Gopal Rao</bold>, Chief Editor for Technical Content at MRS and editor ofÂ <italic>MRS Bulletin</italic>, the importance of publishing oneâs research cannot be understated, not just for scientists in general, but also for early-career researchers. For the actual writing process, rather than start from beginning to end, Rao suggests a different approach. Begin with the title, then write the conclusions section. Think of the conclusion as your destination, Rao said. It then serves as a map for the article. Next, write the abstract, which then operates as a mini-version of the outline for the paper. Next, prepare the figures and captions. Readers often look at figures after the abstract and conclusion before reading the article. Rao acknowledged that not all researchers like to write. He said that what is important is not to be a âgreatâ writer, but to be a âcarefulâ writer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>For more news coverage</title><p id="Par59">Look for articles based on presentations from the Meeting in future issues ofÂ <italic>MRS Advances</italic>, an archival, peer-reviewed journal reporting snapshots of work in progress on key materials topics identified by leading-edge MRS Meeting programming.
