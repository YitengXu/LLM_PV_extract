Solar energy is abundant, and its utilization is prioritized, including rooftop solar power plant (RSPP). This research presents a techno-economic analysis of an RSPP installed in a mosque in Ngombol subdistrict, Purworejo district, Central Java, Indonesia. This article also introduces and explains the regulation of RSPP and electricity tariffs in Indonesia, which define the economics of RSPP. This study employs an operational and financial model to analyze RSPP in five scenarios. The RSPP design objective is to reduce the annual energy usage of the mosque and yield the highest Net Present Value (NPV). According to the result, RSPP at all configurations based on the type and number of panels yield negative NPVs at the current electricity tariff, costs of components, and regulations implemented concerning RSPP. Proposed policy adjustment modeled through different scenarios provide benefit to some extent, limited by other policies. Hence, a combination of different policy adjustments may be required to achieve the most optimal condition for RSPP implementation on the mosque rooftop. This study could help policymakers to understand the possible directions of policy design for faster PV implementation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4822</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_8968.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In terms of the potential for renewables, Indonesia has a total capacity of 417.6 GW from different sources such as tidal, geothermal, bio, wind, hydro, and solar energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. 207.8 GW or about half of this capacity is from solar energy thanks to its geographical condition crossed by the equator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This capacity potential is relatively more significant than the total electricity generation capacity in June 2020, only at 71 GW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. By the first September 2021, solar energy implementation in Indonesia only accounts for 0.08% of its potential, with a capacity of 150 MWp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This utilization rate is relatively low as Indonesia’s energy sector is still dominated by fossil fuels. In 2020, fossil fuel supported 88.8% of the primary energy supply and 85.3% of the electricity generation capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This condition results in high Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector, comprising around 30–40% of the total GHG emission in Indonesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Renewable energy has been known as a low-carbon alternative energy source to replace fossil fuels. Tawalbeh et al. estimated the carbon footprint from solar power to be in the range of 14–73 g CO2-eq/kWh, which is only 2 to 10% of the carbon emitted in oil-fueled electricity generation for generating one kWh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore as a part of its climate action, Indonesia targets to increase the share of renewable energy in its primary energy supply mix to 23% by 2025<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To achieve this target, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) planned to increase the solar power plant (SPP) capacity to 3.6 GWp by 2025, comprising large-scale SPP, rooftop SPP (RSPP), and floating SPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), a think-tank in energy and environment, suggested the possibilities of Indonesia achieving the energy transition goal by utilizing the distributed generation of solar power in the form of rooftop and off-grid SPP. IESR further estimated that a minimum potential of 2 GWp RSPP exists in Jakarta and Surabaya’s residential market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This study implies a more significant potential when considering other cities and types of buildings. A growing interest in studies on RSPP design can also be seen in Indonesia, which analyzes RSPP on residential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, office<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, educational<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and industrial buildings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This paper will focus on SPP on mosque rooftops due to its significance in the context of Indonesia, while this type of building has not received the same research attention as others.</p><p id="Par4">Indonesia is one of the countries with the largest population of Muslims in the world. For that reason, the Ministry of Religious Affairs reported the existence of more than 600,000 mosques and prayer halls of different sizes to support their activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Muslims gather daily at mosques for congregations at five designated times (before dawn, midday, afternoon, sunset, and evening), with a higher volume of visits every Friday midday. The sheer number of mosques suggests a large cumulative rooftop area, while the recurrent use of mosques may result in significant electricity use, which justifies the potential for RSPP implementation. In 2017, the Vice President of Indonesia and the Indonesian Council of Clerics, Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) launched the eco-mosque initiative that aims to increase the environmental awareness of communities through renewable energy use, energy efficiency, waste management, and water preservation in mosques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The relatively large area of the mosque’s roof is suitable for RSPP installation. The RSPP can provide the mosque with clean electricity with relatively low operation and maintenance expenditure (OPEX), resulting in electricity bills and GHG emission reduction from the financial and environmental perspectives. Higher electricity tariffs and the technology’s decreasing capital expenditure (CAPEX) result in RSPP’s more attractive business case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. According to Ghazali et al., the use of clean energy in such buildings is also ethically and morally relevant since preserving nature and the environment is one of the teachings of Islam, as indirectly suggested by the religion’s holy book<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In the broader context, the adoption of solar PV suits well for rural electrification through micro-grid. Due to its decentralized nature, the micro-grid is an economical option to enable electrification in remote areas than extending the centralized grid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The micro-grid with the decentralized generation, such as SPP, yields several advantages such as energy loss reduction, a more reliable supply, and carbon emission reduction due to the higher share of renewable energy adoption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Mosques ideally serve as places of worship and as community building centers for their surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Especially for rural areas, this purpose can be further enhanced by coupling mosques with decentralized generation and connecting them through micro-grid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">There has been a significant number of researches on the implementation of rooftop solar PV for mosques, as will be briefly discussed in this paper. Rashid et al. showed RSPP’s ability to reduce the annual electricity bill by 47% in Malaysia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The payback period for the system’s CAPEX was reached in 13 years. A similar study was also conducted in Kuwait by Almutairi to identify the financial feasibility of the RSPP at 1,400 mosques in 2018, and the exact payback period was recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The PV systems were designed to supply the connected load and shave the peak load during the day. It is, however, essential to note that both studies did not consider the present value of future cash flow, which means that the benefit of the system is subject to overestimation with the actual payback period achieved at a later date.</p><p id="Par7">In 2019, Elshurafa et al. conducted a more comprehensive pilot study of the mosque RSPP in Saudi Arabia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The RSPP was connected to the grid for different scenarios, including no supporting policy and a net-metering mechanism enabling the compensation for the exported surplus generation to the grid. The results showed that the analyzed system was financially attractive for both scenarios. The study finds that the analyzed system is economically attractive for both scenarios. The implementation of net-metering reduced the cost incurred for fulfilling electricity needs by 22% lower than the RSPP with no support policy scenario.</p><p id="Par8">The GOI has implemented regulation on the RSPP through the Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) No. 49/2018 to support the implementation of this technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Among other points, this regulation includes a net-metering scheme for RSPP in Indonesia, enabling consumers with RSPP to export their excess produced energy to the grid owned by the State Electricity Company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). The exported electricity will offset the imported electricity from PLN and be calculated each month. The amount of electricity a consumer can offset every month is 65% of the exported electricity. PLN argues that this arrangement is made to account for transmission and distribution expenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In the case of higher export, the export balance can be accumulated for three months before the balance is reset to zero. This regulation also set the maximum capacity of RSPP, which is 100% of the electricity capacity stated in the contract. However, reports suggest that despite the Government’s intention to accelerate the implementation of RSPP, this regulation fails to enable the financial benefits of installing RSPP. Based on the simulation done by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), consumers will face difficulties in estimating their size of SPP to maximize savings, which is also sensitive to the consumers’ daytime load profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Their result shows that the policy favors consumers with high daytime load profiles and minimal export to the grid, contrary to its aim, which encourages RSPP through the ability to export to the grid. This load profile is uncommon as the majority of the consumers, especially in the residential sector, have a higher load profile in the evening.</p><p id="Par9">Setyawati examines the perception towards the current regulation on RSPP in Indonesia through interviews and online surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The survey results indicate that both consumer and institutional barriers constrain the RSPP implementation under the current policy. 71% of 987 PLN customers who participated in the surveys are interested in installing RSPP but prefer to wait for other options, which implies the less attractiveness of the current policy. The consumer is concerned about the high capital cost, long-term return on investment, and lack of information. Through the interviews with the Government, private sector, and energy experts, Setyawati identified that the low export rate for electricity is a substantial hurdle to attracting prospective users.</p><p id="Par10">The initial investment in CAPEX and electricity bill savings, which is a function of the electricity tariff, define the return on investment of SPP in general, including RSPP. In Indonesia, the MEMR determines the electricity tariff provided by the PLN through the Ministerial Regulation, which is kept updated from time to time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. There are 37 electricity tariffs grouped by the consumer sector (Residential, Social, Industrial, Business, and Governmental) and the size of electricity capacity, expressed in VA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Among the 37 tariff groups, 25 of them are subsidized, including the electricity tariff for all consumers in social. Compared to the basic production costs of electricity generation, Biaya Pokok Produksi (BPP), determined through the MEMR Ministerial Decree, the electricity tariff for the social sector is around 35% lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Hence, the subsidized electricity tariff for social sector consumers may hamper the ability of RSPP on the mosque in Indonesia to recover its initial investment due to the lower bill savings. The regulation on electricity tariff also administers a minimum monthly usage of 40 h which prevents consumers from entirely avoiding electricity bills despite the sufficient RSPP production to offset the imports. Referring to the analysis of IEEFA, consumers in the social sector will find it even more challenging to determine the size of RSPP to maximize electricity bill savings.</p><p id="Par11">There are various methods for sizing SPP. Several SPP design and analysis studies adopt commercially available software, such as Homer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, PVsyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, SOLARGIS pvPlanner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, RETSreen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and System Advisory Model (SAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Šimić et al. proposed a method for sizing an economically optimal SPP based on Croatian policy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The price of the electricity produced by the SPP depends on the ratio of export and import. The policy imposes lower electricity prices generated by the SPP and reduced income at a higher export ratio. Thus, oversizing the SPP has a detrimental effect on the financial feasibility of the SPP.</p><p id="Par12">This study aimed to conduct a similar analysis with those previously mentioned in related research, which involves exploring the design and feasibility of a mosque RSPP based on a location and the regulation in effect on RSPP in Indonesia as the case study. As mentioned above, the current policies revolving around the implementation of RSPP in Indonesia are somewhat unsupportive. Thus, four different policy scenarios are proposed in the simulations to realize RSPP implementation’s financial benefit better. To that end, we present a detailed techno-economic analysis of mosque RSPP in Indonesia for the first time, and the findings are expected to serve two purposes. The first is to define the implementation of RSPP on a mosque in Indonesia. The second is to provide insights to policymakers on the effectiveness of the current supporting policy for implementing the system for a specific end-user.</p><p id="Par13">This paper is structured into four chapters.

Due to the relatively constant irradiance value across years, the site condition data used in the design and simulation can be represented by the data from one of the available years, with its average daily GHI being closest to the average. Thus, 2008, with an average daily GHI at 5.41 W/m<sup>2</sup>, is used for the design and simulation. Since 2008 is a leap year, only data from 365 days is used to simulate a year of operation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) average daily GHI at each year between 2008–2019.

When the load exceeds the RSPP generation, generated energy will be consumed while importing energy from the grid to supply the deficit.

Equations (<xref rid="Equ26" ref-type="disp-formula">26</xref> and <xref rid="Equ27" ref-type="disp-formula">27</xref>) present the import and export mechanism of the model. According to the regulation, the imports and exports are accumulated each month to determine the monthly electricity bill. PLN compensates 65% of the exported energy to offset the imported energy. The offset amount is limited that the reduced imported energy can not be lower than the monthly minimum load, equal to 40 h usage of the maximum electricity capacity, which results in 220 kWh monthly minimum load or 2640 kWh annual minimum load (<inline-formula id="IEq45"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq45_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">minload</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq45_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

If this limit is reached, the export excess will be deposited in the grid and offset up to the following three months’ imports before being reset to zero. Due to the limitation of the model, the offset balance reset mechanism is not modeled, and the model accumulated the imports and exports annually. Hence, the model may not account for the lost export deposits due to the reset mechanism. The net load, the reduced load due to the utilization of the RSPP, can be obtained by offsetting the imports with the compensated exports, expressed in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ28" ref-type="disp-formula">28</xref>). This value will be used in calculating the annual revenue of the RSPP, as further explained in the financial model in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>RSPP financial model.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8968_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">The RSPP gains its revenue from the annual electricity bill saving, calculated by subtracting the initial load with the final load after the utilization of RSPP multiplied with the electricity tariff (<inline-formula id="IEq46"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq46_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">el</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq46_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In each year, the financial model compares the net load with the minimum load set by the regulation for 25 years of the RSPP assumed life span. The net load is a year function due to the module’s degradation rate, while the minimum load is a constant. If the net load is higher than the minimum load, the bill equals the net load. Vice versa, when the net load is below the minimum load, the bill equals the net load, and the excess is deposited in the grid. In practice, this excess can offset future imports when the RSPP generation is low. However, this model only uses one-year irradiance data and repeats them for the assumed life span of the RSPP. Hence, RSPP generation output is relatively constant, which RSPP with a relatively large capacity may result in unutilized deposited exports.

Darghouth et al. estimated that the CAPEX and OPEX for SPP in Indonesia is 1365.76 US$ and 24.38 US$/kW per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The annual revenues and the CAPEX of the RSPP are then used to calculate the system’s Net Present Value (NPV). Based on a market study in 2017, a typical proportion of RSPP CAPEX in Indonesia is consisting of 47% PV modules cost, 13% inverter cost and 40% other complementary components as well as installation cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.The cost for PV modules and inverter in this paper are taken from a renewable energy technology distributor website since the estimate from Dargouth et al. lacks technical specification details needed for the simulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Just as other renewable energy technologies, RSPP is capital intensive. Therefore, the PV module with the lowest price/kW is employed to keep the CAPEX down and this study employs Suntech STP375S 375 W. Each module was modeled in the simulation at various RSPP capacities with the maximum electricity capacity as the upper limit or at 5.5 kWp. This study also employs 9 inverter types from Growatt of different sizes by matching the power output requirement of each simulation.The CAPEX includes PV modules (<inline-formula id="IEq48"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq48_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">PV</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq48_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

For social sector consumers with 5500 VA electricity capacity, the tariff has been 6.27 US¢/kWh for the last eight years. This tariff is subsidized as it only accounts for 65% of the BPP on average. The statistics report of PLN presents The BPP values from 2011–202,048,49, while the PLN’s Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) presents the projection of BPP values from 2021 to 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The BPP values beyond 2030 are estimated using a second-order polynomial regression function generated from the known values of BPP from 2015–2030. The BPP drop in 2015 was due to the increase in power system efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The BPP spike in 2025 is due to the significant increase in renewable energy adoption to achieve the Paris Agreement in that particular year. It is estimated that the BPP will rise at a slower rate due to the coal PP phase-out starting in 2030 and the decreasing cost of renewable energy technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

This impact is more significant at a lower net load level, such as an RSPP with 11 PV modules under the NMS scenario can reduce the load as much as an RSPP with 14 modules under the BAU scenario. However, with the minimum load limit still in place, this scenario causes RSPP to exceed the limit at a lower RSPP capacity than in the BAU scenario. Thus, the additional load reduction is not applicable for RSPP when the load limit is exceeded, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>. This scenario also results in higher annual revenue and NPV. RSPP with the highest NPV is the same as the BAU case with a slight increase of NPV, which is at −313 US$.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Figure 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Net load of RSPP with different number of PV modules in BAU and NMS scenario.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8968_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig><fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>NPV and annual revenue of RSPP with different number of PV modules in BAU and NMS scenario.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8968_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>NST scenario</title><p id="Par41">In this analysis, the electricity tariff is non-subsidized and taken from the BPP. This scenario only affects the revenue of different RSPP capacities, while the net load remains the same as BAU. In this scenario the revenue and NPV is increased, as presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>. Due to the higher electricity tariff, the utilization of RSPP results in higher bill saving. RSPP capacities lower than or equal to 3.375 kWp also achieve positive NPVs. RSPP with a capacity of 1.875 kWp yield the highest NPV of 144.44 US$.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>NPV and annual revenue of RSPP with different number of PV modules in BAU and NST scenario.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8968_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par42">At some RSPP capacities, this scenario may also reduce the annual electricity bill, lower than the subsidized tariff scheme. Over the RSPP operational life span, the subsidized electricity tariff ranges between 6.27 and 7.87 US¢/kWh. Without any RSPP utilization, annual electricity bill of the mosque during this period ranges between 386.55 and 485.11 US$. Meanwhile the unsubsidized tariff ranges between 9.64 and 12.10 US¢/kWh. Hence, the annual electricity bill for different RSPP capacities under the NST scenario can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>. Despite the increased electricity tariff, the annual electricity bill of mosque with 3 kWp and 3.375 kWp RSPP are 355.86 and 319.52 US$, lower than those of in the subsidized tariff scheme. Higher capacities RSPP also result in lower annual bill but these systems have negative NPVs.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>annual electricity bill for NST scenario and subsidized tariff scheme with no RSPP.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8968_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO15"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">It is important to note that the NPV of the RSPPs in this scenario can not be directly compared with the NPV of RSPPs in BAU scenario presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. Zero NPV may denote that the RSPP is able to return the investment. It also implies that investing in such RSPP would result in the same cost as meeting the load fully by importing electricity from the grid. Therefore, due to the tariff difference, the mosque will spend more money in NST scenario than in BAU in meeting the load. When incorporated, the present value of additional bill for 25 years of usage due to the increased electricity tariff is 2,834.23 US$. Thus, when compared to the current subsidized tariff condition, overall cost on meeting the load is higher in NST scenario. presents that RSPP can help reduce this cost slightly, as can be seen from the slight NPV increase for system with capacity lower and equal to 3.375 kWp. The highest NPV for the NST scenario in this analysis is −2,689.8 US$, which is reached with a 1.875 kWp RSPP as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Figure 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>NPV of NST scenario compared to BAU scenario.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8968_Fig16_HTML.png" id="MO16"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p id="Par44">In this paper, we have assessed the design of RSPP on a mosque and its economic implications. Despite the carbon reduction benefit, at the current electricity tariff and capital costs of the components, and the implemented regulations around the adoption of RSPP, it is financially unfeasible to install a rooftop PV system on a mosque indicated by the negative NPV. The highest NPV of −382 US$ is achieved with a 0.75 kWp RSPP. The subsidized tariff of electricity caused lower annual revenue for RSPP to recover its CAPEX. The partial export compensation forces users to increase the RSPP capacity to get the same energy from an RSPP in a full export scenario. However, the minimum load limit regulation prevents users from installing high-capacity RSPP due to the capped revenue and the increasing OPEX that is a function of RSPP capacity. The results of this study reflect well with the study by Darghouth et al. that the low electricity tariff and minimum load limit hampers the financial attractiveness of RSPP in Indonesia. This study also broadens scope of the previous study by including analysis on customers in social sectors as well as different scenarios. The Indonesia’s less supportive regulatory structure on RSPP may result in the differing conclusions to existing studies on SPP integration on mosques in other countries where positive results were documented.</p><p id="Par45">The result of this paper should serve policymakers as a reflection of the prevailing regulation on the adoption of PV in the power sector. This paper provides an insight that the plan to increase the share of renewable sources to 23% in the power generation by 2025 can be hampered by the prevailing regulation. Several policy adjustments were proposed and modeled to explore their implications on the financial attractiveness of RSPP:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par46">Carbon pricing, export compensation rework and non-subsidized tariffs increase revenue and NPV as a function of the RSPP capacity until the minimum load limit is reached. The adjustment on minimum load limit should be prioritized to maximize the implementation of other supporting regulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">The result shows that in the scope of the project, the enactment of non-subsidized tariff can increase the financial feasibility of RSPP indicated by the positive NPV and low annual electricity bill. However, the significant increase of electricity tariff shifts the present value down. Since the main hurdle of RSPP is the CAPEX, it is suggested to relocate the subsidy from electricity tariff to fund the deployment of RSPP. For the case study analyzed, the discounted amount of subsidy given by the government for 25 years of usage is around 2,834.23 US$. The same amount of money can fund a 2.8 kWp RSPP. According to the analysis, RSPP with this capacity can reduce the annual bill of the studied mosque to a level that is equal to or lower than the annual bill in the subsidized tariff scheme. In addition to that, RSPP also provide an opportunity for carbon emission reduction. Overall, such approach can increase the effectiveness of government’s fund spending in supporting the electrification program while pursuing the target of renewable energy integration.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par48">The need for further exploration is also supported by the large diversity of worship facilities in different areas in Indonesia that are not yet electrified. Expanding the study scope utilization of the mosques as a community center and distributed generation for renewable energy is also of further interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Desti Alkano and Grace Peranginangin from Energy Academy Indonesia for their feedback.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>F.A.Q. and S. wrote the main manuscript text, S. prepared Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and F.A.Q. prepared Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>–<xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>.
