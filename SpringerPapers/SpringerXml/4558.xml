To date, the technology has only been purposefully tested in small-scale demonstration projects. This study aims to develop a concrete way to carry out WHS at large-scale.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We describe a method of constructing a wood storage facility, named Wood Vault, that can bury woody biomass on a mega-tonne scale in specially engineered enclosures to ensure anaerobic environments, thus preventing wood decay. The buried wood enters a quasi-geological reservoir that is expected to stay intact semi-permanently. Storing wood in many environments is possible, leading to seven versions of Wood Vault: (1) Burial Mound (Tumulus or Barrow), (2) Underground (Pit, Quarry, or Mine), (3) Super Vault, (4) Shelter, (5) AquaOpen or AquaVault with wood submerged under water, (6) DesertOpen or DesertVault in dry regions, (7) FreezeVault in cold regions such as Antarctica. Smaller sizes are also possible, named Baby Vault. A prototype Wood Vault Unit (WVU) occupies 1 hectare (ha, 100 m by 100 m) of surface land, 20 m tall, stores up to 100,000 m<sup>3</sup> of wood, sequestering 0.1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>. A 1 MtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> sequestration rate can be achieved by collecting currently unused wood residuals (WR) on an area of 25,000 km<sup>2</sup>, the size of 10 typical counties in the eastern US, corresponding to an average transportation distance of less than 100 km. After 30 years of operation, such a Wood Vault facility would have sequestered 30 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, stored in 300 WVUs, occupying a land surface of 300 ha. The cost is estimated at $10–50/tCO<sub>2</sub> with a mid-point price of $30/tCO<sub>2</sub>. To sequester 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup>, wood can be sourced from currently unexploited wood residuals on an area of 9 Mkm<sup>2</sup> forested land (9 million square kilometers, size of the US), corresponding to a low areal harvesting intensity of 1.1 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>. Alternatively, giga-tonne scale carbon removal can be achieved by harvesting wood at a medium harvesting intensity of 4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup> on 3 Mkm<sup>2</sup> of forest (equivalent to increasing current world wood harvest rate by 25%), or harvest on 0.8 Mkm<sup>2</sup> forest restored from past Amazon deforestation at high harvest intensity, or many combinations of these and other possibilities. It takes 1000 facilities as discussed above to store 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup>, compared to more than 6000 landfills currently in operation in the US. After full closure of a Wood Vault, the land can be utilized for recreation, agriculture, solar farm, or agrivoltaics. A more distributed small operator model (Baby Vault) has somewhat different operation and economic constraints. A 10 giga-tonne sequestration rate siphons off only 5% of total terrestrial net primary production, thus possible with WHS, but extreme caution needs to be taken to ensure sustainable wood sourcing.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our technical and economic analysis shows that Wood Vault can be a powerful tool to sequester carbon reliably, using a variety of wood sources. Most pieces of the technology already exist, but they need to be put together efficiently in practice. Some uncertainties need to be addressed, including how durability of buried wood depends on detailed storage methods and burial environment, but the science and technology are known well enough to believe the practicality of the method. The high durability, verifiability and low-cost makes it already an attractive option in the current global carbon market. Woody biomass stored in Wood Vaults is not only a carbon sink to combat current climate crisis, but also a valuable resource for the future that can be used as biomass/bioenergy and carbon supply. The quantity of this wood utilization can be controlled carefully to maintain a desired amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to keep the Earth’s climate from diving into the next ice age, acting as a climate thermostat. The CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown time is on the order of 100 years while the ramp-up time is a decade. A sense of urgency is warranted because the CO<sub>2</sub> removal rate is limited by biosphere productivity, thus delayed action means a loss of opportunity. In conclusion, WHS provides a tool for managing our Earth system, which will likely remain forever in the Anthropocene.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Climate Program Office</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi"

They are ‘low-hanging fruits’, limited by the availability of ‘waste’ wood. They are often one-time opportunities such as the utilization of urban ‘waste wood’. This method may have a potential of up to 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> per year globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Opportunistic sources are not reliable individually. However, over a large enough area, there will be a near steady supply for a large facility, with the amount fundamentally controlled by forest productivity in the region, except for regions with large wood imports/exports. Opportunistic sources include urban wood residuals (WR, wood trimmings from backyard tree removal, construction and demolition debris, old furniture and wood pallets etc.), land clearing for development and agriculture, logging residue, thinning for precommercial treatment, thinning for fuel treatment to reduce fire risk, and wood processing residue. In the US, it is estimated that a total of 328 Mt (mega-tonnes) of wet biomass is unexploited annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], corresponding to a 1.1 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup> availability if distributed over 3 Mkm<sup>2</sup> (3 million square kilometers, US forested area) (see details in <xref rid="Sec32" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>). Throughout this paper, we approximate 1 tonne of wet/green biomass as 1 tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> For estimating waste wood collection area for a large storage facility below, we will use a benchmark value of 0.4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>, which we consider immediately available at no or low cost to the facility as it is simply to make a ‘waste’ valuable.</p><p id="Par16">For Type-B sourcing, wood is harvested from forests managed for carbon sequestration (fully or partially). Here we consider two benchmark values: a medium harvesting intensity of 4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>, and a high harvesting intensity of 12 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>, based on the top-down estimates of Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] using forest coarse wood productivity. If conducted at the medium harvesting intensity over an area of 3 Mkm<sup>2</sup> (current US forested area), it will lead to 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> sequestration (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), compared to 0.5–3 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> needed to offset hard-to-cut fossil fuel emissions in a renewable energy dominated future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the high intensity of 12 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> y<sup>−1</sup> over an area of 8 Mkm<sup>2</sup> (about the size of the US, or 20% of the world’s total forested area), we can sequester 10 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup>, the total sequestration needed from NETs (assumed to be all BECCS in the IPCC 1.5 °C scenario) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The 10 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> rate corresponds to the high end of the potential of 3–10 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> estimated using a top-down approach with world total forest productivity constrained by land use, topography, conservation and existing wood use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Fire suppression, such as in the America West over the last century, has left a large amount of dead vegetation on the forest floor. Combined with drought and insect infestation, this has led to more frequent and larger fires in recent years. Additionally, the release of this carbon pool through catastrophic fires may become an important source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in the future. Collecting dead trees or thinning and burying them would reduce fire danger while creating an effective carbon sink (relative to letting it burn or rot).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Project RECOVER: utilize naturally damaged woody biomass caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, fire, aging/death, and disease. Recovering trees from storm blowdown and other natural or unnatural disasters and storing the carbon will prevent the release of this carbon into the atmosphere. It’s a loss of opportunity if we don’t do it.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Project RESIDUE: utilize forestry residue from timber harvests and other operations. Residues from forestry operations include slash and woodchips. In many places, they are not utilized due to economic and other constraints. To the degree that nutrient and other ecosystem functions are sufficiently maintained, a portion can be buried for carbon sequestration. Furthermore, careful management enabled by the carbon value has the potential to support better ecosystem functioning.

This fundamentally changes the equation of the climate benefit of reforestation, acting as a strong incentive for supporting reforestation/afforestation as soon as possible. Because these restored forests are, by definition, managed, so there is no issue with conservation. Of course, sustainability should be included as part of the WHS project methodology requirement for carbon credits. For example, tropical deforestation leaves land in poor quality after some years of grazing and agriculture. As an idealized scenario, a sequestration rate of 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> can be achieved if the 0.8 Mkm<sup>2</sup> restored Amazon rainforest (area deforested since 1970) is fully utilized with WHS at high harvest intensity (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), though in practice we recommend mixed use.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Project NATURE-2: utilize wood from forests recovered from natural disturbance/death (secondary regrowth forest).

What size of a large burial facility will be needed to accommodate this amount of wood? 100,000 tonnes of green biomass is about 100,000 cubic meters in volume. This volume of wood can be stored in a space of dimension 1 ha (100 m by 100 m; size of two soccer/football fields) with a trench 5 m deep, and a mound 20 m above ground. The air space of the structure is about 150,000 m<sup>3</sup>, after accounting for the tapered geometry of the mound. We assumed 1/3 of the volume is filling space occupied by clay sealant, water and soil backfill. The aspect ratio (height:length) of 20:100 gives a moderate slope. It can in principle be made even taller which would provide a nice vista point on flat land and recreational space if used as a park after sealing. It can also be made deeper at some additional excavation cost. Both can reduce the requirement of surface land area. Such a Wood Vault is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.

Within each unit, multiple cells can be partially sealed with excavated soil more frequently, say each month, to further minimize decomposition before a complete seal off. Multiple Wood Vault units can be added over time and are independent of each other. At higher wood availability such as the rural harvesting case, the process can be done at higher frequency.

To minimize degradation before the closure of the cell, wood material is trucked over and laid down in the cell before moving on to the next cell. After it is fully filled, the cell is covered with a layer of soil and closed. Soil is compacted and allowed to settle to fill the gaps. The cell size is such that it can be filled, ideally in less than a few months of the first dump, and the shorter the better. The optimal cell size can be determined by balancing wood sourcing rate and engineering cost (larger cell will be more space efficient and cheaper per unit mass of wood stored).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">It is useful to take into account the seasonal variations (cold vs. warm, or wet vs. dry) in carrying out different steps of operation. For instance, cutting wood at the end of the growing season after leaf fall will minimize nutrient lockdown as trees send their nutrients down to the rooting zone before shedding leaves. Logging/collection operations are best carried out in cold/dry season with frozen ground to minimize soil damage and compaction as well as to allow better machine maneuverability.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Wood material can be minimally pre-treated to extend the storage lifetime. For example, the treatment material can be contained inside a pond on site. Wood can be dipped into the pond, packed into easy-to-handle units after or before treatment. Another technique is to spray over the wood as the pile runs through a carwash like tunnel, especially on the cut surfaces. A cheaper option is to spray only the cut-ends of whole logs. Charring of the surface of the cut ends is yet another technique. The recommendation of minimal or no treatment is an economic consideration, not that treatment is not good for preservation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">Use the excavated local soil to cover the buried wood if it has low permeability such as clay.

From an engineering point of view, the design lifetime is a key criterion, but because Wood Vault as well as its climate goal are novel concepts and we don’t have enough engineering data to quantify it, this is an area that needs to be further explored and better defined, in particular, in light of long-term climate goal of WHS as a thermostat (below).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Seven versions of Wood Vault</title><p id="Par56">Other versions of Wood Vault construction are also proposed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par57">Wood Vault Version 1.2: Fully aboveground (Burial Mound: Barrow).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">Wood Vault Version 2: Fully underground (V2.1: Pit, V2.2: Quarry, V2.3: Mine).

In Archaeology, the term Tumulus, with its Latin origin, is commonly used to describe burial mounds in the Mediterranean region where they are typically built partially below ground, such as the Etruscan tombs in central Italy. In contrast, the term Barrow can be traced to a southern English dialect. The English tombs as well as northern European burial mounds tend to be built fully above ground. We hypothesize that this is due to the wet climate and high water table in these regions, while the drier Mediterranean climate allows underground burial. This distinction is more than just terminology. Indeed, it has important engineering implications for the construction of Wood Vault for wood preservation. A fluctuating water table leads to aeration and oxygenation, thus not conducive for maintaining anaerobic condition in a Wood Vault. Thus, in wet regions, the fully above ground version (Barrow) is better than Tumulus, though sufficient clay sealing can still make Tumulus version work. This is a critical factor in our design of several versions of Wood Vault.</p><p id="Par62">The construction of these other versions may differ somewhat from Version 1.1 (Tumulus). For instance, the underground version (Version 2) would work well on low-lying area with high water table, where the wood can be buried completely underground below the lowest level of fluctuating water table.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par63">Such places are typically low-lying land with little lateral transport, so sealing requirement may not need to be as stringent but care needs to be taken as we are talking about a very long time scale.

In this case, the upslope direction should be lined with clay or synthetic liner to minimize water flow in the burial chambers.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par65">Similar methods can be applied to bury wood in abandoned mines or quarries which involves little digging.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par66">Burying the wood completely below ground will require more excavation, thus somewhat higher costs. The excavated soil may be sold to compensate for the excavation cost, depending on the market. In the case of utilizing an exhausted mine or quarry, there is little cost of excavation, and additionally contains many environmental and social co-benefits.</p><p id="Par67">Compared to the underground versions, aboveground Wood Vaults would require more maintenance. For Vaults with an open woodpile, a key factor would be fire prevention. Traditional construction material such as adobe/cob (mud-straw brick wall) is an excellent choice because it is locally sourced and low-cost. An adobe enclosure of woody biomass can last for decades or longer without major maintenance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Synthetic material can also be used. In wetter climate, a roof will be needed for rain sheltering. Another concern is animal burrowing or wind erosion, both can be repaired in time with low-cost.</p><p id="Par68">It is also possible to store wood in perpetually wet (submerged under water) or dry (desert) conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>), which leads to our Versions 5 and 6:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par69">Version 5.1: AquaOpen. Wood logs are barged over to water bodies with low-oxygen bottom water such as the Black Sea or the Great Lakes and dropped to the bottom. Ballasts (weights) may be needed to sink the logs, but eventually the logs will remain sunk after saturation with water. It is possible that some dried logs may be resin-sealed so that water cannot penetrate the wood so some research is needed here. A good technique is pre-soaking the logs. Not all water bodies are suitable because bottom organisms such as marine borers and bacteria can attack wood. These waters are not completely devoid of oxygen due to mixing, no matter how weak it is, but the biological activities may be slow enough such that sediments can cover the logs before significant wood decay occurs. Once trapped in the silty sediments, the wood should stay semi-permanently. Examples of wood preservation include the well-preserved Roman and Greek wooden ships at the bottom of the Black Sea, the Swedish Vasa warship at the bottom of Stockholm harbor, and the Neolithic village wooden artifacts at the bottom of Lago di Bracciano in Central Italy, as well as the newly discovered Endurance ship of Ernest Shackleton preserved in near-perfect condition 107 years after sank to the bottom of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par70">Version 5.2: AquaVault. Bundles of wood logs are wrapped inside a lining material, for example plastic or rubber, that is resistant to attack from bottom water dwelling organisms, then are sunk to the bottom. The wrap does not need to be completely waterproof. Similarly to a diving wetsuit, as long as the wrap maintains integrity, the water inside the wrap and between the wood logs will be stagnant enough to maintain low enough oxygen concentrations to prevent bacteria and the wrap itself will deter marine borers. Burying logs in bogs and wetland can also be classified in this category, though it can equally fit in underground burial category.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par71">Version 6.1: DesertOpen. Piles of wood logs are left open in the desert. Dry air and wind minimize decay. Fire is a potential hazard. Having relatively small wood piles separated from each other can minimize loss in the event of fire. Piling the logs in a way such that it is naturally ventilated can significantly extend the life of preservation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par72">Version 6.2: DesertVault. Wood piles are protected with synthetic material, or the traditional methods of straw-mud walls or mudbrick (adobe), sheltered from occasional rain on top. Mud can usually be locally sourced. It is highly effective at fire prevention as well as acting as an insect/animal barrier. Slow wind erosion on the order of decades to centuries can be reinforced with some maintenance. In desert regions, wood sourcing is more of a limitation as forests are mostly in the mountains with modest productivity and many other desired uses. Thinning for fire risk reduction may be a major opportunistic source. Transportation cost is another limiting factor, but there should still be good opportunities for relatively in-situ storage. DesertVault bears similarity with Version 4 (Shelter/Warehouse), but it can be much simpler because the dry desert climate poses significantly lower risk to wood preservation. There are two options of airtight sealing vs non-airtight, whose pros and cons need to be further evaluated though our current inclination is for airtight because we think climate goal needs a guaranteed lifetime much longer than 100 years, which is a commonly stated goal in the current Carbon Dioxide Removal and Carbon Sequestration communities (See below discussion on WHS as climate thermostat). Same consideration applies to Shelter (above) and Baby Vault (below).</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>More Wood Vault versions.

For safety, we should also take into account possible future warming. The wood piles are open in a natural freezer-like environment, which we still call conceptually a Vault because even though  there is no physical protection to construct, it is a natural place we move the wood to. The transportation, placement etc. still consist of engineering effort. Transportation cost dictates that it needs to be in the coastal region, perhaps 1–2 m above sea-level in case of future sea-level rise, though moving the piles upland by 1–2 m are totally feasible should it become necessary in the future. The wood piles should not be placed on fast moving glaciers.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Wood Vault Version 7: FreezeVault.

However, wood logs can be rafted down water ways, and barges or bulkers can be used for long-distance transportation of bundled wood piles. The cost should be quite manageable given the state of modern shipping technology.</p><p id="Par75">Even though we have focused on local wood sourcing here, we do not exclude possibilities of transporting wood long-distance via waterway or railway that may be sufficiently economical and carbon efficient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Land use after enclosure and ensuring the longevity of Wood Vault</title><p id="Par76">Another attractive aspect of Wood Vault is the value for later land use. Unlike a landfill for municipal waste disposal, where leachate, odor and methane gas from chemical and biological activities are of major environmental concern, a Wood Vault is clean, stable and safe.</p><p id="Par77">After the topsoil from excavation is backfilled after enclosure, grass and certain types of trees can be allowed to regrow. It can be used as pastureland or other agricultural use, or recreational use such as parks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Yet another attractive possibility is to use it to install solar panels to generate electricity, or agrivoltaics (combination of above). We expect good safety after post-burial soil settlement for low-weight buildings such as warehouses and animal barns, but as a precaution, it may not be ideal for constructing houses and some other building types. This is a precaution for the rare case where the burial was not done properly or unforeseen geological activities occur because a well-constructed Wood Vault should be as solid as normal ground after a period of soil settlement.</p><p id="Par78">Another key step is ensuring the legal permanence of the Wood Vault. Some legal framework must be set up to ensure that the buried wood isn’t disturbed on a century timescale or longer, even if the surface is utilized for other purposes or even sold to a new owner. There are several potential methods to ensure this. The first is to set up a legal entity to take control of the land containing the Wood Vault and be in charge of its maintenance and upkeep, possibly making use of the surface but with a primary objective of ensuring sequestered wood permanence. While this may seem simple, it can add other costs and ensuring the century long survival of such an entity is a significant challenge.</p><p id="Par79">Another option is to set up a conservation easement on the land. A conservation easement restricts what land can and can’t be used for, with common limits being natural land, agriculture, or sustainable forestry, none of which should interfere with the permanence of sequestered wood. Easements are usually set up on a case-by-case basis, so the preservation of wood could be made an explicit tenet of the easement. Thus, even if the property is eventually sold, the permanence of sequestered wood is legally guaranteed. This approach is much more likely to survive the century scale required for sequestration projects. The easement also has the effect of lowering land values and property tax burdens, reducing expenses if the sequestration entity decides to actively run or manage the Wood Vault after the final burial and capping of sequestered wood. Additionally, buying insurance for possible loss of the stored wood due to unforeseen circumstances would also be useful, but this is an after-fact measure, not a design objective.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The economics of Wood Vault</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Wood Vault with wood residuals as source</title><p id="Par80">The cost of a Wood Vault facility includes land purchase, construction, and operation.

The cost estimate can serve as a basis for other types of storage and wood collection methods.

Assuming a stumpage price of $5/tonne, harvest and transportation of $15/ton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], this adds $20 to the basic scenario above ($13–22/tonne) whose high range includes transportation.

These numbers are only approximate, and a design can be wider and lower where land availability is not a tight constraint.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par91">For an application example, a target of 1 MtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> sequestration rate needs to construct 10 WVUs per year (1,000,000/100,000 = 10), thus requires 10 ha of land surface. Up to 2–3 times more storage capacity is possible if the units are stacked vertically (Super Vault). Because a 1 MtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> rate can be satisfied with a wood sourcing scenario of medium harvest intensity from 2 counties in the eastern US (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which we assume to be a likely scenario in the next few decades, a 300 ha facility will store 30 MtCO<sub>2</sub> in 300 WVUs, after 30 years of operation with wood sustainably sourced from the surrounding 2 counties (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>).

Should the local government be the sole operator of all the Wood Vaults, simply co-siting with current landfills and sharing existing machinery and workforce will be enough to utilize its sustainable wood source, with the great benefit of minimum additional infrastructure, and high cost-efficiency. Should private entities such as individual farmers, forest owners, or corporations develop and operate the facility, the overall cost may be higher, but it should still be viable even with the current carbon market price.</p><p id="Par93">For a target of 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> sequestration, we need 1000 such Wood Vault facilities, compared to more than 6000 operational landfills in the US.

In particular, we assumed the availability of machinery needed for logging, transportation, excavation, and burial on a large facility, supported by a corporate-style business operation. However, in many developing countries such as in Africa, the southern Amazon, or Southeast Asia where there are great opportunities for wood sourcing, including areas with potential for reforestation, this is simply not possible, at least not in the near term.</p><p id="Par95">We propose a ‘small operator model’, as envisioned originally by Zeng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this operation mode, wood is sourced and stored in-situ. The relatively small wood collection area means that the stream of wood availability is also small. With manual and animal power, wood transportation quickly becomes prohibitive at longer distance. This offers the opportunity for innovative technologies such as solar-powered all-terrain robots that can haul logs, replacing traditional labor done by horses and mules. Rechargeable small chainsaw is already widely available (NZ has one at home). Similarly, small and low-cost rechargeable excavator/backhoe can also play an important role. In general, a potential WHS carbon sequestration market can provide the impetus to bring down the cost of existing technology or stimulate new technology in forestry operation from cutting, delimbing, forwarding, as well as various aspects of Wood Vault construction.</p><p id="Par96">Because wood stockpile permits only temporary storage before significant degradation occurs and now with wood collection from immediate vicinity, wood is best buried/stored in a relatively small Wood Vault, which we will call ‘Baby Vault’. Baby Vault is not necessarily a new type of Wood Vault, but just a smaller version of, for example, Tumulus (Version 1.1), Barrow (Version 1.2) or Shelter (Version 4). The Shelter-style Wood Vault (Version 4 or Version 6.2 DesertVault) seems ideal as Baby Vault for developing countries, run by individual farmers, co-operatives or other small operators (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). It does not require digging which is labor intensive without machine. Piling the logs above ground is much more practical, though the height may be limited, thus using somewhat more land-surface area compared to a large burial mound.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Baby Vault is a small shelter that can be built manually or with light machinery, using wood sourced from the immediate vicinity.

A straw-mud walled structure can be built, wood can be placed in it over a suitable period of time, then finally enclosed on the open side and on top which is sheltered with a thatched roof in wet climate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). The walls need to be sufficiently thick to be both structurally sound and prevent erosion and animal intrusion. Vines may grow which can be cut back or left alone, though trees should not be allowed on top. Long-term maintenance is needed but is expected to be minimal if the Baby Vault is constructed properly. We also note that, Baby Vault is not limited to developing countries, and indeed we see great potential in developed countries as well where an individual land owner can carry it out independently.</p><p id="Par98">In-situ storage on the forest floor, near the logging landing site, or on the roadside where wood is harvested has the advantage of minimizing transportation cost and other benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, Zeng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] estimated a cost of $14/tCO<sub>2</sub> for such in-situ operation. A disadvantage is the cost of moving machinery to the site and other overhead costs of each operation. It may be most efficiently carried out by an operator who continually goes around a certain large area consisting of many smaller sites with multiple ownerships, moving from one plot to the next on the time scales of days to weeks to minimize cost of transporting machine. The crew can return to the same site after some years for another harvest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). Materials and machinery can be planned out and used most efficiently this way. In practice, there is likely going to be a continuous spectrum of possibilities between small-scale in-situ burial and large-scale facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Process flow diagram: a Nature-Engineering combo method</title><p id="Par99">To close the loop of a full-scale operation from wood sourcing to burial, we show the process flow diagram (PFD) of WHS with a central storage facility Wood Vault (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). The system boundary depends on whether the wood sourcing is ‘waste’ reception (Type-A) or harvested/transported (Type-B). It is also possible to have an operation somewhere in between Type-A and Type-B, for example, harvesting is already done, but the Wood Vault operator needs to collect wood from a remote site. Also, a wood stockpile for short-term temporary storage is often needed to strike the balance of efficiency/cost and minimizing decay before burial.

Of course, this advantage is shared by all nature-based methods, thus their popularity. However, the main shortcoming of most nature-based methods is that the permanence of such carbon sinks is generally too short compared to the climate change time scale of hundreds of years. This shortcoming is overcome in WHS by burying wood underground or other means to ensure semi-permanent preservation. This requires dedicated facility carefully engineered to prevent decomposition and an operational process flow that is practical, efficient, and low cost. In summary, WHS is a unique hybrid Nature-Engineering method that combines the advantages of Nature and human intervention, each of which is inadequate for solving the climate problem if acting alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>How to do it right: Hit the road with model projects</title><p id="Par101">The best method to ensure the durability and semi-permanence of stored wood is to make sure the project is done right at the early stages of Wood Vault construction. If a Wood Vault is found faulty later, reinforcement is possible if the cost is low enough. This ‘reinforcibility’ should be an important criterion in determining the Wood Vault type of choice. For instance, a Wood Vault constructed in an adobe mud enclosure can be easily repaired should it crack. On the other hand, wood logs sunken to remote ocean depths are left completely to forces of nature as it would be too expensive to intervene at scale. Thus, knowing the processes that determine the timescale of a particular Wood Vault construction with our best knowledge, we can make the decision based on our climate goal (which is not necessarily clearly known on long timescales; see Sect. 5) will be critically important before we implement a specific type of Wood Vault at large scales. In this respect, the terrestrial based methods generally appear to be safer in the sense that they give us the opportunity to reinforce and modify in the future. To put it another way, higher standards will be needed for Wood Vaults that cannot be maintained and reinforced cost-efficiently.</p><p id="Par102">We therefore wish to see the community to start as soon as possible a suite of ‘model projects’ that encompass the proposed Wood Vault types in representative environments, plus any other possible types we have not discussed here. In planning and conducting these model projects, we will gather interdisciplinary teams of experts and practitioners to figure out the best practical way of Vault construction that ensures durability for the specific environment at low-cost. These projects can serve as the ‘blueprints’ for world-wide implementation of WHS. Our current knowledge can already inform reasonable decision because there is no truly unknown science or technology in the WHS method, although the interdisciplinary knowledge base needs to be put together to tackle this problem effectively. Iterations will be needed to refine these blueprints.

We propose the following steps:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par104">Use low-cost sensors to monitor the environment inside the burial chamber, including CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, pH, temperature, humidity, and water table. For anaerobic type of Wood Vaults, after Vault enclosure, we expect the initial oxygen level to drop to zero on the timescale of weeks to months, and CO<sub>2</sub> to rise to a high level as a small amount of organic matter is consumed by fungi/bacteria/insects that are ubiquitously attached to or embedded in the original woody biomass (Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>). For a well-constructed Wood Vault, we don’t expect CH<sub>4</sub> release (see discussion in Sect. 5) so it should remain zero. Such low-cost sensor capability has been developed in recent years, including at our lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par105">These sensors can be built using an Internet of Things (IoT) approach that transmits data to a remote server.

The information on the status of the burial chamber also provides data input to the carbon accounting system useful for calculating carbon credit discount (below).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par106">A powerful analog method can be used to predict future preservation by conducting ‘controlled’ experiments, similar to the unintended ‘natural’ experiments from archaeological and geological evidence (Sect. 5 below) that provide real-world evidence of long-term wood preservation. For selected sample projects, periodically collect samples directly from the Vault, observe and analyze the status of wood preservation. The corner or cell of the Vault can be enclosed again, leading to a slight modification to future preservation. We can then build predictive mechanistic models that include process understanding, validated by these ‘controlled’ experimental data as well as the data from the ‘natural’ experiments. This is akin to how we build predictive climate models that are validated by paleo and modern climate data. By the simple logic of ‘analog’, similarly constructed Vaults in similar environment will have similar degree of preservation as in a ‘control’ experiment. In this respect, a failed Wood Vault provides equally valuable information on how Not to construct a Wood Vault that way. The ‘model projects’ proposed above can best serve this analog purpose.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The expected changes over time of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> after the enclosure of a Wood Vault designed to produce anaerobic condition.

In the case of residual wood utilization, the stored carbon should be relative to a baseline that corresponds to waste wood decomposition over shorter time spans than the semi-permanent storage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). When wood is sourced directly from live forests, the accounting is more complex. Initially there is a loss of carbon after harvest. It is only after forest regrowth that the combined regrowth and stored carbon exceeds the baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Ensuring the sustainability of wood sourcing, in light of many other current and possible uses of woody biomass, is a key to success for WHS.</p><p id="Par108">In a world where WHS is fully implemented, millions of Wood Vaults may be created.

Such information not only provides the foundation for carbon credit trading in carbon markets, but also the necessary information for monitoring and verification, ensuring sustainability, maintenance, insurance, unforeseen events, and potential future use.

However, there are fundamental differences between a Wood Vault and a landfill, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>, including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par110">The job of a landfill is to dispose of waste, including highly decomposable food scraps, reactive toxic chemicals, heavy metals that need to be carefully controlled and regulated. In contrast, a Wood Vault buries only clean natural vegetation which is valuable (for carbon sequestration now, with the option for biomass and bioenergy reserve in the future)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par111">The main objectives are the opposite of each other: a landfill is built to encourage fast decomposition and gas collection, while a Wood Vault is built to prevent decomposition altogether. This requires different design principles and different ways of material use.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par112">Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a potent greenhouse gas, is often generated in a landfill as methanogenic bacteria digest organic waste under partially anaerobic conditions. Such concern has been raised against the wood burial concept by citing what happens in a landfill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, this aspect of landfills does not apply to a Wood Vault. Furthermore, even in landfills, wood, unlike food, is often known to be well preserved, as shown by excavated wood samples from old landfills and modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], even inside lab bio-reactors designed to encourage optimal bacterial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thanks to such meticulous research, the IPCC has recently drastically lowered the emission factor of wood in landfills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A precondition for CH<sub>4</sub> generation in landfills is that there is sufficient concentration of nutrient such as food scrap to supply the substrate for anaerobic bacteria to thrive. This is not the case in a Wood Vault.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par113">Moreover, our standard Wood Vault design calls for total anaerobic condition in the sub-terranean burial chamber (with other designs having similar mechanisms to inhibit organism growth), reasoning that the lack of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) excludes activities of the main ‘wood-eating’ organisms such as fungi and insects. Then the main remaining risk to buried wood is anaerobic bacteria. Fortunately for our purpose, they are known to be unable to digest lignin, the glue-like layer that protects the cellulose structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as evidenced by the difficulty of making cellulosic ethanol for biofuel where the challenge is the opposite: to get rid of lignin protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This explains why wood decomposition is slow in landfills. In a carefully designed and maintained Wood Vault, we expect the decomposition to drop to essentially zero after a short initial period during which any oxygen mixed into the wood-soil matrix initially is quickly consumed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par114">Decomposition of organic waste as well as chemical reactions by aluminum and other reactive materials in a landfill can lead to a ‘hot’ interior that typically reaches 40–50 °C (X. Wang, personal communication). The interior of such a landfill is essentially a ‘slow cooker’ that accelerates biological degradation and chemical reaction. Even in such ‘worst’ condition, wood is still often found to be reasonably well preserved (above). In contrast, in a Wood Vault, only ‘clean’ vegetation is buried, and there is little nutrient and substrate for bacteria to establish colonies at first place. A Wood Vault provides a ‘cold’ and fully capped environment without oxygen. This realization should be sufficient to relieve the concern of ‘smoldering wood’ or ‘smoldering garbage’ sometimes seen in open dump or poorly covered landfills. The key is to ‘do it right’.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par115">Whole wood logs are expected to have much higher durability than smaller pieces such as woodchips, as evidenced by multi-year to multi-decadal time scales (depending on the climate condition) needed to degrade whole dead trees on a forest floor, while smaller pieces such as twigs degrade much faster. The reasons are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par116">In both anaerobic or aerobic conditions, the degradation starts from surface and spreads inward very slowly. For a tree log, the spreading of fungal hyphae and bacteria is generally fastest along the cambium layer and inner bark where phloem contains highest concentration of nutrients. Secondly, they can spread along the vessels in the longitudinal direction or rays in the transverse direction from the cut ends or wounds. Certain tree species have high concentration of sap that prevents vessel penetration, thus minimizing this pathway of degradation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par117">In anaerobic condition, because the lignin layer covers the cellulose structure which is what anaerobic bacteria can attack, reduction in the wholeness of wood, leaves vulnerable entry points for bacteria to enter. Keeping the physical integrity thus enhances its durability.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Wood Vault is fundamentally different from landfill.

As for temperature, it is ‘cold’ (in comparison with an active landfill), same or slightly higher than ambient, and so is pressure. Should the wood preserve on geological timescales, it may be transformed (carbonized), but the carbon will still largely remain in place. Geological movement such as seismic activities could also potentially bring wood to surface or bring in oxygen. Such occurrence can be mitigated, but in practice, it is unlikely to be a major concern because of the rarity of such occurrence on the human-induced climate change timescale and the distributed nature of the WHS method.</p><p id="Par119">A less clear aspect is potential chemical transformation. For example, a highly alkaline or highly acidic environment is known to damage wood (and many other things!). However, most natural soil environments do not deviate significantly from pH neutral. It is also possible that organic compounds such as terpenes in sapwood can be more easily modified by chemical or biological processes, especially in wet burial environments for tree species with less resin where water can infiltrate into wood vessels and leach out organic compounds inside. However, modification doesn’t necessarily convert the organic matter into CO<sub>2</sub> which would subsequently escape back into the atmosphere. If conversion to CO<sub>2</sub> indeed happens, albeit likely slowly, this fraction of carbon would be lost, but the main wood structural ligno-cellulose carbon should remain. In mineral-laden subterranean wet/aquatic environments, minerals would slowly infiltrate wood to seal off the vessels, likely leading to better preservation. While research will be needed to clarify these complexities, carbon accounting for credit can conservatively exclude carbon stored in such organic compounds which only accounts for a small fraction of wood carbon. Thus, the goal of preservation is not necessarily to keep the wood like fresh wood, but can permit transformation to a stable state that maintains wood integrity and keeps most of the carbon in place semi-permanently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Durability: lessons from archaeological and geological evidence</title><p id="Par120">In our view, the most compelling evidence of the potential for long-term whole wood preservation comes from ‘natural’ experiments where ancient wood of archeological or geological origin, was found in good condition after hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years.

This is consistent with the basic biology of decomposition because the main decomposers such as fungi and insects need all of the following environmental conditions to survive and thrive: (1) oxygen, (2) suitable temperature, (3) moisture. This piece of fundamental biology leads to 3 major pathways to prevent wood decomposition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref>): (1) Anaerobic, (2) Cold, (3) Dry.<fig id="Fig22"><label>Fig. 22</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Three major pathways to prevent wood decomposition: (1) Anaerobic condition that can be created by sealing with low permeability material such as clay or waterlogging; (2) Cold; (3) Dry.

In contrast, environments with free water movement such as at the bottom of the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Great Lakes is likely to have low enough oxygen levels to enables wood preservation to some degree, but may or may not be anaerobic enough to ensure the long-term preservation needed for climate purpose. The relatively anaerobic bottom water of the Black Sea is caused by vertical stratification, but free-flowing water will inevitably have some amount of mixing, no matter how small it is. An exception is where the sedimentation rate is high so the wood logs can be buried before decay, as illustrated in Wood Vault Version 5.1 (AquaOpen, Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Our AquaVault design calls for an artificial wrapping which may be able to circumvent the limitation of AquaOpen. Another caution is the lack of reinforcibility in the future discussed above. Thus, more caution is needed before large-scale implementation in aquatic environments. With our current understanding, terrestrial or wet + silty stagnant environments are more reliable at ensuring anaerobic condition.</p><p id="Par139">In summary, for a Wood Vault enclosed in low-permeability soil, the anaerobic, stagnant sub-terranean environment ensures the durability of buried wood by minimizing biological, physical and chemical activities, ultimately leading to a preservation state of quasi-geological nature. We emphasize the critical importance of air-tight sealing, which leads to ultimate anaerobic condition. The initial oxygen at fresh burial is not a problem, because it would take the decomposition of only a tiny amount of organic matter to consume it.</p><p id="Par140">Research with lab experiments and real-world projects will be needed to establish the best practice and define what is ‘sufficiently-good’ burial condition that balances cost and preservation under various soil and hydrological settings. In this vein, we emphasize the paramount importance of the practicality of any proposed solution, including low-cost, wide availability of the material such as clay/mud, ease of operation, suitability for local people and stakeholders, and environmental and social impact.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Implication for the future: a thermostat to manage the climate system?</title><p id="Par141">On longer time horizons, the stored wood is also a reserve of biomass, bioenergy and carbon, should future needs arise (Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>).

The high durability, verifiability and relatively low-cost makes it an attractive option in the current global carbon market.</p><p id="Par147">Because WHS relies on trees to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, but the rate of photosynthesis and land availability are limited, there is an opportunity loss if wood storage is not carried out as soon as the wood is available because it would otherwise decompose into CO<sub>2</sub>. On the ground, this loss of opportunity manifests itself as waste wood rots in a landfill, hurricane damaged trees are collected and burned in a Florida neighborhood, trees are burned in a California forest, and so on. This leads to a SENSE of URGENCY.

Not included are other possibilities such as damaged wood from storm-blowdown and insect outbreaks for which there are no comprehensive estimates.</p><p id="Par152">The total US unexploited wood in green megatonnes is: 56 (urban) + 35 (other removal) + 128 (thinning) + 93 (logging) + 16 (mill) = 328 Mt y<sup>−1</sup>. If we distribute this over the US forested area of approximately 3 Mkm<sup>2</sup>, the wood availability is: 0.2 (urban) + 0.12 (other removal) + 0.43 (thinning) + 0.3 (logging) + 0.05 (mill) = 1.1 t ha<sup>−1</sup>. This leads to potential availability per unit area of 328/300 = 1.1 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p id="Par153">The unexploited urban and other removal are immediately available, which add to 0.32 t ha<sup>−1</sup>. Because carbon value will likely divert some more wood from some other current uses such as making mulch which currently utilizes most urban tree removal (tree yard trimmings: 16 of 20 Mt), we assume a 0.4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> to be practically available immediately.</p><p id="Par154">It is interesting to compare these bottom-up estimates with the top-down estimates based on forest productivity of Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the high 11 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> (3 GtC y<sup>−1</sup>) global top-down scenario, Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found that the US can contribute 500 MtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> (0.14 GtC y<sup>−1</sup>) for the US, slightly higher than the inventory-based estimate above. Distributed over 3 Mkm<sup>2</sup> of forest land, this leads to an areal harvesting intensity of 1.7 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup>. In their low 3.7 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> (1 GtC y<sup>−1</sup>) global scenario, the US can contribute<sup>−1</sup>170 MtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup>at a harvesting intensity of 0.6 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> over its 3 Mkm<sup>2</sup> forested land.</p><p id="Par155">Globally, for their lower 3.7 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup>scenario, Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] stated that 4.4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> (1.2 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>) on 8 Mkm<sup>2</sup> leads to 1 GtC y<sup>−1</sup>. The feasibility of such wood collection rate can be viewed from forest productivity. The 4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> rate is about 10% of the NPP of a typical temperate forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Collecting wood at the 4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> on an area of 9 million km<sup>2</sup> (about the area of the US) would sequester 3.7 GtCO<sub>2</sub> y<sup>−1</sup> (1 GtC y<sup>−1</sup>, 1 wedge of of Pacala and Socolow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], or 10% of global total fossil fuel emissions in 2020). The urban wood residual availability of 0.4 tCO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> is only 1% of the NPP of a typical temperate forest. The sustainability of these relatively low intensity harvest is thus likely to be highly feasible, though caution is still needed in overall resource planning, especially from government and regulatory agency perspective.</p></sec></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par15">A tonne of wet biomass, also known as a green tonne, contains about 0.5 dry tonne biomass. Dry biomass contains about 50% carbon (C), with the rest mostly oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H). Thus, material in 1 green tonne contains about 25% carbon which is oxidized to about 1 tCO<sub>2</sub> (tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>). 1 tC = 3.67 tCO<sub>2</sub> (approximately 4 tCO<sub>2</sub>) as the molecular weight ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>:C = 44:12. We also approximate 1 short ton in US literature with 1 metric tonne for estimates in this paper. In summary, 1 wet/green tonne of wood has approximately a volume of 1 cubic meter while sequestering 1 tCO<sub>2</sub>. Such approximation lends simplicity in our high-level assessment and is within the uncertainty range of natural variations in tree species, wood moisture content, and other factors.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="Misc"><title>Publisher's Note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></notes></back></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Ecosystems</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environment</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environmental Management</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Forestry</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">Carbon Balance and Management</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2022</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"><facet-value count="1">United States</facet-value></facet><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
