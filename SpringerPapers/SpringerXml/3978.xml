Synthesis of C-QDs is roughly classified into “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the top-down approach, C-QDs are synthesized by breaking the large carbon materials into smaller ones by employing the arc discharge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, laser ablation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and chemical oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Conversely, in the bottom-up approach, C-QDs are synthesized via molecular carbon precursors using methods such as; hydrothermal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, thermal-decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and microwave<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Majority of the synthesis processes are typically multistep, cumbersome, and require expensive carbon sources that might be toxic at times, followed by the further necessity of surface passivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">There are many green synthesis routes have been devised for the synthesis of C-QDs by employing inexpensive and natural materials as starting carbon sources, such as chitosan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, egg yolk oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, orange juice, lemon peel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, bee pollen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, humic substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, hair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, peanut shell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, soy milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, Cashew Gum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and Garlic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, most natural carbon sources used in these studies lack the homogeneity and essential purity to obtain the homogenous C-QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The major hindrance with most of the natural carbon sources to synthesize the C-QDs is that they undergo seasonal fluctuation based on geographical location of plant cultivation that could undoubtedly influence reproducibility, shape and size distribution of C-QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. During the synthesis, the presence of a trace amount of foreign impurities (minerals) can lead to the inhomogeneous nucleation and growth of C-QDs. The selection of natural carbon source should be economical, reproducible, and environmental friendly. Also, the photoluminescence properties of as-synthesized C-QDs must be immutable to the sampling and sessional fluctuation. Hydrothermal or solvothermal methods with synthetic molecular carbon precursors (non-natural sources) provide more optional parameters that can felicitate the synthesis of nearly-monodisperse C-QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. On the contrary, using much straightforward thermal-decomposition (pyrolysis) process the control over the size distribution of C-QDs is extremely difficult to achieve given the complex chemical composition of the natural carbon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The fluorescence emission of the C-QDs is quite complex and not yet fully understood. Traditionally, pH-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of C-QDs are analyzed at a fixed excitation and completely ignore many other possible excitations, however, using such approach only partial information is extracted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Analyzing the C-QDs at different pH for a wide range of excitation can, additionally, provide much valuable information than the conventional techniques. However, an increase in the number of PL measurements can also increase the complexity of data analysis techniques. Recently, machine learning techniques such as k-means, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares analysis (PLS), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), multivariate curve resolution (MCR-ALS) have accelerated the multivariate scientific data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Machine learning (ML) can classify even very similar PL spectra, and it is capable of handling large dataset (multiple-set PL measurements). Analyzing the hyper-spectral PL data-set of C-QDs with machine learning could potentially help to augment the origin of PL mechanism.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, for the first time, we present the synthesis of mono-dispersed C-QDs via single-step thermal decomposition process using the fennel seeds (<italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>).

(ii) Can ML assist in finding out the source of PL mechanism given that the multiple-set PL measurements at various pH and excitation wavelength can activate the different type of surface state?

Since, PCA analysis has successfully categories the integrated PL data into three groups, the excitation wavelength that shows the similar or dissimilar features can be chosen with objectivity. It is evident that the group marked with maroon-color ellipse has large variance, and it is the same excitation wavelength (260 nm) that should be chosen for PL studies to investigate the possible PL mechanism. Although, PCA has successfully categories the integrated PL data-set, nevertheless, it fails to provide any information on the typical asymmetric PL peak of as-synthesized C-QDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>MCR-ALS analysis</title><p id="Par29">The standard peak feature extraction procedure becomes inefficient to understand whether the PL spectrum of C-QDs is a single peak or convolution of multiple peaks. The MCR-ALS analysis helps to extracts the pure spectral profile of a PL spectrum from the integrated PL data-set of C-QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9C</xref> shows the MCR-ALS results, integrated PL data-set was resolved into two spectral peaks centered at 416.2 and 475.3 nm, respectively, indicating that the typical PL spectrum is a linear combination of two distinct peaks (feature vectors). Although MCR-ALS was able to resolve the PL spectra into two distinct peaks successfully, nevertheless, the newly resolved peaks overlap, considerably, on each other to such an extent that it is difficult to assign them to two different energy states. The PCA analysis of integrated PL data-set also results in two distinct feature vectors except that the second peak for loading vector is negative that makes the data interpretation more complicated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>). There are two fundamental issues using MCR-ALS analysis; the first issue is more critical to our PL data-set, i.e., the MCR-ALS extracted peaks are overlapped, so hard to assign them to a particular energy state. The second issue is, ones have to manually select the number of components that are to be extracted, and ones are free to choose may two, three, four or any number of component and MCR-ALS will still fit all the data. The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique with a penalty term auto relevance determination (ARD) can select the number of components to be fitted automatically, and by imposing the soft orthogonal constraint (SO), the overlap peaks can be resolved distinctly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>NMF-ARD analysis</title><p id="Par30">The NMF-ARD-SO analysis of integrated data-set results into single spectral peak centered at 424.7 nm, resembled the original PL spectrum (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9E</xref>). Even imposing the hard penalty constraints has not helped and only a single peak could be extracted. The absence of any new peak essentially shed light on the fact that a single broad peak is because of the intrinsic nature of the as synthesize C-QDs, i.e., possibly, single energy transition state exists. Although, we have substantial functionalization on the surface of C-QDs, nonetheless, the photoluminescence is not because of the multiple surface states and the possibility of the existence of multiple energy states can be ruled out. Our results show that given the advantage of priory and orthogonal constrained to ascertain the origin of the PL of C-QDs NMF-ARD-SO analysis has merits over the MCR-ALS and PCA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">We have synthesized mono-dispersed C-QDs via single-step thermal decomposition process using eco-friendly, high abundance, and very economical fennel seeds (<italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>). As synthesize C-QDs were well graphitized and possess excellent colloidal solubility, photo-stability, and environmental stability (pH). The C-QDs show excellent PL activity and excitation-independent emission. Machine learning techniques (ML) such as PCA, MCR-ALS, NMF-ARD-SO are useful in handling the large PL data-set and helped to ascertain the origin of the PL mechanism of as-synthesized C-QDs. PCA helped to choose the best excitation wavelength with objectivity for PL analysis. Nevertheless, we recommend the use of NMF-ARD-SO algorithm to analyze the PL mechanism because of its advantage over other ML algorithms. Synthesis of excitation independent C-QDs is easy to employ and can be scaled up for mass production. Such C-QDs is unique and may find lots of applications in bio-sensing, cellular imaging, solar cell, and sensors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Bio-Nano Electronics Research Center, Toyo University, Japan for the experimental characterization of TEM and XPS.
