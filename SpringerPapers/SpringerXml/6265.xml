</title><sec id="ASec1"><title>Purpose</title><p id="Par1">Cultivated meat (CM) is attracting increased attention as an environmentally sustainable and animal-friendly alternative to conventional meat. As the technology matures, more data are becoming available and uncertainties decline. The goal of this ex-ante life cycle assessment (LCA) was to provide an outlook of the environmental performance of commercial-scale CM production in 2030 and to compare this to conventional animal production in 2030, using recent and often primary data, combined with scenario analysis.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This comparative attributional ex-ante LCA used the ReCiPe Midpoint impact assessment method. System boundaries were cradle-to-gate, and the functional unit was 1 kg of meat. Data were collected from over 15 companies active in CM production and its supply chain. Source data include lab-scale primary data from five CM producers, full-scale primary data from processes in comparable manufacturing fields, data from computational models, and data from published literature. Important data have been cross-checked with additional experts. Scenarios were used to represent the variation in data and to assess the influence of important choices such as energy mix. Ambitious benchmarks were made for conventional beef, pork, and chicken production systems, which include efficient intensive European animal agriculture and incorporate potential improvements for 2030.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par3">CM is almost three times more efficient in turning crops into meat than chicken, the most efficient animal, and therefore agricultural land use is low. Nitrogen-related and air pollution emissions of CM are also lower because of this efficiency and because CM is produced in a contained system without manure. CM production is energy-intensive, and therefore the energy mix used for production and in its supply chain is important. Using renewable energy, the carbon footprint is lower than beef and pork and comparable to the ambitious benchmark of chicken. Greenhouse gas profiles are different, being mostly CO<sub>2</sub> for CM and more CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O for conventional meats. Climate hotspots are energy used for maintaining temperature in reactors and for biotechnological production of culture medium ingredients.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">CM has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than ambitious conventional meat benchmarks, for most environmental indicators, most clearly agricultural land use, air pollution, and nitrogen-related emissions. The carbon footprint is substantially lower than that of beef. How it compares to chicken and pork depends on energy mixes. While CM production and its upstream supply chain are energy-intensive, using renewable energy can ensure that it is a sustainable alternative to all conventional meats.</p></sec><sec id="ASec5"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par5">CM producers should optimize energy efficiency and source additional renewable energy, leverage supply chain collaborations to ensure sustainable feedstocks, and search for the environmental optimum of culture medium through combining low-impact ingredients and high-performance medium formulation. Governments should consider this emerging industry’s increased renewable energy demand and the sustainability potential of freed-up agricultural land. Consumers should consider CM not as an extra option on the menu, but as a substitute to higher-impact products.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cultivated

Further reduction of the blue water footprint of CM is possible through further increasing recycling at the facility (which is in theory well possible within a controlled environment (Yang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012), and efforts in the supply chain, for example by reducing water use for production of culture medium ingredients’.

</title><p id="Par6">Cultivated meat (CM), also referred to as cultured or cell-based meat, is genuine animal meat or seafood produced by cultivating animal cells directly via modern biotechnological methods (Specht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>). CM is intended to be interchangeable in diets, competing in the marketplace on taste, nutrition, and other meat attributes. Currently, over 100 companies across the globe have been founded to bring CM to market; however, it has only been approved for sale in Singapore (GFI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">CM is a sub-discipline of cellular agriculture, which broadly aims to substitute agricultural products derived primarily from animals, including meat, seafood, milk, materials such as leather and fur, and individual proteins such as collagen or heme. Plant-derived products such as cocoa, cotton, or palm oil can also be targeted through cellular agriculture approaches. The potential benefits of cellular agriculture lie in the removal of the animal or plant middle-man, coincident with a reduction in any negative externalities that contribute to climate change and environmental degradation, risk of antibiotic resistance and zoonotic disease, and animal welfare concerns (Stephens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>). Furthermore, having more control over the production process may lead to safer, more nutritious, and tastier products than their conventionally produced counterparts. Manufacturers of cellular agriculture products assume that these features will make them attractive to consumers and interchangeable in diets with little behavioral change required.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Food system impacts, global picture conventional animal agriculture, and footprints</title><p id="Par8">Although animal products contribute around 18% of calories and 37% of protein to the average global diet, the impacts on the environment are disproportionately large compared to non-animal products in diets (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). Estimates of global animal agriculture’s contribution to environmental issues are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9">Climate change: 16.5–19.4% contribution to total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, making animal production by far the highest contributor within food system emissions, twice as large as plant-based sources (Crippa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>; Twine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2021</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2021</xref>). The contribution of ruminants to total animal agriculture emissions is significant due to their methane emissions, with enteric fermentation accounting for 27% of global anthropogenic methane emissions (Global Methane Initiative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>; Grossi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>). Without interventions food system emissions alone could preclude Paris Agreement climate targets to limit warming at 1.5 °C by 2050 (Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Land use and land use change: 83% of global agricultural land use, including pastures and cropland for feed (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), which in turn is the main driver for global land use change (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Pendrill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>; FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2022</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Water use: 41% of green and blue water use combined, although contribution to blue water use is around 6% (Heinke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Nutrients: Over a third of anthropogenic nitrogen emissions (Uwizeye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>) and a dominant driver of disruption of natural nitrogen and phosphorus cycles (Garske and Ekardt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2021</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">Biodiversity loss: All of the impacts mentioned above are strong drivers for loss in biosphere integrity (Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>). Current production of animal products has a disproportionately large effect on biodiversity loss compared to other food products (Benton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par14">Reducing the impact of meat production on the environment can be achieved by improving animal agriculture and reducing the amount of animal agriculture. Given that animal meat consumption is projected to rise by more than 70% by the year 2050, compared to 2010 (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>), cellular agriculture technologies that can ultimately reduce the amount of animal agriculture are of paramount importance, as any improvements to conventional animal agriculture may be offset by anticipated growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Impacts of CM and conventional meats</title><p id="Par15">LCA studies up to date indicate that CM has the potential to have lower carbon footprint, land use, water use, and eutrophication effects than most conventional meats (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>; Tuomisto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>; Mattick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). An overview of the main study characteristics and results is provided in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">A</xref>. For land use, the difference is most striking, mirroring that CM is a more efficient way of turning biotic resources into meat. Energy use of CM however is higher, and therefore generally CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions are expected to be higher. Because animal production systems have greater emissions of strong greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and have higher land use change (LUC)-related emissions, aggregated climate change effects of CM are generally found to be lower than conventional meats. The most recent results for CM from Mattick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>) and Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) show that CM has the potential to have lower carbon footprints than global averages for all animal meats but will likely have higher carbon footprints than efficiently produced chicken (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Because of the different GHG-emission profiles between CM and conventional meats, Lynch and Pierrehumbert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>) modeled beef consumption scenarios over a time period of 1000 years, both conventional and CM beef. Their conclusion is that while “GWP100a” carbon footprints of CM may be lower than conventional beef, the overall long-term effect on climate change may be higher, because CO<sub>2</sub> from energy production in the CM system remains in the atmosphere a long time, while CH<sub>4</sub> from cows breaks down into biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. The study by Lynch and Pierrehumbert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>) however did not account for decarbonization of the global energy mix. Only Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) accounted for the increase in available decarbonized energy and show that this can have significant influence on the results. Because of the different GHG emission profiles between CM and conventional meat, this is a crucial modeling choice and therefore should be included in scenarios. In this study, this was taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ex-ante LCA, upscaling, and uncertainty</title><p id="Par17">CM is being developed with the promise of being more sustainable. However, since the technology is still immature and mostly on lab- or pilot-scale, this promise cannot yet be tested on the (large) scale that will benefit most from economies of scale. In contrast the conventional meat production systems and supply chains are mature and efficiently organized. Comparing a technology that is lab- or pilot-scale to a mature technology that enjoys the high-efficiency benefits of economies of scale yields an unrealistic picture of how the new technology could perform. The difficulties in comparisons notwithstanding, providing a picture of the environmental impacts and hotspots of a future production system can aid decision-making for increased sustainability in the design stages of this system, when it is still relatively inexpensive to change course of development (Villares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2017</xref>; Cucurachi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). Performing an LCA before (ex-ante) a technology is fully developed can therefore provide highly useful insights to deliver on the promise of sustainability.</p><p id="Par18">Tsoy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>) propose a framework for upscaling of three consecutive steps. These are projected technology scenario definition, preparation of a projected LCA flowchart, and projected data estimation. A few things should be considered when developing future scenarios (Pesonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>). First, it is important to select a timeframe for the scenarios. Secondly, there is the option to develop probable or extreme scenarios. Experts can be used to determine or describe realistic probable scenarios and future conditions (Tsoy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>), while a bandwidth is created between optimistic and pessimistic development trajectories for extreme scenarios.</p><p id="Par19">Heijungs and Huijbregts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>) describe uncertainty as “the problem of using information that is unavailable, wrong, unreliable, or that show a certain degree of variability.” A common challenge when conducting an ex-ante LCA is the lack of representative data for the system assessed which might introduce considerable uncertainty in the study (van der Giesen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>). Voglhuber-Slavinsky et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2022</xref>) proposed to explicitly acknowledge uncertainty and use different scenario’s to address uncertainty. Where Tsoy et al.

Various types of cultivated and conventionally produced meat were assessed and compared. The impact assessment methods used are ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint v1.1 (Hierarchist perspective) (Huijbregts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>) and cumulative energy demand (CED) (Frischknecht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>), with characterization factors adapted for lower heating values (LHV), as is included in the used Simapro version 9.2.0.2. Six indicators are included in the main paper in order to limit the number of figures. These are selected both based on perceived relevance to conventional meat and CM production systems and on robustness to minor changes in the LCA models. All ReCiPe 2016 indicators are reported in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">B</xref>, and the most important findings for these indicators are discussed in the main paper. Four indicators that are generally used in LCA of food products (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>) are included: carbon footprint (climate change), land use, blue water use, and terrestrial acidification. In addition, fine particulate matter (FPM) formation, CED, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) are included. FPM formation is relevant because this has significant effects on human health (Huijbregts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>) and both animal agriculture and industrial supply chains (such as in CM) have strong contributions to total emissions (Weagle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Wyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2022</xref>). FCR and CED are included because together they illustrate a fundamental difference between conventional meat and CM. CM is reportedly a more efficient way to convert feed into meat, without the need for growing the whole animal, but with added industrial energy to fulfill certain functions of living organisms. There are different approaches to the indicator CED, and as of yet, there is no harmonized methodology (Frischknecht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). Acknowledging the different approaches to CED, it is useful as a screening indicator and presented alongside the carbon footprint in this study for improved interpretation (Huijbregts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">The FCR shows the amount of dry matter (dm) ingredients needed for the output of 1 kg of fresh meat (assumed dm content between 20 and 30% and protein content between 18 and 25%, see Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">E</xref>). Differentiation is made for primary products, by-products, and biotic and mineral resources. The inputs are counted on a crop level. For example, to produce 1 kg of glucose, more than 1 kg (dm) of sugar crop is needed, because a sugar beet consists of more than glucose alone. The amount of ingredients needed for producing 1 kg of CM is therefore higher than the sum of the ingredients in the medium. Whether a by-product can be used as feed (for animals or CM) is an important sustainability characteristic of a feed regime. It is important to note here that soybean meal is also classified as a by-product in the frame used, although this is more a coproduct (Walker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2000</xref>). For CM, it is relatively uncertain to what extent by-products can be used as feed, and therefore only the soy hydrolysate is assumed to be derived from soybean meal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection and handling</title><p id="Par22">Primary data were collected from over 15 companies and research institutes, both active in CM production and in the CM supply chain, supplemented by literature and theoretical modeling.

This study uses sensitivity and scenario analyses to treat uncertainty and variability in the dataset. For upscaling we considered the framework presented in Tsoy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>). We defined scenarios (with the help of questionnaires and conversations with stakeholders), prepared an LCA flowchart of what an average future facility might look like (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and created the data inventory.

In preliminary conversations with the organizations, a probable timeline for commercial-scale CM production was established, resulting in the target year 2030 and a facility size of 10 ktonne/year. This is not to imply that CM products will be cost-competitive with conventional meat by that time but that some products such as minced meat could be produced and sold at ktonne scales. Subsequently, data were requested from the organizations for their current situation and expectations for 2030, including technology improvements. The latter data points were cross-checked and used as much as possible. If only current data were available, future expectations were either extrapolated with the help of experts or used as-is. Clear outliers were removed from the dataset. For important and variable data, such as culture media composition and quantity used, and energy mixes, various scenarios were developed, and a baseline model was created with representative values from the dataset (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>). These values were determined based on data spread, for example, mean, mode, or geometric mean. The baseline model is not representative of any single cell type or technology, and the values can therefore not be interpreted as such.</p><p id="Par24">For CM production, data has been collected and modeled in as much detail as possible, but since there are still unknowns (and unknown unknowns), data gaps cannot be avoided. To balance this, conservative estimates were used and extreme, worst-case scenarios were included.</p><p id="Par25">Data from both land and aquatic animal cell cultures were collected. CM production for these different species follows similar practices. However, there are important differences related to heating and cooling demand, where aquatic cells in many cases require lower temperatures for growth and are more tolerant to fluctuations in temperature (Krueger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>). Therefore, the worst case is used (land animals, cultivated around 37 °C). These study results are not directly representative of aquatic CM products, but they can help shed light on general hotspots when taking these differences into consideration during the interpretation of the results. The differences in culture medium use efficiency between land and aquatic species have not yet been robustly assessed.</p><p id="Par26">Data handling for conventional meat production is discussed in paragraph <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">2.3.4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Background data, software, and allocation procedures</title><p id="Par27">Background data were taken from Ecoinvent 3.7.1. (system model: allocation, cut-off by classification) (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2016</xref>) and Agri-Footprint 5.0 (system model: economic allocation) (van Paassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>). The software used is Simapro 9.2.0.2. Allocation was done using economic principles, as the available data best suited this form of allocation, and it is in line with the Ecoinvent database methodology (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2016</xref>). Although it is regularly done in LCA research, one should be aware of potential problems when combining two datasets from different sources, such as Agri-Footprint and Ecoinvent. Problems could be differences in methodologies and modeling, selection criteria for data, and different naming of environmental interventions (emissions and extractions) which can cause problems in impact assessment. Agri-Footprint has indicated specifically to this point that modeling of field emissions is mostly done using similar methodologies as Ecoinvent, and the software developer of SimaPro, PRé, has ensured that environmental interventions have been mapped to be compatible with ReCiPe for both databases (Blonk Sustainability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">n.d.</xref>). Additionally, we have ensured consistency by using main inputs from agro-food supply chains from Agri-Footprint and using transport, energy, synthetic chemicals, and other materials from Ecoinvent. In order to make the datasets used consistent with the 2030 time horizon used in the study, we have created foreground processes for the most important inputs (including energy mixes for 2030, which is also used as an input into other foreground processes). Further data handling is described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>. Adapting background databases in order to be representative of 2030 was not feasible. This may cause a slight overestimation of environmental impacts throughout all LCA models presented in this study (both CM and conventional meats), assuming globally technologies only become more sustainable over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Goal and scope</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Goal</title><p id="Par28">The goal of this study was to compare commercial-scale CM production in 2030 to conventional meat production to gain insights into the comparative environmental impacts of different meats and identify hotspots in CM production.

All impacts associated with the product system up to the economy-environment boundary were included (resource extraction, land use, or physical emissions). Buildings were excluded for both conventional meats and CM. For CM, bioreactors and culture medium storage and mixing tanks were included, as these are inherent to this different technology for meat production, and actually can be considered the replacement of the animal’s body in the CM product system.</p><p id="Par30">The CM system flowchart is provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Functional unit</title><p id="Par31">The functional unit was 1 kg of land animal meat produced in 2030.

The same cell culture medium was assumed to be used throughout the process. Cell proliferation takes place in a seed train until the largest stirred-tank reactor (STR) (working volume 10,000 L) is filled to maximum cell density. At this point, 50% of the cells are harvested, culture medium replenished, and cells further proliferate until maximum cell density is reached. As cell doubling is exponential, most cell production takes place in this last phase of proliferation. A targeted feeding regime allows ingredients to be balanced, and water is expended and recycled throughout the process. There are three intermediate harvests, in total resulting in 200% of cells, relative to the maximum number of cells in the largest proliferation reactor (50% + 50% + 100%). Harvested cells are seeded onto edible scaffolds for further differentiation and maturation, which occurs in 4 perfusion reactors (PR, working volume 2000 L) operating in parallel. Conservatively, it was assumed that no further cell growth takes place in this phase even though some data suggest mass increase during differentiation can be more than 100% (Tuomisto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>). Additional equipment included were medium storage and mixing tanks, a cell banking system, and centrifuges.</p><p id="Par35">After each production run (12 days for the 10,000 L STR and 10 days for the PR), the reactors are cleaned using a clean-in-place and steam-in-place (CIP/SIP) system.

For 10 kton/year production, it was assumed that the facility needs around 130 production lines to be operating in parallel on a staggered production schedule, which includes accounting for 15–20% downtime for cleaning and maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Process parameters</title><p id="Par36">The main parameters regarding the cell culture process and system design are provided in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Material and energy inputs and their scenarios</title><sec><p id="Par37">For an overview of the sources, data quality, amount of data points, and whether there has been an independent cross-check of the data, see Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">D</xref>.

Data was asked for both the current situation and 10 years from now (see Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">D</xref> for more information about data collection for culture medium). How lab-scale measured medium efficiency relates to upscaled performances is uncertain. Some indicated that medium efficiency will go down with larger scales, and some indicated that there is no reason to think this will change much or that technology development will counter any negative effects. The proposed high medium scenario amply covers the maximum efficiency decrease mentioned, compared to the baseline (mid) medium scenario (−20%).</p><p id="Par39">Data were aggregated to the ingredient group level to ensure confidentiality. Variation in the dataset indicated different process characteristics and expectations of developments. For the “low-medium” scenario, data assumptions for enhanced catabolism cell types from Humbird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) were used as an additional data source for amino acid and sugar consumption. Lower amino acid and sugar quantities were received from CM companies but could not be verified by independent experts and were excluded from this study. Three scenarios were developed, including two extreme scenarios reflecting the upper and lower data boundary, in addition to a probable baseline scenario. The baseline scenario values for the ingredient groups were based on the mean of the dataset, in some cases adjusted up- or downward if most data points were clustered around a certain value or if conversation with experts suggested some data points were more robust than others. The scenarios are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The values correspond to the amount of medium ingredients needed for the production of 1 kg of meat. Compared to standard DMEM/F12, the medium formulations in this study contain relatively high amounts of amino acids. This could be explained by the fact that when hydrolysates are used as a (partial) source of amino acids, current evidence shows that more of them are needed than when single amino acids are used, because the composition is not defined and not optimal. Despite this, CM companies are likely to make this tradeoff due to cost (Humbird <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) and environmental impact (Tuomisto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) savings that can be expected with the use of hydrolysates.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Culture medium scenarios (total in g ingredients per kg of cultivated meat cells, therefore excluding any scaffolding material)

Glucose is supplied as conventional food-grade maize glucose. Seventy-five percent of amino acids are supplied from soy hydrolysate, and the remaining 25% are single product amino acids from either microbial or chemical production. The soy used is assumed to be deforestation-free, just as for the animal feed in this study. Involved organizations indicated that it is plausible that hydrolysates can be used to supply amino acids in the culture medium, as long as the composition is well defined to enable targeted supplements (Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). Additionally, soy was selected based on primary data, as it has an essential amino acid profile that roughly matches that of the popular basal medium formulation DMEM/F12 (Humbird <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). L-Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid supplemented to the culture medium and is produced microbially. L-Glutamine is not available in Agri-Footprint, and therefore an average of three microbially produced feed-grade amino acids (lysine, threonine, and methionine) is used as a proxy (Marinussen and Kool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). If only single amino acids were used instead of hydrolysates, it is possible that less amino acids would be needed than when using hydrolysates.</p><p id="Par42">Recombinant proteins have important functions in the medium, mainly as growth factors that play a broad role in the control of various cellular pathways or as proteins that can transport and deliver nutrients and other macromolecules. It was assumed that these proteins are produced recombinantly using microbial fermentation, but little environmental data are available in the public literature. In this study, confidential company data is used for albumin, transferrin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). These substances are used in different concentrations in the medium, of which albumin has by far the highest concentration (if used) and IGF the lowest. Regarding albumin, companies have widely differing opinions as to what concentration is needed, or whether this will be included at all, and therefore the scenarios reflect this, with albumin present in both the mid- and high-medium scenarios. IGF production is currently at the smallest scale and has the highest environmental impact and therefore was used as a proxy for growth factors, for which production will likely be at small scales for a long time.</p><p id="Par43">The pH buffering system used is largely bicarbonate in the low- and mid-medium scenarios.

For the upstream materials production, we asked for expected energy use at production scales that the producers expected to attain in 2030. The energy use differs per ingredient, as, for example, the technology and production scales for albumin are already more advanced than for growth factors, which will be expected to stay at small scales for a long time due to more limited demand.

Ambitious benchmarks were used to ensure that no unfair advantage is given to CM. CM is often presented as an environmental solution, but in order for that to be true on a product level, it needs to be able to compete environmentally with conventional meat products from efficient and sustainable production systems. The comparison made in this study shows minimum expected benefits from CM. Current global average production of conventional meat has 2x – 4 × higher footprints than the ambitious benchmarks (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">The ambitious benchmarks for conventional meats are based on LCA models from Agri-Footprint LCA database (van Paassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>), which represent intensive, efficient production systems located in the Netherlands (chicken, pork, dairy cattle) and Ireland (beef cattle). These models are extended with technological and supply chain improvements. History learns that adoption of sustainability innovations in (animal) agriculture systems is challenging and actual effects on sustainability are uncertain (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2001</xref>). Additionally, there seems to be an increasing demand for products with higher animal welfare standards (Scherer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>), which make certain innovations that could decrease product carbon footprints unlikely (e.g., slaughtering at younger ages or keeping livestock fully indoors to capture methane). The ambitious benchmarks focus on a selection of improvements that are proven to be feasible and are likely to be implemented at larger scales by 2030. This does not mean that these are expected to disseminate widely or globally, but there is a high likelihood that these kinds of production systems will exist.</p><p id="Par56">The improvements included for the ambitious benchmarks are the following (see Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">F</xref> for substantiation):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par57">Reduced methane emissions from cattle (− 15%) through the use of enzymes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">Reduced ammonia emissions from cattle (− 5.4%) through increased outdoor grazing</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par59">Renewable energy at farm and feed facilities</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par60">No LUC and associated GHG emissions related to soybean production</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par61">Beef produced in grazing systems on marginal lands was excluded from the comparison. It should be acknowledged that animal production systems can be very different and are often interlinked. This adds complexity to an LCA, among others with regard to allocation and land use comparisons. For example, meat from dairy systems (cows, calves, and bulls) provides more than half of global cattle meat (Vellinga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>). This meat has a lower impact because most of the emissions are allocated to the milk produced in this system. Meat from dairy systems was also included in the comparison.</p><p id="Par62">The ambitious benchmark of CM consists of the baseline scenario with renewable energy for scope 1, 2, and partially scope 3. All scenarios for CM also include LUC-free soy for soy hydrolysate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par63">There are many process parameters that influence the environmental impact and could be further optimized by CM companies.

In the global average energy scenario, the carbon footprint is over 14 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq./kg meat, while the ambitious benchmark has a carbon footprint of less than 3 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq./kg meat. In the renewable scope 1 and 2 scenario, the carbon footprint is around 4 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq./kg meat. The hotspot analysis shows that the carbon footprint is mainly driven by energy use at the facility (scope 1 and 2) and energy use in production of medium ingredients. Depending on what electricity mix is used, and in which scopes, either facility energy use or medium ingredient production is the main hotspot.</p><p id="Par77">Energy use at the facility is mainly driven by energy use of the heat exchanger (cooling energy, ~ 75%), followed by heating the culture medium (~ 10%), aeration, agitation, CIP/SIP, and HVAC (all &lt; 5%, see Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">D</xref>). While different estimates show slightly different hotspots regarding this energy use, it is clear that in-facility energy demand is high and current models indicate that cooling energy is one of the main contributors to be expected. The carbon footprint of the culture medium is mainly driven by production of amino acids from microbial or chemical production (29–37%, depending on the energy mix during production), followed by recombinant proteins (8–29%), glucose (22–29%), and soy hydrolysate (12–16%). In the high-medium scenario, albumin and HEPES both contribute significantly as they are used in higher concentrations and have a high associated footprint. On a per kg ingredient basis, the recombinant proteins have the highest carbon footprint by far, followed by amino acids from microbial or chemical production. These are energy-intensive biochemical processes that are currently mostly not produced at large scales (except for some amino acids commonly used as food and feed additives), and therefore do not enjoy the benefits of economies of scale. The data for these processes is also rather uncertain, but it seems clear that most currently used (fermentation) technologies have high energy use for some time to come, until the industry is fully mature.</p><p id="Par78">The production of the scaffold has a minor contribution but is also only used at small mass percentages (10% of the final product) and is made from relatively low-impact materials. Other (minor) drivers for the carbon footprint are CIP/SIP and recycling of water. Equipment has a relatively low contribution to the carbon footprint, at the lifetimes assumed in the baseline scenario (20 years).</p><p id="Par79">Compared to conventional meat, the greenhouse gas emissions profile is different. In CM production, the main contributor is CO<sub>2</sub>, directly or indirectly from energy consumption (also production of raw materials and upstream industrial processes).

If this energy comes from renewable sources, it can be largely decoupled from the carbon footprint, as is seen in this comparison of ambitious benchmarks.</p><p id="Par82">Land use for CM is lower than for all conventional meats, which is a robust conclusion that is explained by the more efficient conversion of crops into final product, and therefore lower agricultural land use. Land occupied for renewable energy production (solar and wind) contributes around 10–20% to total land use, highlighting a tradeoff in land use for CM, but overall the reduced land use for crops far outweighs the increased land use for renewable energy production.</p><p id="Par83">Blue water use (surface and groundwater) in CM production is higher for chicken, pork, and beef from dairy cattle, and lower for beef from beef cattle. This result is sensitive to internal water recycling at the facility (in this ambitious benchmark, the recycling percentage is 75%). Around half of the water use is at the facility itself (mostly for use in culture media), and half in the supply chain, mainly for the (bio)chemical production of medium ingredients and in the production of the renewable energy materials and infrastructure.</p><p id="Par84">Fine particulate matter and acidification results for CM are lower than those of all conventional meats, and these results are relatively insensitive to changes in the model. The main reason for this is that ammonia emissions for CM are lower than in the animal systems, because there is no manure and CM needs less crops and therefore less fertilizer. Whereas ammonia is the dominant driver for fine particulate matter and acidification for the conventional meat systems, sulfur dioxide and NOx are the main drivers in the CM system. These are linked to the industrial upstream processes, mainly the production of chemicals for medium ingredient production and the mining and processing of materials for the renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p id="Par85">Other impact categories are provided in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">B</xref>, some of which are discussed here. Marine eutrophication shows similarities to acidification results, because nitrogen-related emissions (importantly ammonia) are dominant in both indicators. Freshwater eutrophication results are potentially relatively high for CM (higher than for chicken and pork) but are sensitive to the configuration of wastewater treatment processes and upstream industrial chemical processes and their treatment and therefore also relatively uncertain. Real-world measurements should provide a better idea of what type of wastewater treatment is needed. Toxicity impact categories show variation. While for the water-related toxicity impact categories conventional meat production has higher scores, terrestrial ecotoxicity and human non-carcinogenic toxicity are potentially indicators where CM performs worse than conventional meat. Similar to freshwater eutrophication, this is due to upstream production of raw materials for the industrialized and energy-intensive supply chain, highlighting the need for transparent supply chains and responsible sourcing.</p><p id="Par86">The feed conversion ratio (FCR) for the ambitious benchmarks is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. CM feed conversion ratio is lower than all conventional meats, which means it is a more efficient way of turning crops into meat. This explains why the agricultural land use of CM is low compared to conventional meats. The low FCR is also linked to the relatively high energy use in CM production, as part of the energy needed by animals to keep their biological processes going are now supplied via external (electrical or other) energy.</p><p id="Par87">When looking at the biotic FCR, CM is almost three times more efficient than chicken, which has the most efficient feed conversion of the conventional meats. Mineral feed use for CM is relatively high, while for conventional animal production, this is negligible. In CM production, this mainly concerns direct use of salts in the culture medium and indirect use for microbial production of the amino acids and recombinant proteins. Conventional animals have a relatively large share of by-products in their feed, compared to CM. However, as the FCR for CM is lower, primary feed use is still lowest for CM, almost twice as low as for chicken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par88">The dataset used showed variation in some aspects, highlighting the different approaches to producing CM and the uncertainties at this stage of technology development.

applying smart cooling (combining and optimizing passive and active cooling), increasing the amount of harvests from the largest proliferation vessel (moving towards continuous production), improving medium efficiency (especially optimizing use of recombinant proteins, amino acids, and pH buffer system), and shortening overall production time. These improvements lead to a reduced energy demand, either in the upstream supply chain or during production.</p><p id="Par90">Conversely, energy demand and thereby the carbon footprint are increased by inefficient medium use, less harvests (moving towards batch processes), and attaining lower maximum cell densities or working with smaller cells (at constant cell densities).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Comparison of cultivated and conventional meats</title><p id="Par91">CM and conventional meat are fundamentally different technologies for producing the same product: meat. Compared to conventional meats, CM is produced in a closed environment that enables higher degrees of control. This comes at the expense of requiring more energy but with the advantage of requiring different and less feed. It is therefore not surprising that the environmental profiles of CM and conventional meats are different. This study includes the latest estimates from industry and experts. While many uncertainties still exist, public and private research and commercial developments are accelerating, and environmental data is coming available at a fast pace. The use of scenarios informs the high-level conclusions that can already be drawn at this stage of technology development.</p><p id="Par92">More efficient feed use for CM translates itself directly into lower agricultural land use and good performance on other environmental indicators that are strongly linked to crop production. Indirectly, it also causes CM to have higher energy use, because part of the energy (calories) used for biological processes in animals (such as maintaining body temperature) is replaced by electricity and heat. The important distinction between those two types of energy is that electricity and heat can be produced sustainably, while the sustainability improvement potential for animal feed is more limited and less scalable.</p><p id="Par93">The controlled environment, direct metabolism, and absence of manure in CM production ensure limited emissions from the production process itself. Importantly, ammonia and the strong greenhouse gasses methane and nitrous oxide are avoided or can be mitigated during wastewater treatment or spent media recycling, the latter of which was not yet included in this study. This is in contrast to conventional meat production, where these emissions are harder to mitigate, because these are inherent to biological processes that happen in a less controlled environment. CM therefore performs relatively well on environmental indicators that are strongly linked to ammonia, such as acidification, fine particulate matter formation, and marine eutrophication. For climate change, the sustainability potential of CM is high, because it is mostly CO<sub>2</sub> driving its carbon footprint, and this emission can be reduced by using decarbonized technologies like renewable energy. As the global energy system continues to decarbonize, the average footprint of CM will continue to decline more strongly than that of conventional meats. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions in conventional meat production are more difficult to reduce (Eckard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Höglund-Isaksson and Gómez-Sanabria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). If renewable energy is used, the carbon footprint of CM can be low and comparable to chicken, but if this is not the case, its carbon footprint may be higher than pork. With high certainty, the carbon footprint of CM will be lower than beef from beef cattle.</p><p id="Par94">The bioreactor-based production of CM and the biochemical production of medium ingredients in the upstream supply chain have a few important characteristics. Besides the aforementioned high energy use, there is also relatively high blue water use (surface- and groundwater) and mineral resource use. Blue water use in industrial bioprocessing technologies is high. While conventional meats are known for high water use, the majority of this is green water (rainwater), which is easily replenishable. Looking at blue water use alone, CM scores higher than chicken, pork and beef from dairy cattle, when 75% water is recycled at the facility. Further reduction of the blue water footprint of CM is possible through further increasing recycling at the facility (which is in theory well possible within a controlled environment (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2012</xref>), and efforts in the supply chain, for example by reducing water use for production of culture medium ingredients. Mineral resource use in CM production in feed is mostly due to salts in the culture medium and upstream microbial production processes of medium ingredients. These salts have relatively low associated impacts per kg, but the amounts add up when used in significant amounts. Recycling of salts was not considered in this LCA but could be an important avenue for improving total resource use and associated environmental indicators. The bioreactors and other equipment needed for CM production use substantial amounts of steel and other materials. However, this does not come up as a hotspot in the carbon footprint, as the operational impacts (of energy and resources) dwarf the impacts of the bioreactors over their lifetime (assumed to be 20 years in this study).</p><p id="Par95">Implicit in the comparison of CM and conventional meats is that the products are equal, or in LCA terminology, the function is the same. CM uses the same biological processes to produce the same meat cells; therefore, its function is arguably the same as conventional meats. However, there are more ways to look at the function of foods within an LCA framework, for example, by taking a diet- or product-based perspective or by focusing on specific nutritional quality (McAuliffe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). As health effects and consumer perception and behavior cannot yet be studied in relation to CM, these factors cannot yet be considered. Another factor influencing the functional unit is the inclusion of the (edible) scaffold in the final product. While potentially optional for some CM products, scaffolding materials permit cell adherence and mimic the extracellular matrix of the cells, which can allow for greater control over the final product’s texture. Many options for scaffolding material exist (Seah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2022</xref>). In this study, the scaffolding material was not considered meat, and therefore (conservatively) the reference product of CM is actually ~ 1.1 kg of final product, including 1 kg meat cells and ~ 0.1 kg scaffolding material. If the nutritional quality and consumer perception of the product including scaffold are comparable to meat, this correction to the functional unit arguably does not need to be made.</p><p id="Par96">Some effects that are relevant when comparing two fundamentally different technologies were not captured in this LCA. Examples of topics often mentioned in relation to alternative proteins such as CM are animal welfare, ecosystem functions of livestock systems, biodiversity and ecosystem impacts (especially in aquatic environments), zoonotic disease and antimicrobial resistance risk, odor and other aspects affecting quality of living, food security and food sovereignty, the resilience of and distribution of power in supply chains, and consumer perception and behavior. These are not captured in an LCA but arguably part of a broader definition of sustainability, and therefore there are attempts to include these within the LCA framework (for animal welfare, see, e.g., Scherer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>). Also, a greater debate about the role of animals in the agricultural and food systems is inadequately captured by using a product-based comparison. An example is the function of animals to produce food on marginal lands or in high-quality recycling of waste streams. There is a lot of variation in the environmental impacts or values that meat production systems have, both for conventional meats and CM. By zooming in on ambitious benchmarks, this variation is ignored. This study therefore provides a relevant dataset for the greater discussion on CM, specifically regarding its product environmental footprint, but many other factors are important and should be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Insights from 10 years of cultivated meat LCAs</title><p id="Par97">A little over 10 years ago, Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>) published the first LCA of CM. That study was followed by Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>) and Mattick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>), and the results from those early studies were incorporated in additional assessments by Smetana et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>) and Lynch and Pierrehumbert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). The most recent addition is an LCA based on experimental bench-scale data from Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>). A comparison of these studies, including study design and main environmental indicators, are presented in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">A</xref> and compared to this study. Over the years, insights have progressed, uncertainties have decreased, and environmental benefits and hotspots have become clearer. In all studies, biotic resource use is relatively low compared to conventional meats, but there is variation in the type of feedstocks used and the extent to which hydrolysates can be incorporated. These factors can significantly influence environmental performance. In this study, the effects of more sustainable feedstocks were not included, but previous assessments, such as those that modeled hydrolysates from cyanobacteria (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>; Tuomisto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>), show that there may be opportunities here. The controlled environment and efficient resource use of CM show sustainability potential with regard to direct farm/facility-level emissions and associated disruption of nutrient cycles, which are serious and hard to mitigate environmental concerns in conventional animal agriculture. Estimates of energy use have increased over the years, highlighting the relative uncertainty in this regard and the importance of decarbonizing the energy sources. As energy estimates are shown to be uncertain, in this study, a conservative approach has been taken, in which importantly the cooling load is supplied by active cooling. It may well be that energy use at large scales is lower than the current estimate, as is shown by the sensitivity analysis on smart cooling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Environmental hotspots in cultivated meat production and technology development</title><p id="Par98">The main environmental hotspots of CM production are the facility energy use and culture medium ingredient production, in which energy use also plays an important role. The impacts of CM can therefore be greatly reduced by using renewable energy in both the facility (scope 1 and 2) and the supply chain, mainly for production of medium ingredients.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Energy</title><p id="Par99">Facility energy use is directly within the influence of the CM producers. As far as possible, energy efficiency should be optimized. In this study, a conservative estimate of energy use is taken, mainly regarding the need for a large active cooling load, which accounts for ~ 75% of energy use. The need for the cooling load as modeled here is uncertain. In comparison, Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) model lower facility energy demand (according to our calculations 2.8–9.6 kWh/kg meat cells, compared to 22.3 kWh/kg meat cells in the baseline scenario in this study). As this study and Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) assess different bioreactor systems (a combination of STRs and perfusion reactors and a hollow fiber bioreactor, respectively), different production scales (commercial and bench-scale, respectively) have different process characteristics; these numbers cannot directly be compared, and therefore these differences cannot easily be explained. An important reason could be that the approach used to calculate facility energy demand in this study differs from previous studies (Mattick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>; Tuomisto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) in the sense that data from computational models of similar processes at large scales were used, instead of using thermodynamic calculations for specific processes at the cell level. This results in higher estimates for overall energy use in this study and specifically for necessary cooling load. It is therefore a conservative approach. It is also possible that there are differences in heating and cooling efficiency due to differences in bioreactor sizes, overall water volumes, cooling jacket design, and vessel geometry. The topic of heating and cooling balance is an area of ongoing research and development in the field, because large-scale empirical data for CM production does not exist yet. While small-scale cultures generally do not produce much heat, heat dynamics may change at larger scales, resulting in temperature hotspots that need to be cooled quickly (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). The demand for heating and cooling will depend on multiple factors such as reactor design, cell densities, oxygen uptake rates (OUR), and glucose consumption. Further modeling of real-world pilot CM processes, and preferably experimental data, is needed to provide more accurate estimates of heating and cooling demand at scale.</p><p id="Par100">Environmental impacts of cooling could also be mitigated by applying partially passive cooling. Whether this is possible will depend on the environmental conditions of the facility location and ambient temperatures. The most universally applicable cooling systems are based on active cooling, using vapor-compression refrigeration or cooling water, both of which ultimately reject their heat to the ambient air. The economic optimum temperature differential in the cooling system will be around 10 °C. The production process considered in this study has to be kept around 37 °C, so the cooling fluid will have a maximum temperature of around 27 °C. Another 10 °C temperature differential is required to reject the heat to the ambient air. Roughly speaking, there are four options for cooling, ranging from active to fully passive cooling, that are suitable for different ambient temperatures:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par101">Using a refrigeration cycle, for ambient temperatures up to 27 °C</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par102">Using cooling water and an evaporating cooling tower, for ambient temperatures up to 22 °C</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par103">Using cooling water and an air fin cooler with mechanical air circulation, for ambient temperatures up to 17 °C</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par104">Using cooling water and an air fin cooler without mechanical air circulation, for ambient temperatures up to 12 °C</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par105">Depending on year-round ambient temperature conditions, there will be a need for active or passive cooling, or likely a combination of both, as many locations on Earth have strong seasonal temperature fluctuations. In the baseline scenario, year-round use of the refrigeration cycle was assumed as this is suitable for any location at any time, but this is a conservative approach.</p><p id="Par106">The cooling electricity demand can be reduced by optimizing the cooling system to the geographical location. The sensitivity analysis on smart cooling (cutting down the electricity demand by 50%) shows that this can have a significant effect on the carbon footprint (− 33% in the global average energy scenario and − 21% in the ambitious benchmark scenario). This could be extended to the biochemical production processes in the upstream supply chain, but this was not considered in this study. Also not considered in this study is that the carbon footprint of electricity will on average be lower when active cooling load is most needed, as this is when ambient temperatures are highest and there is more solar electricity available. This has a damping effect on the carbon footprint of products that use a lot of cooling energy. Cooling system design will always be strongly related to location-specific opportunities. Cold-water sources (e.g., oceans or rivers) or residual heat from industry (for absorption cooling) might be viable options, but this depends on geographical, legal, and economic context.</p><p id="Par107">Whatever the exact assumptions for facility energy demand, it is clear that energy sourcing is an important lever for sustainability. Lower energy use results in lower carbon footprints and the conservative energy assumptions in this study therefore possibly result in conservative carbon footprints estimates. CM companies should look for suitable locations where renewable energy, especially electricity, is abundant. There is evidence that this is already occurring in the CM industry.</p><p id="Par108">CM is a new and potentially large sector with substantial energy demand, and thus its role in the energy transition must be considered. On the one hand, it may increase pressure on an energy transition that is already experiencing difficulty meeting global climate goals (Gielen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). On the other hand, it is potentially disruptive to the food system, providing meat with a significantly smaller land footprint, which provides opportunities to use this land for additional carbon storage or renewable energy production while reducing deforestation pressure. Additional studies are needed to further understand this carbon opportunity cost, and robust policies will be needed to realize these opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Culture medium</title><p id="Par109">Culture medium ingredient production is the second environmental hotspot, which becomes important (even dominant) when renewable energy is used for the facility. These impacts are mostly driven by the energy-intensive production of recombinant proteins and single amino acids produced microbially or chemically, followed by glucose, soy hydrolysate, and HEPES (if used). When albumin is used in the medium, this dwarfs the impact of the other ingredients, as it is needed in up to 100,000 times higher concentrations than growth factors. The estimated carbon footprint of microbially produced amino acids is 5x – 10 × higher than amino acids from hydrolysates. If production with hydrolysates is not realized, and companies continue to rely on single amino acids, the impacts of culture medium are likely to be higher, even though less amino acids would be needed as the medium would be fully defined. This is illustrated in Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>), where the amino acids are the dominant driver for the life cycle carbon footprint of CM. The industries supplying the recombinant proteins and amino acids necessary for CM production are not yet always at scale, and therefore this study uses ex-ante estimates for these products for a large part. Currently, these ingredients come from the pharma sector, where price pressure is low, and therefore energy efficiency is not the main priority. As the CM industry matures, the recombinant protein and amino acid industries will also mature and be incentivized towards more sustainable practices given the importance of scope 3 emissions. A dialogue between the CM companies and their suppliers is needed to implement these practices, guided by LCAs that model medium composition and efficiency changes. The majority of recombinant proteins are currently supplied by microbial fermentation; however, other methods such as expression in plants, insects, or cell-free systems may offer advantageous sustainability characteristics (Tripathi and Shrivastava <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>; GFI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). Fermentation using filamentous fungi currently looks highly promising from an environmental perspective (Järviö et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>). Future research is needed to clarify the most suitable production platforms that balance quality, cost, sustainability, and other factors that may be important for regulation and consumer acceptance.</p><p id="Par110">The exact composition and efficiency of the culture medium show variation between technologies and cell types (O’Neill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2022</xref>). In this study, the various medium scenarios reflect realistic future scenarios, to current knowledge, but not per se the absolute upper or lower bounds of medium efficiency. Lower numbers than those modeled in the low-medium scenario have been reported, but could not be generalized across products and technologies at this point, and were therefore not included. Future research and experimental data will have to provide additional insights on this topic.</p><p id="Par111">It is uncertain to what extent CM lends itself to converting waste- or by-products into edible meat. This could be an avenue through which the footprint of culture medium can be reduced. For example, it is possible that the glucose, both for direct use in the culture medium and for indirect use for biochemical fermentation processes in the supply chain, can be sourced from waste- or by-products such as lignocellulosic biomass. Conventional animal production lends itself well to the conversion of by-products into meat, but the currently optimized production systems, including the ambitious benchmarks in this study, are not representative of such a system, and there are limits to the scale of global animal production when increasing the amount of by-products (Mottet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>). Also, the ambiguous terminology around waste-, co-, and by-products casts confusion on the debate, most clearly seen in the discussion regarding soybean meal. Perhaps more useful indicators focus on the percentage that is “human-edible” in an ingredient, which in the case of soybean meal is 80% (Wilkinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2011</xref>), or on the share of land that could otherwise be used for human-edible food production (van Zanten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par112">Offsetting the environmental impact of the culture medium could also be accomplished by harvesting co-products from a CM process. This is not considered in this study because of lacking data regarding separation, capture, and recycling at scale, but Tuomisto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>) show that this could have significant effects on overall system performance. This is an interesting area for future research. It is estimated that under baseline assumptions ~ 3200 tonnes of lactate, 16 tonnes of ammonia, and 1 tonne of alanine will be produced as waste in a year of operation in this model facility (Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">D</xref>). Capture and recycling of these co-products are possible and could valorize them as inputs into downstream applications for bioplastics, fertilizers, or other feedstocks (Nahmias and Wissotsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>). The environmental benefits of this could be substantial. For example, the carbon footprint of biobased lactic acid ranges from 1.6 (Morão and de Bie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2019</xref>) to 11 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq./kg (Parajuli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>), depending on the feedstock and production process. Avoided production of virgin lactic acid production could be partially counted as a reduction in the impacts of CM production. Additional studies are needed to understand the techno-economics of such recycling approaches as well as potential sustainability tradeoffs if recycling systems require high amounts of energy to operate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Other technological innovations</title><p id="Par113">In order to realize the production system as modeled in this study, technological innovations are needed. Importantly, this relates to the bioreactor platforms. Perfusion systems modeled in this study are not yet available for meat production. Cost-effective systems will have to be developed over the next decade. Important characteristics relate to automated feeding (e.g., nutrients and oxygen), perfusion and removal of unwanted substances (e.g., ammonia and lactate), and incorporation of scaffolding. At the facility scale, these relate to harvesting of cells and recycling of nutrients and other medium ingredients. In this study, only water recycling was included (at 75% efficiency). When recycling solid ingredients, additional separation steps are needed, which can be costly and will likely have a tradeoff with added energy and material use. Future research will have to shed light on these costs and environmental tradeoffs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Product development and targeted diet substitution</title><p id="Par114">It is important to see the potential of CM in the context of diets. From an environmental perspective, the largest gains are by substituting the highest impact conventional meat products by CM on the plate of the consumer, being beef from beef cattle. Of course other factors besides those captured in an LCA play a role and regional context matters, but the message is that CM can be seen as a tool to reduce the downsides of current global demand for conventional animal products. In this sense, it can be an attractive part of a mix of sustainable protein sources in a healthy diet, which also includes increased amounts of fully plant-based options, still the most direct way to consume proteins while having the lowest associated impacts (Poore and Nemecek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). Lastly, hybrid products (partly plant-based, partly CM) can be made to increase the amount of sustainable proteins in diets while also optimizing for efficiency, sustainability, and costs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par115">CM has the potential to be a sustainable source of animal protein. How it compares to conventional meats depends on various factors, most importantly the sources of energy used for the facility and the production of medium ingredients. When fully renewable energy is used in these areas, its carbon footprint can compete with ambitious benchmarks of chicken and is lower than that of the other conventional meats. Land use of CM is significantly lower than all conventional meats, resulting from the more efficient conversion of crops into meat. When CM replaces conventional meats in diets, this means that land is freed up. This land could be used to mitigate climate change, support biodiversity, or provide other societal and environmental benefits, but robust policies are needed to realize this.</p><p id="Par116">CM companies should invest in strong supply chain collaborations to drive down the carbon footprint in all parts of the supply chain. Strong climate goals can be set and realized by continuously conducting LCAs to support decision-making and guide technology development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>GAIA and the Good Food Institute funded initial screening economic and environmental assessments, which were published by CE Delft.
