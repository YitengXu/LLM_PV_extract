Nevertheless, due to declining in fossil fuel reserves coupled with negative environmental impacts, shifting to sustainable renewable energy for meeting the future energy demand is recommended. Since Malaysia is rich with natural resources, utilization of biomass energy (bioenergy/biofuel) as the alternative energy is promising to be further explored. Therefore, this review paper intents to discuss the current scenario of different types of biomass energy in Malaysia along with the up-to-date local biomass energy–related environmental policy (from 2016 onwards). In addition, challenges and barriers for large-scale implementation of the biomass energy in Malaysia are to be discussed. Overall, this review paper is interesting as it can assist in promoting the biomass utilization as energy source, and to ensure the future growth of biomass energy market in the country along with its effective implementation while alleviating poor disposal problem and to create job employment opportunities. Furthermore, a collective effort to expand potential biomass feedstocks, apart from oil palm, should be emphasized to encourage the renewable energy production diversification in the nation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bioeconomy</kwd><kwd>Bioenergy production</kwd><kwd>Bioenergy policies</kwd><kwd>Bioenergy outlook</kwd><kwd>Malaysia

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Global energy demand in the twenty-first century is currently witnessing a substantial growth of demand that is coupled with increasing energy-intensive productions, to meet the ever-growing needs of consumer populations. Since the First Industrial Revolution in 1784, fossil fuels, namely coal, oil, and gas, have continued to play a pivotal role in the provision of global energy demand albeit its detrimental effects towards the environment. As a global oil and gas producer, the energy sector in Malaysia is heavily dependent on conventional fossil fuel resources, where 88.4% constitutes fossil fuels and can be further broken down to account for 53.3% natural gas, 30.5% coal, 2.8% fuel oil, and 1.8% diesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], while the remaining are contributed by hydropower. In 2016, electricity generated by fossil fuel–based thermal plants remained dominant at 83.2% compared to hydropower at 12.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], thus highlighting its continued dependency as main resource for the energy generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Nevertheless, the current world energy development scene is transitioning into a new period, where low-carbon emission, clean and environmental-friendly characteristics have been prioritized for the generation of energy. Based on the report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the global renewable energy generation capacity amounted to 2,537 GW with 7.4% growth as of 2019, as compared to previous year. Referring to Tock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], selection of appropriate renewable energy in any country depends on three factors, geographical location, climate condition, and availability of renewable resources. Thus, in local context where Malaysia is blessed with tropical and humid climate for agricultural and forest plantation, biomass energy (bioenergy) utilization is a formidable underlying potential that can be capitalized to develop the local renewable energy scene in Malaysia and as an option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 45% of the nation’s GDP by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Unlike fossil fuel, biomass production and utilization are promising due to net carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission, since released CO<sub>2</sub> during power generation will be compensated by the CO<sub>2</sub> consumption in photosynthesis process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Referring to recent assessment done by Stougie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], environmental sustainability of the biomass energy is indeed lower as compared to coal-fired power plant (12 vs. 19 MPt). Herein, bioenergy is a form of renewable energy generated from biomass sources via traditional and modern approaches, where traditional techniques rely on combustion of biomass to generate energy while modern technologies involve liquid biofuel production, biogas generation by anaerobic digestion, or bio-refineries as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Furthermore, production of bioenergy is obtainable in the form of agricultural and wood processing wastes, residues, and forest products such as logging residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As the fourth largest resources around the world, the adaptation of biomass to energy source is prospective as it is distinctively abundant in nature and can be easily generated in non-urban settings in Malaysian context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical roadmap of bioenergy production</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12155_2022_10392_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Thus, the paper outlines current status of bioenergy deployment in Malaysia, specifically biodiesel fuel and valorization of biomass towards the emerging bioethanol and biogas sectors. The paper seeks to compare current local policies (short- and long-term) with respect to the countries with successful bioeconomy frameworks implementation like Finland and Sweden, as well as neighbouring tropical countries with similar aspirations such as Thailand and Indonesia as benchmarking study. Lastly, this review paper explores the trilemma factors with respect to the pillars of sustainability for amelioration of biomass energy implementation and mitigation at the local context setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Malaysian Biomass Energy: Industrial Status and Development</title><p id="Par5">The oil palm industry is a leading contributor of biomass in Malaysia; hence, it has a great prospect to be commercialized for bioenergy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To date, bioenergy particularly palm biodiesel has emerged as a potential sustainable and eco-fuel in Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], due to its resemblance with the conventional diesel with respect to chemical structure and energy content, low sulphur content, non-toxicity, and high biodegradability, as well as good combustion efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, Li and Loo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported that Malaysia is indeed the primary biodiesel producer, aside from the USA, France, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Australia. On top of that, Malaysian palm biodiesel for transportation has been accepted by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) where it can be used up to 20% biodiesel blend. Referring to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), local biodiesel demand increased to 529,000 tonnes in October 2019 and surpasses the initial estimation of 520,000 which is attributed to the enforcement of B10 biodiesel programme in February 2019 for the transportation sector, as well as B7 biodiesel for the industrial sector. In addition, Gan and Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported that the exploitation of palm biodiesel has been projected to reach up to 0.4 million tons by 2035. Considering the various environmental benefits of biodiesel as fuel replacement, Malaysia is currently gearing up towards the implementation of biodiesel B20 for transportation while B10 for the industrial sector. As of in 2017, there are about 17 biodiesel plants in operation with total installed capacity of 2.05 million tonnes of biodiesel per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The chronology of biodiesel industry in Malaysia is as per described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In Malaysia, MPOB is the leading governmental agency that is responsible for the construction of commercial biodiesel plant with capacity of 60,000 tonnes per annum, as well as continuous research and development (R&amp;D) activities towards the development of new technologies for palm biodiesel as well as winter-grade palm biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution of the biodiesel industry in Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Timeline</p></th><th align="left"><p>Milestones</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>1981</p></td><td align="left"><p>Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) started the first biodiesel project (January)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1982</p></td><td align="left"><p>Initiation of laboratory research on palm methyl ester (PME) biodiesel</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1983</p></td><td align="left"><p>Establishment of Palm Diesel steering committee by the Ministry of Primary Industries</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1984</p></td><td align="left"><p>Construction/commencement of the first PME biodiesel plant in collaboration with PETRONAS, with total capacity of 3,000 tonnes per annum</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1984–1985</p></td><td align="left"><p>Preliminary field trial: 8 taxis</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1986–1989</p></td><td align="left"><p>Field trial (phase 1) involving 31 diesel-powered vehicles and stationery engines</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1990</p></td><td align="left"><p>Field trial (phase 2): bench test by Mercedes Benz in Germany</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1990–1994</p></td><td align="left"><p>Field trial (phase 3) involving 36 commercial buses</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1992</p></td><td align="left"><p>R&amp;D on winter grade biodiesel production technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1995</p></td><td align="left"><p>Establishment of palm biodiesel as substitute for diesel, transfer of the PME technology to other industries, i.e. oleo-chemical, carotenes, vitamin E</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>2000–2002</p></td><td align="left"><p>Construction of the first commercial biodiesel power plant by Carotino Sdn.

While biodiesel is used as a substitute for conventional diesel fuel, bioethanol can be used as a replacement for gasoline and fossil petrol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, unlike the biodiesel, bioethanol has not been emphasized in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It has been reported that Malaysia does not have the bioethanol programme due to lacking in domestic feedstock; hence, it is infeasible to implement a renewable programme that heavily relies on imported feedstock, regardless of various benefits of this renewable energy. Comparing with Thailand and Philippines that are the leaders in bioethanol production amongst the Southeast Asia countries, the plantation area of bioethanol feedstock (i.e. cassava, maize, rice, sugarcane, and sweet potato) as well as the corresponding yield is relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported that the slow evolution of bioethanol in Malaysia is attributed to the high cost of sugar-rich substrates (e.g. sugarcane) while production from starchy crops such as sago and sweet sorghum has not been commercialized yet. Due to these limitations, Tye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that the bioethanol industry in Malaysia is new and accordingly has not much experiences. Therefore, instead of being the producer, Malaysia has been projected to be amongst the major importer of bioethanol commodity (11 million litres) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, Szulcyzk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] predicted that the palm oil industry has the potential to produce up to 7.2 billion litres of bioethanol by 2023. Therefore, further studies will be needed as the technology is still in experimental stage and not yet being commercialized. Once this type of bioenergy has been commercialized, it will be feasible for the Malaysian government to establish the bioethanol policy. To start, ethanol blends of less than E15 could be introduced as car manufacturers do not need to modify the gasoline engines, and subsequently to raise the mandates.</p><p id="Par7">In addition, biogas as potential biomass energy is gradually emerging in Malaysia. It has been reported that the potential of biogas industry can reach to RM 8.3 billion (USD 2.3 billion) by year 2022, possibly contributed by different biomass sources including agricultural waste, crop residue, animal manure, domestic and household waste, amongst others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, the installation of biogas plants in Malaysia is rather slow as compared to solar photovoltaic (PV) as well as mini hydro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Based on the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) statistics, the cumulative installed capacity of commissioned biogas plants in Malaysia from year 2012–2019 is about 102.77 MW: equivalent to 16% of the total renewable energy in Malaysia. The biogas production is harvested through two methods — landfill gas and anaerobic digestion (palm oil mill effluent (POME)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In context of landfill gas, this approach that is most commonly used for the biogas production is promising due to high availability of municipal solid waste in Malaysia, which is often dumped in non-sanitary landfills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. At present, the solid waste in Malaysia has been estimated to be around 33,130 tonnes per day and increased to 49,670 tonnes per day by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Meanwhile, the second technique that uses the POME for biogas production is attributed to its abundance at the oil palm mills. In addition, POME characteristics that are not in accordance to the Department of Environment make it susceptible for biogas production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Basically, 1 tonne of POME is capable to generates 28 m<sup>3</sup> of biogas; and 2.4 tonnes per annum of methane gas produced is equivalent to 3.4 million litres of diesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. With this respect, the biogas trapping from POME feedstock is significant, as supported by the National Key Economic Area (NKEA)—Entry Point Project 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Under this programme, MPOB has been appointed as the implementing agency while the progress is regularly monitored by the MPOB NKEA Biogas Working Group, and to be reported to the NKEA Palm Oil and Rubber Steering Committee led by the Minister of Plantation Industries and Commodities.

These challenges can be grouped into several categories, including technical, financial/economic, social, environmental impact, sustainability, and lacking in institutional/organizational issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Basically, slow evolution of biomass energy in Malaysia can be attributed to the technical challenges incorporating the technological barrier as well as unavailability in technical experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Due to an absence in local advanced technologies, most of the technologies have been imported from the foreign countries, as such this implies high production and maintenance cost. For instance, it has been reported that the technologies for biogas production in Malaysia through the anaerobic digestion technique have been imported from the Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Moreover, lacking in the scientific and technical local expertise particularly related to technology design and construction, as well as operation and maintenance of the biomass power plants explains the low penetration of biomass energy in Malaysia. Here, limitation in local expertise is plausibly due to the lack of technical courses on bioenergy in the higher institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. It is therefore imperative for the collaborative work between the Government and educational institutions to provide skill and workforce training as well as knowledge inputs to skilled personnel and human resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Besides, joint development opportunities between the countries are a good way for sharing the expertise and towards the development of bioenergy technologies, accordingly, can transform Malaysia as a bio-economy hub in the Southeast Asia region. Another technical barrier that is faced in the bioenergy deployment in Malaysia is interrelated to infrastructural barriers. Ideally, distance between the renewable energy plant and the interconnection point of the distribution system needs to be within 10 km distance to prevent the power loss. Nevertheless, in case of East Malaysia, the palm mills that are usually scattered in remote and sub-urban locations, and located more than 10-km distance from the grid connection points make the whole framework infeasible, since it imparts an extremely high capital investment and caused reluctance in venturing into the biomass energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The financial (or economic) barrier is amongst the common challenge faced in fostering the biomass energy in Malaysia. Basically, the economic barrier includes several criteria including the high capital expenditure, lack of experience/trust amongst financiers and/or investors, absence in the appropriate financing scheme, and competition from fossil fuel, as well as fewer subsidies as compared to the conventional fuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. From the Malaysian government and industry perspective, the high capital investment needed has been perceived as the greatest weakness for biomass utilization to energy production, with priority factor of 0.442 and 0.349 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. Previously, Aghamohammadi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>] reported that the capital cost needed for setting up a biogas plant in Malaysia can reach up to RM 10 million, which causes burdens to the developers due to long payback period. Herein, such huge investment can be caused by the replacement of the conventional boilers to grid-connected high-pressure boilers, and dependency on the imported equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Giulioano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] further added that the investment cost that can escalate up to 30% can be also attributed by the change in plants’ location, licensing-related costs, and/or modification of the plant design. Based on recent survey, 100% of the respondents in Sarawak agreed that high capital investment is indeed the main barrier for their active participation in biomass energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. In addition, due to the high capital cost borne by developers, it is more likely that the cost will be transferred to customers, which consequentially results in an unattractiveness of this biomass energy. This is supported by Ratnasingam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] who reported that cost of producing 1 kWh of electricity from the biomass is comparatively higher than the fossil fuel.</p><p id="Par34">In terms of financial assistance, the support can be from commercial bank, Developmental Financing Institution, capital market, angel investor, and venture capital firms, as well as technology manufacturers and suppliers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. However, since the biomass energy industry is still low in Malaysia as compared to solar PV system, it is challenging to secure the potential investors for the biomass energy deployment. It has been reported that the potential investors favour a short payback period of around 2–4 years, which may not be applicable for the bioenergy plant that has higher capital cost ($1,000/kW) compared to gas/coal power plants ($700/kW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. In addition, these financing challenges arose due to incompetency of financial institutions to evaluate loans for this business venture, apart from the limited success story of biomass energy industry to be relied upon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Amran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>] previously reported that the lacking in human resources with technical background in green technology projects in the financial institutions has caused them to refer to external consultants for that matter. However, these consultants sometimes do not provide the bank with reliable information, thus caused difficulties to the bank institutions. On the other hand, the financial aids are applicable for the solar PV system that has already reached the maturity stage in Malaysia thus far, where the involved banks include CIMB Sdn. Bhd. (SME Renewable Energy Financing), Alliance Bank Sdn. Bhd. (Alliance Bank Solar Financing Scheme), and United Overseas Bank (M) Sdn. Bhd. (U Solar Program), amongst others. Hence, it can be concluded that in ensuring the bankability, the developed renewable energy technologies should be proven, has high reliability, and scalable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Not only that, it is reckoned that the competition with the conventional fuel also contributes to slow progress in this biomass energy. Ratnasingam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>] further specified that the subsidy allocation to the fossil fuel–based energy in order to keep the price low will limit the future demand of the biomass energy. Therefore, to foster further investment in the biomass energy, provision of subsidies and incentives for the use of biomass for power generation is highly preferable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Referring to Szulczyk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>], the minor government subsidy will escalate the bio-generated electricity to 36.5% by 2030, which is 16% higher as compared to bioelectricity supply in year 2016.</p><p id="Par35">In context of social issues, the challenges for the biomass energy implementation are related to the market (or consumer) acceptance and community acceptance, as well as socio-political acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. In context of consumer acceptance, the recent survey on the acceptance towards B7 biodiesel implementation in Malaysia indicates that most of the respondents in Central region of Peninsular Malaysia are aware or have heard about the biodiesel, and agreed that the biodiesel is a renewable energy; nevertheless, only few of them know about the current B7 national programme and technical know-how of the biodiesel, as well as reluctance to pay more for the biofuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Accordingly, low support of the biomass energy is plausibly due to limited knowledge on the biofuel’s operation as well as the lacking in awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. Therefore, this should be addressed to ensure the successfulness of biomass energy deployment and to secure future demand. With this respects, Chin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>] proposed that media plays a significant role in influencing the public acceptance. In a separate survey by Zakaria et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>], 93% of the respondents agreed that social media is the best platform to nurture the public awareness on the renewable energy, followed by education/school subject (69.8%), campaign (66.2%), and mobile apps (50%). Thereby, an establishment of website/portal can be a kick-start in cultivating the public awareness, where the proposed contents should include the following: example of the successful biomass energy projects, update and monitoring of the biomass energy development, as well as contact information and support services. Referring to Giuliano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>], some strategies that can be adopted to encourage the social acceptance towards the biomass energy include the involvement of citizens in whole stages of biomass power plants, and providing free seminars and workshop for different level of stakeholders. Besides, market acceptance should be taken into consideration as well, since the cancellation of Envo Diesel programme in Malaysia is primarily due to strong opposition from diesel engine manufacturers, despite its lower cost. Basically, the engine manufacturers claim that the palm-olein biodiesel causes clogging to engine, filter plugging, and corrosion, as well as material incompatibility; hence, they refuse to extend the warranty to vehicles that use the Envo Diesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Accordingly, acceptance and support from the various stakeholders is crucial in fostering the bioenergy deployment in Malaysia.</p><p id="Par36">Though the biomass energy has been perceived as a renewable and clean energy, there are also several environmental challenges included. Recently, Ghani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>] reported that the ambitious Malaysian plan for the bioenergy deployment implies higher land conversion for such purposes, which affects the domestic food security and oleo-chemical sectors. Hassan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] mentioned that the oil palm plantation has increased by 12% within a decade, from year 2005 to 2015. Furthermore, the conversion of rainforest to agricultural plantation causes an alteration in carbon storage, as the pristine rainforest can store more carbon per hectare as compared to the agricultural plantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. Specifically, it has been reported that the rainforest is capable to store up to 9.4 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per hectare per year, whereas oil palm plantation can store CO<sub>2</sub> of only 4.0 tonnes per hectare per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. In context of Malaysia, expansion of the oil palm plantation particularly for the industrial biofuel (i.e. biodiesel) production that is mainly through deforestation and peatland conversion has caused a significant emission of GHGs to the atmosphere, including CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrous oxides (N<sub>2</sub>O) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Referring to the recent work by Kusin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>], large-scale converted land use produces about 6.47–7.78 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N/ha, whereas small-scale converted land use and logged-over forest into the oil palm plantation produce 6.49–7.85 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N/ha and 6.58–7.75 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N/ha, respectively. Basically, N<sub>2</sub>O emission is mostly contributed by the use of fertilizer for the plant’s growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>], which contributes to acid rain as well as the eutrophication problems that lead to depletion of oxygen in both lakes and rivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. In terms of application, it is reported that the biodiesel blend will emit more nitrogen oxides compared to conventional diesel, due to presence of high oxygen contents that favour the combustion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. Further, since Malaysia has been perceived to have the highest deforestation rate in the world with estimated loss of 14.4% of total forest vegetation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>], the biodiversity of ecosystem has been greatly endangered. Referring to Lim and Teong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], extinction of Orang Utan has been frequently highlighted by the environmentalists (The Orangutan Project). Due to these environmental drawbacks of deforestation activities, non-governmental organizations have addressed the need to enhance the biofuel yield in smallholder production, instead of expansion of the oil palm plantation area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. Even so, sustainable practices as well as check and balance between the bioenergy production as well as the resources consumption are advocated to reduce the environmental threats. Moreover, the bioenergy production that requires a copious amount of water for the feedstock production and fuel refining is one of the barriers for the bioenergy deployment, given some regions in the country suffer from water scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. In fact, Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>] reported that the environmental consequences caused by the bioenergy production are closely related to the water resources and pollution (16%), followed by the greenhouse gas emission (6%) and biodiversity and soil organic carbon (5%), as well as soil erosion issues (0.8%). The food-water-energy nexus continues to play a significant role in ensuring the successfulness of bioenergy programme in Malaysia. Accordingly, a life cycle analysis (LCA) is a practical approach to assess the environmental consequences of the biomass energy production.</p><p id="Par37">In terms of the biogas production that is typically being produced via landfilling process, odour pollution problems have become the major barrier, which negatively influences both physical and mental e.g. health conditions and bad experiences. This is verified by the recent survey to local residents in Perlis who located within the vicinity of landfill area, where the findings show that the respondents within 0–2 km radius did experience the health effects as well as disturbance in their daily lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Further, another environmental concern related to the biogas production is related to landfill gas (i.e. methane) diffusion to the atmosphere through the pressure difference, crack, landfill cover, and surrounding topsoils. The emission of these gases then leads to safety risk due to potential explosion risk and to aggravate the global warming problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Accordingly, installation of spatial and a temporal high-resolution monitoring networks is a preferable mitigation route since the emission of the hazardous gases to surroundings is realistically monitored and allows for an early protection and troubleshooting.</p><p id="Par38">The sustainability challenge of the bioenergy industry is mainly related to the feedstock availability for the sufficient supply. In this sense, to ensure sustainable biomass supply for the bioenergy production, high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost biomass needs to be immediately produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Hence, valorization of the various types of biomass materials for the bioenergy production is significant in ensuring the long-term development of the biomass energy sector in Malaysia. Such strategy is significant since an over-dependency on single feedstock may cause feedstock limitation issues, and thus hampers the large-scale bioenergy deployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For instance, the biodiesel production in Malaysia that strongly depends on the palm waste availability has the tendency to increase the market price of crude palm oil, which in turn results in infeasibility of the biomass energy production. In fact, for the bio-refinery plant with a capacity of 0–15,000 tons per day, more than 2,000–5,000 tons biomass daily is required for the process to be economical ($850–875/m<sup>3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. The biomass availability issue is aggravated by the fact that 80% of the mill operators utilize about 40% of the biomass for animal feed, mulching, composting, and soil conditioning purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Moreover, the biomass supply to the bio-refinery plants may be worsen by the logistic barriers related to collection, transportation, and storage of these biomass sources. Referring to Ghani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], the tanker lorries owned by the private mills have low capacity that ranges from 15 to 25 tonnes each. Thus, for the mills that produce about 170 tonnes crude palm oil in a day, lots of tanker lorries and/or multiple trips from mill to the refinery plant will be expected, which is considered impractical. The impracticality here is attributed by two key parameters — transportation cost as well as CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Salleh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>] reported that the standard rate for a lorry to deliver 10 metric tons of biomass is varied: RM 200 for distance less than 30 km, RM 300 for distance in between 300 and 500 km, and RM 500 for distance beyond 500 km. Further, consumption of a gallon diesel fuel for 5.9-mile travel (equivalent to 9.5 km) emits 0.0002 metric tons CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Fadzil et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] thus recommended that a careful planning by the stakeholders is crucial in ensuring the sufficiency of these biomass supplies to all the large-scale plants. Furthermore, implementation of an on-site generation is worthy to reduce the logistic barrier as well as reduction in biomass mobilization costs, as has been done in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Based in “<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Biomass Energy–Related Environmental Policy</xref>”, all the countries have made excellent progress in the establishment of bioenergy-related policies and frameworks. However, regardless of having several key policies in place, progresses and developments in production of bioenergy are still hindered especially in the Southeast countries, including Malaysia. Therefore, in this context, lacking in the institutional/organization presumably contributes to poor execution of these policies and slow progression of biomass energy in Malaysia. Ideally, governance authorities play a bigger role in overseeing these managements and developments, and to prevent miscommunications between stakeholders, subsequently to drive the transformation towards the biomass energy programmes. Despite having numerous institutional and organizational bodies in bioenergy sector in Malaysia (i.e. government agencies, industry players, non-governmental organizations) including the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Economic Planning Unit, Malaysia Biomass Industry Confederation, etc., the lack of coordination amongst these groups will in turn result in failure of the bioenergy. Thus, to compete with other emerging countries that are increasingly reliant to the renewable bioenergy resources, both Malaysian government and relevant stakeholders should come into an agreement and a strategic planning and to reconsider the biofuel’s role in future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">Due to multiple benefits of bioenergy that are particularly related to the climate change mitigation, improvement in energy security, and rural development, it is undeniable that this biomass energy can boost up Malaysia’s renewable energy sector in the future. Besides, the bioenergy development in the country is supported by the increasing abundance of biomass, particularly oil palm biomass that has the potential to be converted to the alternative and sustainable energy. From the analysis, several insights have been drawn: first, despite government efforts in promoting the bioenergy market and use via policy formulation and incentives, there are still barriers that hinder the market penetration. In addition, compared to other regions, carbon tax and pricings had not gained significant traction in the Asian countries and cause discouragement to industry players in championing the biomass-related renewable energy production. Second, there are also limitation in technology and technical experts, high capital expenditure, limitation in financial assistance, lack of knowledge and awareness of the public, and opposition and reluctance of the market developers, as well as associated environmental challenges due to deforestation and greenhouse gas emission from the manufacturing process. With regard to these challenges, it is anticipated for the Malaysian primary stakeholder in energy-related to find optimal solutions and further strengthen the bioenergy sector. Overall, the review of bioenergy in Malaysia is promising as the database provided i.e. challenges for an effective implementation, can serve as a guideline to the researchers and industry players in going forward and expanding the bioenergy sector further.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia
