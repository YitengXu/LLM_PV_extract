Today, fossil fuel resources are the major energy sources used for generating electricity. These resources include petroleum, natural gas, coal, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which also result in serious environmental pollution and contribute to global warming by releasing the harmful carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In addition, such resources are non-renewable limited energy sources that cannot fulfill the ever increasing demand for energy.</p><p id="Par4">Renewable sources of energy such as biomass, wave energy, wind power, hydroelectricity, and solar power could be alternative sources to replace fossil energy resources. Renewable resources provided for about 18% of global energy consumption in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Wind power is currently widely used in the United States and Europe. It is installed capacity of over 100 GW and growing rate of over the 30% per annum. Photovoltaic industry could produce more than 2000 MW of electricity power in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Because of their reliability and easy access to the energy source, photovoltaic systems have attracted much more attention than other technologies that use renewable energy sources. Advantages of photovoltaic (PV) systems outweigh their drawbacks. Some of these advantages are long life, low maintenance needs, ease of installation and no need for fuel; drawbacks are low output in cloudy days and high costs of initial setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The voltage generated by a PV cell is low (about 0.5 to 0.7 V); thus, it is necessary to connect a series of cells in a PV panel. In addition, the panels can be linked in parallel or in series to produce higher voltage with a greater current with same voltage, or the same current, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Generally, grid connected PV inverters can be divided into two groups: single stage inverters and two stage inverters. Previous studies were mainly centered on single stage inverters, while present and future studies mainly focus on two stage inverters. In two stage inverters, a DC/DC converter connects the PV panel and the DC/AC inverter. The PV panel converts sunlight to DC electricity (for a PV panel with low output voltage, a DC/DC boost converter is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]); DC voltage can then be converted to AC voltage with a power electronics system (inverter).</p><p id="Par5">In either grid-connected or stand-alone applications of such devices, DC voltage can be converted to AC voltage by a DC/AC inverter system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Grid-connected or stand-alone, these devices are used in a wide range of systems today, from streetlights to space vehicles. They are used as an attempt to improve reliability, efficiency and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In the past, galvanic isolation in photovoltaic grid-connected inverters was mainly realized through employing line frequency transformers between the photovoltaic system and the grid. These transformers were not only difficult to install, but also large and heavy. In addition, they increased system complexity and were inefficient due to several power stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To solve the problems of efficiency, cost and size of inverters, transformer-less inverters were introduced. Removing the transformer causes a galvanic connection between the photovoltaic system and the power grid. Thus, the common mode leakage current may follow through the parasitic capacitors between photovoltaic system and ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This leakage current increases system losses and grid current harmonics and leads to serious unsafety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the common mode leakage current must be taken into account in designing transformer-less PV inverters.</p><p id="Par7">The efficiency of a PV system is directly affected by the intensity of sun radiation and ambient temperature. In power applications, the efficiency of a PV systems needs be high if it is to deliver the power to the grid. Therefore, it is necessary to track the maximum power under changing surrounding conditions. In a two-stage inverter, the first stage – DC/DC boost converter –delivers maximum power to the second stage and regulates the DC-link voltage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are various types of controllers, e.g., P&amp;O, Fuzzy, Neural network, sliding mode controller etc., to track the maximum power in the first stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the second stage, the controller system controls power stability and quality. In PV applications, good inverter controllers are essential for enhancing the inverter performance since the conversion process depends on control algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This paper reviews the literature on the design of grid-connected PV systems containing DC/DC boost converters, DC/AC inverters, and controllers used for converters and inverters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Photovoltaic device</title><p id="Par8">Several energy sources are available for energy conversion systems, including batteries, PV devices, fuel cells and wind generators. Each energy source is connected to its inverter through a specific integration technique; sometimes, additional devices and extra steps may also be needed. For instance, a wind turbine generator needs an extra AC/DC converter (e.g. rectifier) to connect to an inverter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], since it generates an AC instead of a DC current. On the contrary, a PV panel creates DC power; thus, it can be linked to the inverter directly or through a DC/DC converter. Favorably, this will decrease the total cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Essentially, a PV cell has a semiconductor P-N junction diode cell that directly transforms light into electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. When sunlight hits common junctions of a p-n diode, comprising of photons, the electron system of the material absorbs the energy and produces electron-hole pairs (charge carriers). These are detached by the potential wall, generating a voltage that uses an external circuit to drive a current through, known as the photovoltaic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Different cell arrangements, such as series-parallel, parallel and series create a PV module that has a specific power capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Likewise, modules are linked in series-parallel arrangement to gain higher power capacity and make a panel or array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The solar cell’s output voltage is a function of the photocurrent that is contingent on the level of solar irradiation throughout the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Shortcomings of a PV device include low energy conversion efficiency and high cost of initial-installation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The control system has an important role in a PV system that uses power converters, such as DC/DC converters and DC/AC inverters to safeguard the system’s overall operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>DC/DC power converter</title><p id="Par11">DC/DC power converters are employed in PV systems to change the output voltage. Normally, a DC/DC converter is sequentially inserted between the load and the PV panel to gain the power available from the panel through tracking methods. It is useful for a PV system with unstable and fluctuating output. If the PV system uses both AC and DC converters, a DC-link capacitor can enhance the DC output voltage stability, and therefore, reduce the effect of fluctuation on the AC output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. DC converters may be boost converters (step-up), buck converters (step-down), or a combination of both, like CUK converters and buck-boost converters. Converter type may be selected based on the desired capacity or size of the output voltage to provide the appropriate input voltage for the inverter with the dc voltage stabilization and regulation capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This is applicable for hybrid energy systems, grid-connected systems and standalone systems. DC/DC converter in such systems works with a maximum power operating algorithm so that the PV system generates more power. The performance of a converter varies based on the specific application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>DC/AC inverter</title><p id="Par12">An inverter is a power electronic converter, which converts DC power to AC power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to generate a sinusoidal AC output with controllable frequency and magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Inverters are classified into two types: a voltage source inverter (VSI) is an inverter which is fed with constant voltage, while a current source inverter (CSI) is fed with constant current. Generally, CSIs are used for applications that need very high power AC motor drives. According to the aims, a single-phase VSI was used in this study.</p><p id="Par13">The single-phase inverter involves power stage of two legs, a DC-link capacitor, and a DC input voltage source (VDC). The DC input voltage source is basically a constant voltage source that can be connected to the DC-link capacitor. DC input voltage level is determined by the inverter’s specifications. For a power system, the dc input voltage level of a single-phase inverter should be greater than the peak voltage of the inverter’s line-to-line AC output voltage. The capacitor’s properties are important when there is a fluctuating input DC power, as is the case for a PV panel, to ensure that the DC-link voltage is kept stable during switching between power devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The DC-link capacitance must be sufficient enough to decrease the DC-link voltage ripple, in order to generate quality output power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Switching devices is an important part of DC/AC conversion. Each leg has two insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) with anti-parallel diodes so that the legs never work simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Switching device is selected based on the specific design of a system, e.g. switching speed and power capacity. Generally, MOSFET is chosen for supplying lower power capacity with fast switching speed, whereas IGBT is used for higher power capacity with medium switching speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design of grid-tied PV inverter</title><p id="Par15">The inverter in the grid-tied PV system acts as an interface between energy sources: the utility grid on one side and the PV module on the other. As the inverter transforms DC power into AC power, it is in control of power quality that should be met as required by different standards. Based on the galvanic isolation between the grid and the PV module, the grid-tied PV inverters are grouped into isolated and non-isolated types. A high frequency transformer or a line frequency transformer can be used to observe the galvanic isolation that adjusts DC voltage of the converter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Usually, this galvanic isolation is realized through a transformer that has a great effect on DC/AC efficiency of grid-connected PV systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In a grid connected PV system, the existence of galvanic isolation depends on the regulations of each country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In countries, such as Italy and UK, it is a requirement and is implemented either by a high-frequency transformer on the DC side or by a low-frequency step-up transformer on the grid side, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Grid-connected PV system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40565_2017_367_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">Due to weight, size and cost problems, line frequency transformers are usually preferred to be removed when designing a new converter. Moreover, a high-frequency transformer requires numerous power stages, which makes it difficult to increase efficiency and reduce the costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">On the other hand, in Spain and Germany galvanic isolation is not used if other technological solutions are employed to separate the electrical grid and the PV array. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a depicts a typical transformer-less PV system, which decreases installation complexity, weight cost and size of the whole system. One drawback of these systems is that DC currents may be produced in the injected AC current by the inverter because of the missing line-frequency transformer, causing overheating and failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Unipolar PWM is the most commonly used modulation in this topology, since it offers several advantages compared to bipolar modulation, such as better efficiency or lower emission of electromagnetic interferences and lower current ripple at high frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nevertheless, a high frequency common mode voltage of amplitude <italic>V</italic><sub>dc</sub>/2 is applied to the photovoltaic panels in unipolar PWM modulation, which produces a non-negligible leakage current due to the parasitic capacitance of photovoltaic panels. Thus, it is not recommended to use this modulation in transformer-less inverters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In the full H-bridge photovoltaic inverter, the Bipolar PWM modulation is used to solve the problem of the leakage current. This eliminates high frequency components of the applied common-mode voltage to the panels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

However, gate signals of bridge transistors need to be synchronized so that peak leakage current is limited.

The inverter transforms the DC power into AC power for grid injection. Control is an important part of the system PV linked to the grid. Two types of controllers are used in these systems: ① MPP controller that mainly extracts the maximum power from the PV module; ② Inverter controller that controls DC-link voltage, active and reactive power fed into the grid, grid synchronization and the injected power.</p><p id="Par32">The control structure has two controllers that work in two cascaded loops: an external voltage loop that regulates the DC-link voltage, and a fast internal current loop that controls the grid current or voltage. The DC-link voltage controller balances the system’s power flow. Typically, the external controller is intended to do optimal control and ensure the stability of systems with slow dynamics. The stability time in this loop should be 5–20 times more than that in the internal current loop. The external and internal loops work separately; therefore, the transfer role of the current control loop is not considered in the design of the voltage controller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].

This is achieved by regulating the operating current and voltage of the converter so that it remains close to MPP all the time. In MPPT, voltage and current of the PV array are detected by voltage and current sensors at a particular sampling cycle, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The values are then entered in a MPPT block that calculates the MPP. The MPP provides the reference values for voltage and current, which are transformed to a power value that should match the calculated value. If there is a difference, the converter’s duty cycle is adjusted. When the reference value and the measured power match, it means that the array is already working at maximum power. The converter is typically based on the standard non-isolated, boost or buck–boost topology. The most important advantage of the MPPT is its ability to find the MPP as fast and efficiently as possible. A number of algorithms can be used for the MPPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], including the incremental conductance, perturb and observe, constant voltage and parasitic capacitance.

It discussed DC/DC boost converters that boost the voltage of the current received from PV panels. It became clear that soft switching converters perform satisfactorily at high frequencies in reducing switching losses, decreasing the inductor and capacitor size, and increasing efficiency. Voltage-source inverters, such as full-bridge inverters and half bridge inverters, and their strengths and weaknesses were also discussed. Transformer-less inverters are used to improve the efficiency, lower the costs, and decrease the size. They were introduced to minimize the leakage current and enhance efficiency. A system was also proposed in this study that aimed to reduce the leakage current. It was able to provide a high quality output current and decrease the THD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Demirbas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Global renewable energy projections</article-title><source>Energy Sources Part B Econ Plan Policy</source><year>2009</year><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>224</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15567240701620499</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>[2]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fulekar</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group><source>Environmental biotechnology</source><year>2010</year><publisher-loc>Boca Raton</publisher-loc><publisher-name>CRC Press</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>[3]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Kamalasadan S, Al-Olimat KS (2013) Modeling and control of a micro-grid set up using photovoltaic arrays.
