Here, we report that animals also make complex, microbe-like polyketides. We show there is a widespread branch of fatty acid synthase- (FAS)-like polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins, which sacoglossan animals use to synthesize complex products. The purified sacogolassan protein EcPKS1 uses only methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate, otherwise unknown in animal lipid metabolism. Sacoglossans are sea slugs, some of which eat algae, digesting the cells but maintaining functional chloroplasts. Here, we provide evidence that polyketides support this unusual photosynthetic partnership. The FAS-like PKS family represents an uncharacterized branch of polyketide and fatty acid metabolism, encoding a large diversity of biomedically relevant animal enzymes and chemicals awaiting discovery. The biochemical characterization of an intact animal polyketide biosynthetic enzyme opens the door to understanding the immense untapped metabolic potential of metazoans.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Complex polyketides are usually produced by microbes, whereas the origin of polyketides found in animals remained unknown.

However, because of these data, it is often claimed that complex natural products such as polyketides must be made by symbiotic bacteria, despite a lack of evidence for most compounds found in nature. Although increasing evidence suggests that animals themselves make some compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the origin of most polyketides in animals remains unknown. This problem makes it difficult to supply useful animal compounds as drugs and severely constrains our understanding of chemical diversity and the scope of biosynthesis in nature.</p><p id="Par4">The sacoglossan polypropionate pyrones are among the most structurally complex polyketides isolated from animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The compounds are representative of a large family of bioactive natural products found in many molluscs around the world, and in all cases the origins of these metabolites are unknown. Sacoglossans consume algae, and some species maintain the stolen algal chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) for weeks or in exceptional cases, for several months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Remarkably, in this symbiosis kleptoplasts are maintained without support from the algal nucleus. Since chloroplasts in plants and algae require many chromosomal genes for their function, this survival has long been a source of mystery and debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Thus, the polypropionates are known to originate in these molluscs and to be central to their biology, yet the biochemical source of the compounds remained unknown.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we demonstrate that animals produce microbe-like complex polyketides. Sacoglossans synthesize polypropionate metabolites using a type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded on their chromosomes. The PKS resembles the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthase (FAS) found in all animals, yet it is specific for methylmalonyl-CoA over the normal preferred substrate of known animal FAS and enzymes, malonyl-CoA. PKS expression is transcriptionally correlated with acquiring and maintaining the chloroplasts needed to perform photosynthesis, reinforcing previous ideas and data that the polypropionates support kleptoplasty. The FAS-like PKSs form a group of enzymes that branch with animal FAS, unlike characterized PKSs from bacteria, fungi, and animals, which form a distinct family separate from the FAS enzymes. These results greatly increase the scope and complexity of polyketide biosynthesis in animals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discovery of polypropionate synthase in sacoglossans</title><p id="Par7">We took an unbiased approach to define the molecular source of polypropionates.

Examining the available <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> transcriptomes, we found a number of fragmented transcripts encoding multiple type I FAS enzymes. Reassembly of those transcripts from raw read data revealed four different FAS-like enzymes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Two of these were the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial FAS enzymes of primary metabolism. The remaining two (EcPKS1 and EcPKS2) formed their own distinct group in a global PKS/FAS tree that included bacterial, fungal, and animal PKS variants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). <italic>EcPKS1, EcPKS2</italic>, and cytoplasmic <italic>FAS</italic> were encoded in the animal genomes, and not in chloroplasts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). <italic>EcPKS1</italic> homologs were only found in <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> and <italic>E. timida</italic>, and not in <italic>E. cornigera</italic>, while the other genes were found in all three.

Because EcPKS1 and EcPKS2 lack functional ER domains, they likely both synthesize polyenes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

In bacteria, amino acid residues responsible for AT selectivity are well understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Since no sequenced animal FASs/PKSs prefer methylmalonyl-CoA, there is no model for AT selectivity in animals. Gratifyingly, EcPKS1, EcPKS2, and several relatives, contained a conserved GHSXGE sequence motif found in bacterial ATs that is known to be important in substrate selection. In bacteria, when in the GHSXGE motif X is methionine, the substrate is methylmalonyl-CoA. In EcPKS1, a GHSMGE sequence was observed, whereas that of EcPKS2 was GHSLGE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Comparing these sequence motifs with characterized systems, this implied that EcPKS1 might use methylmalonyl-CoA, while EcPKS2 should use malonyl-CoA.

To gain further evidence for the presence of the pyrone structure, we hydrogenated the enzymatic reaction mixture containing the polyene pyrones, and then analyzed the hydrogenation reaction products by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS)(Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a–d</xref>). This method was chosen because of its predictive value: hydrogenation of the triene should produce four separable stereoisomers, with predictable fragmentation serving to localize methyl groups. Hydrogenation gave four isomers with nearly identical fragmentation patterns around some of the methyl groups, supporting the structural assignment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Although some animal FAS/PKS enzymes accept methylmalonyl-CoA in vitro, malonyl-CoA is preferred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We sought to determine whether EcPKS1 specifically incorporates methylmalonate, or whether it also uses malonyl-CoA like other enzymes. We incubated EcPKS1 with malonyl-, methylmalonyl-, acetyl-, and propionyl-CoA under various conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a–c</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that EcPKS1 uses only methylmalonyl-CoA, and not other substrates. Further, our data suggest that other CoA esters compete with methylmalonyl-CoA but are not incorporated into any products, indicating stringent selectivity for methylmalonate. <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the source of methyl groups in many branched polyketides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We co-incubated SAM with malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA in the presence of EcPKS1, showing that SAM is not involved in the formation of the polyketide chain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>). Thus, by characterizing EcPKS1 we demonstrate that the clade including animals and fungi can use methylmalonate specifically in lipid biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par13">These data revealed that EcPKS1 is a mollusc polypropionate synthase. In combination with previous experimental evidence, a biosynthetic pathway from CO<sub>2</sub> to complex polyketides can be defined. Symbiotic chloroplasts fix CO<sub>2</sub>, which is then converted into methylmalonyl-CoA. The animal enzyme EcPKS1 synthesizes the tetraene pyrone, which would be converted to tridachiones and related natural products by methylation, photoisomerization, photorearrangement, and oxidation. These later events may be important in managing stresses associated with photosynthetic activity and are strongly supported by previous synthetic chemistry experiments in which the γ-methylated tetraene pyrone is used as starting material to synthesize the natural products (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In these experiments, some steps are known to be UV-catalyzed, while others might still result from rapid thermal rearrangements following photoisomerization.</p><p id="Par14">A remaining mystery involves the in vitro product selectivity observed in our study. The major enzymatic product incorporated six units of methylmalonate, while the minor product incorporated seven. While many mollusc polypropionates contain five or seven equivalents of methylmalonate, none of the reported compounds contains six. Therefore, there is a missing chain length-determining factor. EcPKS1 lacks a thioesterase (TE) domain, which is often important for chain length determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We attempted to use base to improve offloading of the product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, but were unsuccessful, indicating that an as-yet unknown factor governs chain length (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6e</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Overall, the biochemical data demonstrate that the domains of EcPKS1 function similarly to those in PKSs such as fungal lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, but with several aspects not previously found in fungal or animal PKS or FAS enzymes. As found in LNKS, both the starter and extender units are the carboxylated CoA esters. Unlike all known fungal and animal enzymes, the EcPKS1 AT domain specifically selects methylmalonyl-CoA, rather than malonyl-CoA, as the starter/extender. In animal FAS, the starter unit is acetyl-CoA, and although malonyl-CoA is the normal extender, the enzymes are tolerant of different substrates in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. At each step of chain elongation, the ketoreductase (KR) reduces a β-ketoester to a β-hydroxyester. In the first three-to-four iterations, the DH eliminates the hydroxy group to provide the α,β-unsaturated ester. The ER domain is nonfunctional, so that the resulting product is a polyene. In the final two iterations, the KR does not function, leaving the ketones intact. These steps are somewhat similar to what is found in LNKS when expressed without its <italic>trans</italic>-ER partner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, except that SAM is not involved, and methylmalonyl-CoA is the substrate. In addition, EcPKS1 and LNKS are very distantly related in the large PKS/FAS family tree (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">In many PKS and FAS enzymes, including LNKS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, when the enzyme is manipulated a pyrone is often offloaded. This has been speculated to result from a faster kinetic rate for chain extension in comparison to ketoreduction at later steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Once the β,γ-diketoester is formed, it is spontaneously released from the enzyme via pyrone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Here, we observed formation of two different polyketide chain lengths. Chain-length control is complex, as it can be governed by the KS, by chain-release domains, or by diverse factors including auxiliary proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Here, we do not determine how chain length is controlled. Because the animal EcPKS1 is not part of a biosynthetic gene cluster, or a locus of pathway-specific genes, we cannot easily identify other genes involved in biosynthesis. Therefore, additional enzymes may be involved in chain-length determination, or whether the observed chain-length selectivity obtains in vivo as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>EcPKS1 is strongly associated with maintaining photosynthetic chloroplasts</title><p id="Par17">Carefully examining all reports of polypropionates from molluscs, we found that EcPKS1-like products are largely restricted to sacoglossans (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).
