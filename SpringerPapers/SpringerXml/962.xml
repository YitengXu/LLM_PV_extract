microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), were prepared using an acid hydrolysis treatment. These cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were further used as barrier enhancing fillers for polyurethane (PU) blended with 25 wt% of poly(vinylidene dichloride) (PVDC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of types and concentration of CNCs on mechanical, optical and barrier properties of polymer composite films. The feasibility of applying the obtained composite films as an encapsulating material for enhancing the lifetime of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) was also of interest. The acid hydrolysis of the MFC-yielded rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNC<sub>m</sub>) while the acid-hydrolyzed water hyacinth led to a formation of spherical-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNC<sub>w</sub>). Regardless of the types of CNCs, the optical transparency of the composite films was maintained well above 60%. According to results in this study, the most efficient film with the lowest water vapor transmission rate of 0.0517 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> was the PU/PVDC film reinforced with 0.1 wt% of CNC<sub>m</sub>. The encapsulants made from this composite could prolong the lifetime of the DSSC devices for up to 14 days, with the normalized PCE value of 0.78. Overall, this work showed that the considerations of the barrier properties of the polymer encapsulants alone are insufficient to ensure that the system would be effective. An interfacial adhesion between the encapsulants and the electrodes, as well as some side reactions between polymers and chemicals inside the fabricated cell, should also be taken into account.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cellulose nanocrystals</kwd><kwd>Encapsulants</kwd><kwd>Solar cells</kwd><kwd>Water

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">On the basis of the types of photoactive materials and their fabrication technology, photovoltaic cells can be classified into three main categories: the silicon-based technology, the compound semiconductor-based technology (such as CIGS and CdTe), and the new emerging solar cells technology. In the development of the new emerging (or the next generation) solar cells, there is a triangle of research topics to be considered, (1) the enhancement of their performance, (2) the reduction of their production process and material costs and (3) the improvement of their lifetime and durability. At the present time, the best global research cell efficiency values for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and the perovskite solar cells (PSC), certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), of 11.5%, 11.9% and 22.7% were reported, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the issue of lifetime improvements in these new generation solar cells is still a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is related to the moisture and oxidation stability of the materials underneath the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this regard, an encapsulation is one possible approach that can be used to enhance the lifetime of these devices. Generally, encapsulation techniques can be categorized into three main types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (1) the use of the metal/or glass lid technique, (2) thin film encapsulations using hybrid organic/inorganic materials and (3) the use of the polymer barrier film for lamination and encapsulation. The advantages of the last technique include its relatively less expensive processing cost and mechanical flexibility of the encapsulant. At the present time, polymer encapsulants for OPV, such as the Ossila’s product, are known to be commercially available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, it should be noted that this thermosetting polymer is a kind of UV curable epoxy-based resin. This was originally designed and developed for use with the OPV and not for the DSSC. This is an important issue since both the DSSC dye and the electrolyte are susceptible to photocatalytic attack, and so they can be degraded upon an exposure to UV light during the encapsulation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Besides, OTR and WVTR values of many polymer based encapsulants have yet to be further reduced, for the sake of a longer lifetime of the devices. Therefore, the development of high performance encapsulants for various types of solar cells is still interesting and deserves consideration.</p><p id="Par3">In our earlier work, the use of polyurethane (PU)/CNC composite as an encapsulating material for the dye-sensitized solar cell, was explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The PU resin was mixed with a hardener and CNCs derived from bacterial cellulose (B-CNC). The lowest WVTR value of the PU composite (54.2 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) was obtained using 1.5 wt % of the esterified B-CNCs. Even though the above value is still much higher than the ideal WVTR value (&lt; 10<sup>−6</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup>day<sup>−1</sup>) of the encapsulation material required for the new generation solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it was found that the lifetime of the DSSC encapsulated with the PU/B-CNC composite film could be prolonged for more than 4 months (with the normalized power conversion efficiency of 0.8 maintained). This was not the case for the bare DSSC (without encapsulation) which was degraded within a couple of days. Nevertheless, to further improve the barrier properties of this polymer composite, a kind of hydrophobic polymer namely poly(vinylidene dichloride) (PVDC) was used for blending with PU. According to our previous preliminary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], PU/PVDC blends were partially miscible, depending on the blending ratios. A high percentage of visible light transmittance (above 80%) through the blend film could be maintained when the PVDF content was no greater than 25%. The water vapor transmission rate through the blend films also decreased with increasing the PVDC content. Notably, the WVTR value of PVDC is intrinsically low (in the range of 0.9–3.4 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) in comparison with that of other polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in terms of oxygen permeability, the OTR value of PVDC is still considerably high (1.2–2.3 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) for the organic electronic and solar cell applications. To further enhance the barrier properties of the PU/PVDC encapsulating films, specific approaches might be used, for instance coating with a more hydrophobic layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], development of an organic/inorganic multilayered film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and introduction of a tortious pathway within a polymer matrix film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The mixing of barrier enhancing fillers with polymers to generate a tortious pathway is an interesting method. With this approach, the reduction of the OTR and WVTR through polymer films can be expected. For example, our earlier work showed that, by mixing MFC with either EVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or Surlyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], transparent composite films with lower WVTR and OTR values were obtained. Other types of nanomaterials such as clay (MMT), ZnO, and TiO<sub>2</sub> have also been used as fillers to enhance the barrier properties of EVOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], PVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and Surlyn/EVOH blends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. From the above work, WVTR values in the range of 2×10<sup>−3</sup>–3×10<sup>−5</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> were achieved, depending on the type and concentration of the fillers.</p><p id="Par4">In the present work, the use of CNCs as barrier enhancing fillers for the PU/PVDC blend film was studied. Two different sources of cellulosic fibers were used for preparing the CNCs. These are the microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) and the cellulose derived from water hyacinth. It is worth mentioning that the water hyacinth is a kind of floating water weed which interfered with water treatment, irrigation, and water supply. In this regard, rather than utilizing the plant weed as raw material for producing agricultural fertilizers, animal feed, building materials, ethanol and reducing sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it would be interesting and useful if this material can be value added. Even though the preparation, characterization and applications of CNCs from water hyacinth were reported by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], however, to the best of our knowledge, the efficacy of water hyacinth based CNCs, in serving as a barrier enhancing filler, particularly in the PU/PVDC blend, has not been studied and reported. In this regard, owing to their differences in terms of origin and cellulose compositions, it was hypothesized that the geometry and dimensions of the CNCs obtained from water hyacinth and MFC using the acid hydrolysis could be different. This might affect the properties of the polymer composites. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of the types and concentration of CNCs on mechanical, optical, and barrier properties of PU/PVDC blend film. The lifetime of dye sensitized solar cells, encapsulated with the developed PU/PVDC/CNC composite films was also examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><p id="Par5">In this study, a kind of room temperature curable polyurethane (PU) was used for blending with PVDC. The PU resin consists of two main reagents, the acrylic-based polyol, and the isocyanate-based hardener. The acrylic polyol (SETALUX 1184SS-51) was supplied from NUPLEX. It contains 2.0% of OH content with an acid value range between 2.5 and 4.7 mg KOH g<sup>−1</sup>. The hardener used for reacting with the polyol was an aliphatic polyisocyanate (HDI biuret) (Desmodur <sup>®</sup> N75MPA/X from Bayer MaterialScience) with an NCO content of 16.5%. Poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC, R204) was purchased from the Asahi Kasei Chemical Corporation. The microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), available in a form of sludge (10 wt% in water), was purchased from Daicel FineChem Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The water hyacinth plant (<italic>Eichhonia crassipes</italic>) was collected from the Chao Phraya River, Bangkok, Thailand, at Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate of (14.1203336, 100.527595).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of cellulose nanocrystals</title><p id="Par6">200 g of MFC were dispersed in acetone for 6 h, and subsequently dried in an oven at 80 °C until reaching a constant weight. The fibers were then ground with a high speed mixer for 5 min to disintegrate the fibers. Next, 20 g of the pretreated MFC was reacted with 200 ml of the sulfuric acid (64 wt%) at 45 °C for 30 min. After that the acid-treated MFC suspension was diluted with de-ionized water. The treated fibers were isolated from the liquid phase by centrifugation for 30 min. Finally, the products were purified in a dialysis tube. For preparing CNCs from the water hyacinth plant, the collected water hyacinth was washed with tap water for several times. Afterward, the rod (trunk part of the plant) was isolated from the root and leaves, before cutting into small pieces (about 1 inch long). These were further ground into smaller pieces (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), using a high speed mixer for 5 min. The resulting fibers were then washed with methanol before drying in an oven at 80 °C until reaching a constant weight. This cycle was repeated twice to promote more disintegration of the fibers. Next, the fiber was treated with a solution of sodium hydroxide (4 wt%) at 85 °C for 6 min, followed by bleaching with hydrogen peroxide (4 wt% in aqueous). After that, an acid hydrolysis process was carried out as follows. 1 g of the fibers was reacted with 100 ml of the sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solution (50 wt%) at 50 °C, for 30 min. Notably, the above condition was also much milder than what is normally used for preparing reduced sugar from a plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. According to our experience, it was found that if the concentration of the acid was greater than this, no cellulose products were obtained.

Likewise, for preparing the PU/PVDC/CNC composites, a suspension of the acid-hydrolyzed celluloses (2 wt% in THF) was prepared by a solvent exchange process. After that, a given amount of the CNC suspension was added to the solution of the PU/PVDC. The concentration of the CNCs in the polymer composite system varied from 0.05 to 1.0 wt%.

After treating with acid, an intensity of the XRD peak at (2θ) = 22.5° increased, compared to that of (2θ) = 15.6°. This was due to the removal of the amorphous phase of cellulose.

The spectrum of water hyacinth fiber shows the peak at 1724 cm<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to a carboxylic of lignin or hemicellulose. The above result suggested that even after treating it with an alkaline solution, the extracted water hyacinth fibers still contained hemicellulose and lignin phases. The above features were not the case for the commercial grade MFC used in this work. In addition, both the MFC and the water hyacinth show the FTIR absorption peaks at 1623 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1610 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. This could be ascribed to the vibration of C=C and possibly some adsorbed water. The peak at 890 cm<sup>−1</sup> (C–H rocking vibration of the cellulose structure) can also be noted.

The first transition occurred over a temperature range between 75 and 125 °C, and could be ascribed to the dehydration of adsorbed water molecules. After that, the second transition temperature of about 220 °C, attributing to the decomposition of the hemicellulose was found from the water hyacinth fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The decomposition temperature at this transition for the MFC and CNCs was higher (about 260 °C for MFC and CNC<sub>w</sub> and 300 °C for the CNC<sub>m</sub>). These discrepancies show that the untreated water hyacinth fiber contains pectin, lignin and hemicelluloses, which have lower decomposition temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] than the MFC and CNCs. Next, the third transition occurred during a temperature range between 270 °C and 390 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of the cellulose phase. Above 500 °C, the percentage weight of the residue remained in the samples reached a plateau. This represents the carbonaceous materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Notably, the percentage of the residue weight from a TGA thermogram of the water hyacinth fiber was relatively greater than those of the MFC. This implies that the water hyacinth used in this study contained less amount of cellulose than the MFC. According to the literature, cellulose content in water hyacinths is versatile, ranging from 18 to 43% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This might be due to the different origins of the biomass and the growth conditions. Furthermore, the above thermograms also show that the residual weight of the CNC<sub>w</sub> was lower than that of the water hyacinth fibers (before the acid hydrolysis). This was due to the fact that hemicellulose was further removed during the acid treatment. Likewise, the residual weight of the CNC<sub>w</sub> was greater than that of the CNC<sub>m</sub>. Again, this can be ascribed to the different source and composition of the original fibers.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TGA thermograms of the water hyacinth fibers (W fiber), the microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), the water hyacinth-based cellulose nanocrystals (CNC<sub>w</sub>), and the MFC-based cellulose nanocrystals (CNC<sub>m</sub>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows SEM images of the products obtained from the acid hydrolysis of both water hyacinth fibers and MFC.

On the other hand, the acid-hydrolyzed water hyacinth yielded a kind of spherical-shaped CNCs, with the average diameter size of 78.5 nm. It was believed that the different morphologies of the acid-hydrolyzed products were attributed to the different types and compositions of the two fibers. As mentioned above, the results from an XRD analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) indicated that the water hyacinth contained less percentage of crystallinity than the MFC.

In this regard, mechanical properties of the developed composite materials deserve a consideration. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows typical stress–strain curves of the PU/PVDC and the composite films containing different types and concentrations of the CNCs. From the curves, it can be seen that the neat PU/PVDC blend film was considerably strong and tough, taking into account the slope, the ultimate stress and the strain at break of the profiles. After compounding it with CNCs, the stress–strain curves changed significantly. The slope of the curve increased which corresponded to the increase of the tensile modulus of the material. The above improvement was obtained at the expense of percentage elongation of the polymer composites (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These changes were caused by a reinforcing effect of the CNCs. Tensile strength values of the composites did not drop when the CNCs were added. This implies that the interfacial adhesion between the CNCs and polymer matrix was considerable. This could be attributed to the polar interaction between the hydroxyl groups of the CNCs and the urethane groups of the polymer matrix. However, in overall, the tensile toughness of the polymers decreased with the concentration of CNCs. It was also noted that the tensile properties of the composite films reinforced with CNC<sub>w</sub> were comparable to those reinforced with CNC<sub>m</sub> if the concentration of the CNCs was kept below 0.5 wt%. However, as the concentration was further increased, the tensile modulus and tensile toughness of PU/PVDC reinforced with CNC<sub>w</sub> were greater than those of the PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>m</sub> analogue. The discrepancies could be ascribed to the different shapes and dimensions between the two types of the CNCs, leading to different reinforcing efficacies.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Stress–strain curves of PU/PVDC composite films containing different types of CNCs</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Tensile properties of the PU/PVDC/CNC composite films</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>CNC<sub>m</sub> (wt%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>CNC<sub>w</sub></p><p>(wt%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Modulus</p><p>(MPa)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Elongation</p><p>(%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Tensile strength (MPa)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Toughness</p><p>(J)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>164.38 ± 5.90</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>121.14 ± 1.13</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>12.75 ± 0.65</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>1.13 ± 0.07</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>0.005</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>283.06 ± 7.99</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>99.17 ± 6.06</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>11.54 ± 0.37</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.86 ± 0.04</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>0.01</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>332.48 ± 8.80</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>90.54 ± 4.36</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>11.18 ± 0.66</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.80 ± 0.05</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>0.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>345.47 ± 6.30</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>82.27 ± 4.24</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>12.33 ± 0.40</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.77 ± 0.04</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>0.5</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>383.88 ± 7.84</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>21.92 ± 6.20</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>10.48 ± 0.45</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.07 ± 0.03</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1.0</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>387.62 ± 7.93</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>21.85 ± 6.47</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>9.72 ± 0.55</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.06 ± 0.03</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.005</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>204.56 ± 7.67</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>104.35 ± 4.69</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>12.89 ± 0.46</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>1.02 ± 0.07</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.01</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>243.52 ± 5.95</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>84.34 ± 5.50</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>13.49 ± 0.48</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.81 ± 0.06</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.3</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>339.35 ± 5.99</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>84.60 ± 5.24</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>14.30 ± 0.62</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.79 ± 0.05</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.5</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>359.35 ± 5.43</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>65.19 ± 4.52</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>12.62 ± 0.46</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.60 ± 0.04</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.0</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>517.96 ± 5.60</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>43.30 ± 4.49</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>13.96 ± 0.47</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.37 ± 0.04</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par21">Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows SEM images of the composite films containing a low concentration (0.05–0.30 wt%) of the CNCs. Some traces of the CNC<sub>m</sub> embedded in the polymer matrix were noted. In addition, the presence of the de-bonded or pull-out area between the CNC and the polymer matrix could also be observed. This might be due to the different thermal shrinkages between the cellulose and polymer matrix phase, induced by the cryogenic fracturing during the specimen preparation. The above observation was less apparent in the case of PU/PVDC composite films containing the same concentration (0.05–0.30 wt%) of CNC<sub>w</sub>. In this latter case, the presence of water hyacinth based CNCs cannot be clearly seen from the fracture surface of the composites. It was apparent that CNC<sub>w</sub> were more compatible with the polymers matrix than the CNC<sub>m</sub>. At the higher concentration (0.5–1.0 wt%) of the CNCs, it is noteworthy that cross-sectioned surfaces of the composites films were not homogeneous, regardless of the type and concentration of the CNCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Some porous areas containing highly agglomerated particles could be found. These porous areas were also unevenly distributed throughout the polymer matrix phase. A consideration of SEM images of the specimens at the higher magnification (see inset in the Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) revealed that these areas represented the polymer-coated CNCs. Besides, an EDX dot map (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) shows that a distribution of Cl atoms corresponded to the distribution of the porous area, whereas the dot map of the N atoms resembled the dense film area. In other words, the porous area was a PVDC-riched phase, whereas the dense film area was a polyurethane-rich phase. In our opinion, the uneven distribution of particles might possibly be related to the fact that PU and PVDC were not completely miscible. According to the chemical structures, PVDC molecules are more hydrophobic than the PU. This is due to the fact that PU molecules contain urethane linkages and some isocyanate and hydroxy groups at the chain ends. PVDC is known to be partially miscible with PVC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], whereas the PU is incompatible with PVC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Hence, in relation to this study, it was possible that the PU and PVDC were phase separated, and the CNCs might be resided within one phase.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images of PU/PVDC composite films containing different types and concentrations of cellulose nanocrystals; <bold>a</bold> 0.05% CNC<sub>w</sub>, <bold>b</bold> 0.1% CNC<sub>w</sub>, <bold>c</bold> 0.3% CNC<sub>w</sub>, <bold>d</bold> 0.05% CNC<sub>m</sub>, <bold>e</bold> 0.1% CNC<sub>m</sub> and <bold>f</bold> 0.3% CNC<sub>m</sub></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig7_HTML.jpg" id="MO9"/></fig><fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images PU/PVDC film reinforced with <bold>a</bold> 0.5 wt%, <bold>b</bold> 1.0 wt% of CNC<sub>w</sub>, <bold>c</bold> 0.5 wt% and <bold>d</bold> 1.0 wt% of CNCm</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig8_HTML.jpg" id="MO10"/></fig><fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM image, EDX spectra, and X-ray dot map of Cl and O Kα of the PU/PVDC film reinforced with 0.5% of CNC<sub>w</sub></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par22">In terms of barrier properties, the WVTR of the PU/PVDC blend films (without reinforcement) measured in this study was 0.162 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. The value lied between those of the neat PU and PVDC films (0.504 and 0.139 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). After applying CNCs into the blend film, the WVTR value of the polymer composite films changed with the concentration of CNCs in a non-linear fashion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Initially, the WVTR values dropped rapidly when a small amount (0.05–0.1 wt%) of the CNCs was added. This can be explained in light of the tortious model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, the lowest WVTR value of 0.0517 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> was measured from the polymer blend system containing 0.1% of CNC<sub>m</sub>. However, when the concentration of the CNC<sub>m</sub> was further increased above 0.3 wt%, the WVTR values rose again. It is possible that the higher the concentration of CNC<sub>m</sub>, the greater the voids and porous area between the cellulose and polymer matrix phase. The above effect was less pronounced for the CNC<sub>w</sub>-based encapsulation system. In this latter case, the WVTR values initially dropped to the lowest value of 0.1352 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> when 0.1 wt% of the filler was added. When the concentration of CNC<sub>w</sub> was further increased, the WVTR values only gradually increased. This could be ascribed to the different dimensions and percentage of cellulose compositions within the two types of CNCs. Herein, it was found that CNC<sub>w</sub> contained less amount of cellulose content than the CNC<sub>m</sub> analogue. In this regard, it was possible that CNC<sub>w</sub> could adsorb less moisture than the CNC<sub>m</sub> analogue. Besides, since the dimensions of CNC<sub>w</sub> were smaller than the CNC<sub>m</sub>, the increase of the voids between polymer and the cellulose nanocrystals could be less obvious.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and percentage visible light transmittance of PU/PVDC composite films as a function of CNC concentrations</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">Despite the improvement of barrier properties, it was interesting that transparency of the composite films could be maintained with the introduction of CNCs. Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows that by using CNC<sub>w</sub> as a filler, a visible light transmittance of the film in the range of 75–81% was obtained. On the other hand, transmittance in the range of 73–90% could be achieved, only if the concentration of CNC<sub>m</sub> used for mixing with PU/PVDC was kept below 0.5 wt%. If the concentration of CNC<sub>m</sub> was increased above 0.5 wt%, the visible light transmittance dropped significantly. In our opinion, these discrepancies can be attributed to the different geometries and the intrinsic reflective indices between the two types of CNCs. Nevertheless, on the basis of the results from WVTR and visible light transmittance tests, the polymer composite films containing 0.1 wt% of CNC<sub>m</sub> and 0.1 wt% of CNC<sub>w</sub> were selected for further used as encapsulants for the DSSC devices in the next part.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Performance and lifetime of the DSSC encapsulated with PU/PVDC composites</title><p id="Par24">Last but not the least, the performance and lifetime of the DSSC encapsulated with the developed composite films deserve consideration. Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows typical <italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> curves of some representative DSSC devices, with and without encapsulation. From the above curves, the fill factor and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of the various cells were calculated (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). An initial power conversion efficiency of the bare DSSC (without encapsulation) was 2.0%. After encapsulation, the PCE values of the cells in the range of 1.92%–2.04% were obtained. These values are still comparable to that of the bare DSSC cell. This indicated that the presence of encapsulating films did not interfere with the performance of the device. In term of the stability and lifetime of the cells, changes in the normalized PCE values of the various DSSC cells as a function of time, are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. The normalized PCE of the bare DSSC dropped rapidly to 0.5 within 3 days. Moreover, if the neat PVDC (without blending with PU) was used as an encapsulant, the stability of the DSSC was still poor. On the other hand, if the neat PU was used as an encapsulant, the normalized PCE of the cell above 0.86 could be maintained, even after 7 days of storage time. The above discrepancies can be explained in the light of the better interfacial adhesion between the PU and the glass substrate. Due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the PVDC, the interfacial adhesion between the PVDC and the glass substrate was poor (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). In fact, the above statements were in agreement with the results from a cross-cutting test, which indicated that a fraction of the PVDC film remaining on the glass substrate was zero, whereas that of the PU film, undergoing similar test, was 100%. As a result, the poor adhesion between the PVDC film and the glass substrate could lead to some leakage of the liquid electrolyte inside the fabricated cell. The electrolyte leakage was thought to be one of the main factors contributing to the failure of DSSC. This was related to the degradation of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/dye/electrolyte interface as a side effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Changes in the normalized power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs, encapsulated with different types of PU/PVDC/CNC composites, as a function of storage time</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40243_2018_128_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Open circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic>oc), short circuit current (<italic>I</italic>sc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the various DSSC cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Type of encapsulant</p></th><th align="left"><p><italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> (mV)</p></th><th align="left"><p><italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub> (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)</p></th><th align="left"><p>FF (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>PCE (%)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>None</p></td><td align="left"><p>701.46</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.61</p></td><td align="left"><p>68.79</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.003</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>PU</p></td><td align="left"><p>718.38</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.71</p></td><td align="left"><p>68.26</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.096</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>PVDC</p></td><td align="left"><p>689.98</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.63</p></td><td align="left"><p>69.33</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.951</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>PU/PVDC</p></td><td align="left"><p>710.92</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.64</p></td><td align="left"><p>70.55</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.040</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>PU/PVDC,0.1% CNCm</p></td><td align="left"><p>704.98</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.66</p></td><td align="left"><p>62.28</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.920</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>PU/PVDC,0.1% CNCw</p></td><td align="left"><p>692.31</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.62</p></td><td align="left"><p>71.36</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.020</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cross-sectional SEM images of the DSSC cells encapsulated with; <bold>a</bold> PVDC, <bold>b</bold> PU, <bold>c</bold> PU/PVDC, <bold>d</bold> PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>m</sub>.

This was due to the compromise between the barrier and adhesion properties of the system. However, after 14 days, the PCE value of the cell encapsulated with the PU/PVDC film, rapidly dropped to about 0.085% (equivalent to the normalized PCE of 0.53). This change was accompanied by our observation that the area around the holes of the device was discolored (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). Of note, these small holes were premade, by drilling the FTO glass. These were used as the ports for injecting the liquid electrolyte into the cell, prior to completing the fabrication and encapsulation. Moreover, our control experiments, involving an immersion of the free-standing neat PVDC film (without blending) into the liquid electrolyte, revealed that the color of the standalone PVDC film also turned black after 14 days. That was not the case for the neat PU film immersed in the same liquid. In this regard, it was believed that the liquid electrolyte was in direct contact and interacted with the PVDC phase (in the PU/PVDC based encapsulant) at the open area around the holes. Notably, according to the technical data sheet from the supplier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], the electrolyte contains several ingredients including a redox couple (iodide/tri-iodide), lithium salt, pyridine and acetonitrile. In relation to this study, it was possible that the pyridine base acting as a catalyst induced the degradation of the PVDC phase in the encapsulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this regard, some possible degradation mechanisms including the dehydrochlorination and crosslinking led to the discoloration and reduction of mechanical properties of the polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Finally, these factors contributed to the degradation of the optical, mechanical, and barrier properties of the PU/PVDC encapsulant. The above changes account for the eventual reduction of the power conversion efficiency values of the encapsulated solar cells. In terms of the effects of the CNC type, during the first 7 days, it was found that the normalized PCE value of the DSSC encapsulated with PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>m</sub> composites was comparable to those encapsulated with the PU/PVDC (without any reinforcement). However, after 14 days, the normalized PCE values of the latter device system dropped significantly, whereas that of the former device system was more stable. In other words, the degradation of PU/PVDC encapsulating film could be suppressed by adding the CNC<sub>m</sub>. This could be related to the presence of the CNCs in the composite films, capable of retarding the diffusion of liquid electrolyte towards the PVDC phase of the film. Last but not the least, it was observed that the performance of the DSSC encapsulated with the PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>m</sub> was also superior to that of the PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>w</sub> analogue. In our opinion, one possible explanation includes the fact that the water hyacinth is capable of acting as an efficient adsorbant for dyestuff, textile effluent, and heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, it is possible that the CNC<sub>w</sub> reacted with Ru-based N719 dye in the cell. This destroyed the dye composition and interrupted the working mechanism of the dye sensitized solar cell. Apart from that, it might be possible that the above effect was attributed to a relatively low WVTR value of the PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>m</sub> composite film, compared with that of the PU/PVDC/CNC<sub>w</sub> film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photographs of the DSSC devices encapsulated with PU/PVDC film (left) and with the neat PU film (right), after storage for 14 days.

At low concentration of CNCs (0.1–0.3 wt%), the properties of the polymer composite films containing CNCs hydrolyzed from MFC were slightly better than those containing the CNCs prepared from the water hyacinth fibers. However, when the concentration of the CNCs was further increased above 0.3 wt%, the barrier and optical properties of the composite system containing water hyacinth-based CNCs were more superior. The discrepancies were ascribed to the different compositions, geometries and dimensions of the two types of CNCs. In this study, the most efficient film with lowest water vapor transmission rate (0.0517 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) was the PU/PVDC film reinforced with 0.1% of CNC<sub>m</sub>. The optical transparency of the films, described in terms of percentage visible light transmittance values, was maintained well above 75% when the concentration of the CNCs was kept below 0.5 wt%. In general, these PU/PVDC composite films reinforced with CNCs might be used as moisture barrier film for packaging applications. However, for solar cell encapsulation, considerations of the barrier properties of the polymer encapsulants alone are insufficient to ensure that the system will be effective. An interfacial adhesion between the encapsulating film and the electrodes should be controlled and optimized. In addition, the interaction between polymers and chemicals inside the fabricated cell should also be taken into account. In this study, we found that PVDC poorly adhered to the glass substrate, and that could also interact with the chemical ingredient in the liquid electrolyte. This leads to a degradation of the encapsulating materials over time. Nevertheless, in this study, it was found that the PU/PVDC composite film reinforced with 0.1% of CNC<sub>m</sub> could prolong the lifetime of the DSSC device for up to 14 days, with the normalized PCE value of 0.78.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Mr. Alongkorn Nukulpakdi, from the RPSC Chemicals Co.
