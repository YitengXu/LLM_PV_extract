Perovskite solar cells offer a compelling combination of low-cost and high device performance. Here we demonstrate high-performance planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells constructed on highly flexible and ultrathin silver-mesh/conducting polymer substrates. The device performance is comparable to that of their counterparts on rigid glass/indium tin oxide substrates, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 14.0%, while the specific power (the ratio of power to device weight) reaches 1.96 kW kg<sup>−1</sup>, given the fact that the device is constructed on a 57-μm-thick polyethylene terephthalate based substrate. The flexible device also demonstrates excellent robustness against mechanical deformation, retaining &gt;95% of its original efficiency after 5,000 times fully bending. Our results confirmed that perovskite thin films are fully compatible with our flexible substrates, and are thus promising for future applications in flexible and bendable solar cells.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Most efficiency values of flexible devices lag behind those on rigid substrates.

There are two device architectures currently dominating in the field of perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs): mesoporous type and planar heterojunction. Solar cells using a TiO<sub>2</sub> mesoporous layer as a scaffold still lead in terms of efficiency. In addition to using a thick perovskite layer for stronger light absorption, obtaining high-quality TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals and forming high-quality interfacial contacts with the perovskite layer greatly improves device performance by reducing interface recombination. The TiO<sub>2</sub> scaffold layer usually requires high temperature annealing at 450 °C that is commonly used in pero-SCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">As an alternative to the mesoporous pero-SCs, the planar heterojunction design, which features a straightforward fabrication procedure, is also becoming attractive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this device architecture, organic semiconductor hole- and electron-transporting layers, which have also been widely investigated, are proper candidates for high-throughput low temperature manufacturing (&lt;150 °C), opening the possibility of constructing flexible photovoltaic cells on various polymer substrates. Most of the flexible pero-SCs have been reported with PCEs in the range of 6–10% (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). Jung and colleagues have reported a perovskite device on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)/indium-tin-oxide (ITO) based flexible substrates, giving a 12.2% PCE. 50% loss in initial PCE was observed after 1,000 fully bending cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. More recently, Seok and colleagues reported a flexible pero-SCs with a PCE of 14.85% based on the similar substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It is catching up with the state-of-the-art for flexible thin film solar cells, such as CIGS, CdTe and so on<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Still most efficiency values of flexible devices lag behind those of the references on rigid substrates, and the bending durability of PEN/ITO is subpar. The major deficiencies arise from the relatively low conductivity and poor mechanical robustness of the transparent electrode on polymer substrates. Transparent conductive oxide (TCOs) electrodes, such as ITO and Al-doped ZnO usually have sheet resistance ∼10 ohm sq<sup>−1</sup>, increasing series resistance of the photovoltaic cells. Besides, TCOs are normally fragile against repeated bending, which has been recognized as the origin of device degradation/failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Going beyond flexible solar cells, wearable electronics require high durability against bending. It imposes further challenges to build up highly flexible pero-SCs. Until recently, the reported mechanical bending test of pero-SCs ended up with the failure of TCO electrodes, and whether perovskite thin films can endure multiple-times bending still remains unknown. Consequently, TCO-free electrodes or even indium-free electrodes are desirable owing to the poor mechanical robustness of poly-crystalline metal oxide films and the scarcity of indium and so on. Thin film conductors based on carbon materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and metal nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> have been successfully demonstrated in flexible pero-SCs. However, the unsatisfying PCEs still limit their further applications, which is possibly ascribed to the imperfect perovskite film or poor contact between the neighbouring layers including the electrode, interfacial layer and perovskite film. The substrate of the flexible electrode is particularly important as well. Although the planar heterojunction pero-SC can effectively lower the annealing temperature below 150 °C, it is still higher than the glass-transition temperature of typical flexible substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PEN. As a result, it is desirable to develop flexible substrates or technology which are able to stand an annealing temperature of 150 °C. This is also critical for the roll-to-roll manufacturing of high-performance flexible pero-SCs. Therefore, for the flexible pero-SCs, the flexible electrodes and substrates should have sufficient thermal stability, high electrical conductivity and optical transmission, bending durability, facilitating growth of high-quality perovskite crystalline films.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, a flexible PET substrate with embedded Ag-mesh (FEAM) was successfully fabricated via nano-imprinting technique, and used as electrodes in flexible optoelectronic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In combination with high-conductivity transparent conducting polymer (Clevios PH1000), the hybrid electrode with high lateral conductivity can be readily fabricated for wide application in thin film devices. Our previous work shows that this hybrid electrode substrate with thickness of 200 μm exhibits a sheet resistance as low as 3 ohm sq<sup>−1</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>) The promising advantages of this hybrid electrode such as high flexibility and robustness, low sheet resistance and high transmission (78%) strongly suggest its future applications in flexible solar cells.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we integrate FEAM/PH1000 hybrid electrode into perovskite-based photovoltaic cells, and demonstrate an ultrathin flexible device delivering a PCE of 14.0%. This value is the highest among those pero-SCs based on TCO-free pero-SCs, and more importantly the device exhibits superior durability against mechanical bending over 5,000 times with 5-mm curvature and extremely high bending stability through rational device design. To fabricate the FEAM, we adopt low coverage, hexagonal Ag-mesh embedded in the ultrathin (∼57 μm) ultraviolet-resin-coated PET substrate that ensures high optical transmission. The bottom of the ultrathin FEAM substrate is laminated on a 100-μm-thick highly hardened PET protection film for thermal processing. It can be readily peeled off after completing the device, giving the ultrathin flexible pero-SCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The structure and properties of FEAM-based hybrid electrode</title><p id="Par8">Ultrathin FEAMs substrate can be readily scaled up via roll-to-roll nano-imprinting, which makes testing the feasibility of this type of substrate for applications in pero-SCs the main motivation of this work. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows a 15-inch FEAM sheet exhibiting excellent flexibility and high transmission in the visible region. The substrate structure is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. The substrate consists of periodically hexagonal Ag-mesh (diagonal length of 180 μm, width of 3 μm and height of 2 μm) embedded in ultraviolet-resin coated on PET, giving a substrate with total thickness of 57 μm. It is noteworthy that the coverage rate of Ag-mesh is 3.2%, which causes very low optical loss of &lt;4% according to <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>. As the Ag-mesh period is several orders of magnitude larger than the visible wavelength, there is no significant light diffraction and scattering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The hybrid electrode substrate PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 was formed by spin-coating PH1000 onto PET/Ag-mesh substrate, then annealing at 120 °C for 20 min (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The 150-nm-thick PH1000 layer shows smooth and continuous coverage on the PET surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 2.0 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM204">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). According to <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, the resulting hybrid PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 electrode shows a transmission of 82–86% in the visible region, with an excellent sheet resistance of ∼3 ohm sq<sup>−1</sup>, almost one-third lower than that of commercial ITO-glass substrates. It should be noted here that the groove is not completely filled with Ag nanoparticles during the fabrication, resulting in an ∼500-nm-height difference between the Ag-mesh and the substrate surface. However, PH1000 still forms sufficient contact with the Ag-mesh as discussed later.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of the FEAMs substrate and hybrid electrode.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) An image of the large-area FEAMs substrate.

The ∼57-μm-thick hybrid flexible electrode (PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000) and all organic interlayer materials (PEDOT:PSS and PCBM) ensure the ultrathin and flexible properties of pero-SCs. Notably, PH1000 and Ag-mesh in PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 are used as electrode and transporting channel, respectively. PH1000 (∼0.9 S cm<sup>−1</sup>) can efficiently collect charges along both the lateral and vertical direction in less than 100 μm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). The charges were then further gathered by the highly conductive Ag-mesh (&gt;10<sup>4</sup> S cm<sup>−1</sup>). As the periodic Ag-mesh honeycomb has a diagonal of 180 μm, the charge–transport pathway of PH1000 along the lateral direction is within 90 μm to ensure efficient charge extraction to the Ag mesh, and this is consistent with the low sheet resistance of the hybrid electrode.

The PL intensity on PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000/PEDOT:PSS was reduced by one order of magnitude compared with that on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS. It strongly indicates that this PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 hybrid electrode coated with PEDOT:PSS hole-transporting layer can extract charge carrier more efficiently, which is consistent with the less hysteresis of the flexible pero-SCs. The TRPL was measured by monitoring the peak emission at 768 nm as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>.

The fast charge transfer and efficient collection shown in the devices based on PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI<sub>3</sub> may be closely related to the less interfacial barrier and a more efficient charge carrier extraction as discussed above, thus contributing to an enhancement of photovoltaic properties, such as less hysteresis and high FF.</p><p id="Par17">We then further study the effects of the flexible hybrid electrode on the charge carrier recombination and transport characteristics in complete devices by measuring the charge carrier lifetime and charge carrier extraction time via transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) methods, respectively.

When we deposited MAPbI<sub>3−<italic>x</italic></sub>Cl<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> film via the one-step method, which requires thermal annealing for ∼1.5 h, it was found that the long thermal annealing process can dramatically decrease the conductivity of the embedded Ag-mesh and the corresponding device performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM204">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We attribute this to the formation of non-conducting silver halide. Therefore, we used the two-step deposition method to avoid long-time thermal annealing, which results in the reaction between Ag-mesh and perovskite and also balanced the growth of perovskite crystal on the substrate consisting of double components (flat PET and Ag-mesh groove). On the PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 substrates, we found that there was a strong dependence of photovoltaic performance on thermal annealing as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM204">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. When the annealing time was extended from 10 s to 2 min at 130 °C, the PCEs improved from 7.0% to 13.1%. With further thermal annealing up to 8 min, the PCEs dramatically dropped to 6.8%. We then studied the relationship between photovoltaic performance and thermal annealing time, and the composition/morphology evolution of two-step solution-processed MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals on PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 substrate was further investigated by using SEM and X-ray diffraction. Films with different annealing times (10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min and 8 min) were chosen for the X-ray diffraction patterns and SEM images shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, the perovskite film on the PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 substrate, after quick annealing for 10 s, exhibited clear diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 28.5° and 31.9°, and were assigned to the (100), (200) and (210) planes, respectively, characteristic of a cubic perovskite structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. With increasing annealing time, the diffraction peaks remain, which indicates that the major part of the precursors was converted to MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal even after short-time annealing at 130 °C. Nevertheless, residual PbI<sub>2</sub> is present according to the X-ray diffraction pattern, which is favourable for pero-SC via surface passivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM204">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>, the full width at half maximum of the (100) peak reduce gradually from 0.203° to 0.178° when the thermal annealing time increased from 30 s to 8 min. It should be noted that both increased crystallinity and a larger grain size with less grain boundaries are evidenced by narrowed X-ray diffraction peak, which is strongly related to the photovoltaic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

The perovskite film (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) was compact and conformal on top of both the PET and the Ag-mesh after thermal annealing for 10 s. On the edge of the Ag-mesh, we observed relatively high brightness contrast compared with the adjacent area, possibly owing to less conductivity and more accumulation of charges. Precursor conversion is not complete, likely owing to the non-uniform thermal conductivity of the hybrid electrode, considering the higher thermal conductivity of Ag-mesh than those of the polymer and conducting polymer components. With the annealing time increased to 30 s, the appearance of pinholes was observed. Again the change in film morphology, along with improved photovoltaic efficiency, (that is, dramatic <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> enhancement and reduction in series resistance) indicates that the conversion of precursors into perovskite is still favoured. As for the pinholes, we coated a PCBM layer to fully cover the perovskite film surface and thus prevent shunting owing to direct contact between Al cathode and PEDOT:PSS layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Increasing the annealing time to 1 and 2 min, the film morphology was further improved, giving a continuous and homogeneous surface with larger grain size and a compact perovskite film. The optimal morphology of the perovskite film can facilitate the charge carrier transportation and collection, and can further contribute to an improved PCE value. Further increasing the annealing time to 4 and 8 min, however, results in a large number of bright contrast disordered grains, especially around the Ag-mesh, strongly indicating decomposition of the perovskite films owing to overheating. The photovoltaic cells based on these films yielded inferior PCEs below 10%. Compared with the optimized devices, all the three parameters determining PCE, that is, <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>, <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> and FF, decreased.

According to the TPV data, extending the annealing time from 1 to 2 min increased carrier lifetime from 5.3 to 8.2 μs, which can be ascribed to the fewer defects in the perovskite film consistent with the increased crystallinity of perovskite films and larger grain size. With further annealing up to 4 and 8 min, the carrier lifetime dramatically decreased to 3.4 and 1.7 μs, respectively, which, as we discussed in previous section, may result from perovskite decomposition. From TPC measurement, the 2 min annealed device has the fastest charge extraction, which is consistent with continuous and homogeneous film surface, large grain size, high crystallinity and beneficial to the device performance, especially FF and <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>. However, after annealing up to 4 and 8 min, charge carrier extraction times are significantly increased. It could be caused by more defects in the perovskite film, resulting from the decomposition of the perovskite films and reaction between Ag-mesh and perovskite because of overheating. Therefore, the high device performance is likely owing to the high perovskite crystallinity with less defects and well protected Ag-mesh.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Bending and thermal stability test of flexible pero-SCs</title><p id="Par21">From the viewpoint of the utilization of the flexible pero-SCs, the mechanical flexibility and durability under bending stress are of great importance concerning practical applications, such as portable and wearable electronics.

Therefore, our results demonstrated that the high flexibility and durability of pero-SCs on flexible hybrid substrates are ascribed to the combination of embedded Ag-mesh charge transport channel in a PET substrate and high conductivity polymer electrode. The former reserved the characteristic of high mechanical flexibility and durability of PET substrate owing to the low coverage and embedded Ag-mesh. The latter utilized the high flexibility nature of the polymer.

The flexible pero-SC stored in inert atmosphere is relatively stable at room temperature as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>. PCE of 12.2% retains 91.6% of initial value after 500 h storage, which is slightly better than that of the rigid control device (90.5% of initial PCE). At 45 and 70 °C, a similar trend holds as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM204">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>. The efficiency of flexible device decreased by ∼25% (PCE of 9.60%) after 500 h at 45 °C, while the rigid device lost ∼31% (PCE of 9.45%). At 70 °C, both flexible and rigid pero-SCs deteriorated quickly and showed photovoltaic characteristics with ∼23 and 15% of their initial values, respectively, after 97 h. It could be attributed to the intrinsic issues of this device structure, such as the acidic PEDOT:PSS, crystallization of PCBM, as well as the thermal stability of perovskite film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. According to our results, the flexible electrode does not induce noticeable device degradation at the initial stage of 500 h of stability test. Therefore, the PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 hybrid electrode is a promising candidate for large-scale manufacturing of pero-SCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">In summary, ultrathin flexible pero-SCs with planar heterojunction architecture have been successfully constructed on 50-μm-thick PET substrate-based Ag-mesh/PH1000 hybrid electrode. A currently highest PCE (14.0%) of TCO-free flexible pero-SCs has been reported. The keys to achieve highly efficient flexible pero-SCs are the high transmission, low sheet resistance, excellent thermal stability of this hybrid electrode, as well as the well-designed device architecture with aligned work functions of PH1000/PEDOT:PSS efficiently extracting charge carriers, and a perfect perovskite film. The ultrathin flexible pero-SCs exhibit excellent bending durability retaining over 95.4% of its initial PCE value even after 5,000 fully bending cycles. This study opens an effective protocol for fabricating efficient, high specific power and bending durable flexible pero-SCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>FEAM substrate fabrication</title><p id="Par25">The fabrication process of FEAM is described as follows. First, the bottom of PET (thickness of 50 μm) substrate was covered by a highly hardening treatment PET protection film (thickness of 100 μm), which can well prevent distortion of the PET substrate during device fabrication process and be easily peeled from the FEAMs-based device. Second, we design and fabricate a protruding hexagon-patterned nickel (Ni) mould (diagonal length of 90 μm, width of 3 μm and height of 2 μm) through electroforming. Then the Ni mould with an area 500 mm × 630 mm was wrapped around a steel roller with the diameter of 200 mm, forming Ni roller mould. The ultraviolet-resin (thickness of 7 μm)-coated PET (thickness of 50 μm) substrate was transferred at a speed of 10 m min<sup>−1</sup> by roll-to-roll nanoimprinting machine, and imprinted by the Ni roller mould with a pressure of 0.25 g under ultraviolet irradiation. The roll-to-roll ultraviolet nanoimprinting lithography can significantly improve the substrate imprinting efficiency. Third, the imprinted groove was filled with Ag ink containing conductive submicron Ag nanoparticles (viscosity of 500 c.p.s.) and the excess Ag ink was removed by means of scraping. The same process was repeated at least three times for complete filling. Meanwhile, to make the surface clear, the wiping process was performed with ethanol. Subsequently, the substrate underwent sintering at 80 °C for 10 min. Finally, an antistatic protective film was covered on the completed substrate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Flexible pero-SCs fabrication</title><p id="Par26">A 15-inch FEAM substrate containing 100 pieces of modules with a size of 15 mm × 15 mm were cut off and then peeled off the antistatic protective film, on which we fabricated perovskite solar cells, directly. The processing and device geometry are exactly the same as the reference cells made on the ITO-coated glass. The <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM204">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref> showed the fabricated process of flexible pero-SC as the following steps: Step 1, the high conductivity polymer PH1000 (Heraeus, Clevios PH1000, Germany) with the thickness of 150 nm was spin-coated on the surface of FEAM under 800 r.p.m., and then baked at 120 °C for 15 min in ambient air. Step 2, an ∼40-nm-thick buffer layer of PEDOT-4083 (Heraeus, Clevios PVPAI 4083, Germany) was subsequently spin-coated at 2,000 r.p.m. and baked at 120 °C for 20 min in ambient air. Step 3, the substrates were transferred into nitrogen glove box for coating of the perovskite layer. In this study, for perovskite layer, we adopted two-step spin-coating method to make a dense and highly uniform film. The 1 M PbI<sub>2</sub> solution was stirred in <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-Dimethyl formamide solvent at 70 °C for 4 h. The PbI<sub>2</sub> solution was spin-coated on substrates and then dried at 70 °C for 10 min. Step 4 and 5, 50 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I (MAI) in 2-propanol solution was coated on PbI<sub>2</sub> layer and the film was taken out for annealing in ambient air at 130 °C for 1 min 40 s for the champion device. Step 6, for PCBM coating (∼60 nm), a 2 wt% PCBM in chlorobenzene solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer. Step 7, the devices were transferred into a vacuum chamber for 100 nm Al electrode deposition by thermal evaporation at 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup> bar with a shadow mask. The active area was 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Finally, step 8, the highly hardening treatment PET protection film coated on the bottom of FEAM substrate was peeled off. The ultra-thin flexible pero-SCs were obtained.
