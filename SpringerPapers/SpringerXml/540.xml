Fossil fuels should not be used carelessly since they produce greenhouse gases, air pollution, and global warming, which leads to ecological imbalance and health risks. The study aims to discuss the alternative renewable energy source that is necessary to meet the needs of the global energy industry in the future. Both microalgae and macroalgae have great potential for several industrial applications. Algae-based biofuels can surmount the inadequacies presented by conventional fuels, thereby reducing the ‘food versus fuel’ debate. Cultivation of algae can be performed in all three systems; closed, open, and hybrid frameworks from which algal biomass is harvested, treated and converted into the desired biofuels. Among these, closed photobioreactors are considered the most efficient system for the cultivation of algae. Different types of closed systems can be employed for the cultivation of algae such as stirred tank photobioreactor, flat panel photobioreactor, vertical column photobioreactor, bubble column photobioreactor, and horizontal tubular photobioreactor. The type of cultivation system along with various factors, such as light, temperature, nutrients, carbon dioxide, and pH affect the yield of algal biomass and hence the biofuel production. Algae-based biofuels present numerous benefits in terms of economic growth. Developing a biofuel industry based on algal cultivation can provide us with a lot of socio-economic advantages contributing to a publicly maintainable result. This article outlines the third-generation biofuels, how they are cultivated in different systems, different influencing factors, and the technologies for the conversion of biomass. The benefits provided by these new generation biofuels are also discussed. The development of algae-based biofuel would not only change environmental pollution control but also benefit producers' economic and social advancement.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Commonly it is assumed that algae are photosynthetic autotrophs that mostly live in water, evolve oxygen, and are either made up of single cells or live in colonies or filamentous forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Algae are comprised of a large number of photosynthetic living beings that mostly inhabit aquatic surroundings. According to the size and morphological characteristics, algal species are usually classified into macroalgae and microalgae. Macroalgae which are also called seaweeds are made up of a large number of cells and can be seen with a naked eye. As compared to macroalgae, microalgal species can only be visualized with the help of a microscope and are highly important in the field of micro nanomedicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Based on existing pigments, brown algae, blue–green algae, and red algae are the three classes of macroalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although blue–green algae and bacteria share some common structural characteristics, blue–green algae were placed in the algal class because of the presence of chlorophyll and correlated complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One more class of algae comprises the red algae. Species that belong to this class of Rhodophyta are eukaryotes that contain chloroplasts and phycobilins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Brown algae named brown seaweeds are typically large macroalgae and have the comparatively immense ability to convert photons as a result of which biomass can be synthesized much more quickly. Brown algae are given more attention for the development of maintainable biofuels because their efficiency is considerably higher in contrast to that of cyanobacteria or red algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Microalgae have also arisen as a probable feedstock for the production of biofuels because a large number of microalgal strains have the ability of lipid accumulation, with a higher growth rate of biomass and greater photosynthetic production as compared to their counterparts that exist on land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Difficulty to sustain and persistent debilitating of non-sustainable petroleum derivatives gave rise to the significance of inexhaustible fuel sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] a worldwide temperature alteration further amounts to the difficulties previously confronted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These days, to move in the promising direction developed and underdeveloped countries are thinking about environmentally friendly power sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Biofuel is referred to as any fuel that is obtained from biomass that is either a plant, algae, or animal manure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Biofuels are accepted to be the most natural amicable energy source. Biomass got from trees, agro backwoods buildups, marine or land plants, grasses, and harvests is the adaptable and significant sustainable feedstock for the development of biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The utilization of biomass as fuel is one of a handful of genuine systems to decrease the effects that greenhouse gases are causing. Contrasted with petroleum products, biomass ignition fundamentally diminishes CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> outflows and essentially lessens the debris obtained after burning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As the conventional fuel resources are being depleted at a high rate, there is more focus towards the employment of alternative sources.</p><p id="Par6">More than 50 years ago, the concept of employing algae as a source of food, feed, and energy was first proposed. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, when programs were started to manufacture gaseous fuels (hydrogen and methane), the production of methane gas from algae received a significant boost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our knowledge of cultivating algae for fuel has greatly benefited from the researchers' work on open pond algae growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The effects of various nutrient and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were documented, the engineering difficulties of mass-producing algae were addressed, and a strong basis for algae-fuel research was established through the isolation and testing of thousands of distinct species. But in 1995, US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office decided to end the initiative due to budgetary restrictions and low oil prices. Everything has altered in recent years. Concerns about "peak oil", the rising effects of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, the United States' increasing reliance on fuel imports, and the associated hazards to energy security have all contributed to a resurgence in interest in biofuels in general and algae-based biofuels in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Advantages in biotechnology have opened up new possibilities that were not possible during the years of former research, such as the ability to genetically modify algae to produce more oils and convert solar energy more effectively. The United States has seen the majority of activity in algae research and commercial production. Algae biofuels are currently being explored globally in both established and developing countries in Europe, Asia, and other regions. The US-based Algal Biomass Organization serves as the industry's chief spokesperson and a resource for data on the businesses pioneering the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This article outlines the third-generation biofuels, how they are cultivated in different systems, different influencing factors, and the technologies for the conversion of biomass. The benefits provided by these new generation biofuels are also discussed. Given these factors, it is essential to remove the current bottlenecks to use microalgae for commercial purposes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Biofuel generations</title><p id="Par7">The only renewable energy sources that can directly replace fossil fuels for current and future energy shortages are biofuel and biomass. These sources are environmentally favorable and renewable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Generally, there are three generations of biofuels categorized based on their sources. Biofuels which are obtained directly from the food source are termed as first generation biofuels such as those that have been manufactured from the biomass comprising sugar, starch, and vegetable fats and oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The biofuels which fall under the category of the second generation are those that are produced from the plant biomass, which is mostly comprised of lignocellulosic materials, as this builds up most of the economical and ample nonfood compounds accessible from plants. But, in the present situation it is not economical to produce these fuels as there is a large number of mechanical obstacles that need to be avoided before their perspectives can be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Second-generation biofuels, for instance, ethanol and methanol created from woody biomass, are more energy productive and more adaptable concerning their feedstock. The likelihood to utilize cellulosic and heterogeneous biomass recommends lower costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In any case, the ecological effect raised from biofuel combustion extraordinarily affects the carbon cycle (carbon balance), which is connected with the ignition of petroleum derivatives. Furthermore, the weariness of various existing biomass without suitable compensation brought about colossal biomass shortage, arising ecological issues like deforestation and biodiversity loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In an inquiry for feasible and practical options in contrast to non-renewable energy sources, past investigations have detailed the predominant abilities of green algae inferred biomass for the development of a better form: the third-age biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Algal biofuels</title><p id="Par8">Algae-derived biofuels are progressed sustainable fuels obtained from algal feedstock utilizing different conversion systems. This is because of the oil-rich arrangement of this feedstock that can be related to its capacity to plentifully photosynthesize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Lipids, polysaccharides, unsaturated fats, pigmentary compounds, cancer prevention agents, and minerals are among the naturally dynamic mixtures found in algal concentrates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). By way of levels of oils among 20 and 50%, such as <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp., <italic>Tetraselmis</italic> sp.,<italic> Dunaliella</italic> sp.,<italic> Isochrysis</italic> sp.,<italic> Nannochloris</italic> sp., and <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> sp., greater developments are reported. For the manufacture of biofuels, it is essential to produce lipids at high growth rates since high biomass productivity increases yield per harvest volume and high lipid content lowers the cost of extraction per unit product. Therefore, metabolic engineering of microalgae is required to enable the constitutive production of large amounts of lipids without compromising growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, lipids encompass the fatty acids which are essential for certain biofuels production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> represents the lipid content of different algae species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Notwithstanding biofuels, algae have been viewed as expected makers of synthetics that protect against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections and are also used for the production of antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In a few viewpoints, microalgae feedstock is desirable to produce biofuels as microalgae does not need cultivable land and new water for development, they are not eatable hence no impact on food chain, can be developed to a few overlays regardless of occasional circumstances, alleviation of barometrical CO<sub>2</sub> and waste water treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cultivation of algae for biofuel production</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/449_2022_2796_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lipid content and fatty acid content of different algal strains</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Classes</p></th><th align="left"><p>Species</p></th><th align="left"><p>Lipid content (% dry weight)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content (molar percentage)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content (molar percentage)</p></th><th align="left"><p>References</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p><italic>Rhodophyceae</italic></p></td><td align="left"><p><italic>Porphyridium cruentum</italic></p></td><td align="left"><p>10–15</p></td><td align="left"><p>21</p></td><td align="left"><p> &lt; 1</p></td><td align="left"><p>López Alonso et al.

The most efficient method that has been used in past for the production of biobutanol is acetone–butanol ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Because of its extraordinary enactment and benefits, this valuable sustainable biofuel can be used along with the currently available fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Because of the higher productivity rate and the presence of carbohydrates, microalgae are assumed to be the most promising feedstock for biofuel production. A large number of algal carbohydrates can be converted into simpler compounds, called monosaccharides, and then can be utilized in the fuel production process. Nowadays, biobutanol production is carried out by some of the world’s famous producers which include Gevo, Butamax, Green Biologics, and US Technology Corporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The production of butanol under the biological methods is done in the presence of an anaerobic environment and is considered a phase of ABE fermentation. For the very first time in 1862, Louis Pasteur was the first scientist who reported the microbial manufacturing of biobutanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation is a biphasic system in which during the acidogenesis phase, butyric acid and acetic acid are formed. After the production of acids, the re-assimilation of these acids results in the yielding of solvents including ethanol, butanol, and acetone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, this process of butanol production synthesizes the other solvents simultaneously, thus the selectivity rate of our desired product is decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has been described that with the inclusion of enzymes such as cellulases and xylanases, scientists engaged <italic>C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum</italic> to use algal biomass, which was obtained from the wastewater for the production of biobutanol. Green seaweed has also been employed for biobutanol production using the strains of strains <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> and <italic>C. beijerinckii</italic> along with the metabolization of xylose and glucose. Macroalgae obtained from a marine ecosystem have also been shown to be a promising candidate for butanol production such as Ceylon moss, a marine macroalgae feedstock was used and Clostridial strains were employed for the extraction of biobutanol from it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Biodiesel</title><p id="Par11">Biodiesel refers to the biofuel which is comprised of mono-alkyl esters. These esters are obtained from organic oils, algae, plants, or animals by the method of transesterification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The process of transesterification is an equilibrium method that employs the presence of a catalyst and processes the algae oil into biodiesel in the presence of potassium hydroxide-like alkali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. To produce the algae-derived biodiesel, a huge amount of algal biomass is required. Algae that are typically employed in biodiesel production are unicellular ones that are mostly found in the aquatic environment. These algal strains are usually characterized as eukaryotes that have immense potential to photosynthesize and have higher rates of growth and greater density of population. In the presence of optimal conditions, even in less than 24 h, a green alga has the potential of doubling its biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For effective production of biodiesel, the algal strains need to be effectively cultivated and then the biomass is harvested from the reactor. The most important methods that are currently under use for microalgal harvesting include sedimentation, flocculation, filtration, electrophoresis, and centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. After harvesting, normally the dry weight of the biomass needs to be increased but if the aim is to develop the production system for biodiesel or biogas, then the necessitation of this step can be removed as the production of biodiesel and biogas can accept the moisture content of high amount and we can easily proceed the process directly after the wet extraction of lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The US Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program concentrated on the production of biodiesel from microalgae and provided the final report according to which, it was suggested that biodiesel could be the only feasible approach to provide us with sufficient fuel to substitute for the existing world utilization of biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It has been estimated that if we use biodiesel which is obtained from algae as a substitute for the 1.1bn tons of conventional diesel which is globally produced per year then it would require only 57.3 million hectares of land, which would be immensely promising in contrast to other biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Although biodiesel has great potential, it cannot easily compete with other petroleum fuels due to certain limitations. Its high cost and the requirement for a huge supply of organic oils is a big hurdle in the competition. It has been predicted that when the cost of petroleum fuels will become high and when the supplies will diminish gradually, only then, the alternative biofuels will become more approachable to investors and purchasers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For biodiesel to turn out to be the substitute fuel of choice, it necessitates a vast amount of inexpensive biomass. Utilizing novel and advanced cultivation methods, algae might permit the production of biodiesel to accomplish the rate and scale of manufacture required to race with, or even substitute, petroleum fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Biohydrogen</title><p id="Par13">A diverse range of biochemical reactions derived from the microbes leads to the production of biohydrogen as a by-product. Biohydrogen exhibits a regular and short-lived nature. Biohydrogen can be referred to as the production of hydrogen by two mechanisms; thermochemical treatment or employing biological methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Biohydrogen is considered one of the most capable sustainable energy sources and can decrease the pressure which is being caused by a very limited supply of other resources. Moreover, it promotes the usage of the environmentally approachable technique. Biophotolysis of water, photo fermentation by photosynthetic bacteria, and anaerobic fermentation of biomass are some of the methods for producing biohydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A promising method of biohydrogen production is the biophotolysis of water using microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Another method of developing sustainable fuel production is the anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrate-rich biomass. Carbohydrates are efficient compounds where monomers are obtained and are employed in biohydrogen production. One such example of a monosaccharide is mannitol which is the probable substrate to produce biohydrogen using macroalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Macroalgae is considered the most significant feed of biomass for biohydrogen production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The process of direct photolysis has only been described in the microalgae species. This method employs the ability of green algae or cyanobacteria to photosynthesize. The process follows by the absorption of light leading to the splitting of water. The resulting electrons are then get transferred to enzymes such as nitrogenase or hydrogenase which will lead to the production of biohydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Indirect photolysis is a two-step method. In the initial step, highly photosynthetic biomass is prepared and in the next step, the process is followed by the anaerobic dark fermentation for the production of hydrogen. The step during which hydrogen is released is highly sensitive to oxygen. This is the reason the evolution steps of oxygen and hydrogen need to be separated in minimum time. Multiple models have been established for the process of indirect photolysis to be carried out. Most of these systems use algae and aim to use their capacity to photoautotrophically produce a huge amount of biomass per surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">As monomers are greatly employed in biohydrogen production, so the conversion of polymeric carbohydrates into monomers is considered a limiting step of the production process. To enhance hydrogen production using algae, a diverse range of pretreatments are employed to carry out the de-polymerization of polymeric sugars. The process of dark fermentation results in the negative net energy balance of differences between the energy which is evolved as hydrogen and the one that is used to produce biohydrogen. To make this whole procedure an economical one, the process of algal dark fermentation must be incorporated with a biorefinery method, where the outlets are commercialized into valuable biomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">As it is known that the activity of hydrogenase is strongly inhibited by the presence of oxygen, researchers have utilized several methods to avoid this inhibition by avoiding the evolution of oxygen in the photosystem. One such method is to regulate the oxygen release by the usage of butyric acids and acetic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Another limitation in commercializing the practical process is the higher costs of PBRs and the photon conversion efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">A more theoretical method needs to be developed to overcome the challenges that oxygen sensitivity is causing to encourage the studies and research on functional systems based on algae for producing biohydrogen. To improve hydrogen production, novel techniques must be introduced for the separation of oxygen from other biochemical reactions. It has been suggested that using the genetic engineering approach, such algal strains can be developed that can withstand and easily tolerate oxygen. The forthcoming role of biohydrogen as an unpolluted energy source for fuel cells manufacturing approximately zero emanations, and as a transitional energy carrier for storing and transporting sustainable energy, is progressively renowned globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Bioethanol</title><p id="Par18">In the present world, huge attention is being given to bioethanol due to its ecological advantages. Bioethanol can be obtained by all three generations of feedstocks including plants, lignocellulosic, and algal biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. To make bioethanol using algal biomass, the cultivated algae are harvested and then dried to remove nearly 50 percent of the moisture so that a solid material can be obtained and handled with ease. For this purpose, the harvested biomass of algae is made to undergo an appropriate process of dehydration to reduce the quantity of water before the oil is extracted. The moisture content is normally removed by a feasible drying procedure. Algal biomass can be dried by various approaches such as freeze drying, sun drying, or spring drying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The process which is typically employed for the production of bioethanol from the algal biomass is fermentation. This process is used for the conversion of starch, sugars, or cellulose existing in algal biomass into bioethanol. This process is carried out by crushing biomass followed by the transformation of starch into sugars. Water and yeast are then mixed with it in the bioreactors which are called fermenters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Yeast is used because it is involved in the breaking of sugar and transformation into bioethanol. Distillation is then carried out as a cleansing method for the removal of water and other contaminants in the thinned alcohol leading to the production of concentrated ethanol. The desired concentrated bioethanol is drained and converted into fluid form. This bioethanol is used for the supplementation or substitution of fuel in cars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The production of bioethanol using microalgae can be used to surmount those environmental issues problems where producing bioethanol from conventional feedstock is found to be emitting more greenhouse gases than fossil fuels as a consequence of the feedstock manufacture and applications throughout the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Algal cultivation techniques</title><p id="Par19">In addition to nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, zinc, and calcium, algal cultivation necessitates water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to yield biomass through photosynthesis, by the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy stored in the microalgal cells. Four major types of algal cultivation methods have been recognized based on certain conditions required for growth. These cultivation techniques are photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, photoheterotrophic, and mixotrophic cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Under the mixotrophic mode of cultivation, microalgae can drive both photoautotrophy and heterotrophy and can exploit equally the inorganic and organic sources of carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Under photoautotrophic mode, chemical energy is made by the process of photosynthesis, during which processed microalgae exploit light as the energy source and inorganic carbon as the carbon source. A CO<sub>2</sub>-rich environment could enhance biomass productivity to a certain extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Photoheterotrophic cultivation which is also called photo-metabolism besides photo-assimilation is the mode of cultivation that requires light and this light is needed to utilize the organic compounds as a source of carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Heterotrophic cultivation exploits organic carbon materials as a source of energy and carbon to promote algal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Among the above-mentioned approaches, photoautotrophic production is most extensively used because it is appropriate for large-scale algal biomass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The cultivation systems for algal production consist of three simple choices—open, closed, and hybrid systems. While the open systems are cost-effective and the closed systems are more efficient in nutrient removal, the hybrid systems are a culmination of open and closed systems specifically meant for high productivity in terms of biomass generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Open pond systems</title><p id="Par21">Around the globe, open pond systems with the usual depth of 1530 cm, are commonly used to cultivate algae. Carbon dioxide which is readily present in the atmosphere can be alleviated by algae. The most generally practiced schemes for research and industrialized algal cultivation include the raceway pond, the closed pond, the shallow big pond, and the circular pond tank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The cultures that are developed in open ponds can stand protection from adversarial ecological circumstances (rainfall, temperature, and luminosity) by the usage of a greenhouse. Microalgae that cultivate in adverse conditions, such as a basic medium or highly saline one, should be approved in command to attain axenic cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Open ponds built in a wastewater treatment plant can be circular or driven by gravity flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The location of a pond is the most basic criterion for open systems. The location should be chosen based on maximum sunlight provision and the availability of all the requirements needed by the algal strains. The stirring unit is mostly absent in these kinds of systems as a result of which there is poor mixing but overall, these culture systems allow the culture process to be handled and monitored most simply and economically. The natural pond is typically not as much of a half meter deep as a consequence of which light breaches the water and a large number of algal cells can absorb it. An earlier report suggested that plastic films can also be exploited by layering them over the water surface for improved temperature control. Several algal strains, mostly for example <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic>, can be cultivated in these types of open systems for profitable motives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. An elongated spinning arm is set in the center of the pond which actions like a clock dial and executes a function of a paddlewheel which is conversant in the structure to that of a raceway pond. Mixing of algae cells and culture media is extra effective as compared to an unstirred pool, but as the algae get exposed to the environment, the contamination becomes unavoidable. As per the research literature, the efficiencies in circular ponds range between 8.5 and 21 g/(m<sup>2</sup> d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The raceway ponds for algal cultivation have been used since the 1950s.

They are normally constructed utilizing a concrete solid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Raceway ponds offer a continuous supply of nutrients and carbon dioxide along with the recirculation of algal culture. They are armed with a paddle wheel to be responsible for mild mixing to inhibit sedimentation. An aerator can be utilized for the intensification of air flow rate and hence carbon dioxide utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A sustainable process involves using wastewater for algal production, which would provide the combined advantages of bioremediation of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen along with the production of biofuels. Considering brackish water, wastewater, and marine waters as a growth medium for algae can help to overcome important ecological challenges, but it will necessitate substantial research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The productivity of algae in large-scale ponds is firmly governed by pH and dissolved oxygen concentration. Principle component analysis is a powerful instrument to perceive the restricted reduction in productivity made by unsuitable processing of the cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. To become a feasible option for scaling the production of algal biomass, open systems have to become cheaper to build and operate while sustaining robust and productive growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The efficiency of open ponds is questionable, even though their construction and operation costs are modest. An open system is difficult to monitor as there is a higher need for land, and there is a higher risk of contamination, as well as constraints due to weather and light intensity. The main drawbacks of an open-air system are its sensitivity to weather, season, and time of day. Some drawbacks of open pond systems prevent their use such as the inability to provide us with monocultures because several native algae and algae graze contribute to contamination. Pond temperature is not usually under control and the intensity of light is reliant on arriving solar insolation. Hence, the effectiveness of the open ponds is reliant on the native daytime deviations in temperature and solar insolation. While the cooling generated from the evaporative process somewhat controls the temperatures of open ponds, it as well points to a substantial loss of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Photobioreactors</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Horizontal tubular photobioreactor</title><p id="Par26">At the commercial level, algal growth is widely done using horizontal tubular photobioreactors (HTB). This kind of bioreactor consists of a long arrangement of tubes that can be made of either transparent silicone, glass, or plastic material. These tubes are placed horizontally, and their diameter is kept small so that the area for the penetration of light is enhanced. This large area for illumination makes the tubular photobioreactor a good choice for the cultivation of algae. The circulation of algal cells in tubular PBR can be done by airlift technology quantum fracturing or using a centrifugal pump. Contemporary methods have been discovered in scheming tubular PBRs to guarantee a thin layer of culture suspension that is free from contamination along with extraordinary exposure to light and decreased energy requirement. However, the rise in the diameter of the tube can lead to a decreased surface-area-to-volume ratio hence less illumination. The increased diameter of the tube can also lead to the unequal distribution of solar energy to algal cells present at different levels in the tube. The longer tubes can cause the accumulation of oxygen which plays an inhibitory role in the photosynthesis of algal strains. These difficulties can limit the scale-up of the tubular photobioreactor. Another limitation of tubular photobioreactor is that temperature control in tubular PBR is not an easy task. Although, thermostats and cooling tubes can be used they are quite expensive to install. HTB can be scaled up by placing the tubes either above one another or using the coiled tubes. The rise of pH of the cultures in these kinds of bioreactors requires recurrent carbonation as a result of which the cost of algal production would be increased. It also requires a large land area to be operational as compared to the vertical ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Recently a new HTB which is named ‘Biocoil’ has been designed in the UK. The material that is exploited for its manufacturing is Teflon or low-density polyethylene and tested effectively at an experimental scale (2000 L) for growing several strains of algae. The poor gas exchange and the large gas gradient along the tubes, which is brought on by the majority of the gas exchange taking place in a separate chamber, are drawbacks of employing these types of reactors. High energy input and occasionally an accumulation of biomass in the tubes are additional drawbacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Vertical column photobioreactor</title><p id="Par27">This kind of bioreactor is made up of glass or acrylic tubing which is placed vertically and allows the light to penetrate them. A gas sparger system is used for introducing the tiny bubbles of inlet gas into the reactor and allows the efficient mixing, mass transfer of carbon dioxide, and removal of oxygen. Usually, there is no incorporation of a physical agitation system in a vertical column photobioreactor. Vertical PBRs can be classified into airlift reactors and bubble columns based on arrays of liquid flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Bubble column reactors</title><p id="Par28">The height of a bubble column reactor is larger than twice that of the vessel's diameter. These are cost-effective and are made of a large surface area for illumination. No moving parts are required in these kinds of reactors as efficient mixing and mass transfer are carried out using a sparger. The design of the sparger plays a key role in the enactment of the photobioreactor. Perforated plates are normally utilized as spargers for shattering and redistribution of the coalesced bubbles. Light is provided by an external source. By moving from the central dark zone to the upper light zone, this liquid circulation develops a differential gas flow rate which is crucial for photosynthetic efficiency. Bubble size, though, seemingly is as well vital for diminishing shear damage to cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Because of the high mass transfer, low energy costs, and exceptionally low physical stress, some bubble column PBRs are armed with a rubber membrane diffuser or double spargers to expand the mass transfer of gases: availability of carbon dioxide and removal of oxygen. If the dual spargers are used, the efficacy of CO<sub>2</sub> transfer is amplified fivefold compared to that of conventional sparging. According to the membrane diffuser's performance, the membrane's slits are more like holes with elastic lids that serve as valves to stop bubbles from entering the gas stream. Thus, the membrane diffuser serves as a one-way valve to stop liquid backflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Airlift reactors consist of a vessel having two interrelating zones. The gas blend streams up to the surface from the sparger in one cylinder, called the gas riser. The further area named the down comer, is the place where the medium streams down in the direction of the base and flows inside the riser and the down comer. The time gas residence in diverse zones impacts gas–liquid mass transfer, heat transfer, mixing, and turbulence and, therefore, is important to control the operation. A rectangular airlift photobioreactor has presented improved mixing features and improved photosynthetic competence, though its design is intricate and, therefore, is not easy to scale-up. The main limitation of using these kinds of vertical bubble column PBRs is that some of the algal strains such as <italic>S. costatum</italic> and <italic>C. muelleri </italic> have been reported to experience sheer stress in algal tubes and because of the pressure provided by the pumps, some algal cells cannot survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].

Another downside of the technology is polluting the inside of the reactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The helical PBR was also given a cone shape with a cone angle of 60°, resulting in a conical helical reactor. For the conical helical system, the angle and height are carefully determined. Polyvinyl chloride tubing was coiled in a conical framework to create the conical helical reactor. The liquid was recirculated using an air pump. This system also includes a degassing system and a heat exchanger for temperature regulation. The photoreceiving area and thus photosynthetic productivities rise by a factor of two when employing a 60°. Among all other cone angles examined for this reactor, the photosynthetic efficiency of 6.84 percent was the highest. The key benefit of the cone shape is the increased light-harvesting efficiency while maintaining the same basal area. Another benefit of this type of reactor is that it requires less energy and places less mechanical stress on algae cells. Because of its defined angle and size, increasing the number of light collecting units is the only method to scale-up, but it results in more energy loss in the intricate branches of flow networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].

Algal biomass can be converted into biofuels with the help of thermochemical methods including pyrolysis, gasification, and superficial liquid extraction, or by carrying out hydrothermal liquefaction. Apart from the sugars and lipids, all of the algae-derived biomass can be converted into biofuels using these techniques.

The process of gasification involves the algae-based biomass reaction in a gasifier under the partial oxidation of air. This process is carried out with any kind of combustion and in the presence of oxygen, air, or steam. A number of other downstream methods also accompany this traditional method.

In contrast to the thermochemical conversion methods, biochemical conversions usually occur at a slower rate and are not much energy-intensive.

The three steps of this process are carried out in sequential order: hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Since hydrolysis acts as the rate-limiting step in the process of anaerobic digestion, the algal liability to the attack by an enzyme is a significant aspect that might be accomplished through pretreatment.

For instance, certain photosynthetic microorganisms' cells have been genetically modified to secrete oil that would typically be retained within the cell, making the process of recovering oil easier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. It will be a huge improvement if algal species can be developed to utilize atmospheric nitrogen instead of the nitrogen fertilizers that are currently needed. The manufacture of nitrogen fertilizers is highly dependent on petroleum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Furthermore, putting in place the right regulatory frameworks to reflect the most affordable price can increase production viability as a long-term and sustainable replacement for fossil fuels. As evidenced by the comparatively rapid expansion of terrestrial feedstock, producers and consumers respond to the incentives provided by such policies (for example, in Brazil). Although the same regulations apply to the production of microalgae, the higher start-up costs and risks function as an additional barrier to investment compared to the less expensive agricultural-based production. Finding a policy mix that provides suitable incentives for third-generation biofuels while transitioning away from conventional approaches and managing the associated risks is likely to be as challenging given the technological advancements necessary to justify these incentives and the fuel's viability. Considering the potential of microalgae as a biofuel feedstock, accepting these challenges would appear to be founded on long-term optimism rather than utopian assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Moreover, recently more attention is being given to the co-culturing technique. Microalgae grow symbiotically with other heterotrophic microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, fungi, and other algae/microalgae, in a co-cultivation method. They trade nutrients and metabolites, which boost productivity and make it easier to commercialize microalgal-based fuel. Co-cultivation makes it easier to gather biomass and value waste, which contributes to the development of an algae biorefinery platform for the generation of bioenergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Algae-based fuels seem quite promising. If the complete environmental impact of the latter forms of fuels is taken into account, they might already be seen as being competitive with petroleum-based fuels. We may be forced to abandon petroleum long before it runs out by climate change-related issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">The creation of third-generation biofuels, a superior type of biofuel, is the most promising application of the biomass obtained from algae species. Algae are adaptable plants that may flourish in a variety of aquatic environments, including water that contains a lot of salt or waste. Algae-producing facilities can be found in areas that are not suited for the growth of forests or agroecosystems. As a result, the production of algae does not compete with that of food, fiber, or fuel. Algae have been extensively exploited in industrial applications with the most intensive usage in the production of biofuels such as biobutanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, or bioethanol. It has been reviewed that for the production of algal fuels, algae can be cultivated in all sorts of systems that can be closed, open, or hybrid. The production of biofuels depends upon several factors which influence the cultivation of algae. The practicality of algae biofuels will probably be most impacted in the long run by genetic engineering. Algal oil's prospects will be improved by improvements in methods for separating algal biomass from water and extracting oil from biomass. In the next 7–10 years, algae-based fuel production might be cost-effective, widely adaptable, and operational, but only if we continue improving our awareness of these magnificent species while also improving our capacity to tailor them for the specific aim of growing new energy industry. In the coming years, algae biomass could play a key role in resolving the conflict between food production and biofuel production.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>TM, NH: conceptualization, data analysis and curation, project administration, supervision, validation, writing—original draft, review and editing.
