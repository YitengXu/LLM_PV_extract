One of the reasons that caused it, is our daily energy waste. People consume electricity in order to use home/work appliances and devices and also reach certain levels of comfort while working or being at home. However, even though the environmental impact of this behavior is not immediately observed, it leads to increased CO2 emissions coming from energy generation from power plants. It has been shown that about 40% of these emissions come from the electricity consumption and also that about 20% of this percentage could have been saved if we started using energy more efficiently. Confronting such a problem efficiently will affect both the environment and our society. Monitoring energy consumption in real-time, changing energy wastage behavior of occupants and using automations with incorporated energy savings scenarios, are ways to decrease global energy footprint. In this review, we study intelligent systems for energy management in residential, commercial and educational buildings, classifying them in two major categories depending on whether they provide direct or indirect control. The article also discusses what the strengths and weaknesses are, which optimization techniques do they use and finally, provide insights about how these systems can be improved in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy management systems</kwd><kwd>Recommendation systems</kwd><kwd>Direct control</kwd><kwd>Indirect control</kwd><kwd>Smart home</kwd><kwd>Automated control</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union, and by Greek national funds through the operational program, Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">TDEK 00343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vrakas</surname><given-names>Dimitrios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/10462_2023_Article_10441.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Artificial Intelligence</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nowadays, electrical energy plays a vital role in various aspects of our life. However, the lack of ecological awareness along with the absence of energy-friendly infrastructures has led into increased energy consumption and waste. According to estimates of the United States Energy Information Administration USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2019</xref>), 40% of the annual CO2 emissions are directly related to the electricity consumption. Out of these emissions, 40% of them concern residential and commercial consumers, and as Armel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>) and Darby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>) mentioned, it is possible to achieve 20% savings if we use power more efficiently. Therefore, electricity consumption and wastage reduction can offer environmental and financial benefits to our society.</p><p id="Par3">Different approaches and systems have been proposed in the literature that aim to reverse climate change and global warming. Intelligent energy management systems with incorporated automations is a promising approach towards the solution of these environmental problems. These systems convert a conventional home or building into a “smart” version of it. Smart Homes and Buildings, according to Energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>), include automations systems which provide the ability to monitor and control various services such as, lighting and heating-ventilation-airconditioning (HVAC), or devices such as fridges, ovens and washing machines. The set of installed sensors, actuators and smart devices constitute an Internet-of-Things (IoT) subsystem. When users are surrounded by microcontrollers and smart devices, they follow the paradigm of <italic>Ubiquitous or Pervasive Computing</italic>. When Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies enable the interaction of people with these devices, the environment embodies <italic>Ambient Intelligence (AmI)</italic> (Weiser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">1993</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">These environments play an important role in the <italic>Smart Grid</italic>. Smart grids consist of two parts, the <italic>supply-side</italic> and the <italic>demand-side</italic>, which optimize the energy production, transmission, distribution and consumption (Mir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2021</xref>). Smart homes are a necessity for the demand-side of these grids because even if the supply-side is successfully optimized, a faulty demand-side, e.g. a conventional home/building, will decrease the total effectiveness of the system.</p><p id="Par5">An immediate conversion of all residential and commercial buildings from conventional to smart, is a costly and time-consuming procedure. Even if governments around the world wanted to carry out this plan, the high deployment costs remain an impediment (García et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>; Shigeyoshi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2013</xref>). Therefore, research was expanded towards lower or no-cost energy saving solutions based on information and communication technologies (ICT) (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Research and development of energy management systems focused on new technologies that embody energy savings, and materials that decrease wastage of energy. However, the same attention wasn’t given at users’ behavioral change. Darby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>), suggested that in order to improve the awareness on energy waste habits, consumers must firstly monitor their power consumption and then manage it after receiving appropriate advice. Governments and Non-Governmental Organizations support and facilitate energy-efficiency changes. However the impact of simple saving tips and peer devices’ comparison is low because of the wrong time and place these occur (Cattaneo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). End-users must alter their routine completely and adopt an environmental friendly behavior (Becchio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Recommendation systems are information systems that assist users to discover personalized content, based on their preferences (Resnick and Varian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">1997</xref>). They are used in many different real-world scenarios (Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2009</xref>) and recently some implementations were applied into energy profile reshaping (Alsalemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Sardianos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2019b</xref>) using deep learning algorithms (Wei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2020</xref>), data mining techniques (Ashouri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>), behavioral analytics and human decision-making processes to develop context-aware systems (Şimşek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016</xref>, Sardianos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2019a</xref>)). Despite the fact that these systems emerged in the mid 90’s (Resnick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">1994</xref>; Shardanand and Maes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1995</xref>), Himeur et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>) reached the conclusion that the field of energy saving recommendation systems is still unexplored.</p><p id="Par8">Intelligent Energy Management Systems (IEMS) are a necessary tool to reduce energy overconsumption in households, commercial, educational and industrial buildings and subsequently the total CO2 emissions that are produced. To be more precise, studies indicate that commercial buildings are consuming almost 40% of the total energy in most developed countries (Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). Therefore, real-time energy usage monitoring, along with systems that can offer ways to manage energy consumption and, alternative sustainable energy sources (e.g. solar panels), are of the highest importance (Mir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2021</xref>). This work provides a comprehensive review of IEMS of the literature over the last decade. Our goal in this article was first, to provide the readers an overview of the influential factors of energy overconsumption and also an overview of various approaches towards energy efficiency. Second, we present a high level architecture breakdown for these systems. Third, we provide a review of the state-of-the-art components of each module and we introduce a novel classification for the IEMS in Direct control systems, i.e. systems that provide automations to the environment in order to control functionalities and conditions, and in Indirect control systems, i.e. systems that aim in the behavioral modification of the occupants. Fourth, for these two novel classes, we discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages which class to conclude which class is more suitable for each environment. Finally, we provide a short discussion about their limitations and problematic aspects and also some future research orientations.</p><p id="Par9">The remaining of our study is organized as follows. Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> presents our motivation towards studying and comparing these two types of energy management systems. Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> discusses related work on this topic and refers to surveys performed on smart environments and recommendation systems for energy efficiency. Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> provides background information of the energy efficiency topic from a researchers’ perspective. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, we present necessary specifications for an intelligent energy management system and an overview of their architectures. Subsequently, Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">6</xref> presents a discussion and an analysis of the advantages of each class, their problematic issues and some suggestions for future research. Finally, Sect. <xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">8</xref> concludes our findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivation</title><p id="Par10">Energy management systems are a promising solution towards energy wastage reduction. The variety of studies on smart environments, and the plurality of algorithms and techniques developed over the last decade for automations and recommendations’ optimizations, are proofs of how important these systems are in our effort to reverse climate change and global warming. During our research, we noticed that in current literature, every discussion about smart environments involved mostly systems with integrated automations. Nevertheless, new systems emerged recently which incorporate recommendations mechanisms, aiming at occupants behavioral change rather than in automations. Therefore, we believe that a review was necessary in order to study both types of Intelligent Energy Management Systems.</p><p id="Par11">From our perspective, studying, reviewing and eventually researching IEMS is an extremely important topic especially during the climate and energy crisis we have been experiencing in recent years. These systems can offer environmental solutions regarding efficient energy consumption in various building types, just by adjusting the type of actuation they will incorporate. Each type of building has different needs and capabilities to control its energy footprint and it is crucial for the community research to develop systems with the right approach for each case. For these reasons, a review of the state-of-the-art IEMS, an analysis and the extraction of useful insights is necessary in the literature. To the best of the authors knowledge, a review that include all these topics in the way this article does, does not exist and that is why we start this specific investigation and research. Almost every review until know was focusing either on systems that incorporated automations in the actuation module or systems that were focusing on behavioral management. Moreover, none of these articles was comparing these two types of systems in terms of their suitability on a specific building type. In order to successfully develop and choose an IEMS, a comparison of their advantages was necessary and will give the readers better perspective.</p><p id="Par12">Before referring to IEMS, it would be useful to discuss about efficient energy consumption. There are multiple influential factors that cause energy overconsumption both in residential and in commercial environments. Moreover, a small discussion about various approaches towards energy efficiency. Our goal was to figure out which are the ways to achieve energy saving results and which implementations seem more promising for each installation environment.</p><p id="Par13">Next, we wanted to proceed with the presentation of the IEMS architecture, and provide the reader with a categorization of their components and a classification of their sub-parts. During our research, a classification occurred for the IEMS in Direct Control IEMS and Indirect Control IEMS. Every IEMS can be classified in one of these classes based on the design of its actuation part. Besides various state-of-the-artcomponents we wanted also to show state-of-the-artcomplete prototypes that have been developed by research teams.</p><p id="Par14">In the final parts of this article, we wanted to discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of each class of IEMS, compare their different aspects, investigate their major open problems and discuss about research gaps and future research orientations that will be helpful for researchers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Related work</title><p id="Par15">In this section, we present surveys and reviews that are related to IEMS (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our intention is to provide the reader an extensive look in the field of Energy Management Systems in Residential, Educational and Commercial Buildings. One could read the work of De Paola et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>) in order to understand which are the general approaches to energy efficiency and also the main architectural, technological and algorithmic aspects of an energy management system. Leitao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>) proposed a similar architecture that also incorporates smart appliances, while Lin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2017</xref>) presented a more abstract architecture for IoT-based systems, consisting of three layers: a <italic>Perception layer</italic>, a <italic>Network layer</italic> and an <italic>Application</italic> layer. Boodi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>) dealt with a review of the state-of-the-art Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) focusing on three model approaches: White box, Black box and Grey box models. They also performed a comparative analysis of the factors that have the highest impact in energy consumption. Himeur et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>) surveyed a large number of databases with data that refer to building power consumption, with several features compared and examined, such as geographical location, number of monitored households, sampling rate, etc. Moreover, this research team presented a novel dataset for power consumption anomaly detection. Such a dataset will be very useful for training and testing models that aim to detect anomalies in order to reduce energy wastage. Finally, they performed review on current trends and new perspectives in the field of anomaly detection of energy consumption systems. According to them, detecting an anomaly in the energy data can help us prevent a problem before it gets big and spreads (Himeur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">When IEMS are installed, they provide AmI at the environment. According to Cook et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>), there are various definitions about AmI depending on the features that are included. These environments offer environmental, comfort, safety and financial benefits. AmI is also an umbrella term which applies into technologies embedded into a physical space to create an invisible user interface augmented with AI (Dunne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>). They presented an comprehensive survey on Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) while referring to the state-of-the-art AI techniques and methodologies to implement these systems.</p><p id="Par17">An interesting study was performed by Shareef et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2018</xref>) reviewing load scheduling controllers which integrate AI techniques such as, artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic, adaptive neural fuzzy inference and heuristic optimization. Al-Ani and Das (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>) surveyed the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques in home energy management systems (HEMS). They analyzed multiple RL algorithms, their objectives, and also their testing environments. RL and DRL seem like a very promising approach in simulation platforms but until now they are too slow during training and that is why only 12% of these approaches have been tested in the real world. Mason and Grijalva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>) have also performed a review article about RL applications for autonomous building energy management. They showed that RL algorithms improve significantly the energy efficiency in domestic environments and also that DRL algorithms are usually preferred more than RL algorithms. Nevertheless, they found out that most of the RL approaches are tested mostly at simulation platforms and that an accurate simulation design is needed before these systems are installed in real world scenarios. An example of such a DRL algorithm was developed by Lissa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>). They proposed an algorithm for indoor and domestic hot water temperature control, aiming to reduce the total energy consumption by optimizing the way that solar produced energy is being used.</p><p id="Par18">Leitao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>) conducted a survey about home energy management systems, where they discussed about the demand-side management, i.e. the collection of techniques applied to reduce energy costs on the consumption-side and improve energy efficiency. Furthermore, they discussed about dominant scheduling methodologies which are grouped into five categories. Additional energy saving techniques are presented by Mir et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2021</xref>), including statistical models, cloud computing-based solutions, fog computing, smart-metering-based architectures and also some IoT inspired solutions. Beaudin and Zareipour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) reviewed methods employed to model various aspects of residential energy management systems. Moreover, they discussed about complexity in such systems and presented also an overview of techniques for scheduling approaches, as well as a classification in mathematical programming, meta-heuristic search and heuristic scheduling techniques. Finally, a recent study by Ali et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>) summarized research opportunities created by open issues in the field such as, blockchain-enabled IoT platforms for distributed energy management, deep learning models to handle, use and evaluate big energy data, peer-to-peer energy trading and demand-side energy management, context-aware pervasive future computing, resilience-oriented energy management, forecasting models, user comfort and real-time feedback systems as well as, Internet of Energy (IoE)-based energy management.</p><p id="Par19">Multi-agent systems (MAS) is an approach used to model components of IEMS. An interesting article was published by González-Briones et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>) reviewing state-of-the-art developments in MAS and how they are used to solve energy optimization problems. They discussed about the types of MAS architectures and also the reasons why they must be used as modeling tools. Asare-Bediako et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>) proposed a multi-agent architecture of distributed intelligence to solve the complex and dynamic decision process of optimal energy management. Their architecture was based on four groups of agents: control and monitoring, information, application and management and optimization agents. According to the definition of MAS (Poole and Mackworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2010</xref>) an agent is comprised by a coupling of perception, reasoning and acting components. Mekuria et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2018</xref>) conducted a comprehensive literature review aiming to identify and characterize the reasoning systems in MAS-based smart environments and also presented the strengths and limitations of them.</p><p id="Par20">During the last decades, researchers studied means in order to transit into more sustainable energy usage. Because of their daily consumption, households are responsible for 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Hertwich and Peters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>). Saving energy and being more efficient in our daily power consumption is important to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. As previously mentioned, occupants’ behavior influences energy wastage, therefore behavioral changes of occupants remains a key objective for energy scientists. Steg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>) discussed of ways to promote the active engagement of people in a sustainable energy transition. According to them, some relevant behaviors must be managed and manipulated. Household consumption and behavioral decisions manipulation can offer a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if regulatory framework is set that supports behavioral changes (Dubois et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Recommendation systems are an important research field since the mid 90’s. Their goal is to help users find online content based on personalized preferences using collaborative or content-based filtering along with AI techniques such as, association rules, clustering, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, neural networks, regression, etc.(Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>). Over the last decade, the research community began to integrate recommendation modules into the components of smart environment systems to persuade users to adopt a more Eco-friendly behavior. Steg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>) discussed on ways to make people more engaged into actions and habits that are more energy sustainable. Furthermore, they analyzed how these actions will affect their daily lifestyle and comfort. Based on recent studies, Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2018a</xref>) estimated that occupants behavior affect 10–25% of the consumption in residential buildings and around 5–30% in commercial buildings. Moreover, there are four topics where researchers must focus in order to identify the effects of occupants behavior in daily power consumption: understand occupants’ actions that affect space heating or cooling, develop methods and techniques to collect data on behavior and building performance, model quantitatively occupants’ behavior and building energy performance and finally, create an evaluation technique for the occupants to identify their energy saving potential.</p><p id="Par22">For there recommendations systems and their applications, an extensive literature survey was conducted by Himeur et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>) on energy saving recommendation systems in buildings, discussing how they evolved and also providing a taxonomy based on the nature of the recommender engine, their objectives, computing platforms and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, a critical analysis was also conducted to understand what the limitations of these systems are when they aim in energy efficiency. Additionally, Law et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>) studied a set of recommendations published by companies and agencies, and designed micro-models to estimate how popular recommendations affect energy savings and conducted also a followup study to understand which types of recommendations were chosen and adopted more often.</p><p id="Par23">From a theoretical point of view, Cattaneo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>) analyzed the barriers towards the adoption of technologies for efficient energy usage and introduced ways to overcome them. Moreover, McIlvennie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>) indicated in their meta-review, that automation and control technologies are only “one piece of the puzzle”. The other one is systems that embed humans in the procedure of excessive consumption reduction using behavioral change techniques through recommendations and feedback. They suggested that the integration between techno-centric and user-centric approaches in more holistic implementations will be more effective.</p><p id="Par24">In this section we mentioned various surveys that have been performed and are related to IEMS. In Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> we present a comparison between these surveys and our work. In the next sections, we will show that each IEMS, regardless of its type, follows a similar architecture. Our work breaks down their components and studies state-of-the-art designs, devices and algorithmic approaches. These IEMS implementations are based on requirements extracted from our need to tackle the factors that cause energy overconsumption. To the best of our knowledge, until now, no survey has been performed that both discusses approaches towards energy efficiency, factors that affect it and at the same time present a overview of the architecture, the components and their categories. Moreover, our work presents a novel classification on IEMS based on the type of actuation they incorporate and discusses major open problems of these classes and suggests research directions that will help community to develop better and more efficient IEMS, specialized for each specific installation environment.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Previous works related to intelligent energy management systems</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Reference</p></th><th align="left"><p>Year</p></th><th align="left"><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Mir et al.

According to Ashouri et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>), there are four major influential factors of this phenomenon:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par26"><italic>Building characteristics</italic> Construction materials and insulation levels are obvious factors that increase energy waste in all types of buildings. van den Brom et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) conducted a research on performance gaps in energy consumption, revealing that recent buildings, constructed with modern materials, consume less energy than recently renovated older buildings. Furthermore, a difference between actual and theoretical (simulated) consumption was also noticed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27"><italic>Occupants behavior</italic> Occupants affect the overall energy consumption, especially in residential buildings (Bourgeois <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). Even in buildings with the same energy labeling, discrepancies can occur in consumption, depending on heater/cooler set temperature, hot water wastage, requirements of indoor environmental quality, lighting usage, etc.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28"><italic>System efficiency and operation</italic> Many buildings or households are equipped either with low efficiency or outdated appliances and devices. Systems’ efficiency affects dramatically the total power consumption, as well as, neglected appliances such as oven, microwave, washing and drying machines.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29"><italic>Climatic conditions</italic> Outdoor temperature, solar radiation, humidity and wind velocity can affect energy consumption, especially combined with the aforementioned factors. Even though, these conditions cannot be managed, it is important to realize how they increase energy wastage in order to search for effective solutions.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Approaches towards energy efficiency</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>General approaches</title><p id="Par30">In order to confront climate change, society has to adopt a more energy efficient mindset. Corucci et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>) identified four approaches towards energy efficiency: <italic>user awareness about energy consumption</italic>, <italic>reduction of standby consumptions</italic>, <italic>plan and scheduling of flexible activities</italic> and <italic>adaptive control</italic>.</p><p id="Par31">Firstly, user awareness is a straightforward way to achieve energy wastage reduction (De Paola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>). Providing appropriate feedback, advice and recommendations along with detailed information about daily power consumption and total cost can encourage users to follow a more eco-friendly behavior (Darby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>). However, aggregated measurements of energy consumptions make it difficult to understand which device or behavior causes the biggest waste (De Paola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>). Moreover, various studies (Himeur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>; Law et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2009</xref>) show that behavioral change is still an ineffective strategy in the long term, therefore more research is required.</p><p id="Par32">Secondly, standby devices and appliances are hidden sources of energy wastage. It was first identified as a new challenge in the early ’90 s (Sandberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1993</xref>) when analysts began to study the number of appliances that were “leaking” electricity. According to Gram-Hanssen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>), any plugged-in device in standby mode can consume some amount of energy, but the increased number of such devices in households and buildings lead to substantial increments in the total consumption. TVs, PCs, Coffee Machines and Printers, are some of the devices in every home, consuming energy without being used for long periods of time (De Paola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>). An interesting study was conducted by Hess et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2022</xref>), showing that education was positively correlated with the reduction of standby energy consumption. Moreover, households with children were using less multi-sockets and were less likely to waste standby energy, whereas high-income households were correlated with higher energy consumption.</p><p id="Par33">Thirdly, activity planning and scheduling using modern smart automations systems can offer reduction of energy consumption during energy demand peak (De Paola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>). Scheduling activities, offers financial benefits when energy fares vary between day and night. Furthermore, as Bouakkaz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>) proposed, users can also save energy when a house is connected, through a hybrid energy system, into battery storage units.</p><p id="Par34">Finally, another approach to reduce wasted energy is the installation of adaptive control mechanisms. HVAC and lightning systems waste energy in order to preserve user’s comfort. However, the incorporation of AI techniques such as user-presence detection, behavior prediction or reinforcement learning control can tune activation times of these services to avoid unnecessary consumption (De Paola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>; Eller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Energy hubs and microgrids</title><p id="Par35">Besides the four aforementioned approaches, another way to move towards energy efficiency, on a higher level, is the deployment of <bold><italic>micro-grids</italic></bold> infrastructures in community areas, commercial areas, etc. A micro-grid is a local electrical grid with defined electrical boundaries, acting as a single and controllable entity (Hu and Lanzon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2018</xref>). Microgrids are important to successfully transform existing grids into smart grids. These grids lead to decrease of the operational costs, reduced emissions and increase of energy efficiency system reliability (Bandeiras et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). These interoperable energy systems consist of local energy production units to increase self-sufficiency using solar cells, heat pumps and recycling of wasted water to achieve sustainability. Another approach towards sustainable energy consumption are the energy hubs which are multi-generation systems that supply different types of energy demands simultaneously by both converting energy carries and using energy storage systems (Nasir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">Various research works have been done in recent years on these systems In order to improve energy efficiency of energy hubs, decrease pollution and improve their reliability, Zhang et al.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2022</xref>) developed a two-stage stochastic model for the design and operation of an energy hub in the presence of electrical and thermal energy storage systems. As mentioned earlier, energy storage systems are crucial parts towards energy efficiency. Energy hubs incorporate these subsystems along with different energy carriers and demand response programs. Javadi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2022</xref>) described in their study the joint operation and planning problem as a two-stage optimization problem to successfully design a model that will achieve optimal sizing and siting of an electrical energy storage device, along with electricity tariffs due to demand response program. In order to optimize the efficiency of these multi-systems and their emissions, Mansouri et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2022</xref>) developed a multi-objective model to design a hub considering the variable efficiency of its converters, the degradation of its equipment and the annual growth both in load and in energy prices. Nasir et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2022b</xref>) studied the day-ahead scheduling of these infrastructures considering also the uncertainties on each energy carrier. Finally, Mansouri et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2021</xref>) designed also a scenario-based framework for an energy hub that includes a power-to-gas system, proving that the implementation of an integrated demand response program, along with renewable energy sources, reduced energy costs and CO2 emissions.</p><p id="Par37">Similar frameworks have been developed also for microgrids aiming to reduce operating costs for users.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022</xref>) presented a framework for the scheduling of microgrids considering also the load demand, the market prices and the renewable power generation level. Last but not least, another two-stage stochastic optimization problem was solved by the researchers to design successfully microgrids with dispatchable generators and wind turbines for energy production (Jordehi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Energy saving based on behavioral change</title><p id="Par38">Many research works are focusing into the modification of human habits and are looking for ways to manipulate them towards energy efficiency.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2020a</xref>) implemented real-time personalized recommendations system that also provided energy saving facts that aim to increase the persuasiveness of the recommendations. Besides the aforementioned apporaches, another way to produce optimized recommendations is Reinforcement Learning. Shuvo and Yilmaz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2022</xref>) proposed a DRL method which integrated human feedback and activity in the decision process to optimize electricity cost and users’ comfort. This system was developed to be used in domestic environments. RecEnergy is recommender system aiming at energy consumption reduction in commercial buildings by human behavior modification (Wei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2020</xref>).

According to De Paola et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>), each system or model that was developed must fulfill some basic functional and nonfunctional requirements. Each system has to perceive the environmental conditions of the place it will be installed, use the input data to learn users’ habits, behaviors, preferences, consumptions per device or appliance and also detect or predict existing context. Moreover, it must provide a way for the users to monitor the consumption and at the same time interact with them using notifications to gather feedback and commands. Finally, it should have the ability to modify its environment through actuation after planning optimized sequences of actions that will both reduce energy wastage and satisfy comfort preferences. In respect to the non-functional requirements, these systems have to maintain intrusiveness at low level in the matter of interaction with the user and the physical infrastructure. Furthermore, scalability and extensibility is desirable in such cases, meaning that the level of abstraction during the design should be high. Also, an intelligent system have to be easily deployed by the users and not not require installation from an expert. In the software engineering part of the implementation, the principle of modularity is really important to avoid problematic behaviors of the system. Finally, it is required to be interoperable, with respect to physical devices and other software components.</p><p id="Par41">Energy management systems are developed in a unique way fulfilling the aforementioned requirements following the approaches of the previous section and also following a specific framework architecture (Leitao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>; De Paola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>).

Each IEMS requires at least one type of each component to work effectively.</p><p id="Par46">Information that emerges from the sensing components is saved and processed by the Processing Engine. The engine is the specialized subsystem with components responsible for the process of all acquired data and also performs the optimization tasks based on the end-users preferences. It should also learn and recognize occupants’ activity patterns, communicate with the actuators and manage anomalies or outlier events. When decisions are made, they are transferred into the actuators to modify each appliance or device contextually. Along with the action commands, sometimes, the process engine provides recommendations to the end-users through the user interface to change behaviors that affect the total energy consumption. All these modifications are focused on the persuasion of a smaller energy footprint of our society, however economic impacts remain also a motive (Sardianos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2020a</xref>). Furthermore, through the user interface, users have access to graphs showing daily consumptions. The most common form of a user interface is a computer or smartphone application.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Intelligent energy management system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10462_2023_10441_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Classification figure of the components of an IEMS</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10462_2023_10441_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par47">A widespread approach to model state-of-the-art energy management systems is Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS architecture is often used as a tool to model subsystems of an IEMS and is composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2021</xref>).

Wooldridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2009</xref>) called the ability of an agent to act at a local level, “Sphere of Influence”. Each agent in a MAS has the ability to interact within a specific range. However, there are “spheres” which coincide, rising dependent relationships and creating a unified model. Because of that, MAS architectures are considered appropriate to model IEMS. González-Briones et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>) argued that MAS are commonly used as models because of the communication, coordination and cooperation capabilities of the agents, and also because this design provides robustness to the system, when different tasks are assigned to each agent.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sensors and measuring infrastructure</title><p id="Par52">Sensors and measurement devices are installed on every smart environment, providing data about temperature, humidity and luminance levels, whereas different sensors are monitoring the presence of occupants.

NILM is a method used to monitor the energy profile of an environment and extract information about appliances consumption by disaggregating the total power consumption (Nalmpantis and Vrakas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2019</xref>).

Our goal in this work was to report state-of-the-art approaches of the area (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, our work differs from previous surveys because it merges smart automation and recommendation systems under the umbrella term of IEM systems, considering them as two individual sub-classes, whereas in current literature, most articles about Home/Building Energy Management Systems (HEMS/BEMS) refer to systems with incorporated automations.</p><p id="Par86">In this article, first, we referred to the major influential factors that increase energy consumption and wastage, and also presented some general approaches that should be followed in order to pursue energy efficiency. Second, we provided an IEMS architecture overview, based on some functional and non-functional requirements which arise from the aforementioned influential factors and discussed about the state of the art of these systems. Third, we showed that each IEMS can be classified as a Direct or Indirect Control IEMS based on the type of actuation it incorporates. When a system contains automation mechanics and the end-users choose only environmental preferences, the system is controlling the environment directly. On the contrary, when the end-users receive recommendations to perform actions, the performed control is indirect. More recent studies proved that recommendations systems provide improvements in terms of energy savings. For this reason, we classified automations and recommendation systems as Direct and Indirect Control IEMS, respectively, a novel classification that addresses the lack of a unified structure and helps new researchers to obtain a more accurate overview of the field. Following, we will discuss about the advantages of each IEMS control type (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), as well as their major open issues, providing also some future research orientations.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Advantages of direct control IEMS</title><p id="Par87">Direct control IEM systems have the ability to automate procedures and actions. Their major advantage is that the occupants of a smart environment are not obliged to alter their routine. Once preferences are set, the system receives input data, optimizes and sends action commands to all required appliances, without the need for further interaction. For example, when an occupant leaves a room and no human presence is detected, the lights can be turned off. Similarly, the TV can automatically be turned off if the room is empty.</p><p id="Par88">Another argument in favour of direct control is the plan and scheduling ability, allowing users to set long-term ecological or economical goals on the system. Moreover, scheduling techniques can offer consumption shifting on various operations to find optimal time frames in order to reduce energy demand and cost.</p><p id="Par89">Furthermore, smart environments with automations can protect occupants from emergency situations that can occur, e.g. an excessive power consumption caused by electricity “leakage” from a faulty appliance. A leaky device is wasting energy and is also hazardous for the occupants because it can cause accidents, such as fire or electrocution. Automated actuators have the ability to turn off appliances when necessary, reducing the energy wastage and offering also a safer environment.</p><p id="Par90">Finally, fully automated IEMS can be applied in households where handicapped or elderly people live. A properly designed user interface along with ambient assisted living devices, such as Amazon’s Alexa, which support voice commands, will allow these people to modify easily the comfort parameters of their environment and the energy consumption will remain optimized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Advantages of indirect control IEMS</title><p id="Par91">The application of recommendation modules in IEMS is a very promising field of research. As it was mentioned in chapter 4, occupants’ behavior is one major influential factor of inefficient energy consumption. Therefore, recommendation systems are useful tools to confront this issue. There is one significant advantage towards these systems. When the occupants follow recommendations for a long time, they acquire an eco-friendlier mindset. Thus, people trained from a home recommendation system will also apply the same aware behavior on every other aspect of their life, e.g. their workplace. Therefore, indirect control will eventually have wider impact.</p><p id="Par92">A major difference from direct control systems is the lack of actuation infrastructure, which provides three important advantages. Firstly, these systems are cheaper and easier to buy. Deducting the cost of smart devices and appliances from the total cost of an IEMS, these systems become more affordable. Secondly, a system with less electrical parts connected to the internet, is less vulnerable to cyberattacks. Even if a false data injection attack is performed on them, the worst case scenario is a system that produces irrational recommendations. Moreover, these systems can also run using a local area network or a Bluetooth area network, which are more secure. Thirdly, the architecture of indirect control systems allows non-controllable appliances to take part into the optimization procedures without any modification on their hardware.</p><p id="Par93">Last, an additional feature of these systems is that it is possible to extend their design so that they can help consumers acquire appliances, based on input data from existing appliances in a household, power consumption of available models on the market, their price, manufacturer and other specifications (Himeur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Open issues</title><p id="Par94">There has been great progress in the development of energy management systems, both towards direct and indirect control. However, various issues and limitations hinder the wide installation of such systems in commercial, residential and educational buildings. We will discuss the most important problematic aspects of each class.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Security</title><p id="Par95">Direct control IEMS convert conventional buildings into smart ones. Therefore, they can be part of the demand-side of a smart grid, one of the most complex cyber-physical systems. According to He and Yan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>), every infrastructure based on cyber-physical systems is vulnerable to various types of attacks.</p><p id="Par96">False Data Injection (FDI) is the most frequent type of attack. Sethi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2020</xref>) proved that these attacks affect electricity bills and load consumption drastically, proposing afterwards a resilient scheduling algorithm to overcome these effects. Furthermore, Dayaratne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) showed that small fluctuations in energy demand from FDI attacks significantly increased the unit price and provided financial benefits to the attacker. Because of the nature of the demand response scheme, these situations lead to inefficient energy consumptions by the system, increasing the energy footprint.</p><p id="Par97">Additionally, another type of attack is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Yi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2016a</xref>) revealed a vulnerability of metering infrastructure using “Puppet Attack”, a DoS attack that exhausts the communication bandwidth, proposing also detection and prevention mechanisms. Moreover, Yi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2016b</xref>) demonstrated that some DoS attacks can cause disruption in the whole smart grid. However, they proposed an algorithmic solution to isolate the attacked nodes to continue data transmission.</p><p id="Par98">Other types of attacks are, Control Signal Adulteration (Esfahani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>), which affects the automatic generation controller that regulates the frequency and power exchange between controlled areas and Information Leakage (Sankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2012</xref>).

This issue occurs for various reasons, mostly in collaborative filtering models. Content-based and knowledge-based systems tend to be more robust (Aggarwal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par105">According to Bobadilla et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>), there are three cases that cause CSP. First, the <italic>new community</italic> problem refers to the lack of ratings from the recommendation database. This usually occurs when there are not enough users to rate or vote for the proposed advice, therefore the precision of the recommendation can’t be calculated. Second, the <italic>new item</italic> problem. The new item problem occurs when new actions or recommendations are imported in the database of the system. These recommendations contain no rating, therefore it is rare for them to be chosen. However, if a recommendation remains unnoticed for a long time, it acts like it doesn’t exist at all, even though it could be useful. Finally, the greatest CS problem is the <italic>new user</italic> problem. Someone who uses the system for the first time has zero votes on contained recommendation. The filtering methods of the system have no prior information about the new user and no history of ratings to calculate a “neighborhood” of appropriate recommendations (Son <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2016</xref>). Therefore, the performance of the system is negatively affected because it cannot produce meaningful recommendations (Safoury and Salah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par106">Some recommendation systems are based in collaborative filtering (CF), which can be viewed as a classification and regression generalization (Aggarwal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) and it is the most mature and commonly implemented technique (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>). This technique is making predictions about users’ preferences based on data collected from users with similar profiles. Ratings between users and items are stored in a matrix which is sparse, sometimes up to 99% (Guo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>). This problem is known as <italic>Data Sparsity</italic> in CF recommendation systems.</p><p id="Par107">Sparsity exists when there is lack of knowledge about new users who start using the system and also, because they ignore the evaluation process after a recommendation. Moreover, new users rarely report their feedback on received suggestions. In CF systems, data sparsity is what causes the cold start problem (Guo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par108">To tackle these problems, some approaches have been proposed in the literature. Himeur et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>) proposed that some explicitly stated preferences by the newcomers can be used as metrics to include them in some preexisting cluster of older users. Lika et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2014</xref>) proposed a model consisting of classification algorithms and similarity techniques that retrieved optimized recommendations. Furthermore, Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2014</xref>) mentioned that promoting new items into new users is not very effective, but promoting new items into less active users showed some performance improvement. Jain et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>) suggested an algorithm based on Sequence and Set Similarity Measure that utilized Singular Value Decomposition removes sparsity from the user-item-ratings matrix and Natarajan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>) proposed two methods to overcome sparsity using linked open data from the “DBpedia” knowledge base to create a recommendation system using Matrix Factorization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Comparison of direct and indirect control IEMS</title><p id="Par109">Every developed IEMS design has advantages and disadvantages that occur from the actuation type it incorporates. Both direct and indirect control can offer benefits to the end users, however, the installation environment that is most suitable for each class, varies. In Tables <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> we compare these systems with respect to the following characteristics: cost, daily life intrusiveness, security, comfort, efficiency, ease of installation, accessibility, radius of influence, planning and scheduling features.</p><p id="Par110">In terms of cost, IEMS with automations require a greater number of equipment to control all necessary devices, appliances and services of the installation environment. Each one of these needs an exclusive actuator, which most of the times increases the cost considerably. Because of that, systems which produce recommendations are more affordable options for daily user.</p><p id="Par111">Regarding the intrusiveness of such a system in users daily life, indirect control tend to be more intrusive. People must take actions every time a new recommendation arrives in order to get the best out of their system’s effectiveness. However, this means that the system is highly intrusive in their life, so in this case a system with automations is a better choice.</p><p id="Par112">Security issues are a main concern for all users especially in recent years. Both direct and indirect control systems incorporate a sensing infrastructure, i.e. smart meters and the rest of the sensors that measure environmental variables. Data collected from these devices are extremely sensitive and multiple security measures should be taken into account. As mentioned earlier, absence detection from residential meter data is an extremely dangerous situation, if this information reaches in dangerous people. Nevertheless, the fact that indirect control systems do not incorporate digital actuators make them more resilient to cyber-attacks and no-one can interfere with the functionality of a device or a service.</p><p id="Par113">In every aspect of their life, people are looking for conditions that increase their comfort, whether at home, at work or out for shopping. An energy management system tends to interfere with peoples comfort in all environments in order to achieve energy savings. A system with automations allows the end users to keep their daily routine intact, requiring only an initial setup and minor adjustments during its use. On the other hand, recommendation modules use humans as actuators, therefore their comfort is more affected.</p><p id="Par114">The fact that indirect control systems have a human-in-the-loop design, decreases also their final efficiency. According to the aforementioned studies, user engagement is a major influential factor for the decrease of their efficiency, which makes systems with automations a better choice from this viewpoint.</p><p id="Par115">In terms of ease of installation, direct control systems consist of many more different devices, such as metering, actuators and sensors rather than indirect control systems. On the contrary, an indirect control system can function even with one metering device in the power supply line and one application on a smartphone. Thus, these systems are easier to be installed and they usually are not requiring technical assistance.</p><p id="Par116">The aspect of accessibility is rarely being considered during the design of an IEMS. Systems with automations are more suitable for environments where elderly or handicapped people live or work because usually it is more difficult for them to control the functionality of the services that need to be managed.</p><p id="Par117">There are cases in our daily life where electricity can cause dangerous incidents. A typical example is the malfunction of an appliance. During the monitoring of the energy consumption an appliance can appear to consume energy, even though occupants know that it is not functioning. That might be a case of energy leakage from an old or faulty device. A direct control system can automatically turn of the power supply of this apparatus and protect users from getting electrocuted.</p><p id="Par118">Another aspect IEMS is the planning and scheduling of energy saving actions. Direct control IEMS are capable of lowering HVAC temperature when temperature and humidity reach certain levels autonomously. Therefore, systems with automations have an advantage over recommendation IEMS.</p><p id="Par119">Finally, energy awareness is another aspect of these systems. Usually, designers and developers of IEMS are focused only to achieve energy consumption reduction on the installation environment. However, by focusing on users behavioral management through recommendations systems, people can become more energy aware. When they learn to follow a specific pattern of actions at home, they can act similarly in any other place. This implies that IEMS with incorporated recommendation modules can have a long term effect in a broader set of environments.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Advantages of each IEMS class</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Direct control IEMS</p></th><th align="left"><p>Indirect control IEMS</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Automated procedures leave occupants’ routine intact</p></td><td align="left"><p>Behavioral changes leading to more eco-friendly mindsets have wider and long-term impact on the environment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Provide plan and scheduling abilities to set long-term goals</p></td><td align="left"><p>Human-in-the-loop applications offer cheaper implementations</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Incorporate techniques to protect occupants in case of an emergency situation</p></td><td align="left"><p>Non-controllable appliances can take part in energy consumption management</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Accessibility features allow installation in households with elderly or handicapped occupants</p></td><td align="left"><p>Extended designs can provide suggestions to replace appliances and devices based on users’ profiles</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of complete IEMS in various aspects / criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>IEMS Type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Cost</p></th><th align="left"><p>Daily life intrusiveness</p></th><th align="left"><p>Security</p></th><th align="left"><p>Comfort</p></th><th align="left"><p>Efficiency</p></th><th align="left"><p>Ease of installation</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Direct control</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p><inline-formula id="IEq57"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq57_Math"><mml:mo stretchy="false">✓</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq57_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

First, we found out that <bold><italic> Machine and Deep learning techniques</italic></bold> are, in most cases, the state-of-the-artapproaches towards the solution of a problem. IEMS are IoT based systems which produce high volume of data, therefore fast and accurate processing is required. Furthermore, these data are, in some cases, collected and processed in real time and decisions must be taken. Therefore, an extensive survey on Machine and Deep learning techniques with applications in IEMS needs to be done so the research community has a better perspective about the limitations of these techniques and how they can be overcame.</p><p id="Par122">Second, another important issue of the IEMS is <bold><italic>security</italic></bold>. As previously mentioned, security issues occur in IEMS and can be dangerous both for the users and for the energy providers and producers. Incidents such as false data injection attacks or DoS attacks are serious and must be taken into consideration during the development. Until now, due to different standards and communication stacks involved in the IoT technologies, traditional measures against cyberattacks are not always applicable (Sicari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2015</xref>). Threats like systems’ failure, smart meters’ data corruption, infection by malware, spoofing of usernames and addresses and unauthorized access, show the necessity for research towards threat and risk modelling, IoT forensics, intrusion detection and prevention techniques (Kitchin and Dodge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>; Atlam and Wills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). Also, Energy Theft is another recent problem that is mostly important for the Distribution System Operators which are managing and distributing produced energy into customers. During our research, we concluded that there is a gap on the area of energy related cyber-security issues and we consider it of great importance for the evolution of IEMS.</p><p id="Par123">Finally, another topic that requires to be studied are ways to increase <bold><italic>user engagement</italic></bold> in recommendation systems. Indirect control IEMS which involve recommendations through notifications systems seem to be very promising. However, no such system can guarantee that users will remain engaged into the suggested actions and that they will act respectively. Moreover, the fact that recommendations systems suffer from the cold-start problem decreases more the chances for engagement, thus the effectiveness of these systems drops compared to systems with automations. Because of that, we consider it necessary for a study to be carried out that will investigate all problematic aspects of behavioral modification systems, focusing on user engagement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Research opportunities</title><p id="Par124">The field of IEMS is still developing, therefore many aspects of these systems need to be improved. Regarding indirect control systems, explainability of recommendations remains an issue that needs further study. The lack of explainable recommendations lead users to ignore advice, reducing the effectiveness of a system and the trustworthiness of it (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020</xref>). Each recommendation should be accompanied by answers to the questions “why to perform an action” and “what the benefits are” (Himeur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>).

Moreover, Wilkinson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2021</xref>) presented that it is more effective to provide justifications on why an action should be performed rather than why not.</p><p id="Par125">Another research opportunity is towards gamified frameworks for systems with recommendation modules. They are more engaging than conventional ones when they aim to change certain behaviors (Papaioannou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2017</xref>). These approaches are preferred for school buildings, in order to improve energy awareness in students. An example by Mylonas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2018</xref>), was implemented through the GAIA project, where IoT lab kits where used along with a serious game resulting in acceptance of energy aware behaviors.</p><p id="Par126">Reinforcement learning is a popular AI technique to develop smart frameworks that perform control actions. These frameworks can be incorporated in smart home energy management devices to offer higher levels of saved energy. According to Mason and Grijalva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>), RL frameworks are capable of learning more complex policies than other neural networks implementations and because of the always increasing data volume, these frameworks will become eventually a necessity. Another opportunity is to develop multi-tasking RL frameworks that will be trained to follow different policies. Until now, many multi-objective optimization methods exists, but none of them utilizes Reinforcement learning. Furthermore, RL control frameworks are not tested yet in extreme condition changes. Minor changes at the environmental conditions have been handled until know (Mason and Grijalva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>) but cases like extreme weather conditions, increase or decrease of occupants, solar panel failure, etc, have not been tested yet. Finally, RL apporaches in IEMS are relatively new (Al-Ani and Das <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>). Another research direction would be to perform a comparison between these new approaches with the traditional ones such as rule-based frameworks and other neural network based implementations.</p><p id="Par127">Regarding privacy issues, protecting sensitive users’ information is essential, therefore some research directions could be towards the improvement of resilience of IEMS to cyberattacks by developing frameworks with less vulnerabilities. Until now, due to different standards and communication stacks involved in the IoT technologies, traditional measure against cyberattacks are not always applicable (Sicari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2015</xref>). Threats like systems’ failure, smart meters’ data corruption, infection by malware, spoofing of usernames and addresses and unauthorized access, show the necessity for research towards threat and risk modelling, IoT forensics, intrusion detection and prevention techniques (Kitchin and Dodge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>; Atlam and Wills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par128">This paper has reviewed state-of-the-art approaches of Intelligent Energy Management Systems. Within the area of energy efficiency, IEMS are considered as a way to confront climate change. These systems follow a similar architecture consisting of four components: Sensors, Actuators, Processing Engine and a User Interface.</p><p id="Par129">There are two types of sensing infrastructures in the literature, custom-made and commercial. Researchers choose their preferred type based on the goals and the scale of the application. In large-scale projects, commercial sensors provided convenience and sometimes a unified communication protocol, whereas custom made sensors were preferred for small-scale projects because they could embed more components.</p><p id="Par130">Moreover, this review proposed a novel classification, based on the type of actuation. IEMS can be divided into direct and indirect control systems, depending on who is performing the actions to optimize energy consumption. IEMS with incorporated automation modules are controlling the consumption directly, whereas IEMS aimed at behavioral changes suggest actions and allow the users to decide about actions. Direct control provides convenience through automations and also safety in case of emergency situations. However, improving energy awareness through indirect control can bring about changes in larger scale.</p><p id="Par131">Nevertheless, all of these systems have weak points and vulnerabilities. Systems with automations are mostly vulnerable against cyberattacks. False Data Injection attacks in such systems, can cause an increase of consumed energy. Systems with recommendations suffer from the Cold Start Problem which occurs when new users begin to use the system and when new actions are imported. These problems must be addressed to ensure the effectiveness of these applications.</p><p id="Par132">Our intentions are to keep researching in the field of IEMS. We consider the area of Reinforcement Learning very promising for applications in energy management using direct control. Trying to overpass problems such as the slow training rate is one of our goals. Moreover, another research opportunity regarding the recommendations’ modules is to implement an application or a serious game that will drastically improve users’ engagement in order to create a more affordable and interesting way for people to become more energy aware.</p><p id="Par133">To conclude, IEMS are going through a constant evolution. Direct control approaches seem like a better option for commercial buildings, where a large number of people is present. In that scale, recommendation systems are not very promising. On the contrary, indirect control seems an appropriate choice for educational buildings because eventually, they will increase the awareness of students and will provide long term advantages. Finally, for residential environments, systems with automations are currently more advanced, however, the installation of a complete smart home is still very expensive and unaffordable for the majority of households.
