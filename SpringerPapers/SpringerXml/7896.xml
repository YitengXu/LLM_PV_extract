Doping is normally achieved through solid state reactions, but recent observations of gas-phase alkali transport in the kesterite sulfide (Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>) system (re)open the way to a novel gas-phase doping strategy. However, the current understanding of gas-phase alkali transport is very limited. This work (i) shows that CIGSe device efficiency can be improved from 2% to 8% by gas-phase sodium incorporation alone, (ii) identifies the most likely routes for gas-phase alkali transport based on mass spectrometric studies, (iii) provides thermochemical computations to rationalize the observations and (iv) critically discusses the subject literature with the aim to better understand the chemical basis of the phenomenon. These results suggest that accidental alkali metal doping occurs all the time, that a controlled vapor pressure of alkali metal could be applied during growth to dope the semiconductor, and that it may have to be accounted for during the currently used solid state doping routes. It is concluded that alkali gas-phase transport occurs through a plurality of routes and cannot be attributed to one single source.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature

In the case of Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGSe) solar cell material, the current alkali metal doping procedures are overwhelmingly based on condensed state reactions. Two common approaches are taken. Either by indirect control of the diffusion from a sodium-containing substrate or back contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, or by deliberate doping from the precursor surface through a post deposition treatment (PDT), e.g. by NaF or KF evaporation onto the surface of the absorber to form a tens of nanometer thick layer, followed by annealing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Control of the sodium content in the former case is difficult as substrates are never identical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and in the latter case at least one extra step is required to add the alkali metal. The subject has been extensively reviewed by Salomé <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">CIGSe thin films are always grown in a controlled atmosphere containing a certain pressure of selenium. The semiconductor requires selenium for its formation and to prevent its decomposition, given that the reaction is ruled by a solid/gas-phase equilibrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The question arises, are any other gas-phase chemical species involved in the equilibrium? All the main binary compounds of CIGSe have low vapour pressures; however, usually CIGSe contains also a considerable amount of sodium incorporated in the film. Is the vapour pressure of sodium or its likely selenide compounds significant? Does this affect the properties of CIGSe films? Alkali elements or alkali metal compounds may diffuse through a gaseous environment, get absorbed, and react with the semiconductor while it is being synthesized. This would correspond to a <italic>gas-phase alkali doping</italic>.</p><p id="Par4">Remarkably, given the amount of research into alkali doping, the possibility of vapour phase doping has been scarcely considered in the literature, even in the most recent review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This may be due to a lack of phenomenological understanding.</p><p id="Par5">In early 2014 Johnson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> reported an unidentified vapour phase transport of sodium and potassium under moderate sulfurization conditions. The transport has been observed due to the successful incorporation of the alkali metals in Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> (CZTS) – a promising candidate absorber layer material for solar cell applications – grown as thin films in the presence of sulfur on alkali-free substrates. This was achieved by simply loading solid NaOH or KOH during the sulfurization of Cu-Zn-Sn precursors at 600 °C in the same reaction chamber. Johnson <italic>et al</italic>. provide a thorough chemical characterization of the resulting CZTS films; however, neither the chemical transport reactions nor the electrical or device properties were investigated, so the technological importance of the incorporation was not assessed.</p><p id="Par6">Nine years earlier than the paper by Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., a striking phenomenon was reported by Wieting <italic>et al</italic>., during batch reactive annealing of CIGSe at Shell Solar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. They showed that all CIGSe solar cell power conversion efficiency parameters improved when the CIGSe active layer was annealed facing a soda lime glass substrate compared to when facing another CIGSe layer. They also found an increase of sodium in the CIGSe layer. Since the sodium was not deliberately added, it was hypothesized that it had travelled in the vapour from the glass to the CIGSe. It was proposed that sodium from the glass reacts with H<sub>2</sub>Se to form Na<sub>2</sub>Se, and the latter would then sublime, diffuse to the CIGSe and react. Their proposed reaction is reported below:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep43266_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ2"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep43266_Equ2_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par7">Reaction (1) is equivalent to an ion exchange reaction. Given the decrease of gas molecules, the equilibrium should shift to the left as the temperature increases, but an increase of H<sub>2</sub>Se pressure and the occurrence of (2) should drive it to the right.</p><p id="Par8">Given the reported reaction, one may wonder if only H<sub>2</sub>Se can release sodium from soda lime glass or it is also possible with elemental selenium. Further, the volatility of Na<sub>2</sub>Se would appear to be important, since it would impact on the amount of sodium transported and remaining in the annealing apparatus. If a volatile sodium compound permeates the furnace, then its presence could also accumulate over many annealings. In this way any semiconductor being grown in the furnace would be “accidentally” doped. A further indication that Na<sub>2</sub>Se can supply sodium to CIGSe is given in a recent work by some of the current authors, where a mixture of Na<sub>2</sub>Se and Se was successfully employed for a “deliberate” gas-phase sodium doping of epitaxial CI(G)Se films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">If gas phase alkali metal vapour allows deliberate doping of the chalcogenide during its very formation, with no extra steps, a new strategy for doping is opened, potentially more energy efficient. Such a parallel route may anyway need to be accounted for during condensed state alkali metal doping. Furthermore alkali contamination in fabrication equipment is currently ignored which means that current trends in alkali doping might need careful re-interpretation.</p><p id="Par10">In this work we aim to demonstrate that “accidental” and “deliberate” alkali metal gas-phase doping can significantly affect CIGSe device performance when annealing with elemental selenium. CIGSe is chosen as a case study because for this compound sodium and potassium doping are critical to obtain world record solar cell efficiencies above 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Two common types of annealing chambers are employed, a semi-closed apparatus and a gas-flow system. A first motivation for using two annealing setups is to show the generality of the observations. Secondly, the closed system approaches equilibrium, whilst the flowing system is further from equilibrium, which is more similar to the commonly used physical vapour deposition synthesis tool. Lastly, physical-chemical insights into the proposed equilibria are provided, based on thermodynamic data as well as mass spectrometric studies. The differences observed are related to the thermochamical data for a number of alkali compound sources of doping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental Details</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication of CIGSe with a gas-flow apparatus</title><p id="Par11">The advantage of using a gas-flow apparatus in conjunction with alkali gas-phase transport is that the geometry of the system allows to produce CIGSe library samples with a lateral gradient of doping concentration during the CIGSe growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">For this purpose, a Cu-In-Ga metal precursor film was obtained from solution, as described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> on Mo-coated glass substrates with an alkali barrier.

The tube furnace employed for <italic>Flux-clean</italic> was mechanically scrubbed of selenium and then heated empty in the presence of flowing selenium at 600 °C twice, in order to produce a blank library sample with no intentional sodium contamination. For the <italic>Flux-NaCl</italic> sample, the selenium powder was replaced with a mixture of NaCl and elemental selenium, to provide a library sample with intentional gas-phase sodium incorporation. The third experiment, <italic>Flux-dirty</italic>, was run again with just elemental selenium, but the tube furnace employed was previously conditioned with a number of routine annealings that involved the use of soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates and various other samples containing Na salts in the precursor. The purpose of this test is to analyse the effects of a typical background sodium contamination.</p><p id="Par14">The metal precursors employed for this set of experiments were approximately 8 cm long and 1.5 cm wide, allowing the fabrication of libraries consisting of a single row of 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> individual solar cells (numbering of which is shown in the schematics in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The solar cell finishing procedure employed consists of the sequence CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ni/Al and was performed at ZSW. CdS buffer layers (typically 50 nm thick) were deposited by a conventional chemical bath deposition, the ZnO layers (80 nm + 380 nm) by sputtering and Ni-Al grids (10 nm + 2 μm) by e-beam evaporation.

The <italic>Flux-NaCl</italic> sample contains 2.5 times the sodium than the <italic>Flux-clean</italic> sample, which also suggests that NaCl acts as a source of gas-phase sodium. The increased efficiency is consistent with the incorporation of sodium, as it reflects its known effect on the CIGSe optoelectronic properties, but importantly the incorporation occurs solely via the gas-phase.</p><p id="Par25">The average device efficiencies are relatively low, but the subsequent observations are valid nevertheless. In order to demonstrate that they are not limited by the CIG precursor or the annealing routine itself a fourth sample is added to the graph corresponding to devices obtained under exactly the same conditions as the <italic>Flux-dirty</italic> library except for the presence of additional NaCl intentionally dissolved in the CIG precursor (<italic>Dirty-NaCl-salt</italic>). Under these annealing conditions an average efficiency of 11% is achieved, with longer annealing times leading to a hydrazine-free record of 13.3% power conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It is interesting to observe that despite the additional sodium in the precursor, the absorber layer itself does not contain the highest amount of sodium. This presumably indicates that sodium can also be lost from an absorber layer during growth.

As the sodium-bearing species condense on or get absorbed by the growing CIGSe film, locations of the absorber closest to the source (cell 1) will experience higher concentrations of the species during growth compared to locations further away (cell 10).

As a comparison, no such voltage gradient is observed for sample <italic>Flux-dirty</italic> library, where it appears that the distribution of gas-phase sodium-bearing species is most uniform. Interestingly, the sample <italic>Flux-clean</italic> shows an upswing of efficiency and V<sub>OC</sub> near cell 10. This is attributed to the condensed selenium residue remaining at the end of the tube after the cleaning procedure described in the experimental part. Mass spectrometric analysis of the residue revealed a concentration of sodium of 84 mg/kg, while as-purchased, the selenium contained only 4 mg/kg. This sodium-contaminated selenium residue was nearest cell 10, and thus acted as a sodium source during annealing, resulting in the observed upswing of cell parameters towards cell 10 of sample <italic>Flux-clean</italic>. This means that, despite the efforts, a sodium-free environment was not achieved, although the central cells of sample <italic>Flux-clean</italic> probably experienced the least concentration of gas-phase sodium species, consistent with the low measured <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. This is yet another evidence for the existence of the gas-phase nature of sodium transport. The result highlights the difficulty to achieve sodium-free environments, which implies that gas-phase sodium incorporation of CIGSe is probably unavoidable and needs to be taken into account when extrinsic doping is the subject of research on chalcogenide materials in general. The <italic>Flux-dirty</italic> library shows that the background sodium contamination of a furnace coming from routine experiments can be substantial and acts as a parallel doping source in virtually all literature studies (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Its effect is largely beneficial, but it appears to be insufficient with respect to doping the CIGSe by NaCl supply directly in the precursor ink (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). It should be stressed at this stage that the final quantity of Na in the film does not appear to relate to the efficiency. Arguably, a critical Na concentration appears necessary during the growth in order to achieve good optoelectronic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, but the final concentration of Na will also depend on the film microstructure, as discussed in the next section.</p><p id="Par29">The monotonic decrease of open circuit voltage shown by sample <italic>Flux-NaCl</italic> moving away from the sodium source actually coexists with a slight opposite trend of surface band gap, as estimated from quantum efficiency measurements.

Significantly, this could be achieved deliberately by annealing the precursor with a non-classical sodium source, NaCl, sitting next to the selenium source. Equally significantly, this could also be achieved by annealing the precursor in an environment where many previous samples had been annealed. The deliberate doping was achieved in a flowing apparatus and thus the rate of doping and the total amout of doping is very specific to the methodology. The following section shows the results of the experiments with the semi-closed apparatus.

It is interesting to note that sodium appears to alleviate the stress, but the effect is not investigated further. The SEM surface images are shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>.

Nevertheless, an attentive observation of the physical state of the reaction products reveals that the formation of the alkali chalcogenide is associated with the release of gaseous species. Among the possible reactions suggested in <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>, the high energy content of Cl<sub>2</sub> makes reactions (5) particularly unfavorable compared to reactions (6) and (7), where more stable gas species such as the dichalcogen dichloride and hydrogen chloride are formed, respectively. These gas species have very high vapor pressures and are not likely to condense at the temperature and pressure employed in this work. As expected by Le Chatelier principle, the consequence of their removal from the reaction chamber is that the chemical equilibrium is shifted to the right, increasing the formation of alkali chalcogenide and making the reactions difficult to revert.</p><p id="Par67">From this consideration it is expected that the type of reaction chamber – semi-open or closed – has a strong effect on the resulting extent of doping, with closed systems being likely to attain lower levels of incorporation.

This means that before an appreciable amount of K<sub>2</sub>Se is able to form by reaction of KCl and Se, KCl vapor is able to reach the surface of the CIGSe film and get incorporated, simply via route (a). It can be argued that the Gibbs free energy difference is enough to ensure KCl incorporation despite KCl having a slightly lower vapor pressure than NaCl.

The solid residual of the TG-MS run is a complex mixture of reaction products, as revealed by XRD analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM49">supporting information</xref>).

Clearly, the liquid solution approach that they employed is different from the gas-phase study undertaken here.

This preliminary evidence is encouraging, but the ultimate confirmation of the phenomenon should be sought with a dedicated tool capable of providing a direct measurement of the evolved alkali-bearing gas species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Gas-phase alkali transport: discussion and implications</title><p id="Par78">In principle, alkali gas-phase transport can occur through all routes (a-e) listed above. The contribution of each route must be evaluated on a case by case basis. Due to the lack of thermochemical data for the alkali polychalcogenide species, it is difficult to assign a precise mechanism of transport to back-up the Na experimental results shown in this work. Nevertheless, comparison with literature reports can help to contextualize the findings and provide useful insights.</p><p id="Par79">If the transport of alkali species occurs by <italic>in-situ</italic> formation of alkali (poly)sulfide/selenides (b-e), the amount of alkali chalcogenide formed depends on the alkali source species employed be it halogenide, hydroxide or other and on the corresponding reaction thermodynamics (i.e. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) and kinetics. If the transport occurs via congruent evaporation of the alkali source (a), the vapor pressure is dictated by the source itself. Therefore, in both cases, the level of doping may be tuned, to a certain extent, by carefully selecting the alkali source counterions.</p><p id="Par80">The alkali source counterions and their by-products (e.g. reactions 5–15) may have secondary effects on the chalcogenide film growth, such as defect compensation, oxidation etc. Chemically speaking, if the route is via (b–e), any effect is expected to be minor when using the fluorides/chlorides, because the halogen-bearing products proposed for reactions (6–8) and (11–13) are relatively stable gas species. Detrimental effects seem certainly limited in the case of alkali fluorides, given that they are extensively employed in (solid state) post-deposition treatments attaining the highest efficient CIGSe devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This may also hold true for NaCl, since it was employed as a deliberate dopant leading to the highest reported efficiency for S-free CIGSe by solution processing (13.3%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par81">Compared to PDTs, alkali doping via the gas-phase through routes (b-e), appears to lead to different effects on the CIGSe surface, because the alkali counterion is either absent or composed of chalcogen. Indeed, in Reinhard <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> the presence of fluorides in direct contact with the CIGSe might play an important role on the surface nanostructuring. The cubic shape of the wells formed hints to a condensed state reaction between KF and CIGSe in the presence of Se. Therefore, the effect of gas-phase alkali incorporation into chalcogenide compounds is expected to confer properties that are different, in principle, to conventional PDTs. This aspect may be particularly relevant for applications where surface effects at interfaces play an important role, such as in CIGSe and other thin film PV.</p><p id="Par82">To summarise, alkali incorporation can be achieved via the gas-phase (as shown here) or by evaporation/condensation followed by ion exchange with the already formed chalcogenide film (as in conventional PDTs).</p><p id="Par83">Therefore, understanding the thermodynamic equilibria responsible for the gas-phase alkali transport (reactions (4) and (a–e)) is essential in view of (i) developing reliable gas-phase doping methodologies, and (ii) unravelling the chemistry of surface ion exchange in PDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Specifically, if vapor phase species can be absorbed and react with the CIGSe, they may also desorb and be lost from the CIGSe, as the preliminary evidence here suggests. This is the nature of gas-solid phase equilibrium reactions, and its consequences may become important in high vacuum synthesis procedures, e.g. physical vapor phase deposition.</p><p id="Par84">More precisely, for case (i) depending on the ease to achieve a uniform gas phase distribution of the dopants, an effective dopant-chalcogenization treatment can be designed based on a static or on a forced convection flow system, as shown in this work. For case (ii), knowing the thermodynamics of the competing reactions occurring at the surface of the CIGSe during alkali fluoride PDT (i.e. also the gas-phase reactions) may help to better explain the phenomenon of surface nanostructuring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it would be important in order to identify which alkali source best fits other chalcogenide systems being developed.</p><p id="Par85">Future work should then focus on the synthesis and characterization of the single alkali polychalcogenides, with the aim of quantifying their vapor pressures, diffusion coefficients and Gibbs free energies of formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Summary and conclusions</title><p id="Par86">This work expands on previous reports of gas-phase alkali transport and incorporation in CI(G)Se<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and CZTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, with the intent to clarify the origin of the transport.</p><p id="Par87">Mixtures of alkali chlorides and elemental selenium are employed during reactive annealing of Cu-In-Ga metallic precursors under static and flux conditions. The gas-phase nature of the transport is supported by SIMS compositional data and is further confirmed by the spatially dependent optoelectronic properties of the resulting CIGSe-based devices produced from the flux annealing. Indeed, the sodium supplied via the gas-phase appears to improve the optoelectronic properties of CIGSe films in much the same way as other kinds of sodium incorporation routes. The known decrease of In-Ga interdiffusion upon Na incorporation is also observed and supported by SIMS, EQE and PL data. Contrarily, preliminary SIMS and PL evidence shows that KCl appears to promote In-Ga interdiffusion in CIGSe.</p><p id="Par88">Based on mass spectrometric analyses and a critical assessment of calculated Gibbs free energies of reactions, the observed gas-phase transport is proposed to occur via five routes (a-e) and to originate from direct alkali source evaporation (a) and alkali monochalcogenide formation (4) (which is deemed possible thanks to the side-formation of uncodensable gas products). In principle, the alkali monochalcogenide formed can then evaporate (b), decompose and release neutral alkali atoms (c-d) or react with excess chalcogen to form more volatile polychalcogenide species (e).</p><p id="Par89">KEMS analysis shows that Na<sub>2</sub>Se sublimation is unlikely to be the sole route for transport under equilibrium conditions. Static annealing shows that the transport with KCl+Se occurs differently from the NaCl+Se case. While limited amount of Cl is incorporated when using NaCl, both K and Cl levels increase substantially with KCl, suggesting that the transport of Na is also mediated by Se, while K is mainly transported via gaseous KCl. This is consistent with the thermochemical data corresponding to the formation of alkali selenides starting from the selenium-salts mixtures in H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>, which shows that Na<sub>2</sub>Se formation is more favoured compared to K<sub>2</sub>Se. As a result, KCl treatment leads to a CIGSe surface microstructure that is much smoother than that of the NaCl case. Such a microstructure is also very different from previously reported nanostructured patterns achieved by evaporation of KF followed by post deposition treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par90">The absence of clear mass spectrometric signals for many of the species involved in the proposed reactions is consistent with the equilibrium thermodynamic calculations. Therefore, the gas-phase alkali transport observed here and implicitly acknowledged by most literature on NaF/KF post deposition treatments may imply that the proposed reactions deviate substantially from equilibrium under routine annealing conditions.</p><p id="Par91">Preliminary evidence suggests that the gas-solid nature of the alkali metal incorporation in chalcogenide films is likely to be reversible, as shown by a decrease of the sodium SIMS signal in CIGS films re-annealed in selenium atmosphere.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outlook</title><p id="Par92">From the proposed phenomenological analysis it is concluded that gas-phase alkali metal transport occurs through a plurality of routes and cannot be attributed to one single source.
