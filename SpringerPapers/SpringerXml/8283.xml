Since large-scale flux is generated by the deep-seated dynamo, the observed characteristics of flux emergence and that of the subsequent decay provide vital clues as well as boundary conditions for dynamo models. Throughout their evolution, ARs are centres of magnetic activity, with the level and type of activity phenomena being dependent on the evolutionary stage of the AR. As new flux emerges into a pre-existing magnetic environment, its evolution leads to re-configuration of small-and large-scale magnetic connectivities. The decay process of ARs spreads the once-concentrated magnetic flux over an ever-increasing area. Though most of the flux disappears through small-scale cancellation processes, it is the remnant of large-scale AR fields that is able to reverse the polarity of the poles and build up new polar fields. In this Living Review the emphasis is put on what we have learned from observations, which is put in the context of modelling and simulation efforts when interpreting them. For another, modelling-focused Living Review on the sub-surface evolution and emergence of magnetic flux see Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>). In this first version we focus on the evolution of dominantly bipolar ARs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Magnetic flux emergence</kwd><kwd>Evolution of active regions</kwd><kwd>Magnetic flux dispersion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41116_2015_Article_9161.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/TEX/41116_2015_9161_TEX.tgz</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>TEX</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Astrophysics and Astroparticles</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plasma Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary material is available for this article at <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/lrsp-2015-1" ext-link-type="doi">10.1007/lrsp-2015-1</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Definition of active region</title><p>The definition of active regions (ARs) has been changing with our ability to observe them through a widening wavelength-window and with our deepening understanding of them. To illustrate this, we recall the Proceedings of the famous IAU Symposium 35 on the “Structure and Development of Solar Active Regions”, held in Budapest, Hungary in 1967, citing the Preface and Introduction by K. O. Kiepenheuer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1968</xref>):
<disp-quote><p>What is an Active Region or a Center of Activity? According to D’Azambuja (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1953</xref>) it is the ‘totality of all visible phenomena accompanying the birth of sunspots’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Today we should extend this definition a little bit: The totality of all observable phenomena preceding, accompanying and following the birth of sunspots including radio-, X-, EUV- and particle emission.</p></disp-quote></p><p>We see here, that Kiepenheuer extended the definition of ARs well beyond the emergence phase and emphasised that ‘visible phenomena’ must be replaced by ‘observable phenomena’, in a much broader wavelength range than that of the optical. After half a century of solar research what can we add to or change in this definition? The most important change is a shift of emphasis from sunspots to magnetic fields. Sunspots appear where the most concentrated magnetic field bundles cross the photosphere, but the magnetic fields of ARs are much more extended. An example is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. However, the decades-old identification of ARs with sunspots still has a strong influence: NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) assigns a number to an AR when/as long as it contains at least one sunspot visible in white-light. This is not a criticism, though. One has to draw a line somewhere and the disappearance of sunspots is a practical milestone in the long gradual decay process, which has few other well-defined markers. In this review, however, we follow AR evolution beyond the presence of sunspots, therefore the term ‘active region’ is defined to include the decay phase, as Kiepenheuer suggested. The AR definition below has many similarities to the one given by Martres and Bruzek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">1977</xref>), who included both magnetic fields and AR evolution in their description of how to define this “extremely complex phenomenon”.

The simplest ARs have bipolar magnetic field configurations, but ARs may be built-up by several bipoles emerging in close succession. In the photosphere the presence of a strong magnetic field is manifested by the appearance of dark sunspots or pores and bright faculae representing concentrated and dispersed magnetic fields, respectively. In the chromosphere arch filament systems connect opposite polarity magnetic concentrations, filaments form along the magnetic inversion line and the bright regions that appear above dispersed fields are called plages. In the transition region and corona bright, hot, dense loops connect the opposite magnetic polarities. ARs are the principal source of a broad range of solar activity phenomena: ranging from small-scale brightenings and jets to the largest flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The level and type of activity is dependent on the evolutionary stage of an AR, being highest at the emergence stage and decreasing after that. AR evolution from emergence through dispersion and the removal of flux through magnetic cancellation and ejection of magnetic field and helicity via CMEs are intrinsically coupled with the workings of the solar dynamo. The magnetic field of ARs is a defining factor of the interplanetary magnetic field, thus their influence extends well beyond the solar corona.</p><p>Active regions emerge into a pre-existing magnetic environment formed by previous active regions. Therefore, they do not evolve in isolation. The interaction with the surrounding magnetic fields of previous regions, new flux emergences and the open fields of coronal holes plays an important role in their evolution and is one of the determining factors of their lifetime. And, vice versa, at any given time the Sun’s large-scale field is determined by the superposed growth and subsequent diffusion of all previously occurring ARs, shaped by differential rotation and meridional circulation, while the magnetic complexity is smoothed by magnetic cancellation processes.</p><p>Throughout the last decades there have been excellent reviews and book chapters published on the evolution of active regions (e.g., Bray and Loughhead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1964</xref>; Schrijver and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2000</xref>; Martres and Bruzek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">1977</xref>; Sheeley Jr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">1981</xref>), though there were relatively few reviews considering the topic in its entirety. We build on the knowledge collected in, and synthesis achieved by, these previous works, and, naturally, we also build on reviews previously written on this subject (van Driel-Gesztelyi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2002</xref>; van Driel-Gesztelyi and Culhane, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">2009</xref>). But this, like all reviews of a huge literature (and in spite of all the efforts to the contrary) is biased by personal views, preferences, and understanding.</p><p>Furthermore, the evolution of active regions includes two essential topics that have already been covered by other recent reviews: The sub-surface evolution and emergence of magnetic flux by Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>), and the nature and evolution of sunspots by Solanki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2003</xref>). Instead of duplicating their work, where relevant, we refer the reader to specific parts of these insightful review articles.</p><p>This review starts with a summary of the main laws of magnetic flux emergence, followed by a concise scenario of active region evolution in which we list the most important steps from the first signs of flux emergence in the photosphere and higher atmospheric layers up to the point when the large-scale emerged flux will become an enhanced network and finally background field, including a few key references. Then we discuss the main characteristics of (bipolar) ARs in an evolutionary context from flux emergence through the decay process. Finally, a special section is dedicated to the analyses of the long-term evolution of single ARs, followed by concluding remarks. In an Appendix we describe sunspot classification schemes, pointing out how they relate to AR evolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Main laws and intrinsic characteristics of large-scale magnetic flux emergence</title><p>The three main observationally established rules of the emergence patterns of sunspot groups (bipoles) which persist during the 11/22-year solar cycle, namely the butterfly diagram (or Spörer’s law; Carrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1858</xref>), Joy’s law (Hale <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1919</xref>) and Hale’s law (Hale and Nicholson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1925</xref>), are the pillars of all successful dynamo models.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Spörer’s law (i.e., the butterfly diagram) expresses that the latitudes of flux emergence show a dependence on the solar cycle phase. ARs emerge at high latitudes when the cycle begins and then tend to emerge at progressively lower latitudes as the cycle progresses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Joy’s law recognises that there is a systematic deviation from the east-west alignment of bipolar ARs with the leading spots being closer to the equator on both solar hemispheres.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hale’s law states that bipolar ARs that are aligned roughly in the east-west direction have opposite leading magnetic polarities on opposite hemispheres (leading in the sense of solar rotation). The magnetic polarities alternate between successive sunspot cycles.</p></list-item></list></p><p>These characteristics are fundamental observational constraints for dynamo models, and Hale’s and Joy’s laws are strongly suggestive of ARs being products of the emergence of Ω-loops originating in a toroidal magnetic field in the solar interior, which is thought to be located at the bottom of the convection zone in the tachocline region (for a review, see Charbonneau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>).</p><p>Besides these three fundamental laws there are three other intrinsic characteristics of large-scale magnetic flux emergence:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The leading preceding (<italic>p</italic>) and following (<italic>f</italic>) polarities of emerging flux show systematic asymmetries, e.g., in their proper motion and stability (Carrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1863</xref>), location of the magnetic inversion line (van Driel-Gesztelyi and Petrovay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">1990</xref>), extent of the elongation of the magnetic polarities, called magnetic “tongues” (Luoni <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2011</xref>), and helicity injection (Tian and Alexander, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">2009</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Flux emerges twisted, carrying magnetic helicity and free magnetic energy from the solar interior (Leka <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1996</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Flux emergence sites are nested (Cassini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1729</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Active region evolution: From birth to death</title><p>Based on a wide range of observational evidence and theoretical considerations, it is widely accepted that bipolar active regions are the consequence of the emergence of buoyant magnetic flux tubes through the solar photosphere into the chromosphere, corona and beyond. These magnetic flux tubes originate in the toroidal magnetic field created by the dynamo at the bottom of the convection zone in the tachocline, and during the highly organised flux emergence phase they are still rooted in it — hence their name: Ω loops (Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">1987</xref>). During their rise through the convection zone the evolution of the flux tubes is influenced by the Coriolis force, magnetic tension, drag, plasma vortices and large-scale convective motions, which all leave their mark on the emergent AR. The most important characteristics of a single major (10<sup>21</sup>–10<sup>22</sup> Mx) bipolar flux emergence, and the sequence of events which follow, can be briefly summarised as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Flux emergence is first seen as the appearance of a nearly horizontal, upward-moving (≈ 1 km s<sup>−1</sup>) magnetic field in the photosphere that has a strength of 200–600 G. The individual flux elements move rapidly away from the emergence site and kG field strength is reached in the photosphere only when the field has become nearly vertical. The leading polarity flux tends to converge immediately into a pore, while the following polarity is less compact (Lites <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">1998</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The granulation looks fuzzy in the photosphere (anomalous granulation). Granulae between the opposite polarities become larger and more elongated before fragmenting (Guglielmino <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2010</xref>). Between the two opposite polarity flux concentrations (pores and spots) dark inter-granular lanes (dark alignments of channels) appear (Loughhead and Bray, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">1961</xref>), along which plasma upflow (≈ 1 km s<sup>−1</sup>) is observed, while at their end(s) bright facular grains show signatures of downflow (Strous and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">1999</xref>). These dark lanes have a lifetime of 10–30 minutes and appear where the tops of magnetic flux tubes are crossing the photosphere.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The compact, expanding bipolar magnetic field appears in magnetograms with corresponding compact bright plage in the chromosphere (first in the Ca K-line, Bumba and Howard, 1965 and then in Hα images Waldmeier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">1937</xref>). Recent multi-wavelength analyses show that within a few 10s of minutes after Ca II intensity starts to increase, soft X-ray (SXR) emission starts increasing and a small bright region also appears in transition region and low temperature coronal lines (He II, O VI, Mg VII, and even a faint signature is seen in the Fe XII line (Guglielmino <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2010</xref>). Tarr <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">2014</xref>) found the first faint emission in 211 Å SDO/AIA images about four hours after the first detection of a rapidly-expanding, highly inclined magnetic field in the photosphere, and three hours later the first well-formed EUV loops.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The initially uniformly weak horizontal fields evolve into a mixture of weak magnetic fields and more vertical (kG) fields (Lites <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">1998</xref>). At the beginning of flux emergence (first day) there is no single magnetic inversion line, but small (≈ 2 Mm) individual bipoles appear all over the AR in between the growing magnetic concentrations at the edges of the emerging flux (Wang and Zirin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262">1992</xref>; Bernasconi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>). The small-scale pattern is suggestive of undulatory (serpentine) flux formed of an alternating series of small Ω and U-loops breaking through the photosphere (Strous <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">1996</xref>; Pariat <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2004</xref>; Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269">2008</xref>). These small-scale flux emergence sites may be recurrent and they may appear with a wavelike regularity (with a λ = 8 Mm) in between the two main opposite polarity concentrations (Strous and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">1999</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In Hα images, dark fibrils, called an arch filament system (AFS), are seen connecting the outer edges of the plage or inner edges of spots of opposite magnetic polarity (Bruzek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1967</xref>). These arches are rising at their tops (<italic>v</italic> ≈ 10–20 km s<sup>−1</sup>) and material is draining along their legs (<italic>v</italic> ≈ 20–25 km s<sup>−1</sup>). The rise-speed seems to be dependent on the flux of the AR, with more substantial flux rising faster (Zuccarello <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR287">2009</xref>). Individual arches are short-lived (≈ 20–30 min), but the AFS exists as long as flux is emerging.

Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, partially adopted from Chapter 5 of Schrijver and Zwaan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2000</xref>), illustrates very clearly that the lifetime is roughly proportional to the magnetic flux of an AR at maximum development. The lifetime of an AR can depend, however, on its interaction with surrounding magnetic fields. The lifetime of two ARs with the same flux content can be very different depending on the phase of the cycle: a large AR may be traceable for up to 10 months during solar minimum, when it can evolve undisturbed, while its identity can be lost in less than 4 months during solar maximum (Schrijver and Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">1994</xref>).

For a sample of 382 ARs, which emerged on the eastern hemisphere outside of pre-existing regions (Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>, her Chapter 3, Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">III</xref>) showed that for ephemeral regions, which are at the smallest end of the size-spectrum of ARs, with a lifetime of 1–3 days, the rise time is as high as 30% of the full lifetime. However, as regions become bigger, the percentage goes down to the few percent level. The last column in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> is based on her results.</p><p>It is still a question whether or not ephemeral regions (ERs, Harvey and Martin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1973</xref>; Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>) are simply the small-scale end of a broad size-spectrum and whether their characteristics and origin are the same as larger ARs (Harvey and Martin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1973</xref>) or if they are generated by a local dynamo process and/or are recycled flux from dispersing ARs (Nordlund <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">1992</xref>). The latitudinal distribution of ephemeral regions extends well beyond the activity belt populated by ARs, and their tilt angle distribution is becoming increasingly random with decreasing flux content, which seems to support their origin in a local dynamo. However, as there is a smooth, continuous distribution of tilt angles, from larger towards the smaller (see Section <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, this strongly argues in favour of a deep-seated dynamo origin. Then, the wide distribution of ER tilt angles may result from the effect of turbulent convection. However, as in other cases when two well-argued viable scenarios for the same phenomena co-exist in science, there is a possibility that both are right, and in this specific case below a certain threshold bipoles do have a different origin from that of the large-scale AR population (Hagenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2003</xref>). As ever-increasing spatial resolution of telescopes and magnetic field measurements are pushing the lower limit of observed ERs to the 10<sup>16</sup> Mx range (see, e.g., Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">2012</xref>), which may well belong to the local turbulent dynamo produced population, it seems to be reasonable to draw the line for ARs at about two orders of magnitude higher than that in this review.</p><p>The flux content of an emerging flux tube has an effect on the rise speed of its top part (that forms the Hα AFS) as well as on the speed of material down-flow along its legs. Zuccarello <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR287">2009</xref>), making an overview of high-resolution Doppler velocity (IPM) observations in the Hα line taken with the THEMIS telescope, report on the rising/draining speeds observed in a large, a small and an ephemeral AR. The results are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and clearly show that in larger (higher-flux, higher-<italic>B</italic>, and thus more buoyant) ARs AFS rise faster and drain with greater speeds (presumably, since the material drains from taller loops). An evolution of all these speeds was noted: both the rise speeds of the middle and the down-flow speeds along the legs on an individual strand of an AFS are highest when the strand forms and gradually decrease during the lifetime of the strand (time scale: ≈ 10 min). The characteristic up- and down-flow speeds in the AFS also gradually decrease as the emergence progresses (timescale: days).

These studies are important because they potentially provide diagnostics for the subsurface processes that flux tubes are subjected to and provide clues to the origin of magnetic features. For example, a log-normal distribution of the area/flux may be interpreted as a clue for repeated random fragmentation and coalescence, while a power-law distribution suggests that the features have the same origin or are dominated by the same processes after emergence. Another question is the area/flux range over which an empirical relation holds. For example, if the area/flux distribution of ARs significantly differs from that of the small-scale end of bipolar magnetic flux concentrations, like ephemeral regions (ERs) and even smaller bipolar features, then this can be interpreted as evidence that large- and small-scale bipoles are produced by different types of dynamo processes.</p><p>Bogdan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1988</xref>), using Mt. Wilson white-light data in the period 1917–1982, made 24 000 measurements of individual sunspot umbral areas to determine the relative size distribution of sunspot umbrae. In the broad range of 1.5–141 MSH (millionth of the solar hemisphere, 3.321 Mm<sup>2</sup> or 0.0225 heliographic square degrees or 1.84 arcsec<sup>2</sup>) they found the sunspot umbral areas to be distributed log normally. While the number of spots changes with cycle phase, and the total number of spots in a cycle difers from cycle to cycle, the distribution of umbral areas was found to be independent of the phase of the solar cycle and it also remained the same from cycle to cycle. These, they suggest, may argue for the fragmentation of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone. More recent analyses also found a log-normal distribution of the flux content of magnetic elements within ARs, suggesting that repeated random bifurcation dominates fragmentation and coalescence in all active regions (Canfield and Russell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>) and the process of fragmentation dominates the process of flux concentration (Abramenko and Longcope, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>).</p><p>Harvey and Zwaan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1993</xref>) used Kitt Peak magnetograms to make a careful analysis of 29 solar rotations, selected during the period 1975–1986 (cycle 21).

Each AR was counted only once, even if it was recurrent. They found that the distribution <italic>n</italic>(<italic>A</italic>) of the areas <italic>A</italic> of bipolar ARs is a smooth monotonically decreasing function of their area <italic>A</italic>, i.e., an essentially fixed power-law relationship between emergence frequency and size, with a size-independent multiplicative factor that is a function of the phase of the sunspot cycle. This study was extended in Zwaan and Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289">1994</xref>), to include a large sample of ERs defined by the size range 45 &lt; <italic>A</italic> &lt; 375 Mm<sup>2</sup>, who found a continuity with previous work. The close correlation between area and total magnetic flux Φ found in Schrijver and Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">1994</xref>) implies that the <italic>n</italic>(Φ) function has the same properties and distribution as <italic>n</italic>(<italic>A</italic>).</p><p>A decade later, Hagenaar <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2003</xref>) carried out a detailed analysis of the (directly measured) magnetic flux distribution of small-scale bipoles on the Sun using SOHO/MDI data from 1996 to 2001, and combined their distribution with that for ARs, from Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>) (which include works cited in the former paragraph). When making the composite, appropriate scaling between instruments and conversion between area and magnetic flux (Schrijver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">2001</xref>) had to be applied. The result confirmed that the emergence frequency increases smoothly and rapidly with decreasing flux (see Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

To identify features they used a ‘clumping’ algorithm, which defines a single feature as a group of contiguous, same-sign pixels, each of which exceeds an absolute flux cutoff. They found that all flux features, regardless of field strength, follow the same distribution — a power-law with slope −1.85 ± 0.14. This result implies that the processes that determine the spatial structure of surface magnetic features are scale-free. Hence, suggesting that either (i) all surface magnetic features are generated by the same mechanism (which may be a <italic>combined</italic> solar-cycle dynamo at the tachocline and a turbulent dynamo that works throughout the convection zone) that acts the same way at all scales, or that (ii) after flux emergence, the spatial structure of magnetic flux is dominated by processes in the interior or at the surface (e.g., fragmentation, coalescence and cancellation) that produce a scale-free distribution. They conclude that fragmentation produces a log-normal distribution when a single large feature is broken up, while on the Sun features come from a range of sources, and a combination of emergence, coalescence, cancellation, and fragmentation may well produce a power-law distribution. Continuing this line of research and applying the same method on <italic>Hinode</italic>/SOT data, Thornton and Parnell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2011</xref>) studied in more detail the low-flux end of the distribution extending the flux distribution study to the flux range of 10<sup>16</sup> − 10<sup>23</sup> Mx and nearly 18 orders of magnitude in frequency. They confirmed that there exists a single power-law distribution over all emerged fluxes, and suggested that this implies a scale-free dynamo, indicating that a turbulent dynamo may act throughout the convection zone. Moreover, from the slope of the emerging flux distribution the turbulent dynamo producing small-scale features produces considerably more flux than the active-region dynamo at the tachocline.

This contradiction may be due to an underrepresentation of ARs in the low-flux end of the distribution, which is particularly likely during higher activity periods.

The fixed spectral shape with changing activity does not hold for the ephemeral regions; while AR frequencies change by a factor of about eight from cycle minimum to maximum, the ER frequency changes by no more than a factor of two. This may point at distinct (dominant) origins for these extremes of the spectrum. She found that the first activity of a cycle is in the form of small bipoles: ERs and small ARs. Citing her:
<disp-quote><p>These regions emerge 2 to 3 years before the first sunspots, at latitudes poleward of about 30°–35°.

Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the opposite polarities separating for four days as expected from the emergence of an Ω-loop, but then the process reverses and the polarity separation starts to decrease. Similar behaviour was shown by Waldmeier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">1955</xref>), (his Figure 48) for a long-lived pair of spots (see Bray and Loughhead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1964</xref>, their Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.3). We cite Bray and Loughhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1964</xref>): “According to Greenwich observers, the westerly motion of the preceding spot ceases when the group attains its maximum area; thereafter the motion is easterly. The following spot moves only eastward, but it comes to rest after a few days.” Wallace Hartshorn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR261">2012</xref>) in her PhD thesis carried out the first statistical analysis of the flux and polarity separation evolution by studying 57 bipolar ARs whose full emergence phase was well observed by SOHO/MDI. The peak fluxes ranged between 10<sup>21</sup>–10<sup>22</sup> Mx, with the average flux being 3.7 × 10<sup>21</sup> Mx. As the spread in flux implies a spread of duration of flux emergence, a normalisation for the latter was carried out. The resulting average flux and polarity separation behaviour during the flux emergence period (on average 60 hours) is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, right panel. The average behaviour shows a lag between peak flux and peak separation distance in bipoles, with the latter trailing. The latter, and a slight reversal of the flux separation at the end of the flux emergence process, confirm the generality of the behaviour demonstrated in the case study by Kosovichev and Stenflo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2008</xref>) shown in the left panel of Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.

Another force, acting in the opposite direction, is an attractive force between the opposite polarities (opposite electric charges <italic>±q</italic> = Φ/2Π, where Φ is the total magnetic flux of the active region) which Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>), in her Section 8.3, estimates to be (Φ/2Π)<sup>2</sup>/<italic>d</italic>62, where <italic>d</italic> is the polarity separation. However, she shows that this attractive force can only balance the magnetic tension-driven force if the polarities are very close, practically touching each other, and it falls with 1/<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>d</italic> is the polarity separation. Thus, based on these considerations it is difficult to understand why the polarities when they are quite far apart may start to approach each other after the AR’s maximum evolution is reached. In the longer-term evolution, based on flux dispersal and a gradual disconnection of the flux tube from its toroidal roots, one may expect an ever-increasing separation trend (due to flux dispersion), unless the disconnection is owing to sub-surface magnetic reconnection between the Ω-loop’s legs (Schrijver and Title, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">1999</xref>). It is surprising, however, that during the undisturbed decay of AR 7978 in 1996 Li and Welsch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2008</xref>) found no significant increase in the distance between the weighted positive and negative flux centers of the decaying AR when comparing its 3rd and 4th rotation (for more details see Section <xref rid="Sec30" ref-type="sec">6.1.1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Tilt angle</title><p>A systematic tilt (a small angle to the direction of the equator) of the axis of bipolar ARs was discovered by Hale <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1919</xref>), see Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.

The tilt angles of the lower-flux bipoles also have a wider scatter about their average values than the tilt angles of stronger sources. They confirmed that the average tilts of BMRs relative to the east-west line increases toward higher latitudes, and that over the analysed period the tilt angle (<italic>γ</italic>) may be expressed as a function of latitude (<italic>θ</italic>) as follows: sin <italic>γ</italic> = 0.48 cos <italic>θ</italic> + 0.03.

For example, Tang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">1984</xref>), analysing a 15-year Mount Wilson magnetogram dataset (1967–1981), did not detect any systematic latitude-dependence of the tilt angle. Howard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">1991b</xref>), using Mount Wilson white-light sunspot data for the period 1917–1985 found a strangely irregular increase of the tilt angle with latitude. Since the tilt angle analysis by Howard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">1991b</xref>) was based on white-light images with no magnetic polarity information, the dataset included pseudo-bipoles (e.g., pairs of same-polarity spots) and cannot separate reversed-polarity (anti-Hale) bipoles. Later analysis by Fisher <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1995</xref>) is based on the same dataset used by Howard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">1991a</xref>). They find that the mean tilt of sunspot groups is an increasing function of both latitude and polarity separation, which was used as a proxy for the total magnetic flux (a reasonable assumption, see Section <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">3.1</xref>).</p><p>More recent analyses of Joy’s law have been based on large datasets of magnetograms (SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI data) and used automatic image-processing algorithms (Stenflo and Kosovichev, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2012</xref>; Tlatov <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2013</xref>). Results are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The main difference between the analyses of Stenflo and Kosovichev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2012</xref>) and Tlatov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2013</xref>) is that the former folds all data into one function describing the latitude dependence of the bipole tilt angle, even that of those bipoles which very significantly deviate from Joy’s law (including those with anti-Hale orientation). Tilt angles outside the range [−90°, +90°] have been shifted by 180, and the two hemispheres have been merged by considering the tilt angle positive when the leading spot is closer to the equator than the following spot. The resulting fit function found by Stenflo and Kosovichev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2012</xref>) (<italic>γ</italic> = 32.1° sin <italic>θ</italic>) has impressively low error bars and a small deviation from the data points even at high latitudes (cf. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, left panel). It gives an easy-to-remember rule that the sine of the tilt angle is approximately half of the sine of the corresponding latitude angle. As the angles are relatively small, the relation roughly works between the tilt and latitude angles, too (<italic>γ</italic> ≈ 5° at <italic>θ</italic> = 10°, <italic>γ</italic> ≈ 10° at <italic>θ</italic> = 20°, etc.). These values are significantly higher that the tilt angles found by Howard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">1991b</xref>), but fit quite well to the values found by Brunner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1930</xref>) at the same latitudes. However, the tilt angle-latitude relationship has turned out to be more complicated than the latter analysis has shown when Joy’s law for small bipoles down to the ephemeral region level was studied. Surprisingly, Tlatov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2013</xref>) found that for bipoles with area &lt; 300 MSH, Joy’s law is the opposite of that for bipoles with area above the 300 MSH limit (see Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, right panel). The difference with the results of Stenflo and Kosovichev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2012</xref>) is attributed to a bias owing to inclusion of smaller bipoles in their sample. The higher the latitude, the more dominant the small bipoles and their effect on the average tilt angle becomes according to Tlatov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2013</xref>).

Wilson dataset taken in the period 1917–1985 and made a critical overview of the principle Joy’s law studies. Their main result is a revision of Joy’s law toward a weaker dependence on latitude and without forcing the tilt to zero at the equator. They also confirmed the results by Dasi-Espuig <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>), i.e., that the tilt angle is cycle and hemisphere dependent.

One of the reasons behind the differing results must be data selection that combines bipoles at different stages of their evolution, as we will argue below.</p><p>To what is this systematic tilt due? Babcock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1961</xref>) proposed that the toroidal field created from a poloidal field by differential rotation would not be perfectly toroidal but spiral, retaining a small polar angle. However, he also mentioned that Coriolis forces acting on the fluid upwelling around a BMR could also cause a tilt in the observed direction. Leighton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">1969</xref>) suggested kink deformation of twisted flux tubes as the origin of the tilt. Schmidt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">1968</xref>) and Wang and Sheeley Jr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">1991</xref>) suggested that the tilt is caused by the Coriolis force acting on the expanding plasma contained within a buoyant rising flux tube (i.e., not in the surrounding plasma), which was supported by simulations by D’Silva and Choudhuri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1993</xref>). They showed that the Coriolis force acting on plasma in the rising and expanding Ω loop will tilt the top of the fluxtube clockwise in the northern and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere, leading to an equatorward tilt of the bipole as observed. For more details about the simulation results and theoretical considerations see Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>), Section 5.1.2. Kosovichev and Stenflo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2008</xref>) returned to Babcock’s spiral field idea based on their analysis of tilt evolution during the flux emergence process. They found that tilt did not relax to zero, as one would expect from an E-W toroidal field and tilt imparted by the Coriolis force, which should cease once the top of the flux tube has fully emerged. Most recently, McClintock and Norton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2013</xref>) argued that Joy’s law is due to a combination of both the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux as well as an initial tilt imparted to the flux rope from the toroidal geometry that it retains.</p><p>There is a large scatter in the tilt angle, which in the various studies may have contributions from the following components:

However, the largest ARs again appear to statistically deviate from Joy’s law (see Tlatov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">2010</xref>); Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Polarity separation:</italic> Fisher <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1995</xref>) showed that the mean tilt (<italic>α</italic>) at a given latitude increases with increasing polarity separation (<italic>d</italic>) by Δ<italic>α</italic> ∼ 10° × (<italic>d</italic>/100)<sup>−3/4</sup>, where <italic>d</italic> is in Mm and Δ<italic>α</italic> is in degrees.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Distance from the centroid of the butterfly:</italic> Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>) found that the preferential orientation of ARs and ERs is the strongest at the average latitude of ARs (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>0</sub>); the deviation from this orientation increases with the differential latitude Δ<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Magnetic twist:</italic> a deformation of the flux tube axis (writhe, see Section <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>) may introduce a scatter of the tilt angle due to an intrinsic scatter in the inherent twist (Holder <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2004</xref>) and the weak nature of the hemispheric helicity rule. Furthermore, during the emergence of a twisted flux tube the azimuthal field component in the flux rope shows up in the line-of-sight magnetic field, leading to elongation of the two polarities (López Fuentes <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2000</xref>; Luoni <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2011</xref>), cf. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, upper panels. When magnetograms are used for the determination of tilt angle, these magnetic tongues or tails may mask the tilt angle of the bipole. However, the magnetic tongues retract when the flux rope has crossed the photosphere and this effect disappears.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Holder <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2004</xref>) using a combined dataset of Mt. Wilson full-disc magnetograms and Haleakala Stokes Polarimeter (HSP) vector magnetograms analysed the tilt-twist relationship. They find no inter-dependence of tilt and twist for ARs that obey Joy’s law. These regions are the ones with a weak twist. Regions that significantly depart from Joy’s law (&gt; 6<italic>σ</italic>) show both stronger-than-average twist and a strong inter-dependence of tilt and twist (negative correlation, since the writhe induced by twist, which obeys the hemispheric helicity rule, is of opposite sign to that required by Joy’s law for each hemisphere). They conclude that a substantial fraction of ARs in their dataset show evidence of having gone through the kink instability. Earlier, Tian <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">2001</xref>), using Huairu vector magnetograms of 286 ARs reached an opposite conclusion: they found a positive correlation between tilt and twist (after correcting for their definition of tilt, which results in a sign opposite to that of Holder <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2004</xref>). As Holder <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2004</xref>) remark, Tian <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">2001</xref>) did not take out the mutual latitudinal dependence between twist and tilt, and therefore any signatures of writhing could have been suppressed in their data set. Nandy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2006</xref>), further analysing the dataset used by Holder <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2004</xref>), as well as Yang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276">2009</xref>), analysed the twist-tilt relationship. For further details, see Section <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>. A different approach was taken by Wallace Hartshorn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR261">2012</xref>), who looked for differences in tilt angle between ARs that obey and disobey the hemispheric helicity preference. In a sample of 57 bipolar ARs she found no bimodal distribution of the tilt angle in the two groups. In fact, the tilt angle dependence on latitude in these two groups was exactly the same. This negative result contradicts expectations that kinking due to internal twist may have, statistically, a significant effect on the writhe/tilt angle of ARs.</p><p>Kosovichev and Stenflo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2008</xref>), using the SOHO MDI 96-minute full-disc magnetogram dataset selected 715 isolated ARs, which were born within 30° of the central meridian, and analysed the evolution of their tilt as a function of time, polarity separation and flux content. They found that at the very start of their emergence bipoles are randomly oriented and the preferential tilt angle is only attained by mid emergence, confirming earlier results by Weart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR270">1970</xref>) and Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>). We would like to remark that this fits well with the findings of Fisher <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1995</xref>), who provided evidence that in magnetic data the presence of magnetic tongues in emerging twisted flux tubes (López Fuentes <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2000</xref>; Luoni <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2011</xref>) may modify the tilt angle. Since the tongue-pattern resulting from, e.g., negative/positive twist on the northern/southern hemisphere shifts the centre of gravity of the magnetic polarities introducing an angle that is opposite to that of Joy’s law (cf. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, upper panels). Therefore, the tilt angle of bipoles that obey the hemispheric helicity rule, may be cancelled by this effect during their emergence and the bipole will only gradually assume the Coriolis-induced tilt by the time the tongues have retracted.

The latter is a surprising (and most disappointing) result from the point of view of interpretation of the AR tilt as the effect of the Coriolis force acting on rising and expanding flux tubes in the convection zone, since it contradicts expectations based on modelling results. Fisher <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1995</xref>) derived a function <italic>α</italic> ∼ Φ<sup>1/4</sup> sin <italic>θ</italic> where <italic>α</italic> is the tilt angle, Φ is total flux (although the separation distance <italic>d</italic> was used as a proxy for it), and <italic>θ</italic> is latitude. The expectation is based on the deduction that the higher the magnetic flux, the greater the buoyancy force, and therefore the shorter the rise, i.e., the shorter the time the Coriolis force can act on the rising flux tube. From the lack of dependence of the tilt angle on magnetic flux and because after the emergence stops the Coriolis force vanishes yet the bipoles do not appear to relax to the E-W direction but (statistically) to Joy’s law, Kosovichev and Stenflo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2008</xref>) conclude that “Joy’s law reflects not the dynamics of the rising flux tubes but the spiral orientation of the toroidal magnetic field lines below the surface as suggested by Babcock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1961</xref>)”. As mentioned above, McClintock and Norton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2013</xref>) have endorsed this suggestion.</p><p>Recently, Tlatov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">2010</xref>) studied the latitudinal distribution and orientation of magnetic bipoles during cycles 21–23. The data set included daily observations from Kitt Peak (1975–2002) and MDI/SOHO (1996–2009). Bipole pairs were selected on the basis of proximity and flux balance of two neighbouring flux elements of opposite polarity. Based on their area, the bipoles were classified as small quiet-Sun bipoles (QSBs), ephemeral regions (ERs), and active regions (ARs). Large ERs and ARs were found to follow the Hale-Nicholson polarity rule, and the tilt of ARs follows Joy’s law. The tilt of small ERs, however, appeared to disobey Joy’s law, while QSBs were randomly oriented (Figures <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). A surprising result was that unlike ARs, ERs also show a preference in their orientation depending on the polarity of the large-scale magnetic field. The authors suggested that these orientation properties may indicate that some ERs may form at or near the photosphere via the random encounter of opposite polarity elements, while others may originate in the convection zone at about the same location as ARs.

The effect of turbulent buffeting of rising flux tubes is well demonstrated by departures from Joy’s law which increase with decreasing flux content of the emerging bipole (Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>; Longcope and Fisher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">1996</xref>). Such turbulent perturbations, if created in the topmost layer of the convection zone, should relax rapidly (Longcope and Choudhuri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2002</xref>), which conforms with observations. For a more detailed description of the modelling efforts and theoretical background see Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>). An interesting case study was carried out by González Hernández <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2013</xref>) of AR 11073. Its tilt angle was significantly different from that described by Joy’s law and it showed an anti-clockwise rotation for at least four days between 30 May and 2 June 2010. The authors explored the possibility of the sub-surface local dynamics being responsible for the significant rotation of this AR by applying the ring-diagram technique to infer the flows under and surrounding the AR. They found a good agreement between the direction of sub-surface vorticity and deviation from the tilt angle given by Joy’s law, which is the very first confirmation of the role of sub-surface vortices changing the tilt angle of ARs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Asymmetric proper motion of leading and trailing sunspots</title><p>Proper motion pattern in a complicated active region may look chaotic at first glance. However, when the individual bipoles which build-up the AR are followed from their birth, a system emerges: the opposite polarity spots move apart and the ensuing divergence is rarely symmetric. As a rule, leading or preceding (<italic>p</italic>) sunspots move faster westward than their trailing or following (<italic>f</italic>) counterparts move eastward. This asymmetry in sunspot proper motions has been long known, dating back to Carrington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1863</xref>). Maunder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">1919</xref>) described the phenomenon as follows:
<disp-quote><p>An examination … shows that remarkable action takes place in the early history of several of the principal groups. Two chief spots become distinguishable while the group is still small, of which the one preceding in longitude — the “leader” — moves forward in longitude for several successive days, but with diminishing speed. The rear-spot, on the contrary, retrogrades, or remains stationary in longitude, so that the distance between these two spots increases, and the group lengthens out. The average length of a fully-developed group of this type is from 10° to 12°. The leader-spot increases in area and advances in longitude for a few days, the two changes, in most cases, coming to the end at the same time. The halt of the advance in longitude is, in some instances, very sudden.… After the halt of the leader the decay of the group sets in, but the process is much slower than the growth. The members of the group disappear with the exception of the leader, which generally becomes circular and strongly defined, stable in area, and with a tendency to slow retrogression in longitude.</p></disp-quote></p><p>This early asymmetry in proper motion introduces a bias in the rotation rate of young bipoles, as pointed out by, e.g., Balthasar and Wöhl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1980</xref>) and Ternullo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">1981</xref>). This higher-than-average rotation rate is decreasing with the age of the sunspot group (Tuominen and Virtanen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">1987</xref>). Ruždjak <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2004</xref>) analysed <italic>Greenwich Photoheliographic Results</italic> data for the years 1874 to 1976 to determine rotation velocity evolution for long-lived and short-lived ARs. The rotational velocities were divided into six latitude strips of 5° width and grouped according to the age of the sunspot groups. For 955 recurrent sunspot groups (groups with a lifetime of at least 20 days and reaching areas larger than 200 MSH during their evolution) they found a decrease of the rotational velocities from their emergence to the values approaching the velocities of the photospheric plasma by their 2nd and 3rd rotations. The mean velocity difference was 0.5° day<sup>−1</sup>. They also found that during their emergence phase the long-lived recurrent sunspot groups (sample size: 955) showed higher velocities than the shorter-lived non-recurrent groups (sample size: 13 169) by about 0.15° day<sup>−1</sup>. Statistical analysis of sunspot group rotation rates have their caveats, however. Petrovay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">1993</xref>) pointed out that area weighting of sunspot group positions leads to fake proper motions in the decaying phase of sunspot groups, most prominently in the decay phase due to the faster decay of <italic>f</italic> spots, which will shift the weighted centre of area towards the <italic>p</italic> spots introducing a fake proper motion of the group as a whole in the direction of rotation. This can result in an overestimate of the rotational velocities by several percents.</p><p>Since sunspots appear at the intersection of strong magnetic flux tubes with the photosphere, the motion that we actually observe is merely a series of successive cross-section locations of the rising parent flux tube, therefore the geometry of the flux tube should strongly influence the proper motion pattern. Naturally, flux tubes do not emerge as rigid systems. Strong buoyancy stretches the flux tube, which also breaks up and emerges in pieces (see Section <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref>). Nevertheless, the proper motion pattern of the sunspots, which are forming at the extremes of the emerging flux tube/rope should be influenced by the geometry/inclination to the vertical of the emerging flux tube.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Magnetic helicty</title><p>The most recently recognised intrinsic characteristic of ARs, that potentially has the widest-ranging impact on the activity of ARs, was the recognition that emerging flux is inherently twisted. Leka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1996</xref>) were the first to provide observational evidence for twisted flux emergence, inspiring research contributing to a revival of interest in magnetic helicity. Magnetic helicity is a measure of the shear, twist and linkage of the magnetic field. Magnetic flux emerging with inherent twist has a very important relevance for solar activity: emerging flux carries free magnetic energy ‘ready’ to be released. Photospheric shearing motions, which have been long thought to be the generators of magnetic stresses, may simply reflect the emergence of a twisted structure as successive cross-sections of a helical structure can easily be mis-interpreted as shearing flows (Démoulin and Berger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2003</xref>). Nevertheless, plasma flows do exist on the Sun, therefore their effects on emerged fields should not be dismissed. Rather, twisted flux emergence and large-scale flows are both responsible for the free energy level of magnetic field structures we see on the Sun.</p><p>The widest-documented example of twisted flux emergence was published by Leka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1996</xref>), who presented a careful analysis of flux emergence in AR 7260 utilising multi-wavelength data including Hawaii IVM vector magnetograms.

Furthermore, Schüssler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">1979</xref>) and later Longcope <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">1996</xref>), through MHD simulations, showed that non-twisted flux cannot even make it through the convection zone due to a strong tendency for fragmentation. However, the flux cannot be fragmented by eddies forming in its wake but can remain coherent if it is sufficiently twisted (Moreno-Insertis and Emonet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">1996</xref>). Many other simulations have been carried out since, verifying this result while probing deeper into the details of inherent twist in emerging flux tubes (see, e.g., Murray and Hood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2008</xref>). These simulation results imply that inherent twist is a general property of flux emergence on the Sun, i.e., that all the large-scale flux that has crossed the convection zone must be twisted and therefore must possess magnetic helicity.</p><p>During the last decade, magnetic twist became one of the “buzzwords” of solar physics, igniting many observational, computational and theoretical attempts to understand its broad role in various activity phenomena, e.g., from the formation of <italic>δ</italic> active regions (Linton <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">1999</xref>; Fan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1999</xref>), sigmoids (Titov and Démoulin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">1999</xref>; Magara and Longcope, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2001</xref>) to CMEs (Low, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">1996</xref>; Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002b</xref>).</p><p>Magnetic helicity is a quantitative, mathematical measure of the chiral properties of magnetic structures. Chirality patterns discovered in active regions, coronal loops, filaments, coronal arcades and interplanetary magnetic clouds (Pevtsov and Balasubramaniam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2003</xref>, and references therein) indicate that the Sun preferentially exhibits left-handed chirality in features in the northern hemisphere and right-handed features in the south. A right-handed twist manifests itself in coronal loops that curve in a clockwise sense when viewed from above and this implies positive helicity, and vice versa for negative helicity. Exceptions to these helicity rules occur in most categories of solar activity at a significant percentage (20–35%). Nevertheless, the Sun’s preference for features adhering to these rules is suggestive of an underlying mechanism that is, evidently, global in scope. Nandy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2006</xref>), deriving the twist in a large sample of active regions from vector magnetograms, found the dispersion in the active region twist distribution is latitude-independent. The amplitude and dispersion of twist was found to decrease with increasing magnetic size of active regions, supporting the ∑-effect model, which invokes helical turbulent buffeting in the convection zone of rising flux tubes as the mechanism for twist creation (Longcope and Fisher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">1996</xref>; Longcope <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">1998</xref>).</p><p>The exception to the hemispheric helicity rule rate depends on the evolutionary stage of the active region. It is high when active regions first emerge. Luoni <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2011</xref>) determined the helicity sign of 40 active regions during the emergence phase as inferred from the shape of the AR’s magnetic tongues and found that 63% of southern hemisphere active regions follow the hemispheric trend and only 57% of regions in the northern hemisphere do. Yang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276">2009</xref>) found that 57.6% (56%) of emerging active regions in the southern (northern) hemisphere follow the helicity trend when using the method of Chae <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>) to determine the helicity of the region. In a study that involved a broader spectrum of active regions (not only emerging active regions), Pevtsov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">1995</xref>) used the linear force-free field alpha-coefficient to determine the sign of helicity and found a stronger hemispheric helicity trend where 69% (75%) of northern (southern) regions had negative (positive) helicity. The exception to the hemispheric helicity rule rate continues to decrease as the active region flux ages, dispersing its magnetic flux and eventually disappearing, so that most quiet sun filaments fit the hemispheric rule with a very strong tendency of high-latitude filaments fitting the rule — dextral (negative helicity) in the north and sinistral (positive helicity) in the south, (Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">1992</xref>).</p><p>This is probably owing to the effect of reconnection between magnetic flux containing opposite magnetic helicity that removes equal amounts of helicity of both signs so that the once weak preference for a helicity sign becomes dominant. The slowly increasing effect of differential rotation may also play a significant role, as this injects negative helicity in the northern and positive in the southern hemisphere. However, it is noteworthy that helicity injection by differential rotation is dependent on the orientation of the bipole, and it even changes sign if the bipole has a larger than 45° tilt angle to the equator (Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2002a</xref>).</p><p>3-D spherical shell anelastic MHD simulations of the buoyant rise of magnetic flux tubes through the convection zone by Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2008</xref>), however, indicate that the initial level of twist must be lower than previously thought. These 3-D simulations show that for tubes with the twist level that is necessary for a cohesive rise, the twist-induced tilt (deformation of the flux tube at its apex) dominates that caused by the Coriolis force, and furthermore, the twist-induced tilt is of the wrong direction (opposite to the observational Joy’s law) if the twist is left-handed (right-handed) in the northern (southern) hemisphere, following the observed hemispheric preference of the sign of the active region twist. In order for the emerging tube to show the correct tilt direction (consistent with observations), the initial twist rate of the flux tube needs to be less than half of that needed for a cohesive rise. Under such conditions, severe flux loss was found during the rise, with less than 50% of the initial flux remaining in the Ω-tube by the time it reaches the surface. This result by Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2008</xref>) may explain the low level twist in active regions deduced from current helicity measurements (Longcope <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Peculiality of flux emergence phase: serpentine flux tubes</title><p>The model of active region formation via the emergence of a coherent sub-photospheric Ω-shaped flux rope (Zwaan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR290">1985</xref>) has been further developed into a scenario where the flux rope is shredded before its passage across the photosphere; an idea driven by observations with sufficient spatial resolution that shows that the first emergence is composed of a series of very small magnetic bipoles in between the main coalescing and diverging polarities (Strous <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">1996</xref>; Strous and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">1999</xref>). This characteristic observation of emerging ARs suggests that the magnetic Ω-loop, which breaks through the photosphere and emerges into the chromosphere and corona, is broken into nearly parallel strands, but somewhere, not very deep under the surface, at least part of the flux bundle joins and is being held together, as indicated by the coalescence of the majority of the flux as the emergence proceeds.</p><p>The fragmentation of the Ω-loop is likely to occur just under the photosphere and indicates the difficulties that a flux tube has in crossing from the convective zone into the solar atmosphere. The rapidly changing physical conditions at the top of the convective zone, where the plasma pressure, density and temperature drop by several orders of magnitude, means that the Ω-loop rapidly loses its buoyancy. The top portion of the Ω-loop becomes denser than its surroundings as it approaches the top of the convective zone, its rise stops, and magnetic flux piles up under the photosphere. Here, the flux takes on an undulatory (serpentine) shape due to the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Parker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">1966</xref>) and the effects of convective flows (Cheung <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>).</p><p>A wave-like pattern in the emergence sites (Strous and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">1999</xref>) indicates that the strands of the shreaded flux tube emerge at several places, like a sea-serpent, creating a mixed polarity field. Wang and Zirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262">1992</xref>) remarked that in this mixed polarity field a substantial amount of flux is cancelled. If, however, we indeed witness the emergence of an undulatory flux tube, at least part of the cancellation may be due to the emergence of small U-loops, i.e., the straightening out of the wavy flux tube as it finally breaks through the photosphere. Such a scenario may show up in the evolution of arch filaments (Georgakilas <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1993</xref>). High temporal and spatial resolution vector magnetic, Ha and Ca <sc>i</sc> 6122.2 Å Doppler observations of the <italic>Flare Genesis</italic> balloon-borne experiment confirmed the sea-serpent topology during the early phases of emerging flux tubes (Bernasconi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>). With magnetic extrapolations, elongated flux tubes linking a series of bald patches (in which field lines are tangent to the photosphere) were found in the emerging flux region observed by <italic>Flare Genesis</italic> (Pariat <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2004</xref>) and also in another emerging AR (Mandrini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2002</xref>), which are very suggestive of the sea-serpent topology.</p><p>However, the serpentine flux may carry a significant amount of plasma (Cheung <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>) which will drain into the U-loop sections of the serpentine field and which must be unloaded from the field lines before a buoyant emergence into the solar atmosphere can resume following the sub-photospheric pile-up. A data driven 3D numerical simulation of the emergence of a serpentine field shows that electric currents build up along the separatix surface that forms along the field, and photospheric shearing motions lead to magnetic reconnection in the bald patch sections (Pariat <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2009</xref>). This reconnection produces the observational signature of Ellerman Bombs (Ellerman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1917</xref>) and disconnects the U-loop sections of the field which contain the dense plasma, allowing the serpentine field to emerge (Pariat <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2004</xref>). Flux cancellation would also be observed in this scenario. The undulatory serpentine flux takes on the global Ω-loop shape of the active region only after successive reconnection events. This flux emergence scenario is also found in the 3D radiative numerical simulation of Cheung <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>).</p><p>A study by Valori <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">2012</xref>) brought together non-linear force-free field modelling and local correlation tracking of the photospheric flow patterns with high resolution coronal imaging and spectroscopic observations of the emergence of AR 11024. The flow patterns in this AR revealed converging motions of opposite magnetic polarities in the U-loop sections followed by flux cancellation, indicative of magnetic reconnection. The global analysis of the reconstructed magnetic field of the active region supports the transformation of the serpentine field into the global field of the active region via successive reconnection events.</p><p>Given this flux emergence scenario, there still remains the question of how the undulatory/serpentine flux influences the signed/unsigned flux of the whole active region? This must depend on the resolution of the magnetograms, but the increase of flux should be steeper at the start of the emergence phase due to the fact that the same flux tube may surface, and therefore its flux is measured, several times. Magnetic flux measurements during the full emergence-period with changing (rebinned) resolution would be very enlightening.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Clustering or nesting tendency of flux emergence</title><p>As was mentioned in Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">1.3</xref>, the first note on the clustering tendency of sunspot appearances was made by Cassini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1729</xref>). Ribes and Nesme-Ribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1993</xref>) cited his description of the phenomena as follows: “There is some reason to believe there exist special locations in the Sun that are propitious for the formation of spots, which do not stray far from their point of origin”.</p><p>ARs tend to emerge in the immediate vicinity or within the boundaries of an existing AR (Bumba and Howard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1969</xref>). Liggett and Zirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">1985</xref>) and later Harvey and Zwaan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1993</xref>) showed that there is a 10 to 22-fold higher emergence rate within existing ARs than in the quiet sun. Furthermore, there is a tendency for ARs to emerge in the immediate vicinity of an existing AR, or at the site of a previous AR, forming “activity nests”, which may exist as long as 6–7 months (Brouwer and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1990</xref>). The longest-lived activity complex of cycle 21, called the “Great Complex”, persisted for 20 solar rotations, consisted of 29 major ARs (i.e., having spots of life time ≥ 7 days with penumbrae) and spanned about 90° in longitude (Gaizauskas <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2001</xref>; Gaizauskas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>). In active nests or activity complexes there is a continuity of major flux emergence in close proximity for 3–6 months, and total magnetic flux may reach 2 × 10<sup>23</sup> Mx, though smaller nests contain less flux. Magnetic flux is nearly balanced in nests and most of the flux is canceled <italic>within</italic> the boundary of the nest, never diffusing out of it (Gaizauskas <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1983</xref>). However, significant polarity separation can result from very effective cancellation processes in the interior of the nest, creating strong monopolar flux areas at/along its boundaries, which will diffuse; each will be carried by meridional flows and distorted by differential rotation, creating strong poleward “plumes” of magnetic field(s) (Gaizauskas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>). When a nest exhibits a local flux imbalance, the diffusing weak magnetic flux, which can be as much as that of a major AR, i.e., ≥ 10<sup>22</sup> Mx, will be the source of a single-polarity poleward plume, which may build or erode polar fields. Opposite-polarity monopolar plumes produced by neighbouring nests form the largest (comparable to the solar radius) and longest-lived quiescent filaments (Gaizauskas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>).</p><p>The nested nature of flux emergence is very strong, nearly 50% of all emergent bipoles are part of an active nest or activity complex (Schrijver and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2000</xref>). The recurrent nature of flux emergence (called “active longitudes”, by Carrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1858</xref>), has been linked to longitudinal wave numbers of magnetic instabilities in a concentrated toroidal field (Gilman and Dikpati, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2000</xref>) and more recently to shallow-water instability of differential rotation and toroidal field bands in the solar tachocline (Dikpati and Gilman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2005</xref>). They have also been linked to the non-axisymmetric nature of the solar magnetic fields (Benevolenskaya, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>). For more details on cycle dependence, periodicities, rotation rates and multi-wavelength studies of activity complexes see Benevolenskaya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>).</p><p>The nested nature of flux emergence is reflected in the formation of some of the large, magnetically complex ARs as several bipolar ARs emerge separated, but in close proximity and in close succession within a few days (Schrijver and Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2000</xref>). Magnetic complexity and activity levels are closely linked.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Decay Phase and the Removal of Magnetic Flux from the Photosphere</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Lifetime of sunspots</title><p>There is a notable asymmetry in the time spent by an active region in emergence and decay: emergence lasts for hours to days (≤ 5 days; Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1993</xref>), while the decay of spots may last from days to several weeks (e.g., Hathaway and Choudhary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2008</xref>) and even in some cases months (van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">1999a</xref>). Once all the magnetic flux has emerged, or possibly even before that (McIntosh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1981</xref>; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263">1991</xref>), active regions start to decay. After sunspots reach maximum area, partially through coalescence of smaller umbrae, spots start shrinking and breaking up indicating that processes begin to occur that erode and fragment the once coherent large-scale magnetic flux concentration. See the Living Review by Rempel and Schlichenmaier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2011</xref>) for the theory of sunspots.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Moving magnetic features</title><p>Decaying sunspots that are (at least) partly surrounded by a moat can show streams of small (10<sup>3</sup> km diameter) low magnetic flux fragments (10<sup>18</sup>–10<sup>19</sup> Mx) that move radially outwards from the spot at speeds of around 1 km s<sup>−1</sup> (Sheeley Jr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">1969</xref>; Harvey and Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1973</xref>; Hagenaar and Shine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2005</xref>), advected outward by the moat flow. These features have been named moving magnetic features (MMFs) by Harvey and Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1973</xref>) who found in their study of 37 decaying spots that 21 showed MMFs. At the edge of the moat the MMFs disappear or merge into the network. There appear to be two types of MMF; unipolar ones, which have the same magnetic polarity as the sunspot, and bipolar ones (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR283">1992</xref>).</p><p>The bipolar MMFs are not randomly orientated, but instead are aligned so that a line connecting between the centres of each polarity is roughly parallel to the radial of the sunspot, with some MMFs’ orientation reflecting the twist in the sunspot penumbral magnetic field (Yurchyshyn and Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281">2001</xref>). In most cases, it is the bipolar MMF fragment furthest from the sunspot that has the same magnetic polarity as the sunspot (Yurchyshyn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR282">2001</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2003</xref>). Such an orientation suggests that MMFs are formed either by U-loops in a field that originates in the canopy emanating from the sunspot which has formed dips that reach down to to the photosphere (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2003</xref>; Bernasconi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>), or by Ω-loop sections of flux that have detached themselves from the sub-photospheric portion of the sunspot that have subsequently risen to the photosphere to form a sea-serpent (Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273">1973</xref>; Spruit <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">1987</xref>). In this case the field remains attached to the spot at the photospheric level but the flux concentration below the photosphere is being eroded. For the bipolar MMFs where the leading polarity is opposite to that of the sunspot, flux originating in the sunspot’s canopy could be dipping down into the photosphere so that the MMF dipole is formed by Ω-loops and their outward flow could be directly peeling away from the spot at the photospheric level (Harvey and Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1973</xref>) and fully detaching the field from the spot. The first appearance of MMFs can be outside of the sunspot penumbral boundary (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2003</xref>) or inside the penumbra (Sainz Dalda and Martínez Pillet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2005</xref>) and an MMF mechanism that invokes the propagation of a kink along a highly-inclined field, rather than sunspot decay, has also been proposed (Ryutova and Hagenaar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite the inherent difficulties in quantitative studies of MMFs, due to their small spatial scale, short lifetimes (few hours, Vrabec, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258">1974</xref>) and ability to merge, the idea that MMFs transport flux away from the spot at the same rate at which flux in the spot is decreasing has been suggested (Harvey and Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1973</xref>) and accepted by many. However, conclusive evidence that all MMFs are indeed detaching flux from the periphery of the spot at the photospheric or sub-photospheric level has not yet been provided. The study by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR283">1992</xref>) shows that only the unipolar MMFs may remove flux from the spot, whereas bipolar MMFs do not. There are also cases where spots that show MMF activity remain as coherent structures over relatively long timescales. For example, the negative polarity sunspot of NOAA active region 10923 that produced MMFs (Sainz Dalda and Bellot Rubio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2008</xref>) and which returned as a still coherent spot in NOAA active regions 10930, 10935 and 10941; lasting on the Sun for three months. The underlying mechanisms that produce MMFs and their relationship to sunspot decay are still to be fully understood.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Fragmentation of sunspots and the re-establishment of convection: umbral dots and light-bridges</title><p>The magnetic field of an active region is dominated by its sunspots.

In order for active regions to decay through advection, processes that are able to break up the intense ≤ kG field of the monolithic magnetic structure of sunspots into weaker flux fragments must first become significant. In the model that describes sunspots as being composed of a closely packed collection of vertical magnetic field bundles, the weak points may lie in (relatively small) field-free regions between the bundles. In these field-free regions over-turning convection can be re-established. Indeed, the umbra of sunspots do require some level of convection to maintain their temperature of ∼ 4000 K and sub-structure in the form of umbral dots — bright spots — indicates small patches of enhanced temperature plasma where convection is thought to be occurring. For a more detailed discussion on the physical drivers of umbral dots see the Living Review by Borrero and Ichimoto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>).</p><p>An indication that large-scale circulation patterns may be important in the break-up of spots was found by Bumba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1965a</xref>), showing evidence for an association between light-bridges within spots and the supergranulation pattern. Light bridges are bright lanes that connect from one side of the sunspot to the other and which split the sunspot into smaller sections (Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). The presence of a light bridge does not necessarily mean the spot is breaking up though. Narrow light bridges that form during a spot’s intermediate stages (C to G by the Zurich classification) can disappear within a day (Vazquez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">1973</xref>). However, thicker/wider light bridges that appear when a spot is past its maximum development show a granular structure similar to the spot-free photosphere (Bray and Loughhead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1964</xref>) and the spot decays and evolves to become type G or H (Vazquez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">1973</xref>). The exact role of light bridges in the decay of sunspots is still an open question. Indeed, Louis <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2012</xref>) find that although light bridges may be necessary for the break-up of spots, they are not sufficient to cause the fragmentation.

They showed that as regions decay, their leading and following polarities exhibit different dissipation rates: the less closely packed polarity tends to dissipate faster than compact polarity. As a consequence, a gradual increase in flux imbalance inside a dissipating bipolar region developed, and later a formation of a CH in place of more compact magnetic flux. The total magnetic flux within the new CH represents a significant fraction of the AR’s flux. The article’s main focus is on CH formation, which must indeed be part of active region evolution and decay process, but they also register some other aspects of the decay process.</p><p>Limb-to limb signed magnetic flux measurements of slowly-evolving decaying regions were used by Karachik <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2010</xref>) to determine the mean inclination γ of magnetic vector in the polarities of these bipolar ARs from the central meridian distance (CMD) where each polarity reached maximum: <italic>B</italic><sub>∥</sub>(CMD) = <italic>B</italic><sub>0</sub> cos(CMD − γ), where <italic>B</italic><sub>0</sub> is the flux along the axis of the flux tube. The magnetic field measurements were done over a rectangular area containing the decaying ARs. There is no mention of background flux subtraction nor of the size of the box (whether it was of constant area or adjusted to the increasing dimensions of the diffusing AR), which can very well influence the measured flux decay rate, i.e., from a small box flux is diffusing out, while a box of varying size includes a varying amount of “background” field. When an AR emerges into a pre-existing monopolar area (plage field), a polarity imbalance of the bipole can develop as the emerging bipole’s polarity opposite to that of the background field will cancel with the latter. With these potential limitations, Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows two of the decaying ARs for which flux measurements, compactness on consecutive rotations were made.

Each MDI map was de-rotated to the central meridian, correcting for area-foreshortening, and measurements were taken over a fixed-area box of 181 × 126 pixels (pixel size: 1.977″ centred on the AR). The area fully covered the AR from start to end. During the four days analysed, the polarity separation increased by 18%, from 68 000 to 80 000 km. The total unsigned magnetic flux (a sum of the signed fluxes) increased during the 1st day by about 5%, reaching 1.1 × 10<sup>22</sup> Mx, attributed to the emergence of an ER, and then was decreasing over the following days at a rate of 8% day<sup>−1</sup>. Polarity imbalance was negative, varying between 4–10%, due to dominantly negative surrounding magnetic fields. For the modelling the imbalance was removed from each magnetic map, which implied a correction of |6| G, comparable to the noise level of ±9 G. The evolution of the AR is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>. Note that no systematic shearing or twisting motions are present. The motions seen all appear to result from buffeting by supergranular flows. Differential rotation should also have some effect due to the large latitudinal extent (≈ 10 heliographic degrees) of the AR. The flux decay is primarily due to cancellations along the magnetic inversion line of the AR, driven by converging motions of opposite polarities resulting from the dispersal of both polarities reflected in the growing polarity separation.

The novelty of their modelling is that it is data-driven: the successive magnetograms drive the evolution of the coronal magnetic fields between successive force-free equilibria. When the initial coronal field was taken to be potential, the small-scale motions were found to inject ≈ 2.5 × 10<sup>25</sup> erg s<sup>−1</sup> of free magnetic energy, which was stored in the corona at low height, below 30 Mm. The initial field’s deviation from the potential did not seem to have a significant effect on the energy injection rate. Over its assumed life-time (9–10 days) a free energy injection by small-scale motions 10% of that of the potential field was found, which was consistent with energy estimates derived from Poynting flux calculations. Such an amount of energy is sufficient to balance radiative losses at million-degree coronal temperatures within the AR (≈ 1 × 10<sup>25</sup> erg s<sup>−1</sup>). The relative magnetic helicity injected by random motions into the coronal field is nearly balanced in sign, but the converging motions toward the inversion line, the global separation of magnetic polarities as well as differential rotation acting together introduce a low net positive helicity, consistent with the hemispheric helicity pattern (being positive in the southern hemisphere). The net helicity injection rate of 1.218 × 10<sup>34</sup> Mx<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> that totals at ≈ 2.5 × 10<sup>39</sup> Mx<sup>2</sup> over the four days analysed. We note that supposing that a CME carries away 10<sup>42</sup> Mx<sup>2</sup> helicity (DeVore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2000</xref>), this helicity injection rate would require 950 days (2.6 years) to accumulate enough helicity for a CME. However, as we discuss elsewhere, ARs do emerge in a non-potential state. The helicity injection discussed here is either building or removing that of the active region. MHD simulations based on flux cancellation leading to flux rope formation for simplicity start from a potential configuration and can only achieve an eruption when they include significant shearing or twisting of the coronal field (Amari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Yeates and Mackay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">2009</xref>; Yeates <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">2010</xref>; Amari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Aulanier <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). With the aim to understand CMEs occurring during the decay phase of ARs, the Flux Cancellation Model (FCM) has been developed (Forbes and Isenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">1991</xref>; Amari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Yeates and Mackay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">2009</xref>; Yeates <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">2010</xref>; Amari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Aulanier <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>).</p><p>Most of the FCMs are computed in bipolar configuration. Amari <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>) show that in a more complex (quadrupolar) configuration the model works just as well, though the field evolution and flux rope formation due to cancellation is slow. However, the presence of an X-point above the twisted flux rope facilitates eruption due to the weaker confinement near this point, i.e., the flux-cancellation and break-out (Antiochos <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>) models are not exclusive, but can work in combination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Dispersal of the active region magnetic field</title><p>Once the magnetic fields of active regions become weak enough to be susceptible to photospheric plasma flows, the fields start to be shaped by convective flows in the first instance. The advection of a magnetic field by supergranular flows carves out relatively free-field regions as it sweeps the flux to the cell edges. Differential rotation and meridional flows become significant in the longer-term. Normally the following spot (which emerges with a more dispersed nature than the leading spot) breaks apart first.</p><p>Active regions, even after the disappearance of their spots, remain distinguishable from their magnetic environment for up to seven months while their magnetic flux in a magnetically undisturbed environment during solar minimum spreads over an ever-increasing area (see, e.g., Figures <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref> and <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref> [upper panel] and see also van Driel-Gesztelyi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">1998</xref>) forming large bipolar regions that slowly become part of the “background field”.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Disconnection from toroidal roots</title><p>During the decay phase of active regions, observations of the motion of the photospheric magnetic field strongly suggest that it rapidly loses its original connectivity to the toroidal flux layer at the base of the convection zone. Whereas the separation and proper motion of opposite polarity sunspots during the emergence phase is indicative of the emergence of the top portion of an Ω-shaped flux tube passing through the photosphere, after a few days this motion ceases. From then on the spots (i.e., the intersection of the two vertical legs of the omega loop) stop separating from each other, fragment and advection by photospheric plasma flows passively disperses the magnetic flux over a larger and larger area as described in Section <xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">4.5</xref>. This evolution requires that a subsurface disconnection from the toroidal belt has occurred because the (horizontal) magnetic tension from a continued connection to the toroidal flux at the base of the convection zone would drive the sunspots apart for much longer than is actually observed (van Ballegooijen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">1982</xref>; Rempel and Schlichenmaier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2011</xref>; Schüssler and Rempel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2005</xref>).</p><p>Schrijver and Title (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">1999</xref>) estimated the time necessary for the flux tube of an AR to get disconnected from its toroidal roots is <italic>t</italic><sub>AR</sub> (days) = 15ϕ/10<sup>21</sup> Mx, where ϕ is the total magnetic flux of the AR. This estimate gives a disconnection time of ≈ 5 months for a major AR.</p><p>The mechanism by which this disconnection occurs is still an open question, but recent work points towards the role of an ‘explosion’ of the magnetic field below the photosphere and/or an increase in plasma pressure so that the equipartition value is reached. Then, external convective motions are able to control the evolution of the sub-surface flux tube, perhaps a few Mm below the photosphere, and the upper, emerged, part loses knowledge of its connection at the base of the convective zone (Fan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1994</xref>; Moreno-Insertis <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">1995</xref>; Schüssler and Rempel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2005</xref>). The photospheric field is then effectively disconnected from its roots. An alternative mechanism is that the photospheric field directly loses its connection to the toroidal flux as a result of magnetic reconnection that is driven as converging convective flows distort and collide (nearly) anti-parallel strands of magnetic flux (Schrijver and Title, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">1999</xref>). For the active region to become disconnected, this process must be very efficient and be able to involve the majority of the flux of the active region. Such an idea may be investigated by the search for systematic and organised converging flows in the convective zone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Flux cancellation and removal of flux from the photosphere</title><p>Once the magnetic field of an active region starts to be fragmented and advected by plasma flows, the likelihood that opposite polarity fragments will collide and undergo magnetic reconnection increases. The observational signature of this process is known as flux cancellation — small-scale opposite polarity fragments (measured in the line-of-sight magnetic field component at the photosphere) converge, collide and disappear from the line-of-sight photospheric magnetograph data (Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1985</xref>). The mechanism that drives this phenomenon was developed by van Ballegooijen and Martens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>). It is the result of magnetic reconnection taking place in the lower atmosphere between the converging opposite polarity fragments, each fragment being a footpoint of a sheared loop that crosses the PIL (Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">1987</xref>; van Ballegooijen and Martens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>). Recent results indicate that the reconnection is occurring in the photosphere (Yurchyshyn and Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281">2001</xref>; Bellot Rubio and Beck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>). The post-reconnection configuration is then a very small magnetic loop that connects between the polarities that collided and a much longer loop that connects the remote footpoints. The small radius of curvature of the small loop pulls it under the photosphere via the magnetic tension force and the associated small bipole disappears from view. As flux cancellation can only remove an equal amount of flux from each polarity, in cases of unequal flux within the canceling bipole, the larger polarity survives.</p><p>Flux cancellation can occur whenever opposite polarity fragments collide. This could be along the internal polarity inversion line of the active region or around the periphery for bipolar active regions. If the active region is more magnetically complex, flux cancellation may be happening at many sites across the region and will act to reduce this complexity. Only if the active region is part of an active nest, and therefore a place of repeated large-scale flux emergence, can the magnetic complexity be maintained. In this case, however, the evolution of the individual bipoles can be significantly shortened by flux cancellation.</p><p>A significant amount of flux can be lost from the photospheric field through flux cancellation. Baker <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>) and Sterling <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">2010</xref>) studied different regions that both showed that 20% of the flux was lost over just two days and Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2011</xref>) tracked an active region from emergence to decay and found that 34% of the active region flux was cancelled along the active region’s internal polarity inversion within 3.5 days of the flux emergence ending.</p><p>We have to remark that the detection of flux disappearance from the photosphere, besides flux cancellation/submergence, can also be the result of a process that merely disperses the previously detected flux so that it becomes too small and too weak to be detected, rather than completely eliminating it. Lamb <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2013</xref>), analysing flux disappearance in <italic>Hinode</italic>/SOT/NFI magnetograms, concluded that dispersal of flux to smaller scales is more important for the replacement of magnetic fields in the quiet Sun than observed bipolar cancellation. This suggests that processes on spatial scales smaller than those visible to <italic>Hinode</italic> dominate the flux removal process. However, conditions in evolving active regions, especially along their magnetic inversion line, are different, and there it is most likely that their magnetic cancellation dominates on observable scales.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>The build-up of magnetic flux ropes and filaments</title><p>While the decay phase is marked by a decrease of magnetic flux density accompanied by a decrease of all plasma parameters (temperature, emission measure, pressure; van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">2003b</xref>) there is a remarkable growing feature in the AR. Filaments, which are absent, or if present, are short and variable when the AR is young, become stable and can reach a length of 10<sup>5</sup> km or more, becoming increasingly parallel to the equator. During this time the magnetic configuration of the active region slowly evolves and becomes conducive to the formation of magnetic flux ropes that can support filament material. The flare activity is fast disappearing with the decrease of magnetic flux density, but coronal mass ejections occur during the decay phase of the active region due to the repeated formation and eruption of magnetic flux ropes.</p><p>The ongoing fragmentation and dispersal of an active region by convective flows and differential rotation spreads out its magnetic field in all directions. Whilst this gradually increases the spatial extent of the active region over time and reduces its flux density, it will also bring opposite polarity fragments together along the active region’s internal PIL and PILs that separate the active region field from opposite polarity regions surrounding it. When small-scale opposite polarity fragments (measured in the line-of-sight magnetic field component at the photosphere) meet at a PIL they have been observed to undergo what has become known as ‘flux cancellation’; the fragments collide and subsequently disappear from the line-of-sight photospheric magnetograph data (Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1985</xref>). In this way, flux cancellation removes magnetic flux from the photosphere. Although flux cancellation can occur anywhere where opposite polarity fragments collide, this section looks specifically at flux cancellation along the active region’s PIL (and assuming that the decaying region is bipolar) and the important consequences for the reconfiguration of the overlying coronal field.</p><p>The physical mechanism behind flux cancellation is resistive in nature. It is the result of magnetic reconnection taking place in the lower atmosphere between the converging opposite polarity fragments, each fragment being a footpoint of a sheared loop that crosses the PIL (Zwaan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">1987</xref>; van Ballegooijen and Martens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>). The weak shear that is present in the decay phase is a combination of the original non-potentiality the active region emerged with Leka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1996</xref>) and the action of differential rotation on the evolving bipole, which is a slow process. Furthermore, shear originating from these two processes can be of opposite sign (Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2002a</xref>). The post-reconnection configuration is a very small magnetic loop that connects between the polarities that collided and a much longer loop that connects the remote footpoints. Depending on the height at which the reconnection occurs the disappearance of the radial flux threading the photosphere can be either the submergence of the very small loop or the rise of the long loop that would contain a concave-up section. In either case a loop moves through the layer where the magnetic field is measured and the associated small bipole disappears from view.</p><p>At what height does the magnetic reconnection occur? Observations mostly support the scenario where magnetic reconnection occurs in an atmospheric layer above that where the magnetic field measurements are being made (Harvey <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1999</xref>; Yurchyshyn and Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281">2001</xref>; Bellot Rubio and Beck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>). The small post-reconnection loop must have a sufficiently small radius of curvature for it to submerge beneath the solar surface as a result of its high magnetic tension force. What is important for the discussion here is that what remains in the solar atmosphere is a long loop that is highly sheared with respect to the PIL.</p><p>The details of how the coronal magnetic field evolves as flux cancellation proceeds in the photosphere/chromosphere have been realised in van Ballegooijen and Martens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>). They consider what happens when the photospheric flows both shear and converge magnetic fragments toward the PIL.</p><p>Sustained flux cancellation is a mechanism by which the free magnetic energy in the coronal field is redistributed in coronal volume, becoming more concentrated above the PIL. Sheared magnetic field accumulates along the PIL and the small loops that submerge after reconnection are likely to be perpendicular to the PIL and close to a potential state. Their submergence removes nearly potential field from the corona leaving the non-potential field behind (van Ballegooijen and Martens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>; Welsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR271">2006</xref>). In this way, flux cancellation can provide energy for the activity that takes place in decaying active regions.</p><p>More than this though, is that flux cancellation can build the specific topology of a magnetic flux rope (van Ballegooijen and Martens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>). This magnetic configuration is important as it can support relatively cool and dense plasma to form a filament and also provides a magnetic configuration that can evolve and become unstable, explaining the occurrence of filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections (CMEs, Hood and Priest, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1981</xref>; Kliem and Török, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2006</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref> shows how flux cancellation initially leads to the accumulation of a highly-sheared field along the PIL forming axial flux of the rope, and then to a helical field that wraps itself around the axial flux and in doing so adds poloidal flux to the rope.

Highly sheared loops are observed in the core of decaying active regions, while the more external loops are nearly potential, i.e., there is a gradient of non-potentiality within the AR away from the inversion line (Schmieder <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">1996</xref>). However, this represents only the first phase of the scenario of van Ballegooijen and Martens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>); the second phase being the creation of helical field lines that define the flux rope. Since we are currently unable to directly observe the coronal magnetic field in any routine and systematic way, what is the observational support for the formation of helical field lines around the accumulated sheared field via flux cancellation?</p><p>One observational approach is to study the horizontal component of the vector magnetic field data at the PIL. If it is inversely directed along a section of the PIL, it suggests the presence of a ‘bald patch’ formed by a concave-up configuration produced by the field lines at the bottom of a flux rope if the rope reaches down to the photosphere (Athay <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1983</xref>; Lites, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2005</xref>; Canou <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). Another approach is to study continuous S-shaped (sigmoidal) sources of X-ray and EUV emission, which follow the magnetic field lines, and which exhibit an inverse crossing of the PIL in the centre of the sigmoid — indicating that they are created by helical magnetic configurations (Green and Kliem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2009</xref>).</p><p>Work that studies the formation of sigmoidal structures in decaying active regions indicates that the coronal field does indeed evolve as described by van Ballegooijen and Martens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>). Whilst observations of the line-of-sight magnetic field at the photosphere comprises many cancellation events of flux fragments along the PIL, an initially weakly sheared arcade of loops, observed in soft X-rays, evolves through three phases. Phase one is a phase of increasing shear driven by the dispersal and cancellation of flux; in phase two there is an accumulation of a significant amount of flux that runs almost parallel to the PIL (axial flux) so that a remnant active region field that has not yet been involved in flux cancellation, takes on the appearance of two J’s either side of the axial flux; phase three involves further flux cancellation that produces field lines that are twisted around the axial flux (which look S-shaped) and which contribute poloidal flux and define the presence of a flux rope (Green and Kliem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>, see Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). In light of this, sigmoids formed in decaying active regions that contain continuous S-shaped structures that have an inverse crossing of the PIL by the middle, bracketed by two regular PIL crossings by the sigmoid elbows show support for the presence of a flux rope (Green and Kliem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2009</xref>). Such an understanding of the magnetic configuration helps explain why sigmoidal active regions have such a high tendency to produce coronal mass ejections (Canfield <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>).

All regions exhibited flux cancellation along the PIL. The models showed that the active regions first developed a strong axial field and then, as flux cancellation proceeded, long S-shaped field lines that wrap around the axial field formed. The models allow a much deeper analysis of the magnetic configuration than can be carried out by observations alone and revealed that the dips in the S-shaped field lines were located at the sites of flux cancellation as is expected from the van Ballegooijen and Martens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1989</xref>) model.</p><p>Such models also allow the study of the evolution of the free magnetic energy and helicity in the regions. The models showed that as flux cancellation proceeded, the potential energy of the coronal field decreases. In addition, the times of CMEs from the active region were determined and a series of models were constructed in the time leading up to four CMEs. In three out of the four CMEs, the free magnetic energy and helicity show increases as expected (Welsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR271">2006</xref>).</p><p>The flux cancellation process that builds the flux rope can also be used to investigate how much flux has been built into the flux rope by the time of the CME versus that in the overlying field that acts to provide a downward tension force, inhibiting the eruption of the flux rope (Green <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2011</xref>). Flux cancellation provides a way to investigate the onset of the loss of equilibrium/ideal instability on the real Sun.</p><p>Numerical models of flux ropes in decaying active regions have made predictions about the amount of axial and poloidal flux that a rope can contain in relation to that of the stabilising overlying active region arcade field before the rope becomes unstable and erupts as a CME. The flux rope insertion method allows a flux rope to be inserted above and along the PIL in the extrapolated potential field of an active region.

This contrasts sharply with Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2011</xref>), who showed, using an observational study, that a flux rope formed by flux cancellation may contain as much as 60% of the unsigned flux of the active region.</p><p>Savcheva <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2012</xref>) carried out a study to try and reconcile the above discrepancy between the observational value of flux rope flux content and that found for a modelled flux rope. The results for four flux ropes for which it was possible to compare the rope’s axial flux to the unsigned flux of the active region just before the eruption showed the ratios 18%, 16%, 58% and 50%. The region studied in Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2011</xref>) was also modelled and there was an excellent agreement in the value found between these two approaches.</p><p>The reasons for this broad range of ratios may lie in the different specific configurations of the flux rope itself and the active-region magnetic field that then influences the profile of the magnetic field overlying the flux rope. The rope is thought to undergo the torus instability and, therefore, erupt if it rises to take on a semi-circular shape and if the overlying field falls off with height with a decay index of ∼ 1.5 (Kliem and Török, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2006</xref>). Alternatively, the broad range of ratios may highlight that there are different mechanisms that can bring the flux rope to the point of eruption. For example, runaway reconnection in a current sheet underneath the rope. There may also be the influence of photospheric line-tying in some cases due to the particular configuration of the flux rope.</p><p>The scenario outlined here, whereby flux cancellation builds flux ropes is strongly supported by a series of 3-dimensional numerical modelling approaches that complete the picture of flux rope formation and eruption in decaying active regions (Amari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Mackay and van Ballegooijen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2006</xref>; Aulanier <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>).

The latest approach to modelling the occurrence of flux ropes and their eruption in the decay phase of active regions is to conduct a data constrained simulation where the starting configuration of the numerical simulation is based on the observed magnetic field. Kliem <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2013</xref>) successfully bring a flux rope constructed from observations using the flux rope insertion method to a successful eruption. They find good agreement between their MHD simulation and observations of the eruption and also that the axial flux in their rope closely matched that of the criterion of the torus instability. This is promising and exciting work that will, in future, be expanded to include observations of the evolution of the photospheric field in the time leading up to the eruption and the NLFFF extrapolations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Modelling the Evolution of ARs from Emergence Through Decay</title><p>The first short flux emergence phase of AR evolution has been extensively modelled and simulated, while the global evolution including the decay phase of ARs has been much less studied except for its flux transport aspect. Modelling of sub-photospheric evolution of flux tubes was reviewed by Fan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>), including its manifestations on flux emergence as well as the main characteristics of bipolar ARs resulting from sub-photospheric effects. Here, following the brief observational scenario of a full AR evolution in Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">1.3</xref>, we describe the most relevant modelling effort of AR evolution from the fully emerged state through decay by van Ballegooijen and Mackay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2007</xref>), which describes the coupled evolution of magnetic fields in the convection zone and the corona, capturing several key observational characteristics of the AR decay process. A key question they investigate is what happens to the coronal and sub-surface magnetic fields as flux cancels along the PIL.</p><p>The numerical mean-field model by van Ballegooijen and Mackay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2007</xref>) starts with a fully emerged flux rope resulting in a bipolar AR with an initial field strength of 1 kG, left-handed (negative) twist with a twist parameter <italic>q</italic> = 2<italic>ΰH/L</italic> = −0.5 with a pitch length <italic>L</italic> ≈ 0.5 <italic>R</italic><sub>⊙</sub>, and a magnetic flux of 1.231 × 10<sup>22</sup> Mx in each polarity (Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16a</xref>). The latitude of the model emergence is +20.2°. It follows the spreading of AR magnetic flux over an increasing area, which leads to a convergence of the opposite polarities and magnetic cancellations along the PIL and the resulting submergence of flux there (Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16b</xref>). Shear is increasing along the magnetic inversion line in the corona due to a <italic>re-partition of shear</italic> between the short submerging and long coronal reconnected field lines: The former are perpendicular to the PIL, i.e., nearly potential, while the long reconnected field lines inherit most of the shear. In the model this is due to a nearly-radial field in the upper convection zone, which prevents the submergence of the magnetic component parallel to the PIL. While the flux is decreasing due to magnetic cancellations and ensuing flux submergence, the shear is accumulating along the PIL at low altitudes, gradually making the field-line structure sigmoidal. By day 20 of the model evolution, a loss of equilibrium and eruption (CME) ensues (see Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). The rate of build-up of free energy resulting from flux cancellations in a decaying AR was observationally studied by Mackay <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2011</xref>). They found a free energy injection rate of (2.5–3) × 10<sup>25</sup> erg s<sup>−1</sup>, which is sufficient to balance radiative losses of the AR, but it appears to be too slow for an efficient build-up of major eruptive activity (see a more detailed discussion in Section <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">4.4.1</xref>).

Since the submerging flux is perpendicular to the PIL (nearly potential), shear is accumulating fast in the corona along the inversion line while the flux is decreasing due to flux cancellations. On day 20, the accumulating magnetic shear leads to a loss of equilibrium resulting in a CME-like lift-off (c) as seen from latitude −60° and (d) from latitude +20°.

Van Ballegooijen and Mackay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2007</xref>) also modelled the interaction between neighbouring flux ropes and the consequences for the sub-photospheric field. They modelled two ARs and found that on the 5th day of decay the dispersing magnetic fields have come into contact forming inter-AR magnetic inversion lines. Magnetic reconnections during cancellation events formed four connectivity systems: besides the original internal connectivities <italic>within</italic> the two ARs two sets of new connections between each pair of opposite polarities <italic>between</italic> the ARs. As a result of flux cancellations along the inter-AR inversion lines, flux retraction was taking place there. Since the retracted field along the inter-AR inversion lines represented connections between the ARs, these submerging loops represent drastically different magnetic connectivities to those of the emerging ones. Magnetic shear accumulated along the inter-AR inversion lines in the same manner and for the same reasons as along the internal inversion lines of ARs described above. Since accumulation of shear is a pre-requisite of filament formation, these inter-AR inversion lines are favourable places for filament formation. It has indeed been observed that the majority of filaments form along such inversion lines (Tang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">1987</xref>).</p><p>The retracted field lines are envisioned by the model of van Ballegooijen and Mackay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2007</xref>) to be pulled back all the way to the toroidal flux layer, to “repair the damage” caused by the flux emergence.</p><p>In the model by van Ballegooijen and Mackay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2007</xref>), the magnetic field of ARs clearly maintains their connection to their toroidal roots during the decay phase of their evolution. However, this may not be the case in the real Sun. Observations show a change in the dynamical properties of active regions from “active” to “passive”, which in the emergence phase is governed by internal large-scale dynamics, while after the emergence theoretical arguments have been raised in favour of disconnection of the emerged flux tubes from their toroidal roots.

The new AR developed a total sunspot area exceeding 400 MSH, which was large enough to produce a detectable decrease in the total solar irradiance (Fröhlich <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1997</xref>; Hudson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">1998</xref>). Within the AR’s boundary a final, fifth, major flux emergence episode concluded the large-scale flux input into the active nest between 14–27 July 1996, while AR 7978 was on the far-side on the disc. This final flux emergence episode probably started just a few days before 27 July, as flux emergence had continued for a few days after the AR rotated onto the disk for the second time.</p><p>In AR 7978 flux emergence started at ∼ S10 E31 on 4 July 1996, in a dominantly negative polarity environment, west of the old and dispersed bipolar region mentioned above, the third member of the complex (see Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>). By 6 July 1996, the first well-formed sunspots of NOAA 7978 were observed, and the fast growth of the magnetic flux lasted until at least 10 July (van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">2003b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">a</xref>). The results of the second episode of flux emergence in the AR is evidenced by the double leading (positive) polarity flux concentrations in the AR on 2 August, seen in Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>, which also shows that the magnetic field of the AR was clearly distinguishable from the background field for at least seven solar rotations. In summary, this active nest received large-scale flux input for over 3.5 months in five impulses. The ensuing decay phase lasted twice as long, for 7 more months. The evolution of the final (double) flux emergence episodes will be followed below, as a rare undisturbed process. In the following subsections we will identify the region as AR 7978 along all the rotations, though in fact it was denoted as NOAA 7981 and NOAA 7986 in the second and third rotations, respectively. After the spots disappeared (from the fourth rotation onward) the region did not have a NOAA number any longer, but we will still refer to it as AR 7978.

The average phase shifts normalised to surface values found over the active region in both datasets were attributed to upward-moving magnetic flux through the top of the convection zone during the emergence of the AR.</p><p>Van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">2003b</xref>), using SOHO/MDI magnetograms, measured the total unsigned magnetic flux of the AR during the emergence and six more consecutive central meridian passages (CMPs). The magnetic boundary of the AR was drawn “by hand”, relying on the detection by the human eye of a steep magnetic field gradient at that location, on magnetic maps displayed in the same dynamic range (Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>). Based on repeated measurements the subjective errors were estimated to be ∼ 10% for the magnetic area and flux above a threshold of 9 gauss noise level (Liu and Norton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2001</xref>). The peak total flux was reached during the third rotation (2.4 × 10<sup>22</sup> Mx, cf. Figure <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>), due to the additional episode(s) of flux emergence mentioned above. The ≈ 10% negative flux imbalance was due to the fact that the AR emerged in a dominantly negative polarity magnetic environment and as its flux dispersed and magnetic area grew, more and more of this pre-existing negative flux was included in the measurements. Another effect of the dominantly negative polarity magnetic environment is that the positive flux of the dispersing AR had a better chance to cancel than its negative polarity counterpart. Later on, the total flux decreased slowly, and even increased during the last three rotations (from October to December 1996) due to small-scale flux emergence activity and the ever-increasing area, which implied the inclusion of more quiet-sun background flux.

Note also that the two diffusing polarities efficiently wiped out all the pre-existing opposite polarity concentrations over their ever-increasing area. The efficiency of this process decreased with time, which led to the appearance of more mixed polarities by the 6th rotation (Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17j</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of the magnetic flux curves measured using the two different methods (i.e., using the hand-drawn contours and the fixed-area box) in Figure <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref> and also in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, shows that the fixed-area flux peaks one month earlier than the flux measured within the contours. This puzzling discrepancy is likely to be due to the inclusion of too much remnant flux of the negative polarity into which AR 7978 had emerged. This suggests that this AR (and activity nest) had reached its highest total flux during the 2nd rotation of AR 7978.

Their main findings are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The magnetic flux evolution was found to have the same trend, but somewhat different relative values. They stated that AR 7978 emerged to reach 90% of the peak total magnetic flux found in the second rotation (CR 1912). The total flux decayed to 50% of the peak flux in 50 days after that. They also found an increasing flux imbalance between opposite polarities: A well-balanced emergence phase followed by increasing imbalance during the decay phase, with excess negative flux of 12% and 20% of the AR total flux in CR 1913 and CR 1914, respectively. This, on average, compares well with the average imbalance value found by Choudhary <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>). Their most surprising result was that despite an area increase of 30%, the distance between weighted positive and negative magnetic flux-centres remained constant in the decay phase, in the 3rd and 4th rotations.

They found that the presence of sunspots over-compensated emission from faculae during the emergence phase, when the 500 nm spectral radiance dropped by ∼ 1 mW m<sup>−2</sup> nm<sup>−1</sup> even though the AR was at 50 W by the time it reached maximum sunspot area. The presence of large sunspots in the 2nd rotation, and a small sunspot in the 3rd, were over-compensated by facular emission when it was close to the limb (70–80°), see Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>. As the magnetic field of the AR dispersed and the facular area grew, the angular distribution of the observed radiance changed. As the AR became older, facular emission became less limb-bright, as its maximum shifted from ∼ 50° in the 3rd rotation to ∼ 40° in the 4th and finally ∼ 30° in the 5th rotation rotation.

In addition, magnetic complexity and flaring, which can also produce non-thermal emission, have to be taken into account. There were 31 ARs observed during the 13 days analysed. The evolutionary phase (Φ<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, see below) and complexity (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub>) of the ARs were determined (see Section <xref rid="Sec49" ref-type="sec">A</xref>), and numbers were attributed to them to facilitate plotting. They also used the X-ray flare index <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> = 1000 × (1 × Σ(<italic>c</italic>) + 10 × Σ(<italic>M</italic>) + 100 × Σ(<italic>X</italic>)), where C, M, and X are the importance values based on GOES X-ray data. Indices used also included sunspot area, plage area, and plage intensity.</p><p>The six evolutionary stages (Φ<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>), though they follow the general trend described in Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">1.3</xref>, are a compact extract of its main elements, so we find it useful to repeat them here. Below, we follow the exact description given by Tapping and Zwaan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2001</xref>) to describe the evolution of bipolar regions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Emergence: the first appearance of the active region as a small, compact, bipolar plage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Growth: flux emergence proceeds vigorously, with the total magnetic flux and plage area increasing rapidly.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maximum development: the plage area and total magnetic flux have reached their maximum values.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Early decay: the plage is starting to break up. If there were sunspots, at least one is still present.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Late decay: all spots have disappeared, the plage has fragmented, but bipolar structure is still easily visible.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Remnant: widely scattered faculae/enhanced network, original bipolar structure is barely visible.</p></list-item></list></p><p>They also remarked: “In the case of an activity complex, however, more than one bipole may be present. The emergence of a new bipole, or relative motions of the constituting bipoles can cause Φ<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> to jump backwards.”</p><p>When these indices were plotted against the evolutionary phase, sunspot area, plage and sunspot magnetic complexity and the X-ray flare index peaked strongly at Φ<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 2, i.e., during the fast growth phase and only the plage area peaked later. The fastest fall-off with evolutionary stage was shown by the X-ray flare index and sunspot area, while the other indices declined slower.</p><p>An interesting result of this work is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig24" ref-type="fig">24</xref>, where antenna temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> (K)) and flare index (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>) of the microwave sources are plotted against the evolutionary phase index from 1 to 6 defined above. Compact and diffuse sources are distinguished in the plot. Though <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> (K) is a good proxy for brightness temperature of diffuse sources, for compact sources it is at least a factor of 16 lower than that, and for obtaining the brightness temperature information on the spatial scales of the sources is required. Keeping these limitations in mind, the figure shows remarkable dominance of flaring activity during the “growth” (2) phase, when the ARs are dominantly associated with bright compact microwave sources. The fall-off with increasing evolutionary phase is steep. Compact sources characterise phase 3 (maximum evolution), while in phase 4 (early decay) both compact and diffuse sources are present. Stages 5 and 6 (late decay and remnant) are characterised by diffuse sources of decreasing brightness temperature. Flaring remains present only until phase 4, (early decay).

Their novel approach is to investigate how these evolutionary stages are reflected in the properties of different multi-thermal loop populations. Ugarte-Urra and Warren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">2012</xref>) find that the core of ARs is more variable at high <italic>T</italic> (4 MK) in the early stages of the evolution. This variability is associated with low-frequency heating events, which allows the cooling of loops to 1 MK and below. During the decay phase, when the core of ARs becomes fainter, the variability also becomes smaller (see Figure <xref rid="Fig25" ref-type="fig">25</xref> lower panels). In that stage there is less evidence of cooling, although weak heating events appear, which increase the EM at high <italic>T</italic> (3.5–5 MK), while there is no noticeable change in the cooler (0.6–0.9 MK) EM component, which is suggestive of high-frequency heating. They conclude that high- and low-frequency heating of AR cores co-exist, but these two processes appear to dominate at different evolutionary stages of ARs. This most interesting suggestion is worth pursuing in order to determine whether the high- and low-frequency heating represent different regimes of the same mechanism or truly different processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Evolution of flare and CME productivity</title><p>AR 7978 provided an exceptional opportunity for observing flare and CME activity as a function of evolution. The number of flares and CMEs that originated from this AR is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. During the emergence and the two following rotations, the AR produced numerous flares (including an X2.6 flare and CME event on 9 July, see Dryer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1998</xref>), until the disappearance of the main spots after its third rotation. On the other hand, CME activity, which was at first mainly related to flare events, continued at a surprisingly high level for the next three rotations (van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">1999a</xref>), while the magnetic helicity content of the dispersed active region remained reasonably high (Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002b</xref>), see also Section <xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">6.4</xref>. However, none of the late CMEs were related to flare events above the GOES B1 level. Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> lists the number of flares in different GOES classes and of the observed CMEs. The flare data in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> was taken from the GOES X-ray and optical event catalog.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> CMEs were identified in the SOHO/EIT data (Delaboudinière <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1995</xref>) and SOHO/LASCO (Brueckner <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1995</xref>) observations by Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002b</xref>). The low level of other activity during the lifetime of AR 7978 allowed the identification of even back-side CMEs that originated from this AR when it was on the far side of the Sun. The number of CMEs has been corrected for data gaps assuming that the frequency of the CMEs was the same during the gaps as during observing times (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). This doubles the sampling of CMEs relative to that of the flares which could only be observed when the AR was on the visible hemisphere. It is clear from the examples shown in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> that the highest activity occurs during the emergence phase. High magnetic-flux density in an AR increases the probability of a high reconnection rate in activity events and thus the appearance of bright flare ribbons. CMEs occurring during the decay phase due to filament eruption may well have the same underlying physics, but the accompanying activity manifestation (two-ribbon flare) will be weaker and beyond a certain point into the decay phase even below detection level.

Twisted flux tubes ejected in CMEs appear in the interplanetary space as magnetic clouds, in most of which the twisted structure is still well observable. In an attempt to trace magnetic helicity, a conserved quantity even in resistive MHD on a timescale less than the global diffusion timescale, Berger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1984</xref>), from the sub-photospheric layers to the heliosphere through an analysis of the long-term magnetic helicity budget of this isolated AR between July–Nov. 1996, Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002b</xref>) developed a method to observationally determine the evolution of the coronal helicity content of AR 7978 and relate changes in it to magnetic helicity carried away by CMEs identified to have originated from the AR (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Also included in this section is the magnetic helicity budget of AR 8100 that appeared on the southern hemisphere and was tracked between Nov. 1997 and Feb. 1998.

The simple bipolar source region, AR 8038, was in a decay phase. Analysing how the free energy was re-introduced to the near-potential state following the eruptions, they found that prior to the flare/CME event on 12 May, the total unsigned flux of the entire AR decreased by about 18% during 66 hours. The unsigned flux evolution in the direct vicinity of the PIL first decreased by 42% in about 30 hours, then during the 30 hours prior to the eruption it started to increase again, re-gaining and surpassing its starting value by a few percents. Fourier local correlation-tracking reveals a general westward flow of 100–200 km s<sup>−1</sup> in the following polarity towards the PIL, which may be a partial source of this flux increase, another being MMF activity around the leading sunspot.

However, the magnetic evolution process cannot be fully explained by the flows obtained and they conclude that it may be necessary to invoke the continuing emergence of fields in a non-potential state.</p><p>Welsch <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">2009</xref>), in an impressive article, analyse 46 ARs using MDI magnetograms to study the relationship between photospheric flow fields and flaring by computing extensive (that scale with the AR size/flux) and intensive (that are independent on AR size/flux) quantities and correlating them with flare activity above the GOES C1.0 level. The relevant part of their study to the topic of this review is that they found the above-mentioned proxy Pointing flux <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>, an extensive quantity, the most strongly associated with flare flux, while all the intensive flow properties showed a poor correlation. Past flare activity was also found to be associated with future flare occurrence. In an in-depth discussion they raise the question of whether free energy propagates from below, as postulated by McClymont and Fisher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">1989</xref>) and supported by Leka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1996</xref>), or if it is due to photospheric flows acting on already emerged fields advocated by, e.g., Brown <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>) and Antiochos <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>). The lack of clear correlation with intensive flow properties as well as the repetitive nature of flare activity in certain ARs, while the lack of it in others are suggestive of the sub-photospheric origin of AR non-potentiality. However, that the correlation was found between the extensive flow property <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>, which has units of energy flux, raises questions. In the decay phase of ARs, magnetic flux cancellations brought along by seemingly random flows may be building up free energy in the corona, or perhaps flaring has a systematic time delay relative to flows, involving the propagation of twist via torsional Alfvén waves (Longcope and Welsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Computation of coronal relative magnetic helicity</title><p>SOHO/MDI magnetograms taken close to the CMPs of AR 7978 at each rotation of its return were used as boundary conditions for linear force-free field (LFFF) magnetic extrapolations (<inline-formula id="IEq11"><alternatives><tex-math id="IEq11_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Berger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1986</xref>) showed that the helicity generation rate can be understood as the summation of the rotation rate of all the individual elementary flux pairs weighted by their magnetic flux. Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2002a</xref>) noticed that photospheric plasma motions generate two different helicity terms: the rotation of each polarity introduces ‘twist’ helicity, while the relative rotation of opposite polarity flux concentrations injects ‘writhe’ helicity. Twist and writhe helicities generated by differential rotation have opposite signs, while their magnitudes are similar, thus they partially cancel. The orientation of the bipole is important to understand the helicity injection by differential rotation as twist helicity dominates when the bipole is aligned parallel to the equator, while writhe dominates when it is perpendicular. Using SOHO/MDI data the helicity injected by differential rotation was computed (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, column 5 — the most accurate values in the helicity budget). Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2002</xref>) followed the same method and computed the helicity injection by differential rotation for AR 8100.

These numbers were then corrected for LASCO data gaps (26 + 5 CMEs). Assuming a one-to-one association between CMEs and magnetic clouds, i.e., interplanetary consequences of CMEs, which have clearly twisted magnetic structures, helicity ejected in a CME was estimated. For computing relative magnetic helicity per unit length in a typical magnetic cloud a numerically integrated form of Berger’s equation (Berger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>) was used, and for the mean magnetic field the values <italic>B</italic><sub>0</sub>(2 × 10<sup>−4</sup> G) and radius <italic>R</italic> (2 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm) of 18 magnetic clouds from the sample in Lepping <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">1990</xref>).

These mean helicity values had to be multiplied by the number of CMEs to obtain the total magnetic helicity ejected from this AR (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, column 6).</p><p>To find the magnetic helicity shed via CMEs from AR 8100 the same method was applied.

After correcting for data gaps and when the AR was on the far side of the Sun the total CME count rises to 65.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Discussion on the helicity budget</title><p>AR 7978 was a classical bipolar AR oriented E-W, distorted only by the differential rotation. It had positive relative coronal helicity, (corresponding to the hemispheric helicity trend on the South hemisphere), and the differential rotation injected positive helicity as well throughout the studied six solar rotations (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, 5th column). Localised small scale photospheric surface motions, as compared to differential rotation, should also inject magnetic helicity into the coronal field. Relative motions of the AR polarities during the two main flux emergence phases were clearly evident. After this period, there was no evidence of significant shearing motions other than the differential rotation (Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002b</xref>). When looking at the changes in coronal helicity from one rotation to the next, and comparing them to the amount of helicity generated by differential rotation (4th and 5th columns in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>) it is obvious that differential rotation is an inefficient generator of helicity. This accentuates the importance of the helicity inflow and outflow through the boundaries of our coronal computational box.

Δ<italic>H</italic><sub>emergence</sub> is given in the last column of Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. It is clear that in the helicity budget of AR 7978 the increase in coronal helicity during the first two rotations and the large amount of helicity carried away by CMEs during this period requires the largest input of helicity by the sub-photospheric layers. Indeed, major flux emergence episodes were observed then in the AR. As mentioned above, during the two episodes of flux emergence footpoint motions are thought to inject helicity in the coronal field. This helicity injection was not computed, since its contribution is included in the emergence term as defined above (Démoulin and Berger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2003</xref>). Thus, the only surface shearing motion considered in our budget is the differential rotation. Later the emergence term in the helicity budget becomes smaller, but still not negligible. The total amount of helicity that should come from twisted flux emergence can be estimated to be between 55–241 × 10<sup>42</sup> Mx<sup>2</sup> in this simple bipolar region, that produced 31 CMEs. For comparison, during the same period, the differential rotation injected only 8.3 × 10<sup>42</sup> Mx<sup>2</sup>, so it clearly was a <italic>minor contributor</italic> to the magnetic-helicity budget of AR 7978. Correction for the underestimation of the longitudinal field by MDI should bring a correction factor slightly over 2 for Δ<italic>H</italic><sub>corona</sub> and Δ<italic>H</italic><sub>diff. rot.</sub> Such correction would cause only a minor change in the total of the emergence term: ΔH<sub>emergence</sub> = 51–246 × 10<sup>42</sup> Mx<sup>2</sup>. Though all the helicity values, especially the amount carried away in CMEs, have important uncertainties (for a discussion see Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002b</xref>); Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2002</xref>), the difference between the above mentioned total helicity numbers is significantly larger than any of the errors</p><p>AR 8100 represents an AR with a different magnetic evolution and can therefore be used to compare and contrast with that of AR 7978. The AR was born on the southern hemisphere with a bipolar configuration but within days of its first appearance secondary bipoles began to emerge and the region evolved to take on a large and complex magnetic configuration. Significant new flux continued to emerge into the region until its third rotation, after which time the flux in the AR began to decrease. The AR emerged with negative relative coronal magnetic helicity (the opposite sign to the hemispheric trend) but by its second rotation the helicity sign in the coronal field had reversed and become positive. We assign this change in helicity sign to the emergence of new flux that carried with it positive helicity as the helicity injection by differential rotation is insufficient by an order of magnitude, even though it is of the correct sign (i.e., positive).</p><p>Akin with AR 7978, columns 4 and 5 in Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> show that differential rotation in AR 8100 is an inefficient means of injecting helicity into the AR during rotations 1 to 4, and possibly also the 5th rotation. In contrast to AR 7978, AR 8100 displayed a strong relative motion of its main polarities throughout its lifetime. This had the consequence that, in addition to the shearing motions created by differential rotation, the polarities underwent a strong clockwise rotation of more than 150. See Figure <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">27</xref>. Therefore, this AR represents a case study of a region where differential rotation is not the only shear flow acting on the coronal magnetic field. The rotation of the polarities and the effect of their orientation makes this AR interesting to study. The injection of helicity by differential rotation can be split into two components — twist and writhe — which inject helicity of opposite sign. The component that dominates depends on the orientation of the bipole. See Section <xref rid="Sec42" ref-type="sec">6.4.3</xref>. Initially, AR 8100 is orientated in the E-W direction and the twist helicity dominates injecting postive helicity. But as the AR rotates, it becomes more aligned to the N-S direction and writhe helicity dominates, which injects negative helicity. Then, the action of differential rotation serves to deplete helicity from the corona (which is of positive sign) rather than building it.

The paper very nicely summarises that differential rotation is an ineffective source of coronal magnetic helicity in both of these very different ARs. The CMEs that are produced from the regions carry away more than 10 times the helicity injected by this mechanism, and in AR 8100 the differential rotation actually serves to deplete the coronal helicity content. What then is the source of the helicity shed by the CMEs? In the early rotations of both ARs flux emergence may provide the source. However, the flux emergence ceases in both ARs whilst the CME activity continues. The observational and theoretical considerations then point toward the helicity reservoir lying in the sub-surface portions of the AR magnetic field, which replenishes helicity into the coronal field either by a continued rise or via torsional Alfvén waves.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Evolution of coronal parameters: <italic>T</italic>, EM, <italic>ρ</italic></title><p>The evolution of the fluxes observed in X-rays were correlated with the magnetic flux density in active region NOAA 7978 from its birth throughout its decay.

It was found that flares mainly occur when the magnetic field of the AR has the highest complexity and magnetic flux density, and this is when the variability of AR cores are the highest, too. However, CMEs may be more closely related to the magnetic helicity content of the AR. It was also studied how much the contribution of differential rotation and twisted flux emergence contribute to building up the observed shear and helicity. Differential rotation turned out to be a very ineffective generator of magnetic helicity, thus the dominant source of coronal and interplanetary helicity is the inherent twist of the flux tubes forming the ARs. Magnetic helicity is transferred from the sub-photospheric layers to the corona by magnetic flux emergence and replenished after relaxation (CME) events either by a slow continuous emergence of the flux tube or by torsional Alfvén waves (Longcope and Welsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2000</xref>). It being concentrated along the magnetic inversion line by magnetic cancellations there. This process can continue for several solar rotations until the helicity reserves of the flux tube are exhausted, or the flux tube is destroyed by convective motions.</p><p>A study of how atmospheric heating is affected by the magnetic evolution was carried out by van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">2003b</xref>) and Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2003</xref>). Using <italic>Yohkoh</italic>/SXT and BCS data they studied the evolution of the coronal plasma parameters as functions of magnetic observables during five solar rotations and derived scaling laws between them (van Driel-Gesztelyi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">2003b</xref>). It was found that the mean X-ray flux and derived parameters, temperature and emission measure of the plasma (together with other quantities deduced from them, such as the density and the pressure), in the AR follow power-law relationships with the mean magnetic flux density. The determination of such power-law relations, when combined with scaling laws deduced from coronal heating models, can provide us with powerful tools for determining the mechanisms responsible for the existence of the high temperature corona (Démoulin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2003</xref>). Through such a study it was found that models involving the dissipation of stressed, current-carrying magnetic fields as well as magnetic turbulence are in much better agreement with the scaling laws derived from the long-term evolution of AR 7978 than the ones which solely involve wave heating.</p><p>Another complex analysis involved the use of multi-instrument datasets leading to a study of the evolution of emitted flux densities in 19 different wavelength domains in correlation with magnetic flux density. Analysing the obtained power-laws and comparing them to heating mechanisms and models of different layers of the solar atmosphere, Démoulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2004</xref>) concluded:
<disp-quote><p>We have learned that the magnetic field is not only a strong structuring agent of the solar atmosphere, but also that it defines its main properties (such as pressure and temperature). There is plausibly a unique heating mechanism in the magnetised part that heats both the upper chromosphere and the corona […]. The heating rate scales approximately with the magnetic field to the second power (transforming all the parameter dependence to the magnetic one). In the intermediate layer, the TR, this heating mechanism could well be at work, but the presence of such high radiative losses makes this heating input unimportant for the TR physics. Finally, taking into account the observed universality of the flux-flux relations (power laws between fluxes from the optical to the X-ray range), this physical scenario is expected to extend to cool stars.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The latter was one of the results relevant to stellar activity studies. However, emitted flux evolution leading to evolving rotational modulation was also used to successfully test photometric starspot modelling programs (Oláh <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">1999</xref>) and interpret stellar X-ray spectra (Orlando <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2004</xref>). The long-term evolution of ARs, especially during solar-minimum conditions, is an outstanding tool for creative solar and stellar physicists to decipher components of complex phenomena covered by their observations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>We started this review with references to IAU Symposium 35 on the “Structure and Development of Solar Active Regions”, held in Budapest, Hungary in September 1967, and we would like to end with another reference to it.

Though these classifications may appear like “zoology”, the “Zürich classification” scheme devised by Waldmeier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">1955</xref>) and further developed by McIntosh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">1990</xref>), is worth describing here, since it is based on the characteristic stages that a spot group may pass through during its formation and decay. There are many varieties of this scheme. Here we largely follow the scheme as summarised in the <italic>User guide from the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC) of the Royal Observatory of Belgium</italic>.</p><p>The 3-component McIntosh classification is based on the general form ‘Zpc’, where ‘Z’ is the modified Zürich Class, ‘p’ describes the penumbra of the principal spot, and ‘c’ describes the distribution of spots in the interior of the group.</p><p>Z-values: (Modified Zürich Sunspot Classification).
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>A</bold> — A small single unipolar sunspot. Representing either the formative or final stage of evolution.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>B</bold> — Bipolar sunspot group with no penumbra on any of the spots.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>C</bold> — A bipolar sunspot group. One sunspot must have penumbra.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>D</bold> — A bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends of the group. Longitudinal extent does not exceeds 10°.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>E</bold> — A bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends. Longitudinal extent exceeds 10° but not 15°.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>F</bold> — An elongated bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends. Longitudinal extent of penumbra exceeds 15°.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>H</bold> — A unipolar sunspot group with penumbra.</p></list-item></list></p><p>p-values:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>x</bold> — No penumbra (group class is A or B)</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>r</bold> — Rudimentary penumbra partially surrounds the largest spot. This penumbra is incomplete, granular rather than filamentary, brighter than mature penumbra, and extends as little as 3 from the spot umbra. Rudimentary penumbra may be either in a stage of formation or dissolution.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>s</bold> — Small, symmetric (like Zürich class J). Largest spot has mature, dark, filamentary penumbra of circular or elliptical shape with little irregularity to the border. The north-south diameter across the penumbra is ≤ 2.5°.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>a</bold> — Small, asymmetric. Penumbra of the largest spot is irregular in outline and the multiple umbra within it are separated. The north-south diameter across the penumbra is ≤ 2.5°.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>h</bold> — Large, symmetric (like Zürich class H). Same structure as type ‘s’, but north-south diameter of penumbra is ≥ 2.5°. Area, therefore, must be ≥ 250 MSH (millionths of the solar hemisphere).</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>k</bold> — Large, asymmetric. Same structure as type ‘a’, but north-south diameter of penumbra is more than ≥ 2.5°. Area, therefore, must be ≥ 250 MSH.</p></list-item></list></p><p>c-values:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>x</bold> — Undefined for unipolar groups (class A and H)</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>o</bold> — Open. Few, if any, spots between leader and follower. Interior spots of very small size. Class E and F groups of ‘open’ category are equivalent to Zurich class G.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>i</bold> — Intermediate. Numerous spots lie between the leading and following portions of the group, but none of them possess mature penumbra.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>c</bold> — Compact. The area between the leading and the following ends of the spot group is populated with many strong spots, with at least one interior spot possessing mature penumbra. The extreme case of compact distribution has the entire spot group enveloped in one continuous penumbral area.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Another useful classification scheme, still widely used in the literature, devised by Hale and his colleagues at Mt. Wilson Observatory (Hale <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1919</xref>), refers to the magnetic complexity of sunspot groups. The scheme was widened to include the most complex class: <italic>δ</italic>-groups (Künzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1960</xref>).
