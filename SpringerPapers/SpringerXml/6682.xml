This work studies the preparation method and performance of hydrogel evaporators using chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a framework and carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as the photothermal material. The evaporation rate of CPC (chitosan/PVA and CNPs) hydrogel obtained reaches 2.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>. Simultaneously, a three-dimensional structure is designed based on the two-dimensional double-layer evaporation system in this study. An evaporator with a tiny-pool structure and a hydrogel with a dome-arrayed structure is designed. These two structures achieve highly efficient evaporation rates of 2.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> and 3.80 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. These optimized designs improve the evaporation rate of the overall system by ~ 66.7%. The developed evaporation devices provide a promising pathway for developing the double-layer evaporators, which promote the new development of water purification with a solar-driven evaporation system.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">CBET-1941743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4402</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_8589.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Water is the most precious resource for maintaining human survival and economic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the amount of fresh water on the earth surface is limited and not capable of meeting the increasing demand. At the same time, the ocean covers more than 70% earth’s surface area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, the problem of converting seawater into fresh water for human utilization is a vital topic that many researchers are working on to aid the sustainability of human societies.</p><p id="Par3">Traditional water evaporation factories are based on petroleum. This method causes significant wastewater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reduce environmental pollution and monetary cost, researchers are driven to utilize a renewable source as the driving energy for evaporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The solar-driven steam generation system is a method that can easily convert seawater to freshwater based on abundant, renewable and clean solar energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Solar distillation mimics the natural water cycle, in which the sun heats seawater to the point of evaporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. After evaporation, the water vapor condenses on a cooler surface. In general, solar-driven water steam generation systems can be divided into two types. One is using photovoltaic (PV) cells which convert solar energy to electricity to power the evaporation process. The other one is utilizing the solar thermal energy directly as the driving energy for evaporation. The PV desalination system includes reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED). The solar thermal system includes multi-stage flash (MSF), multi-effect distillation (MED), vapor compression (VC), freeze desalination (FD) and membrane distillation (MD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The main purpose of the current research of solar thermal desalination system is to improve the photothermal efficiency and the quality of distilled water after purification. Researchers are committed to improving the heat absorption rate of light absorber, the ability to trap sunlight on the gas–liquid surface, and the usable surface area of light absorber per unit projection area, as these are key factors in creating a highly effective desalination system.</p><p id="Par5">The double layer system consists of a light absorber with broadband absorption performance, a thermal insulation barrier and a hydrophilic water channel to transfer the seawater to the light absorber. This system with an excellent evaporation efficiency has been vastly studied. In 2013, Omara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> designed a two-tier desalination distillation system using an evacuated solar water heater, Jut geotextile and a solar still. This double-layered square wick (DLSW) solar still increased water productivity by 114%. The average daily efficiency of the DLSW was 71.5% and the productivity of distilled water increased by 215% if hot brackish water was fed at night. Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> proposed a super hydrophilic thermally insulated microporous membrane composed of carbonized sucrose and polydimethylsiloxane as an efficient solar evaporator, which reached a purified water production rate of 1.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>. In their study, solar energy is used as the only driving energy. The photothermal conversion absorber receives solar energy from sunlight and heats the water inside the porous structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It requires broadband spectrum absorbing performance and high photothermal conversion efficiency.</p><p id="Par6">The main purpose of the heat insulation layer is to trap the thermal energy obtained by the light absorber on the gas–liquid interface. This prevents heat diffusion to the bulk water, thus enhancing the efficiency. As such, the heat barrier material should own low thermal conductivity and hydrophobic properties, which minimize the conductive heat loss in the transport process. The combination of the thermal barrier and a hydrophilic water channel can create a two-dimensional (2D) water transfer system. Shrinking the waterway can effectively reduce the downward heat diffusion to bulk water, improving the evaporation efficiency. Previously employed insulation materials include wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, air-laid paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, macro-porous silica substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and polystyrene foam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The 2D water supply employs hydrophilic intermediary materials such as cellulose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, cotton and silk fabrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, vertically oriented graphene structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and air‐laid paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> for water delivery. In this study, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam is applied as the heat insulation material in the bottom layer. As a closed-cell material, PVC foam has the ability to seal out moisture and has high hardness. As a thermoplastic, PVC performs an excellent performance in thermal insulation. These properties make PVC foam a very suitable material for the heat insulation barrier. At the same time, a cotton wipe is used with high water absorption as the water pipeline between the hydrogel and the bulk water. An adequate and continuous water supply contributes greatly to the high evaporation performance. Its structure affects the water flow’s direction to the absorbing layer. which indirectly affects the evaporation efficiency.</p><p id="Par7">Hydrogels, which are three-dimensional (3D) porous polymeric networks consisting of hydrophilic polymer chains, have been widely employed in various areas such as inclusive biosensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, hygiene products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, contact lenses, drug delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In recent years, hydrogels have shown incredible evaporation performance and become a promising functional material in this field. Hydrogels cooperate well with various types of nanoparticles to improve the photothermal conversion ability, making it suitable for solar-driven water evaporation system. As a porous structure, hydrogels have a large internal volume and surface area, which can continuously absorb water in the process of evaporation and provides sufficient gas–liquid contact to realize an efficient evaporation performance. In this work, the design and optimization of evaporation system and CPC hydrogel evaporator structure is conducted. A tiny-pool structure and dome-arrayed hydrogel is designed. The hydrogel water absorption and light absorption and the overall evaporation rate of the system are measured to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. PVA is a water-soluble polymer with excellent chemical stability, film-forming ability and high hydrophilicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Chitosan is the chitin of shrimps and other crustaceans that has been treated with an alkaline substance. When these two materials cross-linked, a porous hydrogel framework with high flexibility, toughness and water-absorbing quality will be formed. As a carbon-based material, CNPs have extraordinary thermal conductivity and high stability. Therefore, it is used as the light absorbing material of this hydrogel to maximize the solar energy gain.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, a photothermal, macro-porous double-layer solar evaporation system is reported with the schematic structure shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

This dome-arrayed structure therefore dramatically increases the light absorption of the hydrogel, as well as the evaporation area, thus increasing the evaporation rate.</p><p id="Par11">After evaluating the shading impact to determine the geometry which best promotes photothermal absorption, seven hemisphere units with a radius of 2 mm are added to a cylindrical hydrogel with a diameter of 70 mm.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, the CPC hydrogel sample in the wavelength range of 0.3–2.5 µm achieves an average light absorption rate of up to 98%. It maintains a light absorption rate of nearly 98% over the entire visible wavelength range (0.4–0.83 µm). The CNPs play a vital role in the process of light absorption and can absorb and convert the majority of the incident energy, which highly enhances the evaporation efficiency of this hydrogel. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hydrogel prepared by adding CNPs into chitosan/PVA framework has a great light absorption rate and is suitable to be the light-absorbing material of the evaporator.</p><p id="Par21">Water absorption capacity is also an essential factor affecting the evaporation efficiency of materials. The water absorption of a material controls the quantity of water available for evaporation as a result of its ability to resupply water to the evaporation. Superabsorbent materials can quickly absorb water from the water transport layer when their internal water evaporation keeps its internal water sufficient and continues to evaporation. If the material is not absorbent enough, it will not take in enough water from the absorbent layer to sustain subsequent evaporation when most of the water in the material is evaporated. This feature would render the material dry, gradually terminating evaporation and significantly reducing efficiency. Due to the porous structure of chitosan/PVA framework, it is expected to have high water absorption. This expectation is proven by measuring the contact angle and the process of water absorption.</p><p id="Par22">The contact angle is the angle formed between the liquid–vapor interface and the solid surface when the liquid drops on the solid surface, indicating the object's hydrophilicity and wettability. Generally speaking, for a solid that absorbs water, the dynamic phenomenon that the contact angle changes when the liquid drops on the surface, the range is gradually reduced from the maximum contact angle to the minimum contact angle, reflecting the water absorption speed of the material. In this experiment, a water droplet is deposited on the thoroughly soaked hydrogel sample, and images are captured with a high-speed camera illustrating the change of contact angle in the absorption process.</p><p id="Par23">It can be found that the CPC hydrogel absorbed the water by capturing the images as soon as it dropped on the surface which showed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. The contact angle drops to 0 degrees within 5 ms, and the absorption process can hardly be observed. This phenomenon indicates that the surface of the treated hydrogel is completely hydrophilic and has excellent water absorption. This experimental result proves that this sample can continuously absorb water from the water transport layer and maintain the continuous process of evaporation in the evaporation process.</p><p id="Par24">The water absorption test of the hydrogel sample records the water absorption process of the dehydrated sample. In this experiment, a dry sample is tested with a hemispherical structure. To facilitate the observation of moisture infiltration, only the lower surface in contact with the water is polished. A dehydrated sample is dipped into a glass dish filled with water, and its weight is recorded every 15 s until stable, at which point it is considered to be thoroughly wet.</p><p id="Par25">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, the sample is gradually wetted from the center, with the hemisphere structure at the top being the last part to be saturated. The total soaking time is about 15 min. The dry sample weighs 6.5 g, and it experiences a gradual increase in weight before reaching to a converging value, that indicates the entirely wet sample weighs about 20.2 g.

A square sample with a side length of 20 mm is taken from the hydrogel sample. An electric grinder is used to polish its upper and lower surfaces. Simultaneously, an optimized system is demonstrated with a square depression in the middle of heat insulation layer that matched the sample size (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a).

The infrared thermal images are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b. The initial temperature of the sample is set at room temperature (20 °C). After about 10 min, the temperature reaches stability. At this time, the maximum temperature of the sample surface is 59.4 °C. The temperature at the top of the hemispherical structure is slightly lower than that in the plane part, about 53 °C.</p><p id="Par31">Due to the hemispherical structure, the CPC hydrogel sample thickness is increased compared with that of the plane sample, so the heating process is slower than in previous experiments, and the evaporation efficiency is also affected. The evaporation rate in this process rises as the evaporator approaches a stable temperature, as does the evaporation efficiency. Once the temperature reaches equilibrium, the evaporation rate also reaches a steady state. This change of evaporation rate from low to high due to the temperature change is also reflected in the water weight change curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c. For this reason, only the data recorded after a relatively stable rate of mass change is reached is considered in the calculation of evaporation rate. As such, the final 30 min of the experiment was chosen to calculate the evaporation rate in the stabilized evaporation process. The evaporation performance of the system is calculated to be 3.80 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> based on a sample surface area of 400 mm<sup>2</sup> (20 mm × 20 mm).</p><p id="Par32">In a standard double-layer structure, the evaporation behavior of the hydrogels can be used to evaluate the availability of the material for the basic desalination of seawater. Therefore, in this experiment, the efficiency of placing flat cylinder hydrogels in a standard double-layer evaporation system is evaluated. The change in water mass due to evaporation is recorded during a 1-h test under one solar light intensity, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d. The total weight of evaporated water is 1.95 g, and the surface area of the hydrogel sample is 8.55 cm<sup>2</sup>. From this, an evaporation rate of 2.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> is determined.</p><p id="Par33">In the optimized evaporation system, the samples' evaporation rate with the dome-arrayed hydrogel is increased by ~ 66.7% with respect to that of regular double-layer system (without dome-arrayed hydrogel and tiny puddle structure). It fully proves that evaporation space is provided for adequate water with the increase of evaporation surface area, and evaporation performance is greatly improved.</p><p id="Par34">In solar evaporation devices, it is necessary to avoid the accumulation of salt during the evaporation process. The dissolution process of salt on the surface of the sample is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. It demonstrates the ability of the hydrogel sample to drain salt. Upon contact with water, the solid NaCl on the upper layer starts to dissolve due to the movement and exchange of the solution inside the absorber layer and the water delivery system present on the surface of the device and under the insulation layer. After about 6 h, the triple-layer device completely eliminated the salt, which demonstrates its good salt-removal capacity.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The salt rejection progress of the dome-arrayed chitosan/PVA hydrogel based evaporation device.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_8589_Fig7_HTML.jpg" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">In this work, a dome-arrayed chitosan/PVA hydrogel based solar-driven water evaporation system has been studied. This system realizes the heating and evaporation of water by leveraging solar energy, resulting in steam generation at a low energy cost and providing a new material for freshwater acquisition. In the system's design, a micro puddle structure based on the double-layer evaporation system is proposed for the first time. A hydrogel sample with a dome-arrayed structure is studied, expanding the structure of the hydrogel from a 2D geometry to a 3D geometry, which provides a larger evaporation area for the evaporator. Meanwhile, the superior light absorption performance of CNPs and the internal pore structure of hydrogel material enable the system to absorb more solar energy and achieve a higher evaporation efficiency through the dome-arrayed structure. By optimizing the geometric parameters, an increase from regular double-layer structure to the tiny puddle structure with a dome arrayed hydrogel absorber in the evaporation rate of ~ 66.7% is realized with respect to the system without 3D hydrogel and puddle. These innovative ideas optimize traditional structures and can result in more efficient and less costly desalination plants, representing a significant leap in renewable energy harvesting and water treatment for developing human societies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project is supported by the National Science Foundation through grant number CBET-1941743.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Minyue Zhu: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Writing.
