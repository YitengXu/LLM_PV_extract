The reason for this steady increase in emissions is that passenger and freight transport activities are increasing in all world regions, and there is currently no sign that this growth will slow down in the near future. The increasing energy demand in the transport sector has mainly been met by greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting fossil fuels. Although (battery) electric mobility has recently surged considerably, it has done so from a very low base, which is why, in terms of total numbers, electricity still plays a relatively minor role as an energy carrier in the transport sector.</p><p id="Par3">Apart from their impacts on climate, increasing transport levels, especially of cars, trucks, and aeroplanes, also have unwanted side-effects, including accidents, traffic jams, the emission of noise and other pollutants, visual pollution, and the disruption of landscapes by the large-scale build-up of the transport infrastructure. However, road, rail, sea, and air transport are also an integral part of our globalized and interconnected world, and guarantee prosperity and inter-cultural exchange. Therefore, if we are to cater to people’s desire for mobility while keeping the economy running and meeting the Paris climate goals, fundamental technical, operational, and behavioural measures are required immediately.</p><p id="Par4">In this transport chapter, we discuss potential transport activity pathways and technological developments by which the requirement that warming does not exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C can be met—while at the same time maintaining a reasonable standard of mobility.</p><p id="Par5">For our transport scenario modelling, the global warming limits of 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C were translated into transport CO<sub>2</sub> budgets.

Most of this comprised individual road passenger modes (mostly cars, but also two- and three-wheel vehicles), which accounted for 45% of all end energy in the transport sector. In total, road transport (passenger and freight) accounted for around 90% of total final energy demand for transport.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 6.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>World final energy use by transport mode in 2015</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/470651_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">The majority of total passenger–km (pkm) in passenger transport (around 85% of total pkm) is contributed by road transport modes. Freight is much more rail-oriented, and has a 42% share of total tonne–km (tkm), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">6.2</xref>.

A small number of buses had electric powertrains, which were mainly trolleybuses and increasingly also battery-powered electric buses, predominantly in China. China also has a particularly large number of electric two- and three-wheel vehicles. Almost all battery electric scooters worldwide were in China.

A variety of actions will be required so that the transport sector can conform to the &lt;2.0 °C or 1.5 °C global warming pathways. The set of actions described can be clustered into technical and operational measures (e.g., energy efficiency increases, drivetrain electrification); behavioural measures (e.g., shifts to less-carbon-intensive transport carriers and an overall reduction in transport activity); and accompanying policy measures (e.g., taxation, regulations, urban planning, and the promotion of less-harmful transport modes). This study focuses on the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios and sets out the differences between these scenarios and the business-as-usual 5.0 °C Scenario.</p><p id="Par20">We found that urgent and profound measures must be taken because the emissions reduction window will soon close. Therefore, temporary reductions in fossil-fuel-related transport activities (in terms of pkm and tkm of passenger cars, trucks, and aviation) in OECD countries seem nearly unavoidable until the electrification (based on renewable energy production) of the transport sector undergoes a breakthrough.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Powertrain Electrification</title><p id="Par21">Increasing the market penetration of highly efficient (battery and fuel-cell) electric vehicles, coupled with clean electricity generation, is a powerful lever and probably also the most effective means of moving toward a decarbonised transport system. All electric vehicles have the highest efficiency levels of all the drivetrain options. Today, only a few countries have significant proportions of electric vehicles in their fleets. The total numbers of electric vehicles, particularly in road transport, are insignificant, but because road transport is by far the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter in overall transport, it offers a very powerful lever for decarbonisation. In terms of drivetrain electrification, we cluster the world regions into three groups, according to the diffusion theory (Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par22"><italic>Innovators</italic>: OECD North America (excluding Mexico), OECD Europe, OECD Pacific, and China</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23"><italic>Moderate</italic>: Mexico, Non-OECD Asia, India, Eurasia, and Latin America</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24"><italic>Late adopters</italic>: Africa and the Middle East.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par25">Although this clustering is rough, it sufficiently mirrors the basic tendencies we modelled.

We model only minor electrification over all transport modes (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">6.5</xref>), with passenger cars and buses making relevant gains in <italic>electric vehicle</italic> (EV) shares. For example, we project a share of 30% for <italic>battery electric vehicles</italic> (BEV) in China by 2050 due to foreseeable legislation and technological advancements in that country (Cui and Xiao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>), whereas for the world car fleet, the share is projected to increase to only around 10%. The growth in the share of the commercial road vehicle fleet and of the fleet of two- and three-wheel vehicles held of electric powertrains will be small, as will be the increase in further rail electrification. Aviation and navigation (shipping) will remain fully dependent on conventional kerosene and diesel, respectively.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 6.5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Powertrain split for all transport modes in 2050 under the 5.0 °C Scenario in terms of transport performance</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/470651_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The 2.0 °C Scenario</title><p id="Par27">Based on the low market share of BEV observed today (2018), minimal progress in electrification until 2020 is assumed in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Moving towards 2030, the <italic>innovator</italic> regions will experience strong electrification, encouraged by purchase incentives, EV credit systems, and tightened CO<sub>2</sub> fleet emission targets. Passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are projected to achieve shares of BEVs in the regional stocks between 21% and 30%, whereas heavy commercial vehicles and buses will attain even higher EV fleet shares of between 28% and 52% by 2030. This will require a massive build-up of battery production capacity in the coming years. Electric city buses and some trolley trucks will make a significant contribution to this development. Two- and three-wheel vehicles will be nearly completely electrified (batteries and fuel cells) in a couple of regions. OECD Pacific will head the <italic>fuel-cell-electric vehicle</italic> (FCEV) market introduction, which will account for up to 6% of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2030, with Japan and South Korea the main market drivers. Higher shares of FCEV in <italic>innovator</italic> regions are more likely in the bus and heavy truck sector, which reach up to 10% in 2030. In 2050 in the innovative regions, only a minor proportion of vehicles will have ICE (up to 9%). Passenger cars and light commercial vehicles will predominantly be electrified, with a BEV share of around 80%. FCEV will also gain a significant share of 17% in OECD Pacific and OECD North America.</p><p id="Par28">Looking ahead to 2050, 60–70% of buses and heavy trucks will probably be (battery) electric, whereas FCEV will increase their market share to around 37%. The proportion of buses and heavy trucks that will be BEV in 2050 will be around 60–70%. Two- and three-wheel vehicles will be nearly fully electrified in all regions (80–100%).</p><p id="Par29">In the <italic>moderate</italic> regions, the BEV share of road transport vehicles is set in a range of 1–15%. Except for Latin America, the <italic>moderate</italic> regions will have an ICE share of 83% or less for passenger cars. For example, India is progressing with its current electrification strategy and up to 14% of its passenger cars will be battery-powered by 2030. It is likely that ICE will dominate buses and trucks in the <italic>moderate</italic> regions in 2030. Fuel-cell cars now have small shares of 1–2%. Non-OECD Asia is positively influenced by its <italic>innovator</italic> neighbour region, OECD Pacific. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, <italic>moderate</italic> regions will reach BEV shares of up to 67% for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and between 54% and 65% for buses and heavy trucks by 2050. Compared with the <italic>innovator</italic> regions, the <italic>moderate</italic> regions will not experience a significant uptake of FCEVs. Africa and the Middle East will remain mostly dependent on ICE in 2050, with shares of around 90%.

Only about 0.9% of the cars sold were pure battery electric vehicles (BEV). There are several options for energy efficiency improvements. The fuel consumption reduction potential of petrol engines as a result of engine improvements and hybridization is around 25–30%, and it is around 15–20% for diesel engines (van Basshuysen and Schäfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). Maximum efficiencies of 38–40% can be reached by ICE (Schäfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>), whereas electric drivetrains have efficiencies of 80–85% (including [re]charging losses).

In the commercial sector, it is likely that many electrical charging stations will be set up on the private grounds of logistics operators. The market growth of BEV in the truck sector will require considerable public spending on the installation of overhead catenary lines along major highways for trolley trucks (hybridized with diesel, fuel cells, or batteries).

The short distances between stations, small operating radii, and moderate daily mileages make the use of batteries in city buses a viable option, complemented by fuel cells for routes with higher ranges or difficult terrains. Battery electric buses are between the prototype/experimental stage and a mature technology. In China, battery electric buses are already an integral part of public bus transport systems, and the city of Shenzen has had a 100% electric bus fleet since 2016 (over 16,000 battery electric buses) (Sisson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>).

For example, Africa has a high bus share in total pkm today, whereas OECD Europe has a high passenger car share (LDV), but pkm must decrease by 2020 and in subsequent years to meet the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets because fleet electrification will not be able to keep up. In parallel, rail pkm will increase strongly until 2050 and this will compensate, in part, the decline in passenger car pkm. Population and GDP are very likely to catch up in Africa and will result in a sharp rise in mobility demand. We project that most of this rise to be covered by informal and formal public transport systems, with buses and mini-buses. In China, the pkm split among modes is more balanced. All modes are projected to rise in pkm in the future.<fig id="Fig25"><label>Fig. 6.25</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Pkm development in OECD Europe (<italic>left</italic>) Africa (middle), and China (<italic>right</italic>) in the 2.0 °C Scenario</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/470651_1_En_6_Fig25_HTML.png" id="MO25"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Freight Transport Modes</title><sec><p id="Par76">Total freight activity is modelled to increase strongly in the 5.0 °C Scenario and more slowly in the 2.0 °C Scenario (Fig. <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">6.26</xref>).

Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">6.2</xref> shows the assumed global tkm shift from truck to train in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. Heavy freight trucks (HFT) are more likely to operate over long-haul distances, and are therefore more suitable for the shift to rail freight than light freight trucks (LFT) or medium freight trucks (MFT). In the 2.0 °C Scenario, we assume an average shift of 18% for HFT, whereas in the 1.5 °C Scenario, the shift is projected to reach up to 27%.
