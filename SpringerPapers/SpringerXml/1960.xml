Here, we show this can be achieved by using a defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film as the electron transport layer. TiO<sub>2</sub> layers with native defects are deposited by electron beam evaporation in an oxygen-deficient environment. Deep-level hole traps are introduced in the TiO<sub>2</sub> layers and contribute to a high photoconductive gain and reduced photocatalytic activity. The high photoconductivity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer leads to improved efficiency for the fabricated planar devices. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.0% and an average PCE of 17.5% are achieved. In addition, the reduced photocatalytic activity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer leads to enhanced long-term stability for the planar devices. Under continuous operation near the maximum power point, an efficiency of over 15.4% is demonstrated for 100 h.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Perovskite-based photovoltaics have already reached high efficiency levels but their stability under operating conditions remains a challenge.

This unprecedented progress is made possible by the outstanding material properties of perovskites, including direct bandgaps suitable for capturing the solar spectrum, long and balanced charge carrier diffusion lengths, and high defect tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Despite the ultra-long carrier diffusion lengths in these materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, progress in the field has been dominated by perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that use mesoscopic TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layers (ETLs) derived from the dye-sensitized solar cell community. For example, the first PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 15% was demonstrated with a mesoscopic device using a sequential deposition process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. More recently, a series of breakthroughs were made by the Seok group using mesoscopic devices through solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and process engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. On the other hand, device simplicity and process compatibility would benefit from eliminating the mesoscopic layer and it has been suggested that all devices may ultimately adopt the simple planar architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, impressive advances in planar heterojunction PSCs have been realized using organic ETLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, the combination of high PCE and long-term stability in these devices remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, planar PSCs based on compact TiO<sub>2</sub> are still plagued by lower PCEs and larger current–voltage (JV) hysteresis than the mesoscopic embodiments. It has been suggested that the origin of this performance gap is the much higher electron extraction efficiency from mesostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, improving the electron extraction efficiency from compact TiO<sub>2</sub> layers could provide a path to simultaneously achieving high efficiency and improved stability by overcoming basic performance limitations in planar heterojunction PSCs.</p><p id="Par4">Although compact TiO<sub>2</sub> layers are crucial components of planar PSCs, little attention has been paid to understanding and controlling how the characteristics of this material affect device performance. These layers are usually deposited using solution-based processes, such as spin coating and spray pyrolysis, with limited control over their optoelectronic properties. For example, electrical conductivities of compact TiO<sub>2</sub> films are known to be one order of magnitude lower than those of commonly used organic hole transport layers (HTLs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we consider that the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer is illuminated during operation of PSCs and show that the photoexcited state properties of compact ETLs play critical roles in defining device performance in terms of efficiency and stability. Both the photoconductivity and photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> are greatly affected by deep-level trap states associated with native point defects. Here, we have engineered a defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film containing such hole trap states and used it as the ETL for planar heterojunction PSCs. Photoconductive measurements show that the defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film has an internal gain higher than 10<sup>3</sup> at a small bias of 0.5 V, which is attributed to the minority carrier trapping mechanism in the film. By coupling the highly photoconductive TiO<sub>2</sub> ETL with a high-quality perovskite light absorber synthesized using a low-pressure vapour annealing process, a highly efficient planar heterojunction PSC with relatively small hysteresis is achieved. The maximum PCEs under reverse scan, forward scan and steady state are 19.0, 17.1 and 17.6%, respectively. Thus, the performance gap between mesoscopic and planar TiO<sub>2</sub>-based devices has been significantly narrowed. Moreover, the stability of the planar heterojunction PSC is greatly improved by using defective TiO<sub>2</sub> as the ETL. TiO<sub>2</sub> is known to be an effective ultraviolet photocatalyst for oxidizing organic materials and the hybrid perovskite can be photocatalytically degraded under ultraviolet illumination, which typically leads to poor stability for the PSCs. The incorporation of hole-trap states in the TiO<sub>2</sub> ETL reduces its activity for photocatalytic oxidation. As a result, the stability of fabricated planar heterojunction PSCs is greatly improved and we show, for the first time, steady-state PCE &gt;15% during continuous operation for 100 h. These results demonstrate that engineering defects in the TiO<sub>2</sub> ETL is a promising way to improve the efficiency and stability of planar heterojunction PSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Photoconductive properties of defective TiO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="Par6">The compact TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films used in this work were deposited using electron beam (EB) evaporation with a substrate temperature of 350 °C in an oxygen-deficient environment. We note that this substrate temperature is considerably lower than that required for the formation of mesoscopic TiO<sub>2</sub> films. X-ray diffraction confirms that the as-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films are anatase phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The thin films are characterized by strong absorption in the ultraviolet region and very low absorption in the visible region, as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). An indirect bandgap of ∼3.3 eV is extracted from the Tauc plot of the absorption spectrum (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), consistent with that of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>. The high transmittance in the visible range is important for its application as an ETL, as the perovskite light absorber in the solar cell is illuminated through this layer. Despite low sub-bandgap absorption, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) reveals a broad emission centred at around 600 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Consistent with prior reports, this defect-related emission from anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> is very weak at room temperature, indicating that dominant recombination processes are non-radiative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, this weak radiative recombination indicates the presence of deep-level native defects within the material that are related to oxygen vacancies and/or under-coordinated Ti sites. This finding is consistent with composition analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), which reveals that the low-temperature EB-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films are slightly (∼2 at%) deficient in oxygen.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Optical and optoelectronic properties of defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Absorption coefficient of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film on a Si substrate, determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry.

To explore the role of defects on the photoconductivity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films, measurements were performed using a photoconductor made by depositing a Ti metal top contact on the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. For comparison, the conductivity of a conventional solution-processed TiO<sub>2</sub> film was also measured using the same device architecture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The linear current–voltage (JV) curve measured in the dark indicates Ohmic contacts are formed at both FTO/TiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/Ti interfaces (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). The conductivity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film was greatly increased under ultraviolet illumination. At a bias of 0.5 V, an unexpectedly large photocurrent density of ∼1.1 A cm<sup>−2</sup> was generated under 365 nm illumination at an irradiance of 3.6 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>. This value greatly exceeds the light-limited photocurrent density that can be generated; even at an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 100%, the photocurrent density should not exceed 1.1 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> under these conditions. The observation of an exceptionally high photocurrent density, which is not observed for the case of the conventional solution-processed TiO<sub>2</sub> film, indicates that there exists a mechanism for internal photoconductive gain in the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film. Indeed, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, a photoconductive gain of more than 10<sup>3</sup> is obtained at a bias of 0.5 V. Such high photoconductive gain in TiO<sub>2</sub> has been reported for single crystalline nanorods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but not for polycrystalline thin films. Examination of the temporal evolution of the photoconductivity reveals slow rise and fall times on the order of hours, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>. Such behaviour is characteristic of persistent photoconductivity and, together with the large photoconductive gain, indicates a hole-trapping mechanism in the defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film that results in photo-induced accumulation of excess majority carriers, as shown schematically in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>. These electrons contribute to the improved conductivity before eventually recombining with the trapped holes, with long recombination times due to either atomic-scale reorganization following hole trapping at the defect site or spatial segregation of the two carrier types (for instance, trapping of holes at grain boundaries or surfaces).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Shematic structure and mechanism of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photoconductor.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic structure for characterization of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film as a photoconductor.

For comparison, planar heterojunction PSCs were also fabricated using TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films annealed at 500 °C in air as the ETL. The photoconductivity of the EB-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films decreased drastically after annealing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). This finding is consistent with increased electron-hole recombination rates in the annealed TiO<sub>2</sub> due to reduced concentrations of beneficial long-lived hole-trap states associated with photoconductive gain and persistent photoconductivity. Consequently, the photovoltaic performance of the planar PSCs fabricated using post-annealed TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films as ETL was lowered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Compared with PSCs fabricated with as-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub>, PSCs fabricated with post-annealed TiO<sub>2</sub> yielded lower FF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with the increased series resistance due to the decreased photoconductivity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> ETL. The larger hysteresis that is observed following annealing is also in agreement with the reduced electron extraction efficiency due to the decreased photoconductivity.</p><p id="Par13">As the conductivity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> is mainly affected by ultraviolet illumination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>), the effect of hole trapping in the TiO<sub>2</sub> ETL on the photovoltaic properties of the planar PSCs was investigated by measurement with and without an ultraviolet cutoff (425 nm-long pass) filter. As discussed above and shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, under full spectrum illumination, the photocurrent from the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film photoconductor increased and decreased gradually when the light was switched on and off, respectively. Likewise, the photocurrent of the complete PSC increased gradually on illumination with full-spectrum AM 1.5G light, as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. In contrast, no obvious light-soaking process was observed when ultraviolet light was blocked from the illumination (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Therefore, the effect of light soaking on increasing photocurrent in complete PSCs under full spectrum illumination is attributed to the gradually increased conductivity of the TiO<sub>2</sub> ETL in the presence of ultraviolet illumination, which is enabled by incorporation of long-lived deep-level hole trap states. This assignment is also supported by the absence of a significant light-soaking process under AM 1.5G illumination in planar PSCs fabricated using post-annealed TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films as the ETL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1055">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Effect of the hole traps in the defective TiO<sub>2</sub> on the photocurrent of planar heterojunction PSC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Evolution of the photocurrent from a complete PSC under full AM 1.5G spectrum (orange line) and visible light (blue line) illumination.

The photocurrent rise and decay with and without ultraviolet illumination can be repeated, because the hole trapping and de-trapping is reversible.

However, these methods lead to lower device efficiencies due to reduced electron extraction efficiencies and/or parasitic light absorption. As photogenerated holes in the TiO<sub>2</sub> are required to facilitate oxidation of organic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, incorporation of deep-level hole traps into defective TiO<sub>2</sub> provides opportunity to suppress photocatalytic activity and increase the stability of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite interface. We tested the photocatalytic activity of defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films by photoelectrochemical oxidation of methylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) in aqueous solution. As shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, the photocurrent of the defective as-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film was much lower than that of the post-annealed sample, which possessed fewer long-lived hole trap states. This decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the defective TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film has important implications for stability of functional photovoltaic devices. Indeed, the planar PSC employing as-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> as the ETL shows dramatically enhanced long-term stability. As shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, the photocurrent decayed by only about 10% from its maximum value after continuous operation near the maximum power point for 100 h. In contrast, the photocurrent of the PSC fabricated using post-annealed TiO<sub>2</sub> decayed by &gt;30% after 100 h. In addition, the planar PSC fabricated using defective TiO<sub>2</sub> yielded a maximum PCE of 17.6% and PCEs over 15.4% for the entire 100 h testing period. To the best of our knowledge, this combination of high efficiency (over 15%) with long-term stability has not been demonstrated with either planar or mesoscopic PSCs.
