Traditional three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) electronics gadgets fail to effectively comply with these necessities owing to their stiffness and large weights. Investigations have come up with a new family of one-dimensional (1D) flexible and fiber-based electronic devices (FBEDs) comprising power storage, energy-scavenging, implantable sensing, and flexible displays gadgets. However, development and manufacturing are still a challenge owing to their small radius, flexibility, low weight, weave ability and integration in textile electronics. This paper will provide a detailed review on the importance of substrates in electronic devices, intrinsic property requirements, fabrication classification and applications in energy harvesting, energy storage and other flexible electronic devices. Fiber- and textile-based electronic devices for bulk/scalable fabrications, encapsulation, and testing are reviewed and presented future research ideas to enhance the commercialization of these fiber-based electronics devices.<fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2022_1008_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Flexible electronics</kwd><kwd>Electronic textiles</kwd><kwd>Energy harvesting</kwd><kwd>Supercapacitors</kwd><kwd>Photovoltaic devices</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>40</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>31</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40820_2022_Article_1008.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology and Microengineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanoscale Science and Technology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">The Internet of Thing (IoT) has reached a huge impact on self-recognition, real-time access to information for better communication and data-driven decision-making.

The increasing trends for flexible, portable, low-cost, and lightweight wearable electronics attracted academic interests to compliance with future challenges for the fabrication of the next generation FBEDs which highlight the importance of the technical advancements in terms of potential applications and performance of the devices as well as improvement in the quality of life and significant economic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] shows the tendency of stretchable electronics market with a cumulated aggregate growth rate (CAGR) of 25.29% in the forecast period of 2020–2026, and the market value is expected to be worth USD 2981.2 million by end of 2026 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This becomes a consequence of research and development (R&amp;D) efforts in recent past with proof of increasing numbers of publications in the flexible electronic devices field as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. Flexible devices have experienced a considerable growth from plain electronic devices to flexible devices (2014) and to stretchable electronics devices (2019), with present attention moving to foldable and deformable electronic devices as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

On the other hand, we are increasing our social connection with other people heavily relying upon the flexible and portable electronic devices such as laptops and smartphones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These trends in turn boosted the development of the wearable electronic devices (WEDs) to comply with the tasks associated with fast, accurate, direct, and convenient processing of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, smart watches help us to track the movement and communicate to us when we do exercise, instead of holding other heavy electronic devices. These WEDs are in close contact with human bodies which are smooth and portable. During these contacts with body movements, they are subjected to different stress levels and deformations, so these devices must be stretchable and flexible enough to comply with these deformations. Moreover, to avoid the normal working and to ensure the comfort of the wearer, they must be lightweight. Traditional three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) devices failed to efficiently comply with above-mentioned requirements owing to their rigidity and bulkiness.</p><p id="Par9">Moreover, flexible FBEDs, embracing one-dimensional (1D) assembly with modest curvature from 10 to 100 µm, have allured extensive interest toward its application in the wearable electronics area. These devices can be fabricated in different configurations such as interlacing, twisting and coaxial. Being fiber-based devices, they are light in weight and flexible and can adopt and sustain different deformation stresses such as bending deformation, stretching and distortion deformation. It is important to note that these 1D fiber-shaped devices can easily be weaved into flexible, breathable, and deformable textiles which facilitate practical applications of these devices. Hence, research efforts have focused on increasing their performance to exploit in the textile-based substrate for further growth of stretchable, self-healing, or shape-memory functionalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Self-powering devices by fabricating energy harvesting devices integrated with energy storage devices or energy storage devices integrated sensors have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These advancements have motivated and inspired the tech industry like wearable electronic and clothing industry to exploit the well-established traditional textile technology for weaving and developing these fiber-based electronic devices (FBEDs). One example of such devices is a Jacquard smart jacket co-launched by Google and Levi’s which has integrated fiber-shaped sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but with a limited functionality such as reminding the wearers about keeping the smartphone with them.</p><p id="Par10">Further efforts are required to manufacture advanced textile-based electronic devices integrating more functionalities and simultaneously be integrated in the textile fibers. The reported FBEDs are classified mainly into four categories: (1) textile-based energy-generating devices which transform the different types of energy, such as solar and mechanical energy, into electrical energy. These devices are mainly comprised of flexible solar cells, piezoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Fiber-shaped solar cells, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are the most researched devices that can be integrated into textile effectively and are primarily reviewed in this paper. (2) Textile-based energy storage devices have been extensively investigated to save energy and dispense this power to other wearable electronic devices where required. The reported textile-based energy storage devices include supercapacitors (SCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], flexible lithium-on batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Li–S batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Li–air batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], sodium-ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Zn-ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and silver–zinc batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Among these reported devices, SCs are the most cited ones owing to its easy fabrication, long cyclic life, and high-power throughput. Lithium-ion batteries have also been manufactured into textile-based energy storage devices and will be considered in this review. (3) The development of light emitting electronic devices for various applications such as flexible display, phototherapy, and illumination. Based on their working mechanisms, these devices are reported as electroluminescence, sonoluminescence, thermoluminescence, mechanoluminescence and chemiluminescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Amid these reported devices, electroluminescent devices are the most extensive studied devices owing to its good controllability and operated by direct current (DC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and alternating current (AC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] methods. (4) Fiber-based sensors having excellent potential for applications in flexible electronics and implantable medical devices for physical health and fitness monitoring. Recently, they have also been explored for medical diagnostics, especially for elderly populations. Thanks to their 1D configuration, fiber-based sensors can be easily implanted and mounted on the human body with little or no damage, while providing multi-tasking when integrated into a small electronic unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These sensors worked through physical processes based on conducting fibers, optical fibers and chemical ligands exploiting chemical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Another key to the application of FBEDs is the connections to electronic components that must be compatible with a simple and efficient manufacturing process.

One of the key factors in designing FBEDs is the choice of substrate which has an exceptional blend of performance features, making it appropriate for the specific application. Electronic devices comprising flexible substrates allow various degrees of flexibility namely, bendability, elastic stretchability, rollability, and permanent slandering. In addition to flexibility, these substrates offer maintainability of other key characteristics such as excellent adhesion of active material during compression, twisting and stretching stresses. Compared to rigid substrates, fiber and textile-based substrates in flexible electronic devices offer numerous advantages, e.g., light in weight, thin, high mechanical resistance, and cost-effectiveness. Application of these fiber and textile-based substrate in biomedical and consumer electronics is forecasted to have great potential for market growth. With the flexible electronic market value being projected to grow to USD 775 million during the 2018–2023 period, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In the processing of design and manufacturing of the FBEDs, a key element is the selection of a substrate which possesses stretchability and mechanical flexibility. The detail list of the key variables comprises numerous physicochemical attributes, namely thermal stability (in case of extreme weather conditions), chemical stability, excellent adhesion of the coating, surface evenness, optical clarity (e.g., solar cells), and permeability and water repellency. The applications where wearable electronic devices need to contact with the human body, then biocompatibility and bioresorbable attributes of the substrate need to be selected carefully for long-term sustainability. Some of the key attributes of flexible substrates include.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mechanical Stability</title><p id="Par15">The flexible wearable devices are subjected to various mechanical stresses in practical life; thus, it is a requirement for a flexible electronic device to sustain those mechanical stresses. The term flexibility refers to the ability to sustain various mechanical stresses while maintaining its functional properties and performance parameters under those stresses. The target flexibility for electronic devices is quite diverse owing to its broad range of applications. For example, in implanted sensors/communication devices which are mounted/integrated on human skin or other human organs, it is anticipated the need to cope with high stress. However, in other applications small recurring stress cycles or modest one-time strain are expected. In normal conditions, flexible substrates demonstrate essentially ductile-plastic behavior that protects mechanical failure beyond the elastic limit. As the ductility of the substrate is tuned to increase, the strain limit also increases in parallel which results in enhanced flexibility and elongation. Hence, the representative parameter which deals with the mechanical flexibility of the substrate is Young’s Modulus (YM) and measures the stiffness of the materials. YM is a ratio between the stress (<italic>σ</italic>) to strain (<italic>ε</italic>) in the linear elastic system of a uniaxial distortion. The low modulus material represents wide stress array which reveals desirable features without deteriorating the mechanical and electrical behavior. Similarly, through downscaling of the dimensions of the polymer-based flexible substrates, such as Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Polyimide (PI), the modulus can be reduced because the thickness of the film and modulus of strained film are inversely proportional to each other according to the theoretical model:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>54.872</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.226</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Moreover, during processing and application of flexible and stretchable substrates as electrodes, the final strain experienced by the electrodes is directly proportional to YM of the material encapsulating the active material. Thus, for flexible and wearable electronics applications, the substrate must exhibit lower value of YM, sustain deformation stresses, and retain high stretchability. For instance, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with YM = 360–870 kPa displays outstanding performance when subject to mechanical deformation conditions, which empowers its application in flexible and wearable electronics.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Young’s Modulus of materials for flexible and wearable electronics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2022_1008_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Stretchability</title><p id="Par18">In order to exploit flexible substrates in wearable and implantable electronics, it is required for the material to have excellent stretchability to guarantee outstanding performance of the electrodes. The term stretchability, in qualitative terms, is defined as the ability to sustain its properties, e.g., conductivity, under severe mechanical stresses. In quantitative terms, it is defined as the critical stress state of the material at which its behavior changed, for instance from a conductive material to a non-conductive material. In specific terms, stretchability is the ability of materials in flexible and wearable systems, to sustain stress induced by external stimulators such as motion of the body or 100% elastic deformation range. For wearable applications, materials with intrinsically low ductile-plastic behaviors prevent mechanical cracks beyond elastic limits and exhibit stretchability to required value while allowing for out-of-plan distortion. There are two main identified techniques for the fabrication of stretchable electronics: (1) structural modification of the substrate, which includes numerous patterning structures such as serpentine, mesh-types, merged structures, mogul pattern and fractal fabricated by depositing on polymeric substrates in order to sustain excellent conductive characteristics even under mechanical stresses. (2) Exploiting intrinsically stretchable substrates and (3) incorporation of filler materials in the polymers system by either systematic manners or random technique. On the latter approach due to the non-stretchable nature of numerous fillers, several small dimensional nanomaterials, such 1D or hybrid structures, are fabricated to increase the stretchability, while upholding transparency of the flexible substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, 2D materials with exceptional intrinsic conductive properties and facile scalable synthesis technique can be exploited as potential candidate for future electronic devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Adhesion</title><p id="Par19">Adhesion is the propensity of unalike nanoparticles or surfaces to stick to one another due to different forces namely intermolecular forces responsible for numerous functions of several kinds. For instance, labels and tacky tape fall into different classes of chemical adhesion, diffusive adhesion, and a dispersive adhesion. Subject to different chemical and physical properties of the substrates and metals, poor adhesion is obtained mainly for thin film electrodes deposited on flexible substrates. In the flexible and wearable electronics, outstanding adhesion of deposited material or thin films are critical because of external stimulators provide abrasion energy which might cause pilling of some poorly adhered thin films or materials and render the electronic devices impracticable. The leading factor for the adhered material is usually substrate surface energy which comes from polar or dispersive characteristics of the substrates. A good adhesion is obtained when the substrate demonstrates a surface energy of 7–10 dynes cm<sup>−2</sup> higher than the deposited materials and it is normally in the range of 34–36 dynes cm<sup>−2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]<sub>.</sub> Amid other factors, surface pollution and low activation of the substrate are some of the root causes for low activation energy. To achieve an excellent adhesion of nano-particles between conductive materials and substrates, primarily two methods are exploited including construction of chemical bond between the metal and physical interlocking. For implantable devices, where good adhesion of the active material with the active substrate is important chemical bond adhesion is not stable and only physical methods offer good adhesion which involves the development of a transition layer sandwiched between metal and substrate in order to obtain good adhesion and stability of the devices. Excellent adhesion properties are critical to realize a steady performance of the electrodes, and it becomes more important in the case of wearable electronics because during operation they are subjected to bending stresses and there are chances of pilling of active material from the substrate surface. In addition, for encapsulation of conductive material, adhesion between electrode and encapsulation coating is critical with inevitability of double interfacial coating design for good electrode encapsulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Permeability</title><p id="Par20">During use, wearable and flexible electronic device are surrounded by complex environmental constituents such as gases, liquids and other chemical molecules that have tendency to penetrate in the structure of the flexible substrate and compromise the performance and sensitivity of the devices. Water droplets which may become entrapped under the surface of the devices, leading to prolonged exposure of the device to this moisture, may deteriorate the device performance and cause some infection to the user’s skin, which may induce severe pain and delayed healing of the body parts. This problem can be avoided by using substrates which are impermeable or selectively permeable to biological environmental constituents,’ such as liquids, gases, proteins, and other molecular substances. Substrates like PDMS and PI are considered excellent flexible substrates for biomedical applications, due their good permeability to organic thinners, small lipophilic particles (PDMS), high durability, and good electrical properties for longer time in aqueous and saline solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Stretchable substrates normally comprise of long chain molecules and have large pores size as compared to molecules, which allow good permeability to aqueous molecules and oxygen. This is also the case with breathability which is a critical parameter in case of wearable systems because it allows long lasting wearability and excellent adhesion of wearable and flexible systems during perspiration. The high permeability substrates also help to avoid potential risks to skin infections by allowing water and gases to pass through sweat gland ducts. Recent literature shows that by careful modeling and design of the substrates, porosity, pore size of the material can be successfully controlled to achieve selective permeability, such as in fibers and textile substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Water Repellency</title><p id="Par21">Water repellency is the term described as the capability or characteristic of the substrate to repel wetting of the substrate. As discussed above, water vapor entrapped under wearable devices compromise the device performance and its sensitivity and may cause skin inflammation. In case of wearable systems, it is mandatory to make some surface modification of the substrate before its application to wearable systems. Chemical or structural modifications are made to change its affinity to water and introduction of moisture management properties to remain unaffected from moisture, sweating, washing, and showering. Recently, numerous approaches have been reported in the literature to exploit water affinity of the substrate, which has helped to enhance water repellency and introduce hydrophobicity in the material. This has been achieved by introducing filler elastomers such as poly(styrene–isoprene–styrene) in sensors, which shows better results as compared to PDMS, which has its hermeticity deteriorate for long exposure to water vapor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Moreover, device sensitivity and performance can be tailored by making the substrate super hydrophobic, and this also helps to minimize its indissoluble affect during device fabrication and assembly. During the deposition of the hydrophilic coatings on the substrate, surface treatment must be done beforehand to increase surface functionality, although this may lead to external moisture penetration. Therefore, the hydrophobic property of the substrates must be carefully considered to design good water repellent substrates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Softness</title><p id="Par22">The softness of the material, normally represented by the YM, is very important especially in biomedical applications where both stretchability and softness are critical to make sure mechanical compatibility among the human body tissues and the electrode material, because any mismatch between these properties may result in issues with tissues or inflammation in the skin. Therefore, simultaneous realization of these two properties is highly recommended in biocompatible medical devices. Softness is the key element while designing wearable biomedical devices, when compared to stretchability, which is not fully discussed in literature, and extensive research is required in this attribute to investigate tissue interactions at cell level to design an implantable device which has no harmful effects on human tissues. In addition to the substrate’s softness, conductivity of the implantable device is also very important and various approaches have exploited to enhance the softness of the active layer of the electrodes which plays a key role in biomedical field, especially during surgery, particularly for deep brain stimulation where electrodes need to be inserted in the brain. To avoid damage or to control the tissue damage during insertion and removal of the materials, stretchable, removable rigid substrates and shape-memory polymer substrates can be exploited for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chemical Stability</title><p id="Par23">Chemical stability of the substrate is very important because during the electronic device’s fabrication process, they are subject to different solvents and chemicals, which may cause damage to flexible substrates. Hence, substrates must be compatible with different chemicals such as acidic, basic, and other solvents. However, while thin film encapsulation coating on substrates is sometime exploited to protect flexible substrates from chemical damages, nevertheless, it is not practical. Typically, a hard coating on the substrate can offer better protection against permeation by atmospheric constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Thermal Stability</title><p id="Par24">Thermal stability of the substrate is very important, especially for extreme conditions electronic devices, and this may result in more process steps in device fabrication. The thermal stability parameters optimization is ruled by |ΔCTE·Δ<italic>T</italic>|≤ 0.1 0.3%, where ΔCTE and Δ<italic>T</italic> are the coefficient variances of the thermal expansion of substrate, thin film of the devices and temperature excursion during fabrication, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This temperature excursion between thin film of the device and flexible substrate may lead to convex bending of the devices which may result in cracking and delamination of the film during fabrication of devices. Therefore, to avoid this thermal cracking problem under extreme temperature conditions, the design and development of the thin film must be robust to thermal expansion to evade the mismatches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Biocompatibility</title><p id="Par25">The term biocompatibility is normally defining the property of the material being well-suited to living tissues and these materials do not yield lethal or immunological issues when exposed to human body or fluids. For application of wearable electronics in the medical field, biocompatibility of the material and substrate is considered a critical element because it will generate intimate connotation with the biological interfaces. Biocompatibility is compromised due to various factors such as chemical composition, pH of the solution and surface charge. There are numerous substrates which have good biocompatibility such as PDMS, cellulose substrate and silk-based textiles. In addition to these materials, some other substrate materials can also be exploited as biocompatible materials such hard gelatin, starches, and caramelized glucose. The other self-assembling polymers such as cellulose, silk and chitin that offers similar hierarchical configuration with natural bio-repetitive arrangement are also potential substrates for flexible electronics. In the recent trends, wearable health monitoring applications use biomass materials such as bacterial cellulose, which is reported as biocompatible fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Another approach to fabricate a biocompatible substrate is to encapsulate flexible devices with biocompatible coatings such as PU, Eco flex and PDMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Bioresorbability</title><p id="Par26">Bioresorbable materials also known as biodegradable materials are materials that eradicate ecological, chemical, or physical harms by decomposing or dissolving themselves, without any environmental impact and residue toxic pollutants inside the human body.

The FDSSCs devices attracted significant attention of researchers and companies owing to its potential for large-scale production at low cost, huge potential for commercial applications, such as integrated devices and biomedical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and due to its high deformability and fabrication in curve shape, which make it an appropriate nominee for mobile and flexible electronics applications. These types of devices normally required polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates. The choice of active material is made based on their band energy level (BEL). For DSSCs, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO have been chosen because of their wide bandgap properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Since PET and PEN degrade in the temperature range of 120–150 °C, it limits the processing and applications of FDSSCs. The working electrodes must be prepared without binders and without annealing. These binder free layers of active materials result in cracks forming in the thin films during the drying process which increase the risk of exposure of electrolyte to substrate. Secondly, passing the calcination process during the fabrication process makes organic particles remain on the active layer surface which weakens electron transportation through the electrodes. Consequently, the cracks and residual particles present on the surface of the active layer degrade the photo-conversion performance and efficiency of the device and its stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Fiber and textile-based substrates offer the advantages that they are stable and sustain high temperature calcination treatment to remove these organic residual particles from the active material paste.

Even though, this work exhibited the fabrication of a textile-based perovskite solar cell with the good stability properties for the delivered applications, it is still demonstrating low flexibility as this device was directly fabricated onto the textile substrate. Therefore, the manufacturing of the integrated device has compromised flexibility properties such as folding and residual constraints for the attaining of complete device flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Textile-Based Solar Cells Comparison</title><p id="Par40">From the last couple of decades, scientists have successfully demonstrated the fabrication and manufacturing of FDSSCs and counter electrodes which are significant for the development of integrated devices.

Indeed, the scarcity of the energy arising from the fossil-fuels and environmental concerns increasingly force the scientists to explore new sustainable sources of the energy. Electrochemical energy storage devices in this aspect perform a very substantial role. Amid reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] electrochemical energy storage sources, supercapacitors, and batteries are considered as the most significant contenders on the Ragone checkerboard and have been a hot topic of research in both academia and in industry. In the recent past, flexible, and wearable electronics have attracted significant attention of the researchers and scholars due to its continuous emergence in diverse applications, such as biomedical, mobility, sports, consumer electronic devices, and clean energy. The operability of these devices has boosted the necessity for more efficient energy storage devices and their commercialization leading to new challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Modern flexible electronic devices designs have revealed a new visualization of potential flexible wearable electronic devices such as implantable sensors, artificial skins, and other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. To cope with the requirements of the above-mentioned devices, storage devices must establish excellent performance standards even under constant mechanical stresses and deformations including folding, bending, stretching, and twisting for long cycles. For example, an artificial skin may conceivably present a resolution of obtaining real-time data by exploiting body sensors that can assist in regulating biological signals and health related information of the human while assisting human beings in varied conditions and activities. The fundamental challenge is to design and fabricate a FSEDs exploiting fiber-based electrode materials which demonstrate high specific energy and power and show exceptional cyclic stability using compatible electrolyte and separator. Other key parameters are low-cost fabrication and safety of the device which also attract significant importance especially when it’s implantable and fiber-shaped devices. Thus, the increasing applications of these flexible electronics in different fields will inflate the need for FBEDs for modern wearable/implantable devices. From the past couple of decades, electrochemical supercapacitors (ESCs) are attracting significant importance equally in industry as well academia owing to their good energy density (as compared to traditional capacitors) and excellent power density, long cyclic life, and fast charge/discharge rates, which is normally in seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">The conventional ESCs possess inept structures (i.e., a separator sandwiched between two active materials (electrodes) wrapped in aqueous electrolyte), which poses key problems for their applications in realization and commercialization of wearable electronic devices. Major problem with traditional aqueous electrolyte-based SCs is its safety related issues where toxic electrolytes are used during fabrication which require high-quality encapsulation and technological advancement to avoid the leakage of these electrolytes. This encapsulation ultimately increases the weight of these devices and shows some shape constraints to be integrated into wearable electronics and other functional electronic systems. To address these issues and limitations in integration, flexible fiber-based SCs have appeared as innovative device for energy storage devices and engrossed extensive amounts of research in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The FSCs are comprised of two flexible electrodes, gel–electrolyte (solid state or gel-like), a separator and an encapsulation material analogous to traditional SCs. The FSCs offer some advantages relative to traditional SCs, such as the exploitation of gel–polymer electrolyte and fiber-shaped electrodes that can be fabricated in smart designs, lightweight, thin shapes and miniaturized size thus enhancing their potential scope of applications in flexible and wearable electronics.</p><p id="Par43">Research on flexible FSCs originated from the investigation on carbon and conducting polymer-based materials in early 90’s. During the first decades of 21st century, some breakthroughs have been observed in this field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In these publications, SCs are typically fabricated by sandwiching the polymer-based electrolytes between two flexible electrodes in parallel configuration in which the active material is mainly deposited on stainless steel grids. Such approach to fabricate and assemble SCs devices poses two different problems: (1) limited control on the thickness of the device due to the thick layer of solid-state electrolyte and metal-based flexible current collectors; and (2) in this configuration normally electrodes are pressed against each other and become in contact with electrolyte. Therefore, only part of the electrode closed to electrolyte at electrode/electrolyte interface will efficiently be utilized. However, over the past decade the fabrication techniques have been improved to address these issues and remarkable progress have been reported in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Principles and Understanding of Charge Storage Mechanism</title><p id="Par44">Numerous studies have briefly described the charge storage mechanism of SCs and its fundamental electrochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. SCs are mainly classified into two types based on their charge storage mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]; (1) electrochemical double layer supercapacitors (EDLCs), and (2) pseudocapacitors. EDLC is a surface phenomenon and charge accumulation are done on the electrode/electrolyte interface. It is a physical process without any faradaic/redox reaction as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The specific performance of the ELDC devices is governed by the surface properties of the active material such as specific surface area and pore size distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. It is recommended that pore size of porous material for ELDCs must be double the size of the electrolyte molecules/ions to grant full penetration to the pore walls. If there is no compatibility between electrolyte ions and pore dimensions of the active material, the solvated ions will not pass through the pores, but some research reports invalidated this postulation and calculated the highest ever specific capacitance values, even for the smaller pore sizes than electrolyte ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. This shows that no clear correlation exists between specific surface area and capacitance, allowing to infer that large surface and average pore size have no significant impact on specific capacitance. However, according to some reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], in carbon-based material, capacitance increases ~ 1.5 fold when pore sizes &lt; 1 nm are employed. This means that the carbon nanostructure (instead of specific surface area) and pore size play a significant role in enhancing gravimetric capacitance as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. In the recent era, due to numerous in-situ spectroscopic studies and advanced computational techniques close investigation of developments and source of charge storage mechanisms in carbon materials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Conway reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] that different faradaic reactions are the outcome of capacitive electrochemical attributes as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, such as: (1) underpotential deposition, (2) redox reactions normally observed in transitional metal oxides, e.g., RuO<sub>2</sub>·<italic>n</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O: and (3) intercalation and deintercalation pseudocapacitive normally observed in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>. A brief account on pseudocapacitive behavior can be found in the latest reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In the pseudocapacitive behavior, charge accumulation is normally done via surface or near surface charge transfer responses. An intercalation/deintercalation charge storage mechanism was reported in which electrolyte molecules penetrate inside the structure of the redox active material or tunnel is complemented by faradaic charge transfer without compromising default structure of the crystal. In some of the recent reported studies, the term “pseudocapacitive” is confused with materials whose cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge curves are like the attribute of battery materials such as (Ni (OH)<sub>2</sub> and Co<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> in KOH electrolyte). Conversely, the designated pseudocapacitive materials are those which demonstrate electrochemical behavior like carbon-based materials such as MnO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Therefore, it is recommended that the term “pseudocapacitors” must be used for material which shows behavior like RuO<sub>2</sub> in liquid electrolyte.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Graphical demonstration of EDLCs charge storage mechanism and <bold>b</bold> various types of redox mechanism in PCs: (<bold>a</bold>) underpotential adsorption, (<bold>b</bold>) redox PCs, (<bold>c</bold>) intercalation PCs.

In this design, two flexible electrodes are placed parallel to each other with gel-polymer electrodes sandwiched between them wrapped in a flexible packaging. Mechanical flexibility is the most critical property for flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors because they are exposed to extensive mechanical stresses in real-life applications. Therefore, mechanical properties are evaluated by performing electrochemical characterization such as bending stability, folding and twisted conditions. Owing to easy fabrication and assembly, this type of configuration is the most studied design in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Nevertheless, due to the absence of separator in this configuration, complete protection from short circuiting is not guaranteed.</p><p id="Par55"><italic>Planar or On-Chip Structure</italic> Planar configuration of the SCs device fabrication is an emerging design of the device and has the advantage of making thinner and more flexible devices than current design of fabrication techniques of devices, due to their distinctive structural pattern, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The device comprises three important constituents integrated into a 2D configuration in the same plan, which include active material for electrode, current collector, and electrolyte. The incumbent configuration offers enormous channels for electrolyte’s ions and accelerates charge transfer in 2D direction. Additionally, this configuration demonstrates configuration stability and does not affect the electrolyte ions movement even if the devices are subjected to different bending conditions such as rolled and folded conditions.</p><p id="Par56"><italic>Fiber-Shaped Structure</italic> In the recent past, owing to growing demands for wearable and portable electronics, fiber-based SCs have attracted significant attention from investigators and researchers. Thanks to the structural integrity of fibers, fiber-based SCs offer unique advantages over sandwich and planar-shape SCs in terms of structural variety, flexibility, and light weight. In addition to above-mentioned attributes, conventional configurations (sandwich and planar) are unable to match specific capacitance and power volume. Fiber-based SCs offer numerous structures, and focused efforts have been made in developing and designing novel configurations and construction, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. One simple example of this configuration is assembling two parallel fiber-based electrodes dipped in gel-polymer electrolyte in parallel, on a flexible substrate as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Fiber-based SCs also offer the benefit of easy integration of single fiber SC in parallel and series which help in enhancing current density and voltage to increase power and energy densities needed to meet the requirement for practical applications in portable and flexible electronics. Carbon-based active materials such as carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons and graphene-based materials are exploited to fabricate different fibers and yarn shapes. These shapes can also be hybridized with other active materials to synthesize a composite material for faradaic pseudocapacitance, such as transition metal oxides and conducting polymers.</p><p id="Par57"><italic>Wire-Shape Structure</italic> The increased demand for flexible and wearable electronic devices wire-type SCs needed that can easily be woven into textile or wearable electronics. The conventional configuration of device fabrication described above offers many advantages, but they are not classified as fiber-based SCs in true sense, because they are exploited as support to devices. True fiber-based SCs are fabricated as an 1D-wire structure in which one fiber-based electrode is coiled around the other electrode with separator or gel-polymer electrolyte filled in between the electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. For example, wire-type SCs is fabricated using two carbon fiber-based yarns in which one yarn thread is coated with cellulose acetate as separators and other carbon-based yarn thread is coiled around the first yarn soaked with simulated sweat solution and gel-polymer as electrolyte. This configuration is also classified as coil-type SCs as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>d. The electrochemical characterization of these configurations can be performed under different mechanical stresses to evaluate the performance of the device, such as winding, stretching, bending, and folding conditions. However, these stresses might cause damage to coated gel-polymer electrolyte and two wire electrodes may get separated from each other in these conditions and deteriorate the performance of the device. Therefore, best configuration structure is not finalized yet that can sustain these mechanical stresses for mechanical stability.</p><p id="Par58"><italic>Cable-Shape Structure</italic> Wire-shaped SCs have some disadvantages such as short-circuiting and electrolyte seepage challenges because fiber-based electrodes in this configuration are in direct contact with each other, which makes them incompatible for real-life applications. To counter these problems, researchers have offered a novel technique for the fabrication of SCs devices called cable-type supercapacitors as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>e [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The basic principle of this configuration is exactly like wire shape SCs device but in this case an additional wire is introduced in the structure to act as spacer, which is evenly coiled around one of the electrodes with specific field as demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>f. This additional wire is also required in conventional flat SCs to avoid the short circuiting of the electrodes that are in direct contact. The first device of this configuration was fabricated in 2012, in which commercial pen coated electrodes are used as active material along with gel-electrolyte and coiling spacer wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. This spacer wire not only plays a role of prevention of short-circuiting during folding and bending but also offers efficient transfer of electrolyte ions and support large-scale fabrication of FSCs.</p><p id="Par59">In summary, there are three main cell configurations sandwich, planar and fiber-based supercapacitors. Fiber-shaped SCs are further classified as plan, sandwich, and cable type. Wire based or cable type SCs are most suitable for textile and wearable electronics. All three configurations are important with reference to application of these devices. Thus, the assembly of FBSCs must conform to prerequisites to be exploited for wearables including safety, mechanical flexibility, and excellent charge accumulation to enable higher energy density devices that are able to comply with application requirements. Here, flexibility of the devices is frequently cited as a mandatory feature for portable and wearable electronic devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Components of Supercapacitors</title><p id="Par60">The SCs devices normally comprise the following components as demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par61">Working electrodes or active material</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par62">Electrolyte</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">Separator</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">Current collectors</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par65">A SCs is composed of two working electrodes, a separator, gel-polymer electrolyte and two current collectors.

Flexible substrates are considered the most critical component in fabrication and development of FBSCs which shows high electrical conductivity for fast charge transportation and excellent mechanical stability to sustain high mechanical stresses when exposed to real-life applications. Considering recent applications and technological developments, the following flexible substrates have been developed and exploited for flexible electrodes which are mainly classified into three broad categories:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par67">Fiber-shaped substrates</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">Paper-shaped substrates</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69">3D porous substrates</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par70"><italic>Flexible Wires/Flexible Metal Matric/Metallic Fabrics</italic> Metal wires or metallic fabrics or meshes are extensively used as flexible current collector for SCs due to their excellent mechanical strength and high electrical conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. For this purpose, various metal-based substrates have been explored including stainless steel (SS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], copper (Cu) wire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], nickel (Ni) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], and titanium (Ti) wire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], which provide easy fabrication of electrode, high mechanical strength, and excellent conductivity. In addition to flexibility, the active materials deposited on these substrates during electrodes fabrication results in enhanced specific capacitance, energy, and power density, respectively. On the other hand, powder-based active materials need binder for better adherence to the substrate resulting in low value of capacitance and energy density. Rafique et al.

The device demonstrated an excellent cyclic and bending stability and exhibited insignificant deterioration in electrochemical performance under different bending stresses. The device shows 100% retention of capacitance after 500 cycles. Similarly, Cu (OH)<sub>2</sub> deposited directly on Cu foil substrate offer large numbers of active sites for electrolyte ions and redox reactions which are easily accessible for the electrolyte’s ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. A flexible and bendable SCs is fabricated in asymmetric configuration in which Cu (OH)<sub>2</sub> and AC (activated carbon) are used as anode and cathode, respectively.

This increase in thickness of the films results in enhanced gravimetric capacitance which strongly depend on thickness of the active material and decrease in the thickness of the film will slightly increase the specific capacitance for the device. But the problem with the thick film of the active material is that it increases the path length between the conductive substrate and surface of the active material which consequently deteriorates the capacitance and rate capability. These problems can be encountered by exploiting 3D conductive structures as current collectors which enables high mass loadings. Avasthi et al.

In addition, the use of these substrates as current collectors enhances bulkiness of the whole SCs device. On the contrary, carbon-based substrate such as carbon paper (CP), carbon foam and carbon cloth, demonstrated excellent electrical conductivity, good corrosive resistance, good flexibility, and light weight. Thus, as compared to metal-based substrates, carbon-based substrates are considered excellent contenders for FBEDs applications. Here, in this section, latest developments in carbon-based flexible substrates for FBSCs are discussed.</p><p id="Par74">CPs are composed of standard arrangements of microfibers of carbon in plan sheets with numerous nanoscale pores that offer larger specific surface area to accommodate the active material. The network of microfibers constitutes the CPs substrates that are well linked with other microfibers to establish a conducting network that permits suitable pore channels to be formed. These channels offer an effective network of ions/electrons transportation and efficient electrolyte access to electrochemical sites of the active material. Thanks to the high porosity, mechanical integrity and excellent conductivity, CPs are widely explored as current collectors for SCs, fuel cells and other applications.</p><p id="Par75">Numerous types of CP have been applied in different devices, ranging from hygiene and sanitation purposes to decorating and packaging of the materials. Moreover, CP has also been extended to portable and flexible electronic devices including circuits, flexible displays, photoanodes and transistors.

CP exhibited very low internal resistance and high porosity. A core–shell structure of ɣ-MnO<sub>2</sub> wrapped PANI is fabricated and modified stepwise by in situ polymerization technique to load core–shell structure uniformly on CP substrate by the physical adoption method and results in a flexible electrode material for SCs known as ɣ-MnO<sub>2</sub>-PANI-Cp substrate as shown Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>e and f.

id="Sec28"><title>Flexible Batteries</title><p id="Par94">The second potential source to meet the emerging demands of power supply is flexible batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. Confidence on operating systems in electronic gadgets such as mobile and electric vehicles has pushed for compact, lightweight, and flexible power solutions, which have potential to substitute plane, rigid and heavy batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. The evolution of flexible batteries dates back to almost hundreds of years ago. Evolution of flexible batteries started from flexible alkaline batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>] and full polymer batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. Later, polymer Li-metal batteries started to attract more interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. Recently, investigators concentrated their focus on flexible Li-ion batteries with more superior energy density and cycling stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Flexible batteries share the similar working principle as of traditional batteries and comprises of an anode, a cathode, a separator, and an electrolyte. The traditional rigid battery and planar structures cannot meet the obligations of flexible electronics, and it is imperative to fabricate flexible batteries with unique features and attributes to integrate with robust flexibility while conserving high energy density and extended cyclic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">Significant progress in this aspect has already been made not only in the development of constituent elements (anode and cathode materials, current collectors, solid electrolytes, etc.) but also in design aspect of battery system. It is certainly critical, flexible batteries must hold a high flexibility and deformability for all the four crucial constituent elements namely cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, to guarantee their steady power supply even under mechanical stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Flexible Li-ion batteries are the most extensively used battery systems for flexible and wearable electronic devices, but other battery chemistries including low-cost and wide accessible, e.g., sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>], potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>] and high energy density lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>], lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] and metal-air batteries (MABs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>] have also been aggressively researched to inflate the scenery of flexible batteries in recent past. Flexible batteries have been fabricated in three different configurations such as 1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>] fiber-shaped, 2D and 3D architectures.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Constituents of Battery Devices</title><p id="Par96">Flexible battery, like traditional batteries, is also comprised of four essential constituent elements, i.e., an anode, a cathode, a separator, and an electrolyte. However, the rigid and delicate nature of these constituents’ elements for traditional batteries would trigger failure and even safety concerns under mechanical stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To ensure the sustainability and mechanical stresses for flexible batteries, it is imperative to fabricate flexible constituent elements. Remaining in the scope of this review paper, we are focusing on flexible current collectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Current Collectors</title><p id="Par97">Current collectors perform a vital role in the fabrication of flexible electrode because it serves as both the substrate to assist active materials and help to connect the electrodes to complete the circuit. An ideal flexible substrate for fabrication of flexible battery electrodes must have certain attributes such as high flexibility, low-weight, excellent electrical conductivity, and solid adhesion with active materials. We will discuss in detail different types of flexible substrates used for flexible batteries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Metallic Foils Substrates</title><p id="Par98">Metallic foils owing to their high electrical conductivity have been used as current collector for fabrication of the battery’s electrodes in the traditional batteries for years. Thanks to the flexibility of these foils, it is a simple approach to employ these current collectors to fabricate electrodes for flexible batteries. In this regard, variety of metallic foils have been exploited such as Al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>], Cu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>], Ti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>], stainless steel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>] and Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>] to fabricate electrodes for flexible batteries. One of the problems with these metallic current collectors is the delamination of the active materials under mechanical stresses and deformations owing to their rigidity and delicacy which sometime leads to their poor battery performance. To counter this problem, researchers have devised a new strategy in which they make the current collector surface rough to increase the contact points and surface area for active material layer and their adhesion with the substrate. To counter this problem, many techniques have been adopted to introduce roughness on surface of the current collector such as sandpaper grinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>], chemical etching of the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>], and special morphology designing of the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>] as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>a. However, if a mismatch exists between current collector and active material during charge/discharge cycles, can intensify delamination of electrode materials from the metallic substrate especially under repeated mechanical deformations. In addition to bulkiness and low specific performance as well as delicacy and rigidity for metallic current collectors could inexorably impede the realization of flexible batteries. This has motivated researchers to explore other flexible and lightweight substrates, such as polymeric and carbon-based flexible materials, which has improved the adhesion of active material.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Surface morphology of a rough cupper substrate.

In this aspect, both conducting and insulating polymers have been explored as flexible substrates for flexible batteries. Different types of insulating polymers have been explored such as polyimide (PI), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN), poly(ether sulfone) (PES), and polypropylene (PP) which can sustain mechanical stress and deformation without fractures and deteriorating electrochemical performance. However, these substates have an obvious problem of low electrical conductivity which limit their use as flexible current collector. To address this problem, substrates are metallized before their use as current collector and deposition of active materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. Choi et al.

Constraints exist on the uniform distribution of nanoparticles into polymer matrix which often agglomerate during polymerization and on the transparency of the packaging material which limits its application as encapsulation coating for FBEDs.

The unevenness and permeability of the fabric that complicate the printing of uninterrupted and even coating of conductive textiles or the large strain sustained by textiles which enables cracks or peeling of the conductive coatings are the constraints to be addressed.

Several research studies have been dedicated to developing a FBEDs with energy harvesting, energy storage, electronic, sensing functions. The current research and studies are focused on identification of functional requirements of FBEDs and assortment of active materials, device design, fabrication techniques and structure of the devices. Scientific community has surpassed way ahead of conducting fibers and fiber-based electrochemical sensors, and dielectrically gate field effect transistors have been replaced with complex logic gate from simple switches. The development of FBDSSCs and FBPSCs has opened new potential fields for solar energy harvesting and supplying this power to wearable devices. The recent trends and development in this field lead toward the development of self-reliant E-textile system, i.e., only fabricated with textile fibers and fabrics. The availability of diverse nature of fiber-based electronics components will eventually help to cater various needs of practical applications of fiber-based electronics and will stimulate further development of fully integrated E-textile systems.</p><p id="Par150">In the recent past, fiber and textile-based electronic devices are deployed in various fields and considered the most attractive branch of modern electronics and have attracted significant attention from of researchers and enterprises. Even though, considerable growth has been made in the flexible electronic devices field, still only a few fiber and textile-based electronic devices are commercially available. The main fiber and textile-based electronic devices available in the market up to date are flexible fiber-shaped sensors. They are mainly deployed for electronic signal monitoring, but more functionalities are needed for fully function wearable device with diverse functionalities. There are still many challenges for fiber and textile-based electronics and also technology limitations which hinder their commercialization:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par151"><italic>Poor performance:</italic> one of the major limitations of the fiber and textile-based electronic devices is the poor performance compared to its counterparts, i.e., rigid electronic devices and thin film devices. One of the main reasons for poor performance of the FBEDs is their thin shape which give lower conductivity as compared to plan electrodes. Numerous attempts have been made to synthesize and fabricate a high conductive material and optimize the configuration and structure of the devices without compromising their mechanical and electrical properties. This comes through a need for novel electronic materials for FBEDs, with enhanced performance for the electronic device’s applications. Further, the cyclic life of the FBEDs also needs to be improved to combine high performance and reduced cost owing to rapid change of the devices. The main problem of fabrication and characterization of these devices is the degradation of the electronic device due to active material loss or breakage of substrates during repeated measurement such as bending and stretchability characteristics. Stretchability is one of the benchmark characteristic for FBEDs; therefore, they can sustain mechanical stresses during stretchability and deformation. Unfortunately, stretchability is obtained at the cost of loss of conductivity due to incorporation of unused elastomeric polymer materials that enhance volume and make them bulky. Another problem with FSEDs is their sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen and moisture which cause deterioration of devices and hence their performance. Washing resistance is another challenging topic, and existing encapsulation packages and materials are unable to meet these challenges and requirements of the FSEDs with extremely curved exterior. It is particularly important for commercialization of the FBEDs that researcher focus on development of new encapsulation and packaging materials and fabrication techniques of FBEDs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par152"><italic>Large-scale production techniques:</italic> for economy of scale and large-scale production of the FSEDs, bulk production techniques are crucial and currently difficult to meet the requirements and targets. Continuous fabrication of the flexible electronic devices is quite challenging to obtain a stable interfacial bonding among active material and textile fibers. These devices are still designed and fabricated at laboratory scale manually, and there is no automatic procedure and technique for their production. Large-scale production compromises the performance of the FSEDs due to comparatively low electrical conductivity of flexible electrodes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par153"><italic>High cost of production:</italic> most significant concern for sustainability of any manufacturing industry to endure is the enhancement of product performance along with the reduced cost of production. High cost of production is also a major limitation for commercialization and mass production of E-textile owing to high cost of material and production technology. The future research focus will be finding stable and effective active material for electrode fabrication, electrolyte material along reduced cost.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par154"><italic>Energy storage of textiles:</italic> although various research groups are working at laboratory scale, there remain many challenges for industrial scale production of E-textiles. But the energy storage capacity of the textile-based supercapacitors is still on lower side as compared to rigid traditional batteries. The most important challenge is the improvement of energy storage capability of the textile-based energy storage devices.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par155"><italic>Integration of electronic devices into textile:</italic> the most important application of the FBEDs is smart clothing and electronic textile. At this front, it is essential to develop new fabrication techniques for the integration of different FBEDs into textiles with a safer and more relaxed human/textile interface model. Additionally, consistent linking methods and integrated tracks are needed to accomplish the high integration of E-textile. Currently, very few publications and studies are present in the literature about integration and human/textile interface is not considered in detail. Moreover, more functional fiber-based devices integration is significant to realize the broader spectrum of application of these textile electronics. For example, an integrated device in which solar cell, SCs and sensor are integrated into a single device, which can realize the monitoring of environmental alterations without using of peripheral energy supply. Even though, the integration of several functionalities into textile is well established, the disparity in material, assembly necessities among the various varieties of devices remain a crucial hurdle for functional applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par156"><italic>Multifunctionality:</italic> E-textiles are a promising and fascinated technology that could soon become the essential part of everyday live owing to new concept of internet of things (IoT).

There is no standard definition of reliability in E-textile but usually it involves bending endurance, sweat, washing resistance, stretching, humidity and temperature cycling. Different fields of application have different protocols and standards for reliability check, e.g., fashion garment can be hand washed whereas medical apparels need to resist machine washing at 90 °C.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par158"><italic>Safety issues:</italic> along with the above-mentioned limitations and challenges, safety of the devices and its applications is also a major concern for fully developed wearable electronics and practical applications. Some FSEDs such as flexible batteries frequently need to use combustible and toxic organic electrolytes and they are vulnerable to risk of flames and bursts caused by short circuit during the bending. Durable and environmentally benign liquids and gel-polymer electrolytes are desired as an alternative to liquid organic electrolytes in FBEDs which must be tuned to enhance the electrochemical performance. Another safety concern issue is security of the personal data. Wearable sensors are expected to have a large database of personal data, where declassification of sensitive data may have detrimental impacts. Therefore, for the applications of these wearables, data security has to be the most crucial element. There are still some other problems that must be addressed such as comfortability.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par159"><italic>Washability:</italic> E-textiles, like other everyday textile clothing, must have a washing resistance property to sustain general usability. Washability is considered one of the main challenge and obstacles to realize the commercial production of E-textile and wide-scale availability in the market. E-textiles suffer from poor washing resistance, which limit the reliability of the product and its commercialization. The hydrophilic nature of the textile substrate and capillary effect even hydrophobic substrates, still absorb water and making textile-based devices malicious. Moreover, application of mechanical stresses during washing operation may damage electrical connection of integrated textile devices and impedance of the device become uncontrollable. There washing of E-textiles remains a challenge, and there is a need of new technology that can provide better washing stability for conductive textiles.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par160"><italic>Standard evaluation systems:</italic> One of the main issues with FBEDs is the lack of standardized performance evaluation practices that makes it challenging to compare the performance of the different electronic devices. Moreover, the reported performance formats are communicated in distinct forms according to various units. For instance, FSCs performance is reported in different units such as gravimetric, volumetric/areal/linear specific capacitance/specific energy/specific power and active mass/area/volume which are computed from single electrodes (three electrodes setup) or from whole devices (two electrode system). This creates confusion to compare performance in different units. Additionally, flexibility attributes such as bending, stretchability, twisting and other tolerances are distinct indicators of FBEDs, but there are no unified evaluation systems for FBEDs at present. There must be standard performance evaluation system and testing procedures in place for FBEDs to compare the performances of the FBEDs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par161"><italic>Application of fiber and textile electronics:</italic> use of fiber and electronics need the combined attempts of different disciplines such as chemists, textile engineers, material scientists, electrical engineers, and physicists.

The accomplishment of E-textiles may have adverse effects for sustainability, as it makes renovation or recycling of an E-textiles more challenging. Some experts pointed out the risks related to large-scale production and mass markets which will introduce new waste stream of products whose recycling will be a challenge either E-textiles or electronic equipment.
