advancements (e.g., vehicle electrification, automation), new business models (e.g., ride-hailing), and government regulations and policies (e.g., fuel economy (FE) standards, zero-emission vehicle mandates, infrastructure investments, and incentives to encourage adoption of alternative fuel vehicles). Despite significant uncertainty, these developments, combined with demographic growth, will influence the future LDV fleet size and composition, and consequently the oil demand from LDVs. This paper provides a review of changes in the LDV sector and an assessment of their impact on oil demand. It takes into account the impact of LDV fleet growth, increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and alternative fuels (focus on biofuels), and improvements in internal combustion engine vehicles’ (ICEV) FE. Our analysis indicates that oil demand in 2040 could remain unchanged relative to 2016, but depending on the development of certain trends, demand could shrink or increase by ~6 million barrels per day (±25% relative to 2016). Our findings suggest that ICEV FE improvements could have a much greater impact on oil demand than the emergence of EVs. Moreover, preliminary research indicates that automation and shared mobility could reinforce the economic attractiveness of EVs, thereby increasing their penetration and impact on oil demand. Because of uncertainties in the development of these two trends by 2040 and difficulties in quantifying the complex interactions, we have not captured these effects in our model. Therefore, the range of uncertainty on the oil demand evolution could be even higher than our model indicates.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Oil demand</kwd><kwd>Light-duty vehicle sector</kwd><kwd>Vehicle fuel economy improvement</kwd><kwd>Vehicle electrification</kwd><kwd>Vehicle automation</kwd><kwd>Shared mobility</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41825_2019_Article_17.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>25</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>25</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Combined</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>R &amp; D/Technology Policy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The transportation sector forms the backbone of the overall global oil demand. In 2016, oil demand from the transportation sector was ~52 million barrels per day of oil equivalent (MBDOE), of which ~76% (40 MBDOE) was from road transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Within the road transportation sector, light-duty vehicles (LDVs) were the largest consumers of oil, accounting for between 24 and 24.4 MBDOE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The global LDV fleet size was estimated to be around ~1 billion vehicles in 2016, and it is expected to grow by almost 85–100% by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In this paper, LDVs are categorized into two segments. The first includes traditional fuel internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) that use diesel or gasoline as fuel. ICEVs include hybrids which use an internal combustion engine and include a battery that can be recharged while driving (typically while the vehicle decelerates or is in braking mode). The battery is most often used to power the vehicle during low-speed driving conditions. Traditional fuel ICEVs accounted for ~95% of the LDV fleet in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The remaining ICEV fleet included natural gas vehicles (NGVs), and ICEVs that can run on biofuels (flex-fuels). These segments accounted for ~5% of the total global fleet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The second LDV segment comprises electric vehicles (EVs), which consist of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). PHEVs differ from regular hybrid vehicles by the fact that their batteries can be recharged via pre-installed electric plugs, allowing the batteries to recharge from a regular electrical supply source. EVs accounted for &lt; 1% (3 million cars) of the global fleet in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The paper discusses the key trends and growth in the LDV sector that will influence the size and composition of the LDV fleet and consequently impact the demand for oil from the LDV sector. The paper identifies and discusses five key evolutions, their state of the art and future challenges, and uses them to model 2040 LDV oil demand scenarios.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The changing LDV sector: key trends and evolutions</title><p id="Par6">The entire LDV sector is evolving, driven by the rapidly changing technologies, demographics, and global and domestic policies. The key trends paving the way for future evolutions in the LDV sector are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par7"><italic>Demographic trends</italic>, including the fast-growing middle-class in emerging markets (which will lead to an increase in the number of people able to own a vehicle), increased urbanization, and city expansion. The increasing densification of the population in megacities will result in significant traffic congestion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9"><italic>Technological improvements</italic>, including improvements in EV battery capacity, cost and performance, and the rise of various technologies impacting vehicles (e.g., the development of lightweight materials for vehicles) and the transportation ecosystem (e.g., ubiquitous internet connectivity, artificial intelligence).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10"><italic>Government policies and regulations</italic> driven primarily by local air pollution and/or climate change concerns. These include increasingly strict environmental regulations related to the LDV sector, such as stringent fuel economy and greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions regulations, plans to ban diesel vehicles in major cities, and the possibility of banning the use of ICEVs altogether in some cities. Other initiatives include direct financial incentives to increase the attractiveness of “clean” vehicles, investments in EV charging stations, and geopolitical and industrial policies to encourage EVs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11"><italic>Evolutions in the electricity generation sector</italic>, including rapid developments in renewables such as solar and wind. The latter have become progressively cheaper to install and operate and could contribute to a reduction in average electricity prices and electricity generation-related carbon emissions.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12"><italic>Consumer behavior</italic>, including indications in some regions of a decreasing attachment to cars as an owned asset, often in response to the cost of vehicle ownership or other available alternatives for mobility (e.g., public transportation and ride-hailing).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par13">These trends contribute to five key evolutions in the LDV market landscape:</p><p id="Par14"><italic>ICEV fuel economy improvements</italic>: Governments use standards and regulations to drive ICEV fuel economy improvements in order to reduce emissions and fuel consumption in the transportation sector. In response to these fuel economy standards and tighter emissions controls, manufacturers and other relevant stakeholders are encouraged to find new ways to improve vehicle efficiencies. In the medium term, experts expect that manufacturers will be able to achieve most fuel economy improvements through enhancements to engine technology and hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par15"><italic>Penetration of alternative fuels</italic>: The use of alternative fuels such as biofuels (including mainly bioethanol and biodiesel) in transportation is growing, but they represent a small share of global fuel consumption. Advanced biofuels (made from cellulosic material, algae, and other substances) have disruptive potential, but remain many years away from adoption due to containment, technological, and cost considerations. Current expectations are that the main application for biofuels will be as a blend with fossil fuels for LDV engines. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) currently represent a very small market, with only a few thousand vehicles on the roads concentrated in very few markets such as in the United States (California) and Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. National FCEV targets in key markets (e.g., in the USA, Japan, and China) do not exceed a combined handful million vehicles by 2030, indicating that the outlook of FCEVs remains relatively weak over the next decade or two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par16"><italic>Vehicle electrification</italic>: EVs consist of BEVs and PHEVs. BEVs are propelled solely by an electric motor using chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs. PHEVs integrate a combustion engine, a battery, and an electric motor. Typically, their batteries can be recharged while driving or through an electrical supply. Two types of factors drive the speed of EV adoption: those that contribute to increasing the attractiveness of EVs and others that contribute to decreasing the attractiveness of ICEVs. Even though the current trend is supportive of EV uptake, many uncertainties remain concerning the achievability of most forecasted improvements (e.g., battery cost improvements, changing mineral prices, or the sustainability of current enablers such as government subsidies).</p><p id="Par17"><italic>Vehicle automation</italic>: The wide range of autonomous driving capabilities can be broadly divided into driver assistance and high/full vehicle autonomy. Driver assistance refers to the automation of a small number of activities that a driver typically performs (e.g., automatic emergency brake and autonomous cruise control). High/full vehicle autonomy refers to the automation of a higher number of driving activities, or in some cases all driving activities. In the case of full automation, the vehicle can drive itself with little or no human interaction.</p><p id="Par18"><italic>Growth of shared mobility</italic>: Shared mobility alternatives have become popular in recent years. As urbanization increases and the number of LDVs grows in many developing countries, shared mobility becomes more effective. These changes are attributable to the impact of technology, ease of access, economics, and policy measures on human behavior. As households do not typically use cars for long periods of the day, shared mobility can be an effective alternative.</p><p id="Par19">These developments could disrupt the future energy landscape in the LDV segment, depending on their speed and scope. This paper addresses each of these five evolutions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The five significant evolutions</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Improvement in ICEV fuel economy</title><p id="Par20">The three largest car markets—the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and China—have been using national fuel economy standards and GHG emission standards for LDVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to drive ongoing enhancements in fleet fuel economy and reduce the carbon emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fuel efficiency targets and forecast improvements</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41825_2019_17_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">In the US, the 2016 unadjusted fleet fuel economy and GHG target for new passenger cars was 36.2 mpg (6.5 L per 100 km [L/100 km]) and 225 grams of carbon dioxide per mile (gCO<sub>2</sub>/mi) respectively. Pending consideration by the current administration, this was expected to increase by ~50% by 2025, to 55.2 mpg (4.3 L/100 km) and 147 gCO<sub>2</sub>/mi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In light of these standards, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have decreased by 22%, and fleet fuel economy has increased by 5.4 mpg, or 28%, with an average annual improvement of about 0.5 mpg per year since model year (MY) 2004 vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In China, fuel economy standards are based on a weight classification system in which vehicles must conform to the standard for their class. The 2015 fuel consumption target was 6.9 L/100 km. This target has been tightened to ~5 L/100 km by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The EU has changed from a voluntary standard to a mandatory one, currently according to a weight-based-limit value curve. The 2015 CO<sub>2</sub> emission target for new cars was 130 gCO<sub>2</sub>/km (corresponding to fuel consumption of around 5.6 L/100 km of petrol or 4.9  L/100 km of diesel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The emission target for 2030 has been set at 59 gCO<sub>2</sub>/km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">There are significant ongoing efforts to improve the fuel economy of ICEVs. Leading automakers, sometimes supported by oil companies, are investing in new technologies such as gasoline compression ignition (GCI) that could result in a 24.6% reduction in energy consumption and a 22.8% reduction in GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, claims that a GCI engine could be operational as soon as 2019. Auto-manufacturer Mazda has also announced that it will be releasing the first commercial GCI engine by 2019. This engine promises up to 20–30% higher engine efficiency compared to the current equivalent model and up to 45% more than Mazda’s 2008 petrol engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These technological breakthroughs are expected to accelerate the speed at which manufacturers will be able to achieve fuel economy standards and meet their emissions targets. Additional vehicle fuel economy improvements are also expected through improvements in vehicle aerodynamics, tire rolling resistance, more efficient lighting and air-conditioning systems, and reductions in vehicle body weight using composite materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Lukoil expects that cumulative fuel savings above 50% may be achievable in new ICEVs (equivalent to more than doubling the new ICEV fuel economy) through the combination of turbocharged engines, start-stop technology, weight reduction, hybridization, and other techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, Lukoil presents fuel economy forecasts that imply that the new ICEV fleet fuel economy will improve at ~2.2% annually from 2015 until 2030. Assuming the trend continues until 2040 and that over extended periods of time the ICEV stock fuel economy improves at the same rate as the new ICEV fleet fuel economy, the estimated ICEV stock fuel economy improvement over the 2016–2040 period comes out to be around ~65–70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The dramatic expected improvement in fuel economy of ICEVs could also increase their economic attractiveness compared to alternative powertrains. This could decrease the cost of ownership of an ICEV on a per-mile basis and delay the cost crossover point with alternative fuels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Penetration of alternative fuels</title><p id="Par26">In 2016, biofuels constituted ~3% of global transport fuel consumption, and they are projected to reach ~7% by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ethanol accounts for roughly 94% of the alternative fuel market, with biodiesel constituting the remainder. The US and Brazil combined account for 80% of global production and consumption.

This reduction of subsidies is a risk for EV uptake as EV sales remain highly dependent on them. Recent experiences in Denmark and the US show that cutting off direct EV subsidies before price parity with ICEVs has been reached could hinder the uptake of EVs. In Denmark for example, EVs were exempted from the 180% import tax (reduced to 150% in 2016) imposed on ICEVs, making the country a pocket of high EV penetration in the past few years. However, EV sales experienced a 60% quarterly fall after the government announced the phase-out of the EV tax break.

The government has given 100 million euros to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research to develop information and communication technologies under the ICT 2020 funding program. This program includes research on EV energy management. In Sweden, over one-third of EV policy instruments focus on stimulating R&amp;D. The Swedish Energy Agency has invested 260 million Swedish krona (SEK) to finance research into environmentally friendly vehicles.

However, financial subsidies and policy support could quickly become unsustainable given the forecast for growth in EV sales. This growth will require new, more sustainable mechanisms and incentive schemes, such as funding from government revenues that come from the EV value chain, rather than from government policies that use direct incentives to increase sales. National resources and public support are already overstretched, and there is societal pressure to downsize financial stimuli. As the number of EVs grows, governments may wish to look for other tools to stimulate the EV market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition to the difficulty of sustaining financial stimulus for ever greater numbers of EVs, other types of preferential treatment, such as free access to carpool lanes and free parking, could also prove difficult to sustain. Indeed, these incentives will inevitably become less valuable to vehicle owners as EVs become more mainstream.</p><p id="Par67">The EV credit is considered by some government agencies to be an inefficient method of reducing carbon emissions. For example, the US Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the EV credit system costs the federal government anywhere between $230 and $4400 for every net tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> that the subsidy reduces, depending on the state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The cost per tonne is higher in states that rely heavily on coal-based electricity generation, such as North Dakota. This cost largely exceeds the government’s forecast of the social cost per tonne of carbon emissions in 2020, which ranges from $12 to $123. The government estimates that in 2050, the social cost of a tonne of carbon emissions in the worst-case scenario would be $212 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Even this figure is lower than the lower end of the current cost of EV incentives per tonne of reduced carbon emissions ($230 per tonne of reduced emissions). Recent research has found that EV adoption incentives in the US cost around $5.47 per gallon of gasoline saved, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 16 years.

Driver assistance refers to the automation of a small number of activities that a driver typically performs, such as automatic emergency brake and autonomous cruise control. High/full vehicle autonomy refers to the automation of a higher number of driving activities. In the case of full automation, the vehicle can drive by itself with little or no human interaction. Industry experts often refer to five levels of autonomous driving levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Level 1 refers to simple “driver assistance” techniques (e.g., cruise control) and Level 5 refers to “full autonomy” (i.e., a vehicle that does not require a human driver, a steering wheel, or pedals). In this section, we will refer to AVs as vehicles with a very high level of automation (Level 4 or Level 5).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Levels of autonomy, adoption paths, and challenges of AVs</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41825_2019_17_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par74">Key technology and regulatory milestones have shaped the autonomous driving landscape. One of the earliest and most prominent examples of the popularization of autonomous driving features is the introduction of electronic cruise control in the US during the 1960s and 1970s, enabled by technological innovation.</p><p id="Par75">More recently, technological developments in the automotive industry have accelerated, and strategic partnerships have formed between automotive and technology companies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Tesla's and Google’s early breakthroughs in vehicle autonomy have attracted significant interest from a variety of players [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].

Safety concerns refer mostly to system reliability and the ability to respond to adverse real-life traffic circumstances. Achieving acceptable safety standards will require further technological development, and testing under real-life conditions. Auto insurance companies will need to adjust their business models in light of these developments, as some or all of the liability will transfer progressively from the driver to the car itself.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par81"><italic>Consumer acceptance</italic>: Public opinion about AVs currently indicates significant concerns over security and the reliability of software-based systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Even if those risks were addressed from a technical perspective, it could take a while before consumers trust in the safety of AVs.

AVs could increase the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by a single vehicle due to the increased convenience of travel they provide, leading to longer trips and higher car utilization. More VMT would lead to an increase in oil demand. However, AVs could also lead to higher vehicle electrification as well as increase the ICEV fuel economy while driving due to optimizations such as smarter breaking, cruise control, and automatic route optimization.

Therefore, the net impact of AV technology on oil demand is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Shared mobility</title><p id="Par87">Shared mobility can be categorized into three main groups: ride-hailing services, car-sharing providers, and car-pooling platforms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Ride-hailing services such as Uber typically offer a ride on-demand at the time and location requested by the customer, most frequently through a mobile phone application. Car-sharing services such as Zipcar provide a car without a driver, typically for a shorter period than general car rental services. The rental duration can range from a few minutes to a few hours. Carpooling services involve connecting individuals who take similar routes so that they can share a ride. Generally, shared mobility services compete with traditional taxis, public transportation, and personal car ownership.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Main categories of shared mobility services</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41825_2019_17_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par88">Shared mobility services have developed rapidly over the past few years with many players entering the market.

The number of cars used by car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and Autolib has grown sharply over the past decade. Some experts expect the number of cars used by car-sharing companies to continue to grow by ~30% annually until 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Major automotive manufacturers have formed partnerships with mobility companies in order to enter the car-sharing service market. For example, Daimler and Europcar (car rental company) have jointly established Car2go, a car-sharing service in which users are charged a per-minute rate, with discounted fixed rates for hourly and daily usage. BMW and Sixt (car rental company) have formed DriveNow, a car-sharing service that allows riders to book a BMW car using their mobile app and pay a per-minute rate. Both these newly formed companies have experienced significant growth in the number of registered members since 2011–2012, with a combined ~1.7 million members in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">Shared mobility offers an economical solution to customers who use their cars infrequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Personal car ownership is costly for infrequent drivers, as cars are typically the second most expensive asset a person purchases. Ride-hailing can enable a higher utilization of vehicles and often better time management for drivers, both of which contribute to reducing the cost of transportation.</p><p id="Par91">Shared mobility is also more convenient than traditional taxis and sometimes more convenient than driving a personal car in congested cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Most services are provided through a mobile phone application, which enables “anywhere, anytime” access to the service. Ride-hailing services also offer instant price quotes, transparency regarding drivers’ identities and service ratings, and automatic invoicing, all of which are convenient and help build trust in the services. Finally, the use of on-demand shared mobility services eases some of the parking spot hassles and costs, particularly in large, congested cities.</p><p id="Par92">It is unclear whether shared mobility services alone would increase or decrease the demand for oil from the LDV sector. Shared mobility could make vehicle travel accessible to more people, such as to groups that cannot afford to purchase a vehicle. It may even encourage people who use public transportation to switch to car transportation. Making vehicle travel accessible to more people would put upward pressure on oil demand from LDVs. On the other hand, shared mobility may lead to more passengers sharing a single vehicle during a trip instead of using multiple vehicles.</p><p id="Par93">It should be noted that increased use of shared mobility services is not a foregone conclusion. Some users of UberPool or Lyft Line have expressed some level of discomfort or privacy concerns when sharing a ride with strangers, and it is unclear as to how consumer attitudes towards ride sharing will evolve. More passengers sharing vehicles would lead to a decrease in oil demand from LDVs. If shared vehicles were mostly EVs, as some analysts are anticipating, then the increase in shared mobility would inevitably put downward pressure on oil demand.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Synergy among the evolutions</title><p id="Par94">Major market experts and players see a natural link between shared mobility, autonomous vehicles, and electric vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].

Mobility service cars are expected to drive up to ~100–110,000 km per year, compared to 22,000 km per year for a typical privately owned vehicle. Because of more intense use, it is assumed that commercial vehicles will be written off after 300,000 km rather than after 10 years. As such, significant numbers of EVs are expected to be used in shared mobility services. Furthermore, consumer concerns over EV range and charging station availability could be mitigated by the fact that most taxi rides fall within current EV ranges, and cars could be dispatched according to customer destination, battery life, and recharging needs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par97"><italic>The link between EVs and AVs</italic>: EVs facilitate the rapid development and testing of driverless technology because they are modular and computerized.

Governments will need to create new regulations consistent with the changes, while businesses will need to adjust their plans and business models to mitigate the risks arising from changes to the LDV sector and also to realize new opportunities.</p><p id="Par127">To react effectively, stakeholders will first need to understand the dynamics and likely magnitude of the changes in the LDV sector. Narrowing the wide range of forecasts to a realm of likely options will provide stakeholders with greater clarity.</p><p id="Par128">This study identified several areas of major uncertainty. Further research is needed to explore these areas. This would enable a better understanding of the dynamics and likely magnitude of the changes to the LDV sector and their potential impact on oil demand.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par129"><italic>Consumer acceptance and adoption</italic>. The future LDV landscape will depend upon how fast and to what extent consumers adopt new LDV technologies and paradigms, particularly EVs, autonomous driving technologies, and vehicle/ride sharing. Even though OEMs are investing heavily in EVs and AVs, often supported by government initiatives, and technology and automotive companies are investing in shared mobility, this does not necessarily mean that most or a large percentage of consumers will transition towards these new mobility mechanisms and technologies.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par130"><italic>Future oil prices</italic>. Multiple uncertainties surround forecasts for oil prices in 2040, including the development of fiscal policies in various jurisdictions which influence the price of gasoline and diesel at the pump. Fluctuations in and speculation about the price of oil will continue to influence the development of alternative fuels for LDVs such as biofuels, gas, and electricity. The development of biofuels and advanced biofuel technologies remains heavily correlated with oil prices: low oil prices diminish the incentive to shift towards biofuels. Similarly, the future role of gas in the LDV sector will remain dependent on the gas-to-oil price differential. Natural gas-fueled LDVs will be unattractive without a price advantage for using gas over gasoline or diesel, especially given the limited infrastructure availability for such vehicles and their shorter driving ranges. Finally, oil prices will play a major role in the uptake of EVs. A sustained low price environment for oil may significantly delay the time at which EVs achieve an unsubsidized total cost of ownership (TCO) parity with ICEVs. In a scenario of sustained low oil prices, governments may utilize fiscal policies or carbon-content-based taxes to offset the impact of lower oil prices. A low level of tax provides a weak signal to consumers of future fuel-use costs, especially given the undervaluation of lifetime operating costs known as the energy efficiency gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. On the other hand, high fuel taxation may not be politically palatable in various parts of the world, as the recent fuel tax riots in France illustrate.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par131"><italic>Technological advancement and speed of the mobility revolution</italic>. The LDV sector’s mobility evolution will be determined by the intersection of multiple technologies including EVs and AVs, and new paradigms such as shared mobility. While the uptake of EVs is expected to put downward pressure on oil demand, the net impact of AVs and shared mobility on oil demand is less clear. As discussed, they could increase or accelerate the uptake of EVs, putting further downward pressure on oil demand. On the other hand, AVs and shared mobility could boost the demand for car travel by enabling wider access to cars through lower costs, putting upward pressure on oil demand. The speed and extent of these evolutions remain subject to significant uncertainties.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par132">The speed and extent of technological advancement will be a key driving factor for the increased penetration of EVs and other alternative fuels such as biofuels. Current trends in battery cost reductions, driving ranges, and charging speeds favor increased uptake of EVs. However, there are potential roadblocks that could reduce the pace of these trends. Supply-side scaling challenges for batteries such as cobalt may put upward pressure on battery prices, thereby making EVs less economically attractive. The development of cheap, sustainable second- and third-generation biofuel supply, such as algae-based biofuels, through technological advancements and governmental support will determine the extent of growth in biofuel adoption. The market viability of other advances in technology that result in energy efficiency gains and reduced GHG emissions is still uncertain. For example, fuel cell vehicles that offer long driving ranges with very low emissions still face important technological and infrastructure development roadblocks.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par133"><italic>Government policy targets and their achievability</italic>. Many evolutions in the LDV sector, especially the rise of the EVs, have been driven by government interventions to address local air pollution and/or climate change concerns. These interventions have taken the form of policy commitments such as supply-side vehicle and fuel standards/mandates, the provision of preferential treatment for EVs, and financial investments such as infrastructure investments for EVs and biofuels, and purchase incentives for EVs. These investments are costly, and there are varying views on their sustainability, with direct EV purchase incentives in some countries recently scaled back. As such, the political will to sustain these policies and financial investments is not guaranteed. However, changes in energy demand and price dynamics, macroeconomic and fiscal circumstances, industrial and environmental policies including supply-side standards/mandates and driving restriction policies, and/or cost trends in technologies could lead countries to achieve their stated ambitions, including nationally determined contributions to the Paris COP-21 agreement, faster than expected.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par134"><italic>Interaction with the existing energy system</italic>. Increases in EV uptake may cause some pressure on the existing electricity infrastructures which will require additional investments to meet the increased demand. However, those investments have been shown to be in line with historical electricity infrastructure investments and may not severely impact EV uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, the extent to which existing infrastructure can efficiently serve extra demand for electricity, especially capacity at peak charging times, may depend on the appropriate “economic integration” of EVs into electricity networks (e.g., the design of EV charging markets, regulations, and incentive structures). For example, using a smart charging system that promotes charging during times of excess electricity generation may alleviate network constraints and minimize the need for investments. An additional consideration is whether the use of the existing infrastructure will help to reduce carbon emissions. A carbon-emitting electricity generation infrastructure (e.g., heavily dependent on coal) could ultimately make EVs highly polluting. Technologies currently under development, such as smart grids, will help address some of these challenges. Significant uncertainty remains regarding the overall level of investment needed in various geographies, and whether and when those investments will be undertaken.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par135">This paper has endeavored to create a comprehensive view of how the trends and evolutions in the LDV sector will change the fleet size and composition of LDVs and the consequent demand for oil. The results presented in this paper suggest that, for the next two decades at least, oil will likely remain the primary fuel for LDVs. The fuel economy of ICEVs is increasing, and uncertainties remain regarding the scale of electric, autonomous, and shared vehicle adoption. As such, an appropriate action plan for the next two decades for key stakeholders, including governments, entrepreneurs, OEMs, and oil producers among others, would be to develop a basket of solutions that take into account a range of projected technological, social, and economic conditions, rather than rely on specific outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Chay Allen, KAPSARC, for his editorial advice.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">International Energy Agency: World Energy Outlook. <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.iea.org/weo2017/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.iea.org/weo2017/</ext-link> (2017).
