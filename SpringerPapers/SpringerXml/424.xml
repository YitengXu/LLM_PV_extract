While developed countries have accomplished this objective through unique ways, developing and underdeveloped countries are still lagging. Deficiencies in technological readiness and supportive infrastructure are major concerns for them. To support their future endeavours in the field of electric vehicles, a review article that encompasses the present status, barriers for EVs adoption and operation in developing countries proves highly critical. A critical analysis of EV adoption barrier information is used to develop appropriate technology to tackle these barriers and provide necessary plans for policymakers to effectively implement electric vehicles. Furthermore, this article comprehensively analyses barriers to EV implementation and adopts the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model to rank the evaluation criteria based on expert opinions. From the results for developing countries such as India, the model placed battery-operated electric vehicles at 5th position on the hierarchy ranking. This is because the existing infrastructure and technology will not currently support the imminent shift to electric mobility. The identification of a possible alternative propulsion system that bridges the gap between necessity and feasibility is essential. For this purpose, the article also explores the prospects and critically analyses hybrid electric vehicles as an intermediary propulsion system that smoothens the transition to EV. The outcomes of the literature review, expert opinions and author findings suggest that hybrid technology uses powertrain components that are chiefly similar to those found in conventional vehicles, yielding vehicle manufacturers with a smoother changeover to Electric Vehicle technology, which may otherwise lead to an immense failure in technology transition.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Future mobility</kwd><kwd>EV barriers review</kwd><kwd>Electric vehicles</kwd><kwd>Hybrid electric vehicles</kwd><kwd>MCDM</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Academy of Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">RAE TSP -

As the nation looks to improve its standard of mobility, an exponential increase in this trend is anticipated in the coming years. With a sharp increment in the total number of vehicles on road, a substantial escalation of greenhouse gases, depletion of fossil fuels and damage to the health of the environment and its inhabitants will develop. Owing to these drawbacks, future mobility will move towards eco-friendly and carbon–neutral alternatives. In recent years, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained extensive attention as sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) based vehicles. Forecasts show a tremendous increase in the national fleet of EVs in the future and this can be attributed to characteristics of reduced emissions and noise whilst realising the potential for improved vehicle crash structures. Furthermore, EVs exhibit considerable promise in revolutionising the two-wheeler and public transport sectors where India’s automotive industry is predominantly dependent. However, the shift from conventional to fully electric propulsion will require immense developments in vehicle powertrain architecture, charging infrastructure, power grid management, consumer mindset and government support. At this time, charging infrastructure is inadequate, insufficiently distributed and requires time to progress convincingly. Range anxiety is an important criterion that induces the public to lose interest in EVs. A factor often disregarded to the considerable penetration of EVs into the market is the reaction on global and national power grids that are linked to charging infrastructure. Unless the required attributes for EVs are balanced in the right proportion, the transition becomes significantly difficult. Even a small disturbance or irregular transition from ICE-powered vehicles to EVs will produce a negative impact on the economic growth and overall performance of the automotive sector.</p><p id="Par37">To establish the target areas of research for this paper, an analysis of the lapses/gaps found in the existing literature is performed and summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The electrification of vehicles becomes a prominent subject in the field of automotive technology, various assessment studies on the large-scale electrification of vehicles and its barriers are adequately explored by the researchers. The impact evaluation of an extended transition for the transportation sector within a country/region mandates an analytical study that focuses on the influence of the entire vehicle population. Various research studies are investigating the overall environmental impacts of EVs throughout their lifetime of operation. These studies have often presented and compared comprehensive quantitative information for the emissions/fuel efficiency standards of conventional vehicles (CV), EVs and HEVs. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is the analysis tool prevalently used for such studies; however, this methodology neglects the qualitative effect of EV usage on factors such as the quality of power required and stress of heightened energy demand on power grids. A majority of research work highlights the importance of implementation of EVs and HEVs over CVs although most of them refrain from going into detail on comparing the two based on factors ranging from performance to infrastructure. Additionally, some papers consider the barriers to EV adoption although these barriers are often limited to performance/technological factors and abstain from considering infrastructural or governmental parameters. Furthermore, research work falling under the above categories neither consider the potential of other propulsion systems nor compare the overall characteristics of EVs to fossil liquid fuel vehicle, gaseous fuel vehicle, hybrid vehicle, plug-in hybrid vehicle, fuel-cell vehicle and alternative fuel vehicles. An untouched comparative research perspective of this kind is essential to explore factors assisting automotive manufacturers in developing sustainable vehicle propulsion technology along with ease of transition. Studies on transportation systems that are based on expert opinions make use of numerous methods of data accumulation and analysis as seen in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Numerous studies implement the analysis of variance (ANOVA) methodology in tandem with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In such a system, decision-making comparisons via AHP is used to set initial weights per criterion following which an ANOVA study is conducted for correlation between various groups. The Q-method (Q-sort) is another common methodology used in similar studies. In such studies, factor ranking is conducted via Q-sorts after which Q-method is implemented to observe the diversity within opinions of various experts. Often, such studies compare varying opinions of both the general public as well as industry experts. A majority of studies however limit their survey criteria to vehicle safety, handling and security due to which predominantly concentrated around intelligent cyber-physical vehicles. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is made use of to solve the complex decisions that are produced when numerous criteria are considered. This method allows for opinion-based decision-making, consideration of alternatives as well as the effects produced by each alternative. The preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE<bold>)</bold>, an MCDM tool has been adopted in this study due to its appropriate ranking capability for criteria based on additional deviation information from the evaluation of alternatives within the same criterion.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Literature survey of analogous research papers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>References</p></th><th align="left"><p>Objectives of work</p></th><th align="left"><p>Categorization (EV/HEV/CPS)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Geographic context</p></th><th align="left"><p>Inferences</p></th><th align="left"><p>Identified gaps</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Life cycle assessment (LCA) of mass usage of EVs</p></td><td align="left"><p>EV</p></td><td align="left"><p>China</p></td><td align="left"><p>CO<sub>2</sub> impact due to life cycle emissions of EVs is defined using a time-dependent model</p></td><td align="left"><p>Considered the factors that are only related to emission reductions and fuel savings</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Life cycle analysis for transition to EVs</p></td><td align="left"><p>EV/HEV</p></td><td align="left"><p>Australia</p></td><td align="left"><p>Highest overall carbon footprint for EVs then ICVs and finally HEVs.

EVs present themselves as the most compelling yet viable solution for future mobility. However, the monumental essential requirements to be fulfilled for EV operation impede the path of quicker transition from conventional internal combustion vehicles. This review article is focused on the motivation of elucidating the status of EVs with a detailed examination of the significant barriers to their adoption and operation in the context of developing countries. The thorough articulation of EV barrier information will be useful to discover the relationship within economical, technological, infrastructural, societal and environmental barriers and it will be supportive holistic material for manufacturers, policymakers in strategic planning and devising suitable measures in controlling the barriers. Included with the review status for an objective of identifying the possible alternative propulsion for the passenger vehicle segment, a quantitative examination method is proposed in the successive sections of the paper. To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no review papers that deal with a plan for an efficient propulsion system transition pathway. Moreover, the existence of enormous barriers for imminent EV transition necessitates a decisive solution with the perspective of an intermediate propulsion system that is capable of utilizing the existing industrial and infrastructural facilities. To accomplish this objective, an expert perception ranking method is utilized in discerning and justifying the mindset of respective experts on EVs and other propulsion types. The preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) decision-making tool is employed, the hierarchy order is extracted in form of variable criteria and equivalent criteria weight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electric Vehicle Transportation Status Around the Globe</title><p id="Par39">To interpret the overall impact of EV penetration on a global scale, the current state of EVs must be visualised and analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present status of EV sales, stocks, as well as forecasted figures, are used as focal points for this analysis. To condense the analysis, global EV leaders such as Europe, China and USA are considered along with developing nations such as India and Brazil.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Global Scenario on EV Sales</title><p id="Par40">In 2020, Europe overshadowed China for the first time since 2015 and ascended to the top of the global EV sales ranking.

This can be attributed to the various stringent emission norms, incentive schemes and policies placed by the respective governments. The regulation targets officiated by the European Union (EU) for 2021 mandate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of new cars and light commercial vehicles (LCVs) should fall under 95 g/km and 147 g/km respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As existing conventional powertrain architectures are unable to match these regulations, automakers are perpetually looking for a technology shift towards EVs. As a consequence, the plug-in car segment in Europe has grown in size even during the decline of the automotive sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In China, there exist adequate public charging points and hence the demand for EVs is less subservient to government policies as consumers face fewer issues with range anxiety and EV recharge. India has shown significant growth in the EV sector owing to policies such as the Rs. 950 million subsidies for EVs as issued by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Trend analysis of BEVs during the period 2010–2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>EV Status in India</title><p id="Par42">At present, EVs hold 1% of the Indian automotive market out of which, 95% is two-wheelers. The market has seen steep development in two-wheeler technology due to the support of both government and private entities, as demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Future projections show the exponential increase in the BEV segment which peak at 42 million units by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The gradual increase in projected sales of CVs till 2025 is ascribed to vehicle manufacturers’ intention of improving their existent powertrains before the transition to EVs is completed. Additionally, manufacturers are conducting R&amp;D on hybrid powertrain technology to maximise their efficiencies before a complete shift to an electric-based architecture. A target sale of 30–40 million EV units by 2030 is set by the Indian government, one-third of which is expected to be EV cars. The primary scheme proposed by the government is the faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles (FAME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Despite various initiatives taken by the Indian government, certain barriers limit the production and sales of EVs in India such as charging infrastructure, battery technology, consumer behaviour and overall government support which are elaborated in detail in the subsequent section.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Past, present and future status of EV in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Practical Challenges in Implementing EVs for Mass Transport</title><p id="Par43">EVs are garnering attention worldwide for their environmental benefits with many countries starting to implement policies to promote them to replace CVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, a complete shift towards EVs could not be possible without the obstacles shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. This is depicted by the current market’s penetration. The acceptance of EVs and their initial diffusion into the market largely depend on consumer perception and attitude towards EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The mindset of consumers plays a crucial role in EV adoption. Similarly, charging infrastructure, driving range, charging time, government support, total cost and awareness among consumers are crucial factors limiting EV adoption rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The present battery technology is a significant barrier that affects the overall cost, driving range and charging time of EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Indeed, the policymakers and authorities have decreased the barrier effects by formulating appropriate policies and incentives, benefitting both consumers and manufacturers. These could have helped EV introduction into the market, although not ensuring their sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, a thorough understanding and analysis of existing barriers are necessary to improve EV diffusion further.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Various barriers for EV implementation</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Technology Difficulties</title><p id="Par44">Limited range, packaging, safety, component standards and energy generation are the most important factors hindering the adoption of EVs as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Battery capacity, vehicle weight and aerodynamic drag dominantly influence EV range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. EV propulsion necessitates a large number of batteries to match the range of CVs due to the smaller size and low voltage capacity of batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A lack of a sufficient number of charging stations also influences the EV range. The weight of an EV is an important parameter that determines its performance and ultimately its success in the market. EV weight is proportional to the expenditure on energy storage thus increasing cost and ultimately reducing customer demand. To improve driving range, the use of lightweight materials, high energy density batteries and battery charging with renewable energy sources (RES) should be employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This latter technology presents additional challenges such as increased installation and repair costs, inconsistent charging due to its diurnal nature and reduced battery life in the case of standalone photovoltaic cell based EVs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although the idea of new batteries seems to have a good prospect, much like fossil fuels, battery production materials are sourced from finite elements such as Li, Ni, Mn. Safety is another important criterion affecting the acceptance and success of EVs. Current EV batteries pose threats in terms of overheating, fire safety, thermal runaway and high energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. EVs also pose the threat of cyber security issues within the communication aspect of battery management systems (BMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the most concerning factors are the disposal of used batteries and the associated environmental impairment. Minimal technological developments in the field of battery recycling are not promising enough to support the claims of a greener future. Lack of standards during EV manufacturing immensely impacts manufacturing cost. The choice of propulsion motor types, viz. induction motor, permanent magnet motor, permanent magnet assisted synchronous motor available to EV manufacturers further affect standardization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Even though placed under the clean vehicle category, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) powered by H<sub>2</sub> exhibit notable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, produced during the process of H<sub>2</sub> extraction from methane. The process of hydrogen extraction from water requires large amounts of electricity and can be produced with the help of RES such as wind, tidal, hydro, solar, although these have not been adopted for large-scale electricity production. Furthermore, the presence of H<sub>2</sub> in FCEV raises safety concerns due to its unstable nature.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Technological barriers to EVs adoption</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Infrastructure Difficulties</title><p id="Par45">Before envisioning the EV concept for a specific automotive market, a robust yet sustainable charging infrastructure must exist within the region. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> explains the main barriers related to EV infrastructure. Range anxiety is the most substantial roadblock to the EV acquisition. It is induced due to the scarcity of adequate on-road battery charging infrastructure in most regions of EVs usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. To overcome this issue, regions with a significant EV population must invest in a cohesive network of numerous interconnected battery charging/swapping stations. Specifications and safety standards to be adopted in charging stations are other parameters to scrutinise while addressing the inadequacy of charging infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Charging units with high voltage power cables in the circulation require substantial power flow control systems that disconnect current flow in case of loose connections. ‘Inductive Charging’ allows the user/EV to be shielded from the physical charging circuitry as they are allocated below the road surface. However, the charging efficiency for this technology is highly dependent on the separation distance of the EV from the charging emitter, limiting it to a maximum charging efficiency of 85%. Additionally, peak charging distances of only 250 mm can be accommodated after which charge efficiency diminishes immensely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. ‘Fast Charge’ circuitry capable of charging an EV under 10 min requires additional installation of safety circuits and components to function effectively either in a charging station or at the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Global EV charging standards administer appropriate regulations for different charging, viz. Level 1 (Opportunity Charging), Level 2 (Primary Charging) and Level 3 (Fast Charging) to ensure safe and efficient charging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Level 1 technology (8–16 h) uses standard 120 V outlets/connectors, without the need for supplementary installations. The size of cabling and thermal constraints imposes limitations on current rating and charging time. Level 2 technology (4–8 h) adopts 240 V with specified connectors/adaptors due to rated voltage and power management requirements. Level 3 technology (10–15 min for 80% SOC) uses 480 V and is limited to on-road charging terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This technology however encounters an expensive technological disparity for household application. It requires 3 phase alternating current (AC)/direct current (DC) connections exceeding 22 kW and a minimum current of 32 Amps and 3225 Amps for AC and DC, respectively. Ratings of this magnitude pose safety hazards for a household and require expensive thicker insulated cabling with shortened charger-vehicle cables. Furthermore, various protocols and complex BMS are mandatory to reduce battery degradation and to safeguard the consumer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Consequential effects of power transmission and storage due to EV charging need to be considered both at the consumer end and the producer end. The impact of electric vehicle grid integration (EVGI) is of utmost relevance when it comes to power grid management for the government. EV charging has been found to intensify grid loading thereby causing voltage instability and producing heightened peak load demands. Its consequence is a depreciation in power reserve margins and power quality issues due to the nonlinear loading properties of EV charging. Furthermore, distribution transformers experience decreased lifetime due to increased hot spot temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Future projections reveal that for an EV population of 42 million, surplus power demand could rise to 92%, accentuating the importance of power management systems. The principal contributing factor for this is the existing uncoordinated charging systems for EVs which cause disorderly peak load demand and more importantly, harmonics within the system. Harmonic distortions (20%—45%) deteriorate the power quality of the grid and impact the durability of components such as transformers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It is found that Level 3 charging technology derives the highest level of harmonic distortion. To maintain power quality, total harmonic distortion (THD) must be less than 5% for a 69 kV network although EV charging often causes THD greater than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. With larger EV penetration, normal rate charging may also be subjected to significant power quality deviations. To overcome the inadequacy of charging infrastructure, committees around the world are introducing concepts such as swappable battery packs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This infrastructure is positioned based on storage capabilities rather than technological charging standards. However, immense capital investment, cost incurred during EV layout redesign and land area requirements prove to be deterrents. Moreover, the homogeneity of batteries is required in a market unlike for existing EVs in the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Similar to charging infrastructure, complications of congestion exist due to uncoordinated charging within the battery swapping station (BSS) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Shortly, the countries must focus on coordinated EV battery charging/swapping and power management systems to provide sustainable charging systems that possess favourable power quality.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Infrastructural barriers for EV Implementation</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Battery Difficulties</title><p id="Par46">The requirement of sophisticated battery technology is one of the main factors that prevent the mass emergence of EVs into the current market as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. The effectiveness of EV batteries is determined by their range, cost, charging time and safety, working temperature range, materials used, recycling prospectus and disposal capabilities. Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the market due to high energy density, high power density, low weight, cost-effectiveness, non-toxicity and acceptance for fast charging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The main drawback of Li-ion batteries is their high threat of causing fire hazards. The high potential of these batteries for thermal runaway causes temperatures to reach extremities thereby posing an explosive threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Li-ion batteries pose flammable risks in case of overcharging and place a threat to passengers’ safety if not properly insulated. Furthermore, a major drawback associated with any battery technology is its capacity, the most influential factor for EV range. Heavier, high voltage batteries are being utilized to improve the range but the increased mass takes up more space as compared to a fuel tank in a CV counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], ultimately affecting the vehicle handling and performance. Likewise, the charging time of these batteries is much higher than the refuelling time of CVs, even considering fast charging technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], a significant barrier to EV adoption. A crucial issue being faced by battery manufacturers is maintaining battery temperature within the optimal window irrespective of climatic and regional changes. This necessitates battery thermal management systems, increasing system complexity. Materials and manufacturing issues associated with batteries also restrict large-scale EV emergence. Battery materials dictate the operational efficiency and quality of the battery. LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> are materials currently used for cathodes in EVs, while graphite is used for anodes. Drawbacks such as higher cost, complexity, toxicity, poor conductivity and low safety of these materials urge battery producers to develop and incorporate novel materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The processing of these materials leads to large volume changes which can be avoided with the use of composite materials such as micro-scaled or nano-scaled particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Large-scale production of Li-ion batteries for EV applications will use up large volumes of industrial fossil fuels. A less disclosed challenge is the limitation of lithium reserves to meet the annual EV demand of 100 million of 40 kWh Li-based batteries. This will also make the cost reduction in Li-ion batteries a challenging task in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. As EV batteries reach their end-of-life, they emerge as a waste management challenge due to their high volume, complexity and material variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. One probable solution to this issue is the process of recycling, reducing the amount of toxic waste generated and the cost involved in management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. However, battery recycling involves numerous tasks that collectively increase the cost of disposals such as collection, transportation, storage, disassembly, residual energy, echelon reuse and pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. When these costs are added to manufacturing, logistics, raw material and material processing, EV batteries become more expensive. A shift towards novel battery materials implementation would result in soaring costs, further hindering the acceptance of EVs.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Battery barriers and their effect on powertrain electrification</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Purchasing Capability/Consumer Behaviour for EV</title><p id="Par47">Attitudes, perception, experience and societal influence are primary psychological factors influencing consumer behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref><sub>.</sub> Statistical data show that majority of EV users are well-educated with medium to high income, using their vehicles for private purposes and charging them at home at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

This is contrary to results from studies that imply that EVs do not bear higher flammability risks than CVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Lack of awareness amongst the public on the environmental benefits of EV also hinders EV purchase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Consumers often give preference to EV performance over their environmental benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Total battery life is a major factor that stimulates consumer behaviour towards EV purchase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The current EV market does not encourage potential buyers due to a lack of variants. Thus, variety in EV range, style, appearance and functionality can attract more consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Moreover, government policies and incentives offering monetary benefits have a significant influence on EV purchases.

Increased EV penetration could be possible if more beneficial policies are implemented in the future. Monetary incentives unrestricted to sales, tax waiving, income tax credit, subsidiaries for vehicle purchase and construction of charging stations are expected from the government to promote the EV market. A helping hand from the government in signage standardisation for the identification and increased accessibility of charging stations is also mandated in many areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Governments should also work on creating awareness among the public on the environmental friendliness of EVs which not only aids in EV market promotion but also in reducing pollution and carbon footprint. EV penetration can be further promoted if governments levied heavy taxes and restrictions on vehicle carbon emissions. A practical implementation of this scheme is already available in Norway, wherein CVs are heavily taxed whilst BEVs and FCEVs are completely exempted from import and value-added taxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The provision of substantial funds and encouragement towards the development and implementation of alternative fuels will help in the long run. All governments should increase EV market penetration by procuring large-scale fleets of EVs for public transport which, if implemented, can increase the motivation for EV adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] for large companies. Consequently, the number of charging stations available in the community will increase.

By inducing changes in economic criteria weights while keeping all other criteria weights identical, liquid fuel vehicles (LFVs) are spotted as the best propulsion system for the present scenario of this economic phase. In the subsequent position, HEVs up to 0.50 weight are suggested after which gaseous fuel vehicles (GFVs) replace this position. This could be potentially due to the major barrier of higher capital cost. In the central zone, PHEVs and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) occupy positions. On the lowest side, BEV and FCEVs take up positions due to their technologies still being in the emerging stages, with their manufacturing not proving cost-effective. For behavioural criteria, up to the weight of 0.50, LFVs is considered as the best choice while above this weight, PHEVs take up the position. Notably, LFVs move to the lower zone as the entire weight is provided to the behavioural criteria, while BEVs top this position because of higher energy conversion efficiency levels. AFVs show the worst behavioural nature in all forms of weights level except 0.25. This could be due to the properties of biofuel in comparison to that of fossil fuels. In terms of infrastructure, irrespective of weights, the rank order does not show any alteration. This proves that each propulsion system requires a specific kind of primary mandatory infrastructure even at minimum weight, without which the accomplishment of a particular propulsion system is problematic.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Report of hierarchy variation with different criteria weights</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Alternatives</p></th><th align="left" colspan="4"><p>Economic</p></th><th align="left" colspan="4"><p>Behavioural</p></th><th align="left" colspan="4"><p>Infrastructure</p></th><th align="left" colspan="4"><p>Society and environment</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="16"><p>Weights level between the main criteria</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="8"><p>Best to worst</p></td><td align="left"><p>.25</p></td><td align="left"><p>.50</p></td><td align="left"><p>.75</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>.25</p></td><td align="left"><p>.50</p></td><td align="left"><p>.75</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>.25</p></td><td align="left"><p>.50</p></td><td align="left"><p>.75</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>.25</p></td><td align="left"><p>.50</p></td><td align="left"><p>.75</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A3</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A4</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td><td align="left"><p>A1</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A5</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A6</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td><td align="left"><p>A7</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>A1, Liquid fuel vehicle;

HEVs are positioned at second as the infrastructure required is similar to that of LFVs. For GFVs, slight changes are required in refuelling stations, and therefore they rank third. PHEV, BEV, AFV, and FCEV vehicles are ranked in subsequent positions as a significant change in charging infrastructure is required to make them functional. From the societal and environmental aspects, the best alternatives are BEVs in comparison to HEVs as corresponding weights increase. At the second rank, LFVs swap with HEVs at higher weights. This shows that less polluting vehicles are preferred as better alternatives. Interestingly, FCEVs rank in the lower category. This is potentially due to inadequate vehicle response under varying weather conditions and the lack of a skilled workforce. From this criteria weight alteration study, it is understood that focusing on a particular attribute will affect various other aspects. Each vehicle powertrain has particular advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the selection of vehicles should optimally satisfy all criteria. This type of weight assessing approach will be an appropriate preceding step while looking for the evolution from conventional power trains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Characteristics and Probable Pathway of Powertrain Shift Hierarchy</title><p id="Par54">The aim is to determine the best powertrain system for the present scenario without any significant changes in the automotive industry from the chain of production to consumer usage. The PROMETHEE analysis is further proceeded as per the first phase of decision, and equivalent weights are employed for economic, behavioural, infrastructure, society, and environment-based criteria. Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows the significant positive and negative characteristics of a powertrain based on expert opinion. LFVs have strong infrastructure administration, while this criterion is satisfied at the top level for HEVs and GFVs. This could be due to similar infrastructural requirements for the three propulsion systems. However, this measurement will be comparatively lower for LFVs. For PHEVs, HEVs, and FCEVs, infrastructure is shown as a major barrier as its energizing technology is entirely different from conventional LFVs and is not yet developed in India. The behavioural attribute is only present in the negative side of LFVs and GFVs and in the region of BEVs and FCEVs, it is positioned at the peak. This shows that it has a higher level of efficiency and satisfactory operational tendency. As for PHEVs and BEVs, both have similar kinds of attributes and although the level of scoring for the criteria is different, PHEVs are ranked higher than BEVs. The main reason is the infrastructural requirements and its ability to run only on ICEs, which push BEVs further below. FCEVs and AFVs possess only one positive feature differently. FCEVs satisfy the behavioural criterion due to higher energy efficiency and smooth operation, although contrastingly, they have poor features in all other criteria. Similarly, in the economic aspect alone, AFVs secured their best position. As the power development operation is quite identical to LFVs and the only difference is the fuel utilization, they scored more in the sub-criterion of capital cost and resale value. Among all alternatives, HEVs encompass all the criteria in the positive sector. They have a greater score in infrastructural, behavioural, social, environmental, and economic criteria. Although they possess electric motors, they do not pose many infrastructural barriers as the battery is recharged by the running of ICE. Additionally, the presence of switchable powering modes satisfies the behavioural criterion. Concerning demanded engine operation, effective energy management strategies prefer appropriate powering modes. Furthermore, the presence of dual powering mode provides environmental benefits as the electric motor drives the vehicle at idle and low speed, improving fuel efficiency and correspondingly reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Despite possessing such superior qualities, HEVs received the lowest score due to the major factor of the economic aspect for a consumer. However, in comparison to BEVs, FCEVs, and PHEVs, they provide better economic benefits. Finally, for clear and concise visualization of the pathway for a vehicle powertrain shift, the PROMETHEE diamond plot is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. Based on the present scenario, the existing LFV is the most advantageous in all desired criteria. The second position is held HEVs followed by PHEVs, GFVs, BEVs, FCEVs, and AFVs. This ranking order displays that for the present scenario, the alternative for a conventional LFV is the HEV, which should be the next phase of powertrain technology rather than BEVs, which might instead lead to a failure in technology transition. Since BEVs require the evolution of automotive, industrial and infrastructural technology, this would take longer to achieve, especially for developing countries. This analysis does not conclude that BEVs have inferior features; instead, it derives that considering the BEV as an alternative powertrain solution to conventional LFVs is not feasible for the present scenario.

HEVs help to overcome these disadvantages by using two power sources. This is possible as HEVs use engines that operate only in the most efficient torque and speed region while providing excess power to recharge the battery/meet the motor’s remaining power needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].

Hence, HEVs are superior and have clear advantages over CVs and EVs in terms of the TCO.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Driving Range</title><p id="Par60">Consumer range anxiety is one of the most significant factors preventing the adoption and further penetration of EVs in the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. Range anxiety is either due to the lack of fast charging infrastructure or the limited driving range of EVs. In terms of driving range, HEVs and PHEVs have an intrinsic advantage over EVs with the aid of their ICE. HEVs have two power sources, i.e. the battery and the ICE, with the batteries being recharged either through the ICE or from RBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. The HEV engine also operates in its optimal condition, thereby improving its fuel economy and hence having a higher range than its CV counterparts and EVs. PHEVs also can recharge their batteries externally and provide a higher all-electric range than HEVs due to their larger capacity batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. Even though the all-electric range of PHEVs is less than EVs, they act as regular HEVs when the battery depletes, giving them a high driving range.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ease of Transition to EV Manufacturability</title><p id="Par61">The EV market is yet to develop in most countries, and there is a lack of EV manufacturers to support its penetration into the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. Significant resources and time are needed to develop and bring about the required production technology and maintain a proper supply chain for components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. This is where HEVs help to smoothen the transition and pave the way for EVs. HEV components are produced in-house by existing automobile companies and OEMs as the basic structure of CVs and HEVs are similar. With an increase in HEV sales, HEV component production increases. Subsequently, production technology will improve when the market sees a significant enhancement in automotive electronic component development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. This makes it easier for the OEMs to manufacture EV components in the future as HEVs and EVs have very similar powertrain components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>], especially in PHEVs. By the time EV technology develops and matures to penetrate the market further, EV manufacturers can easily access various components with optimized supply chains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Resale Value</title><p id="Par62">With the advent of EVs, future used-car markets are bound to change; however, CVs are still dominant in this market. At present, electric-powered cars depreciate faster than CVs, and in that caveat, BEVs lose resale value quicker than HEVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. This is associated with two main reasons: lack of infrastructure and rapid EV technology developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Lack of infrastructure includes lack of network coverage of charging stations and also the unavailability of spare parts. On the other hand, with rapid battery improvements, the driving range increases, and EV’s cost significantly decreases, leading the consumers with old EVs to have no place in the used-car market. This rapid depreciation of EVs is said to cause resale anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>] among consumers and hence is a potential barrier to the adoption of EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. HEVs on the other hand have a steady depreciation rate and show a similar ratio of resale value to initial price as that of CVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. This can be attributed to an HEV’ high fuel efficiency, improvements in battery costs and performance, and increasing fuel costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. With rising fuel prices over the years and in the coming future, consumers start to look for other viable options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>], and therefore, HEV sales are bound to increase. Hence, HEVs show the highest potential in the resale market in the coming years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Techno-economic Analysis for Transition to Electric Mobility</title><p id="Par63">The techno-economic analysis on electric mobility transition requires several factors, viz. capital, fuel for electricity production, operation and maintenance costs to be considered. The data for the same are summarised and presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>. A report from the ‘International Council of Clean Transportation’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>] exhibited a declining trend in the cost of electric vehicle battery packs in USD/kWh from 2020 to 2030 through a multitude of research studies. This is attributed to the advancement in battery pack technologies, specifically in materials science. The primary components for typical electric vehicles such as inverters, high voltage cables and onboard chargers also show a decrease in unit cost from 2017 to 2025 of an average of 9.5%, Whilst the indirect costs for electric vehicles such as research and development or administration expenses are said to reduce by about 70% in the same period. A study that highlights the predicted decrease in the capital cost for the purchase/installation of charging infrastructure for EVs from 2014 to 2035 is available in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. In the same period, it is anticipated that the cost for at-home and public level 2 charging units would decrease by about 73% while the decrease in the cost of rapid charging units is about 70%.<fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Techno-Economic analysis for transition to electric mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40032_2022_852_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO19"/></fig></p><p id="Par64">During the transition to electric mobility, there is a possibility of diesel being replaced by biodiesel and hence the impact of such replacement should be analysed in terms of cost. The primary fuel and environmental cost comparison between diesel and biodiesel is depicted in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. In general, biodiesel is more expensive than conventional diesel in terms of production and environmental costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. However, while considering the life cycle of the vehicle, the environmental costs for biodiesel are relatively less, and the production cost of biodiesel can further be reduced depending on the production process and the type of feedstock used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. The bio fuelled HEVs follow a trend of lower brake power and torque, and higher brake specific consumption when compared to fossil fuel HEVs which necessitates the tuning of the engine operating parameters, thereby increasing cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. Additionally, it is found that with an increase in the biofuel level in the mixture with fossil fuels, there is higher NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and more CO<sub>2</sub> production due to more complete combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>]. To reduce the same, it is needed the catalytic converters, ultimately increasing the cost of installation and overall weight of the vehicle. Also, the use of biofuels in engines results in a higher heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. This mandates a better engine design and thus increasing the cost. Furthermore, it is found that out of all the biodiesel mixtures with fossil fuels, it is found that only B20 and B50 are suitable for automotive applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>]. For the production of these variants of biodiesel, special manufacturing equipment, processes, skilled professionals and production techniques have to be adopted, which are different from the existing and known standards. As a result, all these factors together contribute to the increased cost of utilizing biofuel HEVs in place of fossil fuel HEVs.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cost comparison between diesel and biodiesel</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>References</p></th><th align="left"><p>Parameter</p></th><th align="left"><p>Diesel (USD)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Biodiesel (USD)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fuel price (per gasoline gallon equivalent)</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.35</p></td><td align="left"><p>3.68</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Production cost of fuel (per gallon)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.77</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.5–3.35</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Total environmental cost</p></td><td align="left"><p>80,443</p></td><td align="left"><p>83,867</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Life cycle based total environmental cost</p></td><td align="left"><p>183,243</p></td><td align="left"><p>181,923</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Other Advantages</title><p id="Par65">Other advantages of HEVs include but are not limited to RBS, reduced noise emissions and acceptance of EVs in the future. RBS helps in conserving the kinetic energy during braking, usually lost as heat in CVs. As braking in urban conditions leads to the consumption of almost half of the energy from prime movers, RBS becomes significant in improving the efficiency of HEVs. RBS helps the conversion of kinetic energy into electrical energy during braking and using it to charge the battery. This can be used to meet the vehicle’s power requirements at a later stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. HEVs also help to reduce noise pollution in urban areas, mainly when driven in all-electric mode in PaHEVs and PHEVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. In this mode, only the electric motor is used to drive the vehicle and the noise produced is insignificant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. PHEVs in all-electric mode exhibit noiseless driving similar to BEVs, albeit for a shorter range. PHEVs in all-electric mode help transition to BEVs smoother by providing BEV style driving experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. Studies have shown that first-hand experience at driving BEVs has a positive impact on EV adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>] and PHEVs provide this experience to consumers, making it easier to transition to EVs by providing the right mindset thus improving consumer perception of EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p id="Par66">The extensive review of the literature related to electric mobility demonstrates the large gap to be bridged for the complete diffusion of EVs to the market in developing countries. Numerous technical and socio-economic factors, viz. purchasing cost, driving range, range anxiety, consumer perception and lack of charging infrastructure play a significant role in impeding the transition. The majority of the technical barriers and purchase costs could be reduced with corresponding development in battery technology and increased density of charging infrastructure. Governments of developing and underdeveloped countries should consider these barriers during the creation and implementation of new policies to maximize the EV transition. As this transition is also largely reliant upon consumer mindset, awareness improvement programs on EV policies and environmental benefits could motivate the consumers to switch to EVs. A larger scale of such programs should be conducted either by government bodies or forums of public interest.</p><p id="Par67">An expert perception survey conducted at the end of the review revealed the potential of HEVs as the best alternative propulsion system for India. For this purpose, the categorized barriers with their sub-categories for different propulsion systems are shared with the academicians and industrialists to obtain their opinions. The criteria and sub-criteria analysis of barriers for alternative propulsive systems are carried out with their impact on deployment. The data obtained from experts are processed with MCDM based PROMETHEE approach through which appropriate weights to each criterion are assigned and the ranking of alternatives are accomplished. The prevailing transportation scenario in India places LFV first place due to its widespread acceptance and development which then followed HEVs. This transportation performs better in all criteria as compared to other alternatives. The lack of OEMs and production units in India only placed them in the second position. PHEVs and EVs are further below in ranking mainly due to their infrastructure deficiency. Thus, the hierarchy report, which is the main outcome of the expert perception survey concluded HEVs as the most viable option for India, considering the existing technology and infrastructure. The ample use of HEVs in India will help in reducing emissions and path transition to EVs.</p><p id="Par68">Literature review on the advantages of HEVs portrays its capability to ease EV transition. Adopting HEVs by auto-makers helps them get familiar with the production of EV components as HEVs and EVs have similar power train components. With increased HEV sales, production technology for electric-drive components increases and the supply chain for these components undergoes significant development. Furthermore, the introduction of PHEVs also helps to smooth the transition to EVs. It helps to develop the charging infrastructure gradually and gives the consumers an experience of all-electric drive, thus helping EV adoption rates. At present, other advantages of HEVs over EVs include lower TCO, higher driving range, higher resale value and reduced life emissions. HEVs also have a significant advantage over CVs with improved fuel economy, reduced lifetime cost and emissions, especially in India with the increasing fuel price and stricter emission norms. Future research studies can be oriented to enhance the evaluation of sub-criteria datasets and thus the accuracy of the developed model. This study offers the flexibility of extending to other countries to find an optimal alternative propulsive system depending on various barriers and sub-criteria as applicable to them.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Management of Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore for the facilities provided during the execution of this work.
