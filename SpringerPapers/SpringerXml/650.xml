Modeling the dynamic interactions of both human and non-human systems is admittedly a challenging task, as it requires expertise from multiple disciplines. Within the last 10 years, a wide variety of research papers have been published that include some biophysical aspects in a model of the economy. These papers all have one thing in common: the model of the economy includes physical and/or energetic exchanges, as well as monetary exchange. This theme is what defines the emerging sub-discipline of biophysical economics, BPE. BPE models of the economy originate from a variety of disciplines, and thus BPE research articles are published across a wide spectrum of academic journals. As inter-disciplinary researchers ourselves, we want to understand what BPE modeling approaches have been used so far. In this paper, we examine and classify over one hundred published articles that use biophysical models of the economy. Although BPE modeling approaches are quite varied, grouping the research by common characteristics reveals several active research areas. We highlight recent papers that are helpful examples of the most popular BPE modeling strategies. Gaps also exist. Several modeling approaches have not been used in published works yet. We identify which of those gaps could be promising avenues for future research. We conclude by suggesting which BPE modeling approach might be particularly appropriate for a variety of research questions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biophysical constraints are largely ignored in conventional economic models. Of course these conventional models do not explicitly deny the biophysical reality that the economy depends on the availability of natural resources, or even that the economy takes advantage of ecosystem services such as water purification, carbon sequestration, and erosion control. However, these realities are generally not considered limiting enough to be of concern.</p><p id="Par3">To be fair, instances of natural resource depletion leading to major economic contraction are rare in the modern era and early attempts by economists to model or account for biophysical limits on the economy were unsuccessful. In 1798, economist Thomas Malthus modeled the economy as bound by the quantity of agricultural land. And, because the quantity of land available to feed the population could only grow linearly, but the population would grow exponentially, he predicted catastrophic outcomes (Malthus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1878</xref>). What Malthus’ model missed was the impact of technology. Human ingenuity improved the quality of land, rendering the physical quantity of land a seemingly non-binding constraint. Indeed, the subsequent increase in the quantity and quality of food production ushered in one of the greatest eras of improvement in human health and well-being.</p><p id="Par4">In 1866, renowned mathematical economist William Stanley Jevons’ predicted that the rebound effect from England’s improvements in energy technology would outstrip the available reserves of coal. He called for policy to restrain economic growth and keep the economy from an unsustainable path. (Jevons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1866</xref>). However, his policy suggestions went unheeded and his predictions were proved wrong. Again, the economy skirted looming constraints through technological innovation. Thus, this more sophisticated biophysical model of the economy proved lacking as well.</p><p id="Par5">These failures may have inadvertently led economists to believe that technological innovation will always allow the economy to ignore biophysical limits. And, to be fair, that is a possibility, though an unlikely one. As the Industrial Age enters its fourth century, there is reason to believe that past technological advances did not abolish biophysical constraints, but instead merely postponed them. For example, while diminishing reserves of underground coal in the UK and Eastern US were replaced with coal mined from near surface resources (e.g., in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin), the less obvious depletion of CO<inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mrow/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Similarly, as diminishing conventional oil reserves are being supplemented with ‘unconventional oil’ from oil sands or tight oil resources, the increasing energy costs may become unsustainable. These and other substitutions skirt obvious natural resource limits in the short-run, but are subject to seemingly less obvious ecological limits in the long-run. Thus, the urgency to understand the relationship between economics, resources, and ecological systems might be more apparent to those outside the economics discipline.</p><p id="Par6">As Malthus and Jevons demonstrated, developing a useful biophysical model of the economy is challenging. Biophysical models of the economy require knowledge from a variety of additional disciplines, including earth and environmental science, biology, and ecology, as well as industrial and mechanical engineering, to name a few. Development of biophysical models of the economy is necessarily multi-disciplinary. Unsurprisingly, most of the biophysical models of the economy have been developed outside of the economics discipline because ecosystem services are not traded in the market, nor are ecological systems necessarily well-understood by economists.</p><p id="Par7">The field of biophysical economics provides a named space for the diverse body of research that is linked by a common goal: to elucidate the physical reality of the earth-based economy. BPE models must capture complex interactions between human and natural systems. Many focus particularly on modeling thermodynamics and energy as part of the economic systems of extraction, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal. The advantage of BPE models is that researchers from a wide variety of backgrounds can work together to understand these systems. The disadvantage is that emerging, multi-discipline research fields such as BPE can be a daunting landscape to navigate. It is not easy to understand the full range of BPE research that already exists, let alone identify potential openings for new BPE research questions. Given the urgency of the questions that biophysical economics research can address, coupled with the widely diverse set of approaches used by practitioners, a way to understand the current biophysical economics modeling landscape is a necessity.</p><p id="Par8">The contribution of this paper is to develop a taxonomy for biophysical models of the economy and classify a sample of over 100 BPE articles published in the last 10 years. This taxonomy classifies articles based on six characteristics: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par9">Framework: does action in the model flow from the top-down or bottom-up?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Spatial scale: is the model more local or global in scale?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Time horizon: is the time frame short or long term?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Modeling ethos: is the model more empirical or theoretical?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">Origins: does the model emerge primarily from natural or from social sciences?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">Mechanism: does the model rely on statistical inference or simulated outcomes?</p></list-item></list>Each characteristic is described in detail in the “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Taxonomy</xref>” section.</p><p id="Par15">Classifying BPE research through this taxonomy helps to identify approaches that have attracted high levels of research activity. The taxonomy also reveals under-utilized approaches that could be successful new avenues of future research. Gaps within the modeling taxonomy may indicate open niches, or room for new biophysical economic models. Preliminary analysis of the gaps in the taxonomy suggests that promising openings for future research include for example, how the geographic distribution of people and resources affect biophysical constraints. Or, what policy interventions might be necessary to transition smoothly to a renewable energy based economy.</p><p id="Par16">This paper proceeds as follows. We first provide a brief history of biophysical economics as it emerged from within economics and from other disciplines. We identify additional reviews of BPE literature, as well. We then describe the wide variety of modeling approaches that have appeared so far in the field of biophysical economics. We describe each of the six characteristics that are used to categorize them and show how four examples of recent research are classified using the taxonomy. Classifying 110 BPE articles according to the taxonomy allows researchers interested in biophysical economics an opportunity to see the broad landscape of modeling approaches that have been published so far. The paper concludes with suggestions of areas that are ripe for additional research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>What Makes a Model of the Economy a Biophysical Model?</title><p id="Par17">Mainstream environmental economic models examine the markets and market failures related to natural resources, energy, and waste. These models perceive natural resources, energy, and waste through the lens of financial flows. In contrast, biophysical models of the economy also account for the physical flows of natural resources, energy, and waste through the economy. In most cases, resources, energy, and waste are viewed as central players in BPE models of the economy. Palmer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>) <italic>Energies</italic> article provides an especially clear definition of biophysical economics.<disp-quote><p>Biophysical economics is the study of the ways and means by which human societies procure and use energy and other biological and physical resources to produce, distribute, consume and exchange goods and services, while generating various types of waste and environmental impacts. Biophysical economics builds on both social sciences and natural sciences to overcome some of the most fundamental limitations and blind spots of conventional economics. It makes it possible to understand some key requirements and framework conditions for economic growth, as well as related constraints and boundaries.</p></disp-quote>Conventional economics models the economy as a separate and distinct entity. The economy is modeled as a circular flow of goods and services in one direction, and monetary flows in the other. In conventional economics textbooks, the circular flow economy is presented as disembodied and disconnected from the earth upon which it is based.</p><p id="Par18">The contrast between BPE and conventional economics is made clear in the BPE version of the circular flow model as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>BPE’s circular flow model</p><p>Adapted from Heun et al.

The diagram not only recognizes the necessity of material and energy as inputs to a functioning economy, but also recognizes the inevitability of outputs—presently waste deposited back to the biosphere. The non-monetary flows of materials, energy, and waste that are intrinsic to the economy are made visible alongside the monetary flows and flows of economic goods and services. This coupling between economy and biosphere is critical to holistically understand constraints to economic opportunities and the impacts of economic activity upon the natural environment.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Biophysical Economics Renaissance</title><p id="Par20">As mentioned above, biophysical economics is not new. In fact, the name “economist” was coined by the the Physiocrats, arguably the first biophysical economists in the modern era (Miller and Blair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>). The Physiocrats were led by French physician Francois Quesnay and advocated the position that agriculture was the source of a country’s wealth. This rivaled earlier ideas of mercantilism (led by Sir William Petty, the first econometrician) that described a country’s wealth as coming from the accumulation of silver and gold.</p><p id="Par21">Francois Quesnay is likely most known for his Tableau Economique, an economic model depicting the flow of goods through economic sectors. Most notably, Quesnay saw no “value-added” in manufacturing or service industries—agriculture and land output was the sole source of wealth (Quesnay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1972</xref>). Despite this flaw, the Tableau Economique went on to influence the foundations of national accounts and input–output economics and Quesnay is known as one of the first economists who valued an economy’s reliance on natural resources.</p><p id="Par22">Outside the field of economics, the scientific work of Sadi Carnot, Rudolf Clausius, and Lord Kelvin formalized the laws of thermodynamics. These laws describe the nature of energy, but the second law is of particular importance to economics. The second law of thermodynamics roughly states that isolated systems tend toward an equilibrium, at which point no useful work can be done. For a system to maintain a non-equilibrium state and continue to do work, it requires a continual flow of low entropy (high quality) energy. That is, the system must be open (i.e., have inputs) to perform tasks and/or grow. The economy is such a system. One goal of biophysical economics is to stay true to these thermodynamic principles.</p><p id="Par23">Scientists outside the field of economics began to see the implications of these laws on the economy—because economies exist in a physical reality, they must have fundamental physical limits or constraints. Cleveland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>) go into more detail concerning this early theory development phase. Some notable researchers include Lotka, who linked energy quality to biological life (Lotka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1922</xref>), Cottrell, who studied “surplus energy” (a precursor to Energy Return on Investment, EROI) and its role in societal development (Cottrell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1955</xref>), M. K. Hubbert, who developed the theory of peak oil (Hubbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1949</xref>), and Odum, who posited an energy theory of value and developed systems ecology (Odum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1994</xref>). Cleveland et al. studied the relationship between energy use and GNP (Cleveland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1984</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Within the economics discipline, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly pioneered the modern biophysical approach to economic theory. In 1971, Georgescu-Roegen’s <italic>The Entropy Law and the Economic Process</italic> introduced the implications of entropy for an economy (Georgescu-Roegen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1971</xref>). An economy relies upon low entropy (high quality) resources to fuel the production of goods. Furthermore, economies emit high-entropy (low quality) wastes (e.g., waste-heat). Georgescu-Roegen is one of the first economists in the modern era to acknowledge the biophysical constraints of the global economy (Kåberger and Månsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2001</xref>; Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1999</xref>). And, although somewhat controversial, Georgescu-Roegen even went so far as to suggest that the second law might apply to physical matter as well as energy—economies consume highly concentrated ores (e.g., copper or lithium) and then dispose of materials in a low concentration waste-stream (e.g., landfills).</p><p id="Par25">Herman Daly built on Georgescu-Roegan’s biophysical approach as he developed the concept of steady-state economics. In contrast to mainstream economic theory that requires ever-increasing levels of economic output to maintain growth in standards of living, Daly posits that a steady-state economy, in combination with significant recycling programs, can maintain growth in standards of living, while also acknowledging and incorporating the biophysical limitations of the economy (Daly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1991</xref>). The implications and pathways towards a steady-state is a growing research thrust that has recently gained popularity (Ghisellini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Arguably the first holistic biophysical model of the economy in the current era is the seminal, <italic>Limits to Growth</italic> work led by Donella Meadows (Meadows et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1972</xref>). Advances in computer technology opened the door for their highly sophisticated model and simulated outcomes of the interaction between economic and biophysical systems. Their model explored the impacts of population growth, resource depletion, and pollution externalities on societal growth. Harking back to Malthus and Jevons, their simulations resulted in a growth patterns that exhibited overshoot and collapse. Only scenarios of concerted and sustained efforts to mitigate damaging effects of over consumption were able to avoid unplanned collapse. The study findings generated much controversy within the academic and popular literature; however as the decades have unfolded since their work, the predicted patterns of the model have not been proven inconsistent with reality. Malthus and Jevons’ theories may be proven correct after all (discounting their timeline), although that would not be a win to celebrate.</p><p id="Par27">Since Daly and his contemporaries’ work, many BPE researchers have turned to solidifying, building out, and fine-tuning the theoretical framework that was largely outlined in the 20th century. Hall and Klitgaard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>), for example, wrote <italic>Energy and the Wealth of Nations</italic>, an introductory textbook to biophysical economics. Now, more research activity is trending towards quantitative modeling rather than qualitative theorizing. A few researchers have been at the forefront of this modeling effort.

BPE shares EcE’s underlying theory, perspective, and historical literature, but differs in the primary research thrust.

These include aggregate production functions, input–output tables, systems dynamics, life cycle assessment, and many others. The choice of model depends partially on the modeling goal, but also on data availability and domain knowledge (North and Macal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>; Hamill and Gilbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Sterman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1991</xref>). An interesting example is provided by the World3 model, developed during the seminal <italic>Limits to Growth</italic> study (Meadows et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1972</xref>). The goal of the model was “to identify “different possible futures” by “sketching alternative scenarios for humanity as we move toward 2100.” (Meadows and Randers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>, p. xvii). This meant that model results were not meant to be treated as <italic>predictions</italic>, but instead “merely indicate the general direction our system, as it is currently structured, is taking us.” (Meadows et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1972</xref>, p. 43). This, however, did not stop many critics from rebuffing the model by pointing out that “predictions” did not come to pass in any particular year (Bardi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>). That is, some readers of the model results assumed a different modeling goal than the designers intended.</p><p id="Par37">We postulate that biophysical economic models can be categorized in many ways (described in the “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Taxonomy</xref>” section). The categorization of models may elucidate several things about the field: 1. What topic areas have been addressed? 2. What modeling types have researchers focused on? 3. What modeling goals are prominent? And, categorization may help point out potential gaps in the current modeling landscape. Is the current landscape of BPE models missing any important areas of research that can be identified through a taxonomic analysis?</p><p id="Par38">For this paper, we have selected 110 articles containing biophysical economic models to analyze based on their topics addressed and model characteristics.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Article Selection Criteria</title><p id="Par39">In order to capture as representative a sample of recent models as possible without generating too large of a potential set, we developed a set of search and screening criteria in our literature search. For our initial search, we included the journals: <italic>Biophysical Economics and</italic> <italic>Sustainability</italic> (formerly <italic>Biophysical Economics and</italic><italic>Resource Quality</italic>), <italic>Ecological Economics</italic>, <italic>Ecological Modelling</italic>, <italic>Energy Economics</italic>, <italic>Energy Policy</italic>, and <italic>Resource and Energy Economics</italic>. We acknowledge that BPE researchers publish elsewhere as well, but we believe these journals provide a representative cross-section of the field (the journals <italic>Energy</italic>, <italic>Applied Energy</italic>, and <italic>Energy Policy</italic> all receive similar BPE models, for example). We also added 20 known BPE models published elsewhere. These models were categorized when developing the categorization criteria, but were outside the final defined scope of the literature search. We additionally added 7 papers recommended by reviewers. Our search process followed the following steps: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par40">Using ScienceDirect, filter to only include research articles from 2009 to 2019 (results are provided in the supporting materials).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">For each journal, search with keywords:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par42">Model, input–output</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Model, systems dynamics</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Model, production function</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Agent-based model</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Perform first screening of 1366 results</p></list-item></list>We limited the initial search with certain modeling framework keywords to attempt to avoid articles discussing conceptual or qualitative models or reviews. We acknowledge that, by focusing specifically on these keywords, we may miss other BPE models that do not fall into one of these categories, such as a generic analytical model defined by a few equations (though, the search did pick up some of these models, usually under the “production function” search query). The initial search provided a total of 1366 papers to screen.</p><p id="Par47">Our initial screening process consisted of reading the title of the paper to determine if it did not fit a broad definition of “BPE model.” Our primary guide here is the definition of biophysical economics referenced in the “<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">What Makes a Model of the Economy a Biophysical Model?</xref>” section. To align with the definition of BPE, we kept articles that hinted at including both an economic component, and physical resources or environmental flows within industrialized society. A BPE model either explicitly accounts for physical limits in non-monetary units of physical substances in or around an economy (in addition to some economic component), or a BPE model frames the interpretation of a monetary-based model through a BPE perspective (such as a model critiquing the cost-share of energy and its impacts on GDP). For this first screening process, our aim was to be inclusive rather than exclusive. That is, we only excluded papers that clearly were <italic>not</italic> a BPE model. An article was discarded if: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par48">The article only mentioned emissions, CO2, or carbon footprinting in the context of climate change, such as “Structural decomposition analysis and input–output subsystems: Changes in CO2 emissions of Spanish service sectors (2000–2005)” (Butnar and Llop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par49">Excluded because short term environmental concerns, without much discussion of physical limits or the root causes of climate change, align closer to environmental economics than biophysical economics.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">The article was focused on land use or agriculture, such as “The role of farmers’ property rights in soil ecosystem services conservation” (Foudi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par51">Excluded because, while a macroscopic land use or agriculture study could fit within BPE, a micro-economic or small-scale/local perspective rarely fits within the BPE definition of “...the ways and means by which human <italic>societies</italic> procure and use energy and other biological and physical resources.” Here, the title does not imply investigating fundamental limits or constraints on soil at a societal level.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">The article only referenced pricing externalities, such as “Pricing emission permits in the absence of abatement” (Hintermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par53">Excluded because pricing externalities and emissions abatement fall within the realm of energy economics, and do not necessarily examine physical limits or the root cause of emissions (economic output and resource usage).</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">The article focused on non-humans (often within the journal <italic>Ecological Modelling</italic>), such as “Evaluating impacts of intensive shellfish aquaculture on a semi-closed marine ecosystem” (Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par55">Excluded because the definition of BPE limits the field to human societies.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">The article had no clear link to economics, such as “Foodweb modeling for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Twelvemile Creek Arm of Lake Hartwell, South Carolina, USA” (Rashleigh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par57">Excluded because, while PCBs are a pollutant generated by humans, BPE models must include an economic component.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list>Screening article titles reduced the pool to 207 potential BPE models. These 207 articles were then screened based on the abstract and conclusion. This second stage followed all of the discard criteria above, but additionally looked for commentary on the physical nature of resources or potential ecological constraints on the economy. Lack of BPE specific commentary often meant the article better aligned with one of the neighboring economic disciplines described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Additionally, the paper needed to include a quantitative model. Abram and Dyke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>), for example, did not pass the second screening. Though the title “Structural Loop Analysis of Complex Ecological Systems” and abstract hint at BPE commentary and a quantitative model, the paper itself details a specific tool used to analyze system dynamics models and does not focus on a specific BPE model. This second screening reduced the pool to 110 articles that were categorized according to the criteria outlined in the “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Taxonomy</xref>” section.

These topic areas were selected by identifying common, but discrete themes among the papers. The topic areas include: 1. “Energy Economy”—macroeconomic models such as an economy-wide EROI or rebound-effect study; 2. “Energy Resources and Technology”—models focused on a specific sector or technology such as peak oil or solar PV; 3. “Materials”—models studying the depletion of non-energetic, non-renewable substances, particularly industrial feed-stocks, such as lithium or iron; 4. “Resources”— models studying renewable resources, or resources in the context of ecology rather than industry. These include agriculture, water, or land use; 5. “Interconnections”—models of a holistic nature that capture multiple categories, such as the Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY) model (Motesharrei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>); 6. “Climate”—models focused on the relationship between biophysical economics and climate change; and 7. “Policy”—models focused on policy and stakeholder action, such as a dynamic ecological footprint model to examine the impact of different policy scenarios (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>).
</p><p id="Par61">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> displays the number of papers within each of these broad categories. The figure shows that the majority of models investigate energy-related subjects. Indeed, much of biophysical economics has been focused on questions related to energy return on investment and the role of energy in the economy. However, there are also a significant number of models that focus on non-energetic materials and resources. These models hit the “materials” economy-biosphere link present on Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the biophysical circular flow diagram. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> also seems to indicate that there are relatively few models focused on interconnections, climate, and policy.

These characteristics are: Framework, Spatial scale, Time horizon, Ethos, Origins, and Mechanism. For each characteristic, we use an ordinal 1–5 scale to designate the potential categories of that characteristic. Note that though we use a 1–5 scale, we make no value or effectiveness judgments. Neither 1 nor 5 is “the best”—the quality of a specific model is wholly dependent on how well it aligns with its intended application. Additionally, the categories may not be evenly spaced—they are merely a logical ordering. That is, a category of 3 is not necessarily directly halfway between two and four, but the order 2–3–4 is logical.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Framework</title><p id="Par64">The framework characteristic is the big-picture structure of a model type. The categories are Individual-based Model, Agent-based Model, Input–Output Model, Systems Dynamics, and Aggregate Production Function. The framework characteristic describes something broader than “model structure.” Two systems dynamics models may have vastly different structures. But, as systems dynamics models, they will have the same overall rules, mathematical concepts, and types of algorithms governing them.</p><p id="Par65">In the taxonomy, a category of 5 represents models similar to aggregate production functions—simple, highly aggregated analytical models that collapse highly distinct and variable real-world phenomena into a minimal number of variables.</p><p id="Par66">Systems dynamics models or similar are given a category of 4, as they can capture more details of the dynamics of a system. As system dynamics models are one of the most prevalent approaches we find, here we provide further description of this approach. A systems dynamics model identifies stocks and flows within a system and determines feedback loops in order to build system-level equations that relate various parameters. An example systems dynamics model might be of the world economy, such as the World3 model in <italic>Limits to Growth</italic> (Meadows et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2004</xref>). Often (though not a requirement), the equations describe aggregated flows at the economy or sector level, such as lumping all production, emissions, or energy use into a single parameter. These parameters might miss important details of what they represent, like limitations of specific energy technologies. Furthermore, the design and structure of a systems dynamics model is static throughout its runtime. Stocks and flows representing portions of the economy do not spontaneously switch trading partners.</p><p id="Par67">Input–output modeling or similar are given a category of 3, because they can be highly disaggregated with numerous distinct industries or processes (assuming data availability).</p><p id="Par68">A category of 2 represents agent-based models. Agent-based models (ABM) are relatively new modeling approaches and we provide further description of them here. ABM often model micro-economic behavior at the level of the individual or firm. Macroeconomic outcomes (desired indicators) emerge from agents’ interactions. While also incorporating feedback loops, an agent-based model is adaptive in ways that system dynamics cannot be, in part because the major driver within the model is an individual rather than system. Social networks and relationships can form or dissolve because of agents’ changing behavior. Intra-system, emergent, macro-level dynamics, such as income inequality and technological adoption, are more able to represent realistic variability because they need not be constrained by a static set of functions. For example, Rai and Robinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>) developed an agent-based model of household solar panel adoption within Austin, Texas. The model simulated both economic and social influences (such as geographic neighbors installing PV systems) on the decision to invest in solar panels, and accurately simulated city-wide solar adoption trends (the emergent behavior being studied).</p><p id="Par69">Lastly, a category of 1 for the framework characteristic represents true individual-based models, where an agent is a specific person or entity, rather than an industry or country (a country might often be the “agent” in ABMs, such as Voudouris et al.

A systems dynamics model may represent the global economy, a specific country’s economy, or one city’s economy using the same equations. However, each scale still encounters the limitations of the modeling framework. A coarse- or fine-grained systems dynamics model will always treat its object of analysis as a system of stocks and flows. For the modeler, it is important to ensure assumptions built into the modeling framework align with the represented scope. An aggregate production function model might not fit a rapidly evolving city well, as the framework abstracts away from many of the details that defines a “rapidly evolving city.” On a practical level, an individual-based model of the world would create significant computing costs.</p><p id="Par73">The choice of scale also impacts model interpretation and policy implications. What is the modeler trying to say with their model? A peak-oil model of a single oil well has a significantly different impact than a continent or world model.

At the other end of the spectrum are complete empirical and applied models that directly correlate to a specific location, time, and technology, but leave little room for making general observations. Ethos captures that characteristic spirit of the model’s interpretation intentions. Many models fall between these two extremes—they are built with some links to a specific, real instance, but are based on theory or contain stylized elements. Often the specific and real data are used to validate theory (or at least the model), which may enable further model projection past the original dataset (i.e., hindcasting to prove model legitimacy).</p><p id="Par79">Some researchers have suggested that, at least for certain modeling frameworks, few should fall in the middle of this characteristic.

Due to the nature of agent-based modeling, it might be impossible to build a purely empirical model. Agent-based models require significant modeling assumptions (ideally based on theory) that extend beyond a pure data-based analysis. <bold>Gap is unlikely to be filled.</bold></p><p id="Par100"><bold>Box D</bold> indicates that agent-based models are grounded in behavioral economics or social science. This is because agent-based models originated in the social sciences, and the framework is significantly dependent on social dynamics and interactions. <bold>Gap is unlikely to be filled.</bold></p><p id="Par101"><bold>Box E</bold> shows that an agent-based model by definition is a simulation. It cannot be a statistical analysis. An agent-based model could potentially be constrained by an optimization framework but these are rare. <bold>Gap is unlikely to be filled.</bold></p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Systems Dynamics Gaps</title><p id="Par102"><bold>Box F</bold> shows that there are no short term systems dynamics models. So far, system dynamics models have been used to study long term and ultra-long term time horizons. It may be easier to use an input–output model or other model structure to study short term time horizons. <bold>Gap is possible to be filled,</bold> if the systems dynamics model is built appropriately. <italic>Is there enough rare-earth element mining capacity for the European Union to dramatically ramp-up energy storage technologies in the short term (&lt;5 years)?

Similar to agent-based models, this gap appears to be a byproduct of the systems dynamics framework. <bold>Gap is unlikely to be filled.</bold></p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Continent Spatial Scale Gap</title><p id="Par104"><bold>Box I</bold> shows that across all other modeling characteristics, continent scale models are rare. It is interesting to note that most simulation models work at the world scale, while most statistical analysis models work at the country scale. An apparent gap exists in scaling these modeling mechanisms to alternate spatial scales. This might be attributed to low data availability at the continent scale; country or worldwide data may be easier to obtain. There seems to be much room for models of a specific continent, particularly if there is an emphasis on ocean- vs land-based trade or supply routes. <bold>Gap is possible to be filled.</bold><italic>Does one continent have an inherent advantage over others for an energy resource transition due to distribution of resources? How has geographic distance between suppliers and manufacturers affected EROI and costs for various energy technologies?</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Time Horizon Gap</title><p id="Par105">The majority of time horizon gaps occur for the short term (less than 5 years) time horizon models. <bold>Boxes J</bold>, <bold>K</bold>, and <bold>L</bold> show that only Input–Output models currently model the short term. As input–output models usually work with a single year of economic data, this makes sense. However, the gap indicates that short term simulations (<bold>Box L</bold>) do not exist. This may be because economies are not facing fundamental physical constraints in the short term, and so a short term biophysical model might reduce down to a standard economic model. However, there is potential for sudden supply shocks within the short term. This might require a biophysical model to understand. We believe this is certainly a research gap that ought to be further studied. <bold>Gap is possible to be filled.</bold><italic>What short term economic and environmental effects would occur due to a repeat of the 1973 oil crisis in today’s economy?</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Ethos Gap</title><p id="Par106"><bold>Box M</bold> indicates that few statistical analysis or optimization models are purely theoretical. Conversely, <bold>Box N</bold> indicates that few simulations are purely empirical. This makes sense—a certain level of abstraction is necessary to create a tractable simulation. That is, simulations rely on theory. In parallel, analytic models rely on empirical data. Analytic models may incorporate theoretical underpinnings (such as the concept of EROI), but they tend to be far more empirical than theory. As such, these research gaps make sense and seem to be a product of the modeling mechanism, rather than an underdeveloped area of the landscape. <bold>Gap is unlikely to be filled.</bold></p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Other Observations</title><p id="Par107">Few optimization models were found in the literature. This might be a consequence of the requirements for optimization—biophysical economics tends to be complicated and complex in a way ill-suited for an optimization routine. Optimization requires a well-specified objective and well-specified constraints. Within the context of economics, an optimization model might also require economic actors to maximize their utility and perfectly value everything—a contentious assumption.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusion and Future Research</title><p id="Par108">Biophysical models of the economy are necessarily multi-disciplinary because they model both human and natural systems, as well as the relationships between them. Because of the multi-disciplinary nature, biophysical economics modeling approaches are published across a large spectrum of academic journals. The primary contribution of this study has been to develop a taxonomy of biophysical economics models as a way to understand the current landscape of this diverse body of work. Using the taxonomy to classify the last 10 years of published studies reveals which approaches have been used more than others. The more densely populated cells of the taxonomy include systems dynamics models, global models, long time horizon, and those originating from either integrated assessment modeling or mainstream economics. Several gaps in the taxonomy suggest that some modeling approaches have yet to be explored in the published literature. Some of the gaps are expected, and are not likely to be productive areas to explore. For example, the Ethos gaps are a natural result of the context of how models are developed. On the other hand, the lack of agent-based models, and models at the city, state, or continental scale are likely to be promising avenues for the future. That these gaps exist indicates that certain research questions have yet to be addressed. We believe there is merit to building models in these gaps. By expanding the application of these biophysical modeling approaches we can deepen the understanding of how the economy can work within its biophysical constraints.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. 1744593.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abram</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dyke</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Structural loop analysis of complex ecological systems</article-title><source>Ecol Econ</source><year>2018</year><volume>154</volume><fpage>333</fpage><lpage>342</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2018.08.011</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ayres</surname><given-names>RU</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The second law, the fourth law, recycling and limits to growth</article-title><source>Ecol Econ</source><year>1999</year><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>473</fpage><lpage>483</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00098-6</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ayres</surname><given-names>RU</given-names></name><name><surname>Warr</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><source>The economic growth engine: how energy and work drive material prosperity</source><year>2010</year><publisher-loc>Cheltenham</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Edward Elgar Publishing</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bardi</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><source>The limits to growth revisited</source><year>2011</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/978-1-4419-9416-5</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Brand-Correa LI, Brockway PE, Copeland CL, Foxon TJ, Owen A, Taylor PG, Brand-Correa LI, Brockway PE, Copeland CL, Foxon TJ, Owen A, Taylor PG (2017) Developing an input-output based method to estimate a national-level energy return on investment (EROI).

This suggests a certain amount of overlap between Ecological Economics and BPE. The journal <italic>Biophysical Economics and Resource Quality</italic> (BERQ, now <italic>Biophysical Economics and Sustainability</italic>) has the largest percentage of BPE models, followed by <italic>Ecological Economics</italic> and <italic>Energy Policy</italic>. BERQ’s high percentage indicates that its scope fully aligns with BPE and the editors filter models appropriately. Although BERQ was launched in 2016, the rate of non-BERQ BPE models has remained fairly steady during the time period under review (2009–2019). This indicates that field has grown over the past 3 years, and BERQ has captured this growth without negatively affecting publishing rates in other journals.</p></sec></app><app id="App3"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Appendix B Full Taxonomy Scheme</title><p id="Par112">For reference, the full taxonomy scheme is supplied in Table <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">13</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab13"><label>Table 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Full model taxonomy scheme</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Characteristic</p></th><th align="left" colspan="5"><p>Category</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p>1</p></th><th align="left"><p>2</p></th><th align="left"><p>3</p></th><th align="left"><p>4</p></th><th align="left"><p>5</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Framework</p></td><td align="left"><p>Individual-based model</p></td><td align="left"><p>Agent-based model</p></td><td align="left"><p>Input–output model</p></td><td align="left"><p>Systems dynamics</p></td><td align="left"><p>Aggregate production function</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Spatial scale</p></td><td align="left"><p>City or smaller</p></td><td align="left"><p>State/province</p></td><td align="left"><p>Country</p></td><td align="left"><p>Continent/world region</p></td><td align="left"><p>World</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Time horizon</p></td><td align="left"><p>Immediate (less than 1 year)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Short term (1–5 years)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Medium term (5–10 years)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Long term (10 + years)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Ultra-long term (100 + years)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ethos</p></td><td align="left"><p>Pure theory, no connection to real world</p></td><td align="left"><p>Mostly theory, limited validation</p></td><td align="left"><p>First principles validated by real data (e.g., IAMs)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Mostly empirical, some first principles</p></td><td align="left"><p>Pure empirical (e.g., econometric)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Origins</p></td><td align="left"><p>Physical science model</p></td><td align="left"><p>Ecological or engineering costing</p></td><td align="left"><p>IAMs</p></td><td align="left"><p>Mainstream economics</p></td><td align="left"><p>Behavioral economics/social sciences</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Mechanism</p></td><td align="left"><p>Simulation (model has to “run”)</p></td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Optimization</p></td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Analysis (i.e., statistical modeling)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></app><app id="App345" specific-use="web-only"><sec id="Sec320"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" xlink:title="Electronic supplementary material"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41247_2020_69_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electronic supplementary material 1 (XLSX 291 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par30">Specialty journals are defined as journals where over 50% of their articles use the same major subject code (Kelly and Bruestle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par34">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, bioeconomic research articles were included as BPE.
