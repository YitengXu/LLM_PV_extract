These cells remain reliant on the so-called chloride activation step in order to achieve high conversion efficiencies. Here, by comparison of effective and ineffective chloride treatments, we show the main role of the chloride process to be the modification of grain boundaries through chlorine accumulation, which leads an increase in the carrier lifetime. It is also demonstrated that while improvements in fill factor and short circuit current may be achieved through use of the ineffective chlorides, or indeed simple air annealing, voltage improvement is linked directly to chlorine incorporation at the grain boundaries. This suggests that focus on improved or more controlled grain boundary treatments may provide a route to achieving higher cell voltages and thus efficiencies.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">High performance CdTe thin film solar cells typically require a chloride activation treatment.

To achieve such high efficiencies in CdTe solar cells the dominant process step remains the chloride ‘activation’ treatment, wherein chlorine is diffused into the CdTe layer by annealing after exposure to CdCl<sub>2</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Without such treatment, the cell efficiency is typically &lt;5%. Despite the level of technological advancement CdTe cells have now reached, the chloride activation process is still not fully understood. The traditional approach to investigating the impact of the chloride treatment has been to compare CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated and -untreated devices and to analyse the metallurgical and electrical changes. There are many papers that follow this approach and while it is not without merit, it is also inherently limited. Such a wide array of changes occur during treatment; p-type doping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, grain recrystallization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, intermixing between the CdTe/CdS layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, junction formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, modification of grain boundary carrier collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; that comparison with as-grown (that is, untreated) devices, which are always low performance, makes it difficult to isolate the key changes. Our previous development of the MgCl<sub>2</sub> treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> allows us now to take a different approach: we are able to compare two chloride treatments that we know to yield high efficiency, namely CdCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>, with two which yield some performance improvements but not to the same extent, these being NaCl and KCl, as well as untreated devices. This allows us to develop a more detailed understanding of exactly why compounds such as MgCl<sub>2</sub> are effective, whereas compounds such as NaCl are not. Comparisons are also able to be made with air annealing, but use of the ineffective chlorides offers an important like-for-like comparison where post-growth processing conditions are kept as similar as possible. By making these comparisons it allows us to separate the different impacts the chloride treatment has and to identify the key roles that the chlorine has in isolation from the effects of annealing.</p><p id="Par4">In order to study the impact of the chloride treatment in isolation as much as possible, we have sought to minimize the influence of other secondary dopant species oxygen and copper. For the highest efficiencies to be achieved, we would typically include an oxidized nanostructured CdS layer (CdS:O) and in-diffuse copper into the CdTe back surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Both of these are known to improve performance, but are liable to mask the impact of the chloride treatment and were thus removed from the cell fabrication process. As a result, peak cell efficiencies are lower than the maxima achievable, however, their removal affords a cleaner comparison of the chloride treatments. The aim of this work is placed on comparative analysis rather than peak efficiency.</p><p id="Par5">This work reports comparative in-depth materials and device characterization of CdTe solar cells with these different treatments. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that effective chloride treatments improve the cell <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> via a mechanism of chlorine incorporation at the grain boundaries, which increases the minority carrier lifetime and improves the junction carrier transport. This work presents a comprehensive comparative study of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (as well as NaCl and KCl)-treated CdTe solar cells with the more standard CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell performance for varied annealing conditions</title><p id="Par6">We have previously reported on the variation in optimized device efficiency resulting from various chloride treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For reference, efficiency data is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="Par7">To summarize, all chloride treatments tested generate some increase in performance in comparison to the as-grown (untreated) sample but CdCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> treatments produce markedly higher efficiencies than the others. In terms of device performance, we consider these two treatments to be essentially equivalent. However, since NaCl and KCl treatments impart some improvement to device performance, it is tempting to say that they are all ‘effective’ to an extent. Further and more in-depth comparison of the change in individual device performance parameters from current-voltage (<italic>JV</italic>) analysis for these different treatments as a function of annealing conditions suggests differently though.</p><p id="Par8"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows average efficiency and open circuit voltage values (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) determined for cells treated with either MgCl<sub>2</sub>, an effective treatment, or NaCl, an ineffective treatment. Each point represents the average for a cell plate with nine contacts. For each treatment, the annealing step for an individual cell plate was varied in the ranges 410–450 °C and 20–60 min, with 0 min being the equivalent as-grown (untreated) cell performance. For an untreated cell, the peak efficiency is 2.9% but with NaCl treatment this increases to a peak of 7.4%. All the performance gain is, however, via short circuit current (<italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>) and fill factor increases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>) compared with their as-grown levels. As <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> demonstrates, the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> shows a negligible increase, having a maximum of 670 mV for the as-grown samples and a peak of only 680 mV for the NaCl devices under any treatment condition. Indeed for a number of NaCl treatment conditions, the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> is in fact decreased, particularly for treatment at 450 °C. In contrast, the MgCl<sub>2</sub>-treated cells show a strong <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> improvement to &gt;820 mV associated with the large efficiency increase. It is this voltage increase rather than increases in fill factor or <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> that distinguishes ‘effective’ and ‘ineffective’ chloride treatments. Hence the effective treatments, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub>, are capable of increasing the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> to levels in excess of 800 mV, while ineffective treatments studied (that is, NaCl, KCl) do not exceed 700 mV irrespective of treatment conditions and indeed often lead to an active reduction in the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>. Following these observations, it is important to establish two factors: why these ineffective treatments fail to generate a <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> improvement and the mechanism by which the effective treatments do improve the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Cell performance for various MgCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl treatment conditions.</title><p>Variation in average performance parameters extracted from <italic>JV</italic> data for MgCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl treatments performed for a range of treatment times and temperatures 410 °C (red), 430 °C (orange) and 450 °C (yellow).

Here we compare five samples: as-grown, MgCl<sub>2</sub>-treated (‘effective’), CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated (‘effective’), NaCl-treated (‘ineffective’) and KCl-treated (‘ineffective’) cells. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the SIMS chlorine profiles for the four samples with the position being normalized such that 0 is the ZnO/CdS interface (determined from sulfur profiles) and 1 is the CdTe back surface with the CdTe thickness being ∼4 μm for all cells. The SIMS profiles were obtained from all of the samples using identical instrumental conditions. Hence the measured signal in counts is directly proportional to the elemental concentration is all cases, and direct comparison of the relative chlorine concentration and relative distribution are possible. From the profiles it is clearly seen that annealing in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub> has led to an increase in the chlorine content of the cell of approximately two orders of magnitude compared with the background levels in the as-grown device. There is also an increase in the chlorine counts within the CdS compared with the CdTe, as is often observed for CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This is at least in part due to the change in matrix upon sputtering from the CdTe into the CdS: the sputter yield of chlorine from the two materials is different and this acts to increase the count rate from CdS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> rather than indicating a genuine increase in concentration. In contrast, both the NaCl and KCl treatments give only a minor increase in the chlorine concentration, and even then this is confined to the CdTe nearest to the diffusion surface—deeper in the CdTe, the chloride level does not rise above its background value. This is strongly indicative that the poor performance of these treatments results from an inability of NaCl and KCl to effectively introduce chlorine into the CdTe, in contrast to the case for CdCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> treatments, possibly due to the higher dissociation energies of the compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In essence, NaCl and KCl treatments have improved the cell performance over as-grown devices in spite of little chlorine being incorporated. However, when one considers that similar increases in <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> and fill factor to those obtained from NaCl and KCl treatment have previously been obtained by simple thermal treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (that is, with no chloride present) the result is less surprising. Indeed direct comparison with air annealed cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) shows a similar response to annealing conditions as for that with the ineffective chlorides present. Utilizing the same treatment ranges (410–450 °C, 20–60 min) gives similar increases in <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> and fill factor but again the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> is never increased from the as-grown level. There are, however, a number of differences between the ineffective treatments and air annealing: X-ray diffraction analysis shows NaCl treatment causes an increase in &lt;111&gt; preferred orientation, while other treatments generate a decrease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; MnCl<sub>2</sub> and KCl give efficiency levels well below those achievable with air annealing with a pronounced decrease in <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> compared with as-grown devices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). However, as the ineffective treatments fail to incorporate significant amounts of chlorine into the CdTe we may draw some parallels with air annealing.

There is clearly no evidence of any strong chlorine accumulation at the CdS interfaces or indeed for any magnesium accumulation at them and overall any magnesium content appears to be below the detection threshold for EELS either at the interface or grain boundaries. Only Cu shows any accumulation at the interface, with this presumed to have come from impurities in the gold back contact. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> shows a higher resolution image of a single CdTe grain boundary with the corresponding quantitative line scans of Cl, Cd and Te content across the boundary shown below.

This matches the finding for CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and we may, therefore, infer a generalized mechanism, namely that effective chloride treatments lead to chlorine segregation at the CdTe grain boundaries. This in turn lead to performance improvement through modification of the electrical state of the boundaries themselves, that is, the grain boundaries are in some way electrically passivated.

Determination of accurate carrier lifetime values for CdTe can often be problematic, however, owing to enhanced surface recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This may be overcome by techniques such as two photon excitation measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but here we instead employ two different single photon measurement protocols: one where excitation occurs through the glass, called ‘front surface’; and one where illumination occurs at the free CdTe back surface. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows both front and back surface TRPL measurements from a 10 μW 760 nm excitation (5 μm diameter spot) for (a) MgCl<sub>2</sub>, (b) CdCl<sub>2</sub>, (c) NaCl and (d) KCl-treated cells, while the average carrier lifetime values extracted are given in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> (the same decay curves are plotted in log scale in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for reference). For back surface measurements, the minority-carrier lifetimes are, as expected, dominated by surface recombination. Hence the lifetimes for all chlorides do not deviate from the as-grown value, 0.24 ns, by more than the experimental error. Back surface measurement is, therefore, considered to yield surface-dominated lifetime values that are not representative of the bulk carrier lifetime. In the case of front surface measurements, however, there is a far greater variation in the determined lifetime values. For the as-grown sample the lifetime is 0.30±0.04 ns but following successful chloride treatments, using CdCl<sub>2</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub>, this lifetime is increased to &gt;1.6 ns, which correlates with the increased in <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> seen in these cells (&gt;0.8 V from 0.650 V).

It has been suggested that apparent shifts in junction position observed by EBIC may potentially result from high-injection beam conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (that is, where the injected electron density vastly exceeds the materials doping density). In these instances the junction is, to an extent, deactivated and collection is instead controlled by the back contact field, with the peak of EBIC collection, therefore, occurring away from the interface and close to the back contact. For the measurements reported here, there is no evidence of high injection effects as collection still occurred comparatively close to the CdS/CdTe interface. The shift in junction position for the as-grown sample can additionally be corroborated via both external quantum efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), which shows characteristic buried junction behaviour, and capacitance voltage profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM815">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), which shows the junction position deeper into the CdTe.

Trap assisted transport mechanisms are commonly observed in CdTe solar cells due to a high degree lattice mismatch between CdS/CdTe layers, leading to the formation of interfacial defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

The improvement in junction quality, for MgCl<sub>2</sub> andCdCl<sub>2</sub> treatments seems likely to be due a combination of chlorine incorporation at grain boundaries and reduced strain at the CdS/CdTe interface. For NaCl and KCl processing any changes occur primarily as a results of thermal annealing and thus reduced strain, due to the lack of chlorine incorporation detected by SIMS. Hence, it seems likely that for these devices carrier transport at the junction is dominated by recombination at defect states and that the chloride process has a significant role in reducing this recombination. Due to the preferential incorporation of chlorine at the grain boundaries detected by EELS analysis, it would appear these defect sites primarily reside at the grain boundaries. For treatments where chlorine is inadequately incorporated we see a slight reduction in the recombination current, but that there is still significant recombination in the near interface region due to the higher grain boundary population in this region. Hence, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub> are seen to create higher quality junctions than the other chlorides due to effective passivation of these defect states. The <italic>JVT</italic> analysis is in good agreement with EBIC position being shifted deeper into the junction for cells with higher recombination that is, recombination at the near interface has forced the EBIC observed junction deeper into the material.

Device performance may be improved through increases in <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> and fill factor when little or no chloride is contributed to the cell as a result of annealing. This serves to partially reduce recombination in the near interface region and move the junction towards the CdS interface. The key role of chlorine within the cells is to increase <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> through passivation of the CdTe grain boundaries and thereby generate a subsequent increase in the carrier lifetime. Without this the cell <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> does not improve, a finding which is of relevance to other thin film technologies such as CZTS and CIGS, which have similar grain structure and similarly limited device <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> relative to their theoretical maximum. These results indicate that the key route to improving the cell open circuit voltage, the performance-limiting factor for CdTe solar cells, could, therefore, be through focussing on improving the grain boundary passivation. This may potentially be achieved by separating the annealing and chloride in-diffusion steps that is, by air annealing first followed by a separate chlorine in-diffusion step. In the present methodology, two processes are being combined, but by first annealing the solar cell and then attempting grain boundary passivation separately, the in-diffusion of chlorine may be more accurately optimized or even replaced by an alternative. It may be that MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub> are effective simply because they dissociate chlorine in the correct temperature range for annealing. If the annealing step can be separated lower temperature or more controllable chlorine processing may be possible. By demonstrating that both MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub> are simply sources of chlorine in-diffusion rather than the compounds themselves being in some way essential, we hope this may inform development of additional non-toxic chloride activation routes and enable industrial fabrication processes to move away from their reliance on hazardous CdCl<sub>2</sub> process. Industrial manufacturers are often naturally conservative with regards to changing their processes, but a more developed understanding of the activation mechanism will hopefully help provide the confidence to accept a more environmentally safe procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cell deposition and processing</title><p id="Par21">All solar cells were deposited in the superstrate geometry using SnO<sub>2</sub>:F (FTO) coated soda-lime TEC glass, supplied by NSG Ltd.

The reverse saturation current, <italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub>, is determined from the <italic>y</italic>axis intercept. From the response of the <italic>A, J</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>n</italic> to temperature the dominant mechanism may be inferred.</p><p id="Par32">For multi-step tunnelling dominated carrier transport, whereby carriers recombine via a staircase of trapping states distributed throughout the energy gap, the current density passing through the junction under forward bias obeys the following relationship:<disp-formula id="Equ3"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13231_Equ3_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par33">Hence, for junctions where multi-step tunnelling dominates <italic>A</italic> should be temperature independent while ln<italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub> should show an inverse linear temperature dependence. For a multi-step tunnelling regime, we also expect that <italic>n</italic> should decrease for increasing temperature while for some other transport mechanisms (for example, SRH) it should be temperature independent. For example as-grown and KCl devices examined show some deviation from this linear relationship at low temperature (&lt;250 K), however, this is most likely caused by the effect of particularly high parasitic resistances present in these devices. This may be confirmed by the temperature dependence of the ideality factor, which decreases with increasing temperature for carrier transport dominated by multi-step tunnelling.</p><p id="Par34">In the case of multi-step tunnelling, it is possible to determine the number of tunnelling steps (<italic>R</italic>) for carriers traversing the depletion region from the value of <italic>A</italic> by using the following equation:<disp-formula id="Equ4"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13231_Equ4_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par35">where,<disp-formula id="Equ5"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13231_Equ5_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ6"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13231_Equ6_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par36">and <italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub> is the electron effective mass, <italic>ɛ</italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>ɛ</italic><sub>p</sub> are the dielectric constants of the n- and the p-side of the junction, respectively. <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>N</italic><sub>D</sub> are the acceptor and donor doping concentrations, respectively. A reduction in the number of tunnelling steps is generally considered to reflect a reduction in the number of interface states and an improvement in the junction quality. Equations (4, 5, 6) were used, in conjunction with carrier concentrations extracted from capacitance-voltage measurements, to calculate the number of tunnelling steps required for the carriers to pass through the depletion region. It is well known that the doping concentration of CdS is a few orders of magnitude higher than that for CdTe and thus the approximation <italic>K</italic>≈1 (see equation (6)) is used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. By using the values of CdTe doping concentration, the parameter <italic>α</italic> is calculated from equation (5) (using the typical values of the electron effective mass and the dielectric constants of CdTe). Finally, substituting these values in equation (4) yields the number of tunnelling steps <italic>R</italic>. Note that the parameter <italic>A</italic> is supposed to be constant throughout the whole range of <italic>T</italic>. However, due to its temperature variation, the value at room temperature was used in the calculation for all samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par37">The data which supports the findings of this work is available through the University of Liverpool RDM DataStore or from the author by request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional information</title><p id="Par38"><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Major, J.
