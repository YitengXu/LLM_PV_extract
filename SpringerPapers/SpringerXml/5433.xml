However, because the larvae of TBPs live inside the trunk and are well concealed, prevention and control are difficult. The lack of effective control methods leads to the death of many trees in forests. In this study, a novel nanopesticide featuring high bioactivity and slow-release properties was developed to control TBPs. Thiacloprid (THI), which is commonly used to control <italic>Coleoptera</italic> species, was used as a model pesticide.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The oleophobic properties of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were exploited to encapsulate the hydrophobic pesticide THI by self-assembly, and the size of the obtained nanoparticles, THI@BSA·NPs, was approximately 23 nm. The loading efficiency reached 70.4%, and THI@BSA·NPs could be released continuously for over 15 days, with the cumulative release reaching 93.5%. The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled nanoparticles were evenly distributed in the digestive tract and body surface of a typical TBPs, <italic>M. alternatus</italic>, and the stomach and contact toxicities increased by 33.7% and 25.9%, respectively, compared with those of free THI. Furthermore, the results showed that the transport efficiency of THI@BSA·NPs was highest at a concentration of 50 μg/mL, and the THI@BSA·NPs content in the trunk, from to lower to higher layers, was 8.8, 8.2, 7.6, and 5.8 μg/g. At the same time, THI@BSA·NPs also exhibited high transport efficiency in dead trees.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The transport efficiency and toxicity of the active ingredients are the key factors for the control of TBPs.

The larvae of TBPs generally live inside the branches and trunkes of trees, affecting nutrient and water transport and even causing the trees to be riddled with holes, leading eventually to tree death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Importantly, some TBPs can also spread plant diseases; for example, <italic>Monochamus alternatus</italic> is a quarantine pest and an important insect vector of the devastating forestry disease, pine wilt disease, known as a cancer or plague of pine trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Pine wilt disease harms major species of <italic>Pinus,</italic> such as Scots pine (<italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), black pine (<italic>P. thunbergii</italic>), and Japanese red pine (<italic>P. densiflora</italic>), in East Asia, Europe, and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since pine wilt disease was introduced into China in 1982, billions of pine trees have been infected and have died, causing direct economic losses of hundreds of billions yuan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, because TBPs are well concealed and live inside the branches and trunks, the use of traditional control methods is challenging; moreover, treatment of plague wood in high-altitude areas also leads to problems in forest protection. Currently, research is being conducted on the injection of pesticides into trees to control TBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but the effect is not ideal; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient solution.</p><p id="Par5">Nanotechnology is an emerging technology, and due to its good biocompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], moderate delivery efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and outstanding sustained release performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and stability, it has been widely applied in energy conversion and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], microelectronics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], precision biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], environmental pollution remediation, the catalyst industry and membrane engineering. In particular, multifunctional nanotechnologies, such as nanosensing systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], gene targeting, nanooptics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], precise and intelligent controlled release, and biological detection, have brought vitality to many fields. In particular, it should be pointed out that nanotechnologies are being developed for application in agriculture and forestry, and related reports are available. Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] used lignin, a biomaterial, to encapsulate avermectin to prevent avermectin from undergoing photodegradation. The encapsulation efficiency value reached 63%, and the half-life of avermectin under UV irradiation was prolonged by 7.5 times compared to that of uncoated avermectin. Liang reported that when prochloraz was encapsulated within the pores of mesoporous silica nanoparticles, the loading efficiency reached 25.4%, and the toxicity of the nanoparticles toward zebrafish decreased more than sixfold compared with that of prochloraz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To solve the problem of pest resistance to Bt toxins, Zheng developed a nanoscale star polymer as a carrier for the pesticide Bt toxin Cry1Ab. This nanocarrier could effectively deliver Bt toxin to kill Bt-resistant pests. The toxicity toward Bt-resistant pests was significantly improved. The survival ratios of the 0.1 mg, 1 mg and 10 μg groups were reduced to 66.7%. 53.3% and 25.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, there are very few reports of the use of nanotechnology in forestry pest control, especially given the urgent need to develop new pesticide loading technologies to effectively control the severe economic losses caused by TBPs.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, using a polymer biomaterial with excellent biocompatibility, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was used as a pesticide carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A high-loading-efficiency BSA nanopesticide with high bioactivity was developed through self-assembly to control TBPs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thiacloprid (THI) ((3-((6-chloro-3-pyridyl) methyl)-1,3-thiazoline-2-ylidene) cyanamide) is a kind of neonicotinoid insecticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] that is mainly used in the control of TBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; therefore, THI was selected as the model pesticide in this study. First, a saturated BSA solution was added dropwise into THI acetonitrile solution and stirred at high speed to prepare THI bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (THI@BSA·NPs) by self-assembly. The size distribution and structure of THI@BSA·NPs were examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The loading efficiency of THI@BSA·NPs was determined with different THI concentrations. The release behavior was also studied. Furthermore, the typical TBP and important vector insect of pine wilt disease, Monochamus alternatus, was chosen as the test insect, and the contact toxicity and stomach toxicity of THI@BSA·NPs to the 3rd instar larvae were compared. Then, by utilizing fluorescent staining technology, FITC was used to label BSA to synthesize fluorescent THI@BSA@FITC·NPs to explore the mechanisms of stomach toxicity and contact toxicity. Finally, by using pine trees as research objects, a simple comparison of the transport efficiency of THI@BSA·NPs in live trees was performed. Moreover, to address plague wood in high-altitude areas, THI@BSA·NPs application was considered to reduce the cost of disposal and the risk of infection. The transport efficiency of THI@ BSA·NPs in dead tree trunks was also studied.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustration of the THI@BSA·NPs, it can encapsulate the hydrophobic drug THI and is labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate for pest control, for the transport of nanoparticles in the trunk of pine tree, and the contact and stomach toxicity mechanism.

Even if BSA is a biological material, safety tests are still very necessary. Before the study, the safety assessment of BSA to trees was conducted. Different concentrations of BSA solutions were injected into the pine trees, and the health of the pine trees was investigated after 60 days.

The surface of the nanoparticles was smooth, and no holes were formed. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, the average particle size was approximately 23 nm, and the particle size distribution showed a single peak, indicating that the particle size distribution of THI@BSA·NPs was concentrated and that no other by-product had been produced.

The temperature and pH selected in this study represented the temperature and acid–base range under natural conditions, and the physiological conditions of MA. At a pH of 7.0, the cumulative release durations were over 15 d at 15 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C. The trends of the three release curves were basically the same, and the entire release process was stable. No sudden release occurred, and the cumulative release amounts under the three temperature conditions were approximately 93%. As the temperature increased, the release rate of THI@BSA·NPs increased to a certain extent, but the cumulative release amounts under the three temperature conditions were similar. The above results indicated that temperature conditions could affect only the release rate of THI@BSA·NPs, and did not affect the cumulative release of THI from THI@BSA·NPs. Next, at 25 °C., the release behaviors of THI@BSA·NPs were investigated in PBS at pH 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0. Under these three pH conditions, the cumulative release durations of THI@BSA·NPs were over 10 days. The pH 5.0 treatment group had the highest cumulative release (97.9%), followed by the pH 9.0 treatment group (96.8%), and the lowest cumulative release (93.4%) was observed for the pH 7.0 treatment group. Under the three pH conditions, the trends of the three release curves were also the same, and the release process was relatively stable; no sudden release occurred. These results showed that the appropriate acid–base conditions would promote the release of THI and increase the cumulative release amount. This may be related to the destruction of the structure of the protein under acid–base conditions, as more THI was released from the incomplete shell structure.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>THI@BSA·NPs release curves <bold>a</bold> with different temperature, <bold>b</bold> pH, and <bold>c</bold> the THI@M release curves</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2020_725_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">Finally, the release behavior of THI@M was investigated under the same conditions (25 °C, pH 7.0).

The results suggested that the toxicity of THI@BSA·NPs at 24 and 48 h was significantly higher than that of THI in the two insecticidal modes. In the stomach toxicity experiment, the larvae were acclimated to drilling into artificial feed, and some active ingredients came in contact with the larval surface. This behavior explained that the stomach toxicity in this study included a certain contact toxicity, which was one of the reasons why the stomach toxicity was much higher than the contact toxicity. These results were consistent with previous research results. Kah summarized previous research results and found that in 21 related reports, the toxicity of nanopesticides was 2.0 times higher than that of pure active ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and nanocarriers could improve the insecticidal activity of active ingredients on multiple levels.

Due to the nanoscale particle size and large specific surface area of nanopesticide formulations, they could improve the coverage of, adhesion to and permeation into pests compared with conventional formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, the distribution of the fluorescence of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs on the surface of the larvae and its coverage were examined to understand the performance of THI@BSA·NPs on the surface of the larvae (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, there was some fluorescence distributed in the head, body and tail. Compared with the heads and tails of the larvae, the fluorescence distribution in the bodies was more uniform, and the fluorescence intensity was stronger. This might be related to the greater activity of the larval head and tail, compared with the body; the swing range of the tail and the head is large, causing the attached THI@BSA@FITC·NPs to fall off. In addition, the fluorescence was more concentrated on the internodes and small protrusions on the surface of the larvae, indicating that the nanoformulation had a stronger ability to adhere to these uneven structures than to the smooth surface, and more THI@BSA@FITC·NPs remained by the holes on the internodes. In addition, fluorescence distribution was observed on each of the small rosary warts that made up the step blisters (ambulatory ampullae) for crawling on the larval abdomen. As the larvae crawl mainly by using the step blisters (ambulatory ampullae) of the abdomen, this part had a long contact duration with the THI@BSA@FITC·NPs, indicating that the longer the contact duration is, the stronger the adhesion of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs on the larval surface. These phenomena proved that, as a nanopesticide delivery system, THI@BSA·NPs exhibited good coverage and adhesion to pests, which could allow the active ingredients to come in contact with and stay on the larval surface.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> The fluorescent image of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs, the distribution of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs on the larval body side (<bold>b1</bold>), the abdomen (<bold>b2</bold>), and the head (<bold>b3</bold>), body (<bold>b4</bold>), tail (<bold>b5</bold>), (<bold>c1</bold>–<bold>c4)</bold> the valve changed with treatment time, (<bold>d1</bold>–<bold>d3</bold>) the microscopic images of larval cross section, (<bold>d4</bold>–<bold>d6</bold>) the fluorescent distribution of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs on larval cross section</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2020_725_Fig5_HTML.jpg" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">It is important to study how nanoparticles penetrate the epidermal structure of pests to better understand the mechanism underlying the increase in contact toxicity. Coomassie brilliant blue-stained THI@BSA·NPs were used to explore the main mechanism by which the nanoparticles penetrated the epidermal structure into the larvae. One phenomenon caught our attention (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c) during analysis of the staining results. The longer the larvae were exposed to the stained THI@BSA·NPs, the more intensely the valve was stained on both sides of the larval body, indicating that an increasing number of THI@BSA·NPs remained at the valve. The valve is constantly opened or closed when the larvae breathe, and the nanoparticles could easily pass through the valve and enter the body. Perhaps the nanoparticles could penetrate the epidermal structure or interstitial membrane to directly enter the larvae to exert insecticidal activity; however, the valve channels were needed when a large number of nanoparticles entered the body.</p><p id="Par29">Finally, whether THI@BSA·NPs could successfully enter the larvae still needed to be verified. THI@BSA@FITC·NPs were used to treat the larval surface, and then, the treated larvae were dissected to obtain transverse sections and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). It could be seen that fluorescence was uniformly distributed on the entire cross-section. A mass of dispersed AVM@BSA@FITC·NPs was clearly observed, indicating that the nanoparticles could enter the larvae through the epidermal structure and move further into the center of the larval body to deliver the AVM to the target site. The entire epidermal structure emitted bright fluorescence, indicating that a large number of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs were enriched in the surface layer and had not yet entered the larvae. These results were also verified in our previous toxicity bioassay. Therefore, THI@BSA·NPs exhibited higher contact toxicity than THI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Stomach toxicity</title><p id="Par30">The efficiency of transport and conduction could be enhanced significantly, and the insecticidal toxicity could be accelerated, because the small particle size pf the nanoparticles improved the dispersal and permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, the mechanism for the acceleration of stomach toxicity could be revealed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) by comparing the transport efficiencies of THI@BSA·NPs and THI@M in the body. The total THI content detected in the THI@M treatment group was much smaller than that in the THI@BSA·NP treatment group. After 24 h of treatment, the THI levels in the head, body and tail of the THI@M treatment group were 0.11, 0.43, and 0.09 mg, respectively, and the total THI content was 0.63 mg. The THI levels in the head, body and tail of the THI@BSA·NP treatment group were 0.09, 0.62 and 0.15 mg, respectively, and the total THI content was 0.86 mg. After 48 h of treatment, the THI content in each treatment group increased, and the distribution trend was basically the same. In THI@BSA·NPs treatment, the content of THI in body and tail were 46.5% and 66.7% higher than that in THI@M, respectively, and in head was 22.2% lower than that in THI@M. The content of active ingredients detected in body and tail were higher in THI@BSA·NPs treatment, but detected in head was lower, indicating that more active ingredients were transported to farther locations. In the same treatment duration, in the THI@BSA·NP treatment group, more active ingredients were distributed in the body and tail; with prolongation of treatment duration, more THI was detected in the body and tail. This result suggests that THI@BSA·NPs could significantly increase the transport efficiency of active ingredients due to the size of the nanoparticles and the hydrophilicity of BSA itself. The midgut and hindgut, the major digestive and absorption systems of larvae, are concentrated in the middle and rear parts of the larvae. The higher the transport efficiency is, the greater the amount of active ingredients that could be absorbed, further improving the bioactivity of THI.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Total content and proportion distribution of THI inside larvae, <bold>b1–b3</bold> the microscopic images of larval digestive system, <bold>b4</bold>–<bold>b6</bold> the fluorescent distribution of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs on larval digestive system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2020_725_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par31">The larvae were fed artificial feed mixed with THI@BSA@FITC·NPs, and then, the treated larvae were collected and dissected to obtain intestinal tissue sections.

Fluorescence distribution was also observed in the intestinal tissues, indicating that under oral feeding, THI@BSA@FITC·NPs had high transport efficiency inside larvae and could be smoothly transported to intestinal tissues. The villi inside the intestinal wall could clearly be seen, and the fluorescence intensity inside the intestinal wall was the strongest due to the adhesion of THI@BSA@FITC·NPs to these villi. Fluorescence was also observed on the fat particles outside the intestine, indicating that the intestine effectively absorbed THI@BSA@FITC·NPs and quickly converted them into nutrients. Shen's research showed that nanocarriers could efficiently penetrate insect midgut cells to reach the target site, thereby improving activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Therefore, at the end of this study, the transport efficiencies of THI@M and THI@BSA·NPs in the trunk were compared (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As shown in the figure, the transport efficiency of THI@BSA·NPs was significantly higher than that of THI@M at the same concentration. The distribution of THI in the THI@BSA·NP treatment group was more even than that of THI@M; when the concentration was 50 mg/mL, the proportions of the four layers were 28.94%, 26.97%, 25.00% and 19.09% in the THI@BSA·NP treatment group and 45.41%, 26.97%, 14.50%, and 9.84% in the THI@M treatment group. On the other hand, as the concentration decreased, the transport efficiencies of the THI@BSA·NP treatment group and the THI@M treatment group improved. In the THI@M treatment group, the THI levels in layer 4 were 1.0, 1.6 and 3.0 mg/g when the concentrations were 200, 100, and 50 mg/mL, respectively, and in the THI@BSA·NP treatment group, the levels were 3.4, 4.6, and 5.8 mg/g, respectively. This showed that with decreasing concentration, greater amounts of active ingredients could be transported farther away, and the migration distance could be effectively increased. THI@BSA·NPs are nanosized particles with high dispersibility and a long migration distance in water, and all these features would allow the active ingredients reach the site where the target organism resides more efficiently, improving the application efficiency and reducing the pesticide application amount. In applications, the migration distance in the trunk could be increased by appropriately diluting the particles without affecting the control effect of THI to achieve the maximum performance.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Total content and proportion distribution of THI in the trunk of alive pine tree</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2020_725_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par33">THI@BSA·NPs were considered for treatment of diseased wood to reduce the cost of transporting the diseased wood in high-altitude areas to resettlement sites. The transport efficiencies of different concentrations and different formulations were also studied, and the distribution of nanoparticles in the trunks of dead trees was explored. The results, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, were the same as those for live trees. When the concentration was 200 μg/mL, the THI content in the layers was 89.4, 96.5, 101.7, 62.6 and 29.7 μg/g, and the corresponding values in the THI@M group were 126.0, 112.9, 73.9, 33.6, 21.9 μg/g. In THI@BSA·NPs, the proportions of layer 1 to layer 5 were 23.5%, 25.4%, 26.8%, 16.5% and 7.8% respectively under 50 μg/L, and the proportions were 34.2%, 30.6%, 20.1%, 9.1% and 5.9% respectively, the distribution of THI@BSA·NPs in the trunks of dead trees was more even. Obviously, driven by the same concentration and the same amount of water, the migration distance of THI@BSA·NPs was longer, and the THI concentration detected at farther layer was higher, indicating that THI@BSA·NPs has a higher transport efficiency. On the other hand, when the content of active ingredients were same, the lower the concentration was, the more uniform the distribution.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Total content and proportion distribution of THI in the trunk of dead pine tree</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2020_725_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par34">Generally speaking, the smaller the particle size of the nanoparticles, the larger the specific surface area and the higher the loading efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The size of the nanoparticles we prepared was 23 nm, which was less than 100 nm. Compared with the microcapsules, the size was smaller, so the loading efficiency was higher. On the other hand, the particle size of 23 nm allowed nanoparticles to easily pass through the conducting tissue of trees, and the high transport efficiency of THI @ BSA·NPs enables the active ingredients to reach the survival sites of the trunk-boring pests more efficiently. At the same time, smaller particle size could effectively improve the coverage, adhesion and permeability on pests of pesticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], so the nanoparticles could efficiently penetrate the epidermal structure to improve contact toxicity. The high transport efficiency inside larvae allowed the active ingredients to reach the site of action efficiently and exert insecticidal toxicity. The results of transport efficiency also verified this conclusion. Finally, the great slow-release performance enabled THI@BSA·NPs to control trunk-boring pests for a long time. Therefore, the nano-pesticide THI@BSA·NPs prepared had great control efficiency on trunk-boring pests. At present, trunk injection is still the main method to control trunk-boring pests with the characteristics of highly targeted and little impact on non-target organisms. However, the control effect is limited by the low transportation efficiency and shorter release period inside trunk. In this study, biological material BSA were used as pesticide carrier for the preparation of THI@BSA·NPs, which has the characteristics of high efficiency and sustained release. The good transport efficiency inside trees ensured that the active ingredients reached the survival site of the target organism. Meanwhile, nanoparticles could enhance the coverage, adhesion, and penetration of active ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], so, compared with traditional formulation, THI@BSA·NPs could effectively improve the stomach toxicity and contact toxicity of THI. Based on the above conclusions, we believe that THI@BSA·NPs has better control efficiency for trunk-boring pests than traditional formulations. Currently, the control of trunk-boring pests is still a difficult problem. The nano-pesticide, THI@BSA·NPs prepared by us, has low cost, easy synthesis, high biocompatibility, and low environmental impact. At the same time, compared with traditional formulations, great slow-release performance and higher control efficiency made THI@BSA·NPs have broad application prospects in the control of trunk-boring pests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">In this study, a nanoparticle with high bioactivity against TBPs was successfully synthesized and verified as having an excellent control effect. THI@BSA·NPs, which are particles with a size of approximately 23 nm and a loading efficiency of up to 70.4%, were stable under different temperatures and pH values and could release THI stably over 15 d, and the cumulative release exceeded 90%. By using various dyeing techniques, nanoparticle distributions and sections were observed. The nanoparticles showed a better distribution range on, adhesion to, and penetration of the larval surface, and at the same time, they exhibited a higher transport efficiency inside larvae, ensuring that the active ingredients were ingested. The contact and stomach toxicities of THI@BSA·NPs increased by 25.9% and 33.7%, respectively, compared with those of THI. Finally, compared to the commonly used formulation in production, THI@BSA·NPs had a higher transport efficiency in live or dead trees and could ensure that the active ingredients reached the target parts. In summary, the THI@BSA·NPs synthesized in this study could effectively control TBPs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the following people for their contributions: Xiaoyu Xu, Chenglin Liu, Tao Chen.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>CZ, SY and SG contributed to conception.
