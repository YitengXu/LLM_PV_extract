Herein, we demonstrated that light radiation, by generating plasmon-based hot electrons and subsequently increasing the reduction rate of Ag<sup>+</sup> in the system, in addition to enhancing the growth rate of nanocubes, causes twinned seeds, which these seeds are then converted into nanorods and right bipyramids. With shorter, higher energy wavelengths, Ag<sup>+</sup> reduction progresses more quickly, resulting in structures with more twin planes. The overlap of the excitation wavelength and the band gap of Ag<sub>2</sub>S clusters formed in the early stages of synthesis accelerates the rate of reaction at low-energy excitation. According to our findings, the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone acts as a photochemical relay to drive the growth of silver nanoparticles. Overall, this work emphasizes the impact of excitation light on polyol synthesis as a technique for generating Ag nanocubes of various sizes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>19203</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_23959.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The unique and remarkable physicochemical properties of noble-metal nanostructures in comparison with their respective bulk materials have led to many researchers being interested in these nanomaterials and exploiting them in a diversity of applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Refinements of this synthetic approach of Ag nanocubes using many additives either individually or simultaneously, such as HCl/NaCl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, NaSH/Na<sub>2</sub>S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and Br<sup>−</sup> ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> for access to well-defined nanocubes, have been described. Also, Xia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> were able to improve this synthesis method by replacing silver precursor from AgNO<sub>3</sub> to CF<sub>3</sub>COOAg. Over the past decade, myriad studies have been conducted to investigate the role of these additives. Indeed, S<sup>2−</sup> species by the formation of Ag<sub>2</sub>S clusters act as heterogeneous nucleant and Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> compounds take part as oxidative etching agents.</p><p id="Par7">More recently, it has been demonstrated that Cl<sup>−</sup> and Br<sup>−</sup> play a role in directing cube shape via thermodynamic control, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent assists in producing Ag nanocubes by kinetic control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Although this method is light sensitive due to the presence of species such as Ag<sub>2</sub>S, AgCl, and Ag nanoparticles, few studies have been conducted to date to investigate the effect of light on polyol reduction methods. After a comprehensive study of the literature, we found just two reports that only investigated the effect of sunlight on these polyol-based systems. They both used protocols that were not reproducible. Ashkarran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, inspected the impact of solar light on this approach, in which the silver precursor is reduced by heated ethylene glycol in the presence of PVP, and a trace amount of Na<sub>2</sub>S. According to Xia’s group results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the reproducibility of this procedure is low, so the results obtained from their work cannot be generalized/validated. This is because aside from light, many parameters may affect the systems that cannot be controlled. In the other work, Im et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> claimed that the light from fluorescent tubes or the sun can affect the reproducibility of synthesis by its impact on the formed AgCl during the reaction. They deduced AgCl photodecomposed to Ag and afterward the Ag atoms sit act as heterogeneous nucleation places therewith yielding irregularly shaped Ag nanoparticles. Recently, Rioux et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> investigated the role of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the polyol synthesis of Ag nanocubes. They discovered that Ag nanocubes are produced even when the polyol process is run under light conditions and without stirring, implying that AgCl is unlikely to serve as a heterogeneous nucleant for Ag nanocube synthesis.</p><p id="Par8">As mentioned previously, the effect of light has not been studied on polyol-based synthetic methods at different irradiation wavelengths. Here, in this paper, we explore how light affects the polyol synthesis of Ag nanocubes during the entire reaction.

After 1 h, 60 µL of 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>S in EG solution was injected. Two minutes after the addition of Na<sub>2</sub>S, 0.5 mL of 3 mM HCl solution was injected into the reaction solution, followed by the addition of 1.25 mL of 20 mg/mL PVP in EG.

After 1.5 h, the growth was stopped by immersing in an ice-water bath. To remove the residual EG and PVP, all of the samples were centrifuged and washed with acetone and DI water. The final product was dispersed in DI water. To investigate the effect of light and excitation wavelength on the polyol synthesis, the reaction solution was irradiated with (1) a 200-W incandescent lamp, (2) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of different excitation wavelengths as the exciting source in three wavelengths 465, 528 and 628 nm with intensities of approximately 0.06, 0.24, and 0.06 W respectively.

Then the reaction was probed over time. The changes in the morphology of Ag nanocubes were monitored by UV–Vis spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows normalized UV−Vis extinction spectra of the obtained Ag nanoparticles during a reaction from 15 to 90 min at certain intervals. According to the literature, the presence of a shoulder peak at about 355 nm indicates the formation of Ag nanocubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. As the reaction progresses, a shoulder peak around 380 nm appears, indicating the growth of corners and edges as well as the transformation of nanocubes from a truncated form to sharp corners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. These two shoulder peaks are observed in the extinction spectra of both conditions, but it should be noted that the 380 nm shoulder peak appears earlier under light than in dark conditions. In addition, more changes in the position of the main LSPR peak relative to time, under light irradiation conditions, indicate faster growth kinetics under light conditions (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>UV–Vis spectra of Ag nanoparticles aliquots collected at different reaction times in different light condition (<bold>a</bold>) dark, (<bold>b</bold>) room light, (<bold>c</bold>) 200-W incandescent lamp.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_23959_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">Therefore, it can be concluded that by changing the light intensity, we can synthesize Ag nanocubes of different sizes. Xia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> used diethylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol to achieve smaller nanocubes, while in our method, by removing light from the system, the reduction rate of the reaction can be reduced and small nanocubes can be easily synthesized. On the other hand, up to now, many seed-mediated methods have been developed for the synthesis of nanocubes with larger sizes, which seems to be achieved by using excitation light with an intensity and a specific wavelength. To prove this claim, a 200-W incandescent lamp that could provide more light intensity (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>) was used as the light source. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, the λ<sub>max</sub> variations of extinction spectra over time show more changes than the previous two conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). These observations confirm the increase in reaction kinetics in the presence of light (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">In addition, more structural information about nanoparticles can be obtained using these extinction spectra. To achieve this, the obtained spectra were fitted using the Lorentz function. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, 15 min after the addition of CF<sub>3</sub>COOAg, only the dipole plasmon modes of the Ag nanocubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> are present when synthesis is performed under dark conditions, while in another two conditions, in addition to these plasmon modes, there are several others that overlap with the original ones. The peaks at 419 and 505 nm can be related to the presence of pseudo-spherical particles and longitudinal plasmon of silver nanorods, respectively in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>e<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Also, the extinction spectra obtained under the three above conditions were studied at 90 min after the addition of CF<sub>3</sub>COOAg (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1)</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>b, in the dark conditions, only dipolar plasmons related to Ag nanocubes are observed, while in the other two conditions (Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1d, S1f</xref>), in addition to these peaks, there are other peaks that overlap with the main ones.

Since the changes in light intensity are in order of dark &lt; room light &lt; lamp 200 watts, the varying of the edge length of nanocubes changes in the same way (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).

Therefore, to examine the effect of excitation light on the polyol synthesis of Ag nanocubes more rigorously, the synthesis was evaluated at three different wavelengths (465, 528, and 628 nm) with an identical light intensity.

On the other hand, Xia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> showed when the reaction kinetics in seed-based syntheses increases, the two reduction pathways consisting of solution reduction and surface reduction occur simultaneously. This allows homogeneous nucleation to happen in the system which causes the formation of small nanoparticles in the system at the same time as the seeds grow. Consequently, we hypothesize that the presence of these pseudo-spherical particles could be owing to the enhanced rate of reduction in the reaction. According to the literature plasmon-based syntheses of Ag nanoparticles, such as prisms, pyramids, and rods, are critically dependent on both the wavelength of incident light and reduction kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Mirkin et al., showed that at shorter wavelengths, higher energies (400–450 nm), due to a greater rate of Ag<sup>+</sup> reduction, multiply twinned seeds in the reaction solution would be the dominant product.

Zheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> showed that in the presence of incident light (600–750 nm), seeds with a pentagonal twin structure are eventually converted to rods. Since the Ag<sub>2</sub>S clusters formed in the early stages of synthesis are light-sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, the optical band-gap of these clusters was calculated from their absorbance spectrum (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7a</xref>) and found that it has a high spectral overlap with the excitation wavelength at 628 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7b</xref>). Here, it accelerates the reduction rate in the seed formation step and causes multiple twinned seeds to form in the system, eventually growing into nanorods in the presence of red light. It is worth noting that in terms of aspect ratio, the nanorods obtained are larger than those gained in the previous two wavelengths, which may be because, under the conditions of red light, longitudinal plasmons are activated, causing the growth at the tip of the nanorods and the increase of the aspect ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Also, considering the LSPR spectra, it is clear that the edge length changes of nanocubes are less than the other two wavelengths (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>, and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">It was determined that the wavelength and intensity of the incident light affect the synthesis, but the question is, how? The effect of light on nanoparticle synthesis has been researched by several groups.

Therefore, considering that PVP exists in our synthetic system in identical conditions to the ones described above (acidic conditions due to the addition of HCl to the reaction media). It is reasonable to expect it to serve as a hot electron stabilizer. On the other hand, ethylene glycol, which functions as the solvent in the system, can operate as a hot hole scavenger and contribute to the growth kinetics of Ag nanoparticles by oxidizing to glycolaldehyde (reducing agent in our reaction)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>.

It was found that incident light, in combination with polyol synthesis, accelerates the rate of silver reduction and the formation of nanocubes in the polyol system. Ag<sup>+</sup> reduction proceeds more quickly with shorter, higher energy wavelengths, resulting in structures with more twin planes and, following that, nanorods and right bipyramids are formed in the system. It was also demonstrated that at low energy excitation, the rate of Ag<sup>+</sup> reduction is accelerated due to the overlap of the excitation wavelength and the band gap of Ag<sub>2</sub>S clusters generated in the early stages of synthesis, resulting in the presence of nanorods and right bipyramids in the synthesis. According to the open-circuit potential (OCP) results, the surfactant PVP acts as a photochemical relay to drive the growth of anisotropic Ag nanoparticles from Ag seeds generated in the early stages of the polyol system. Overall, this study highlights the influence of incident light on polyol synthesis as a strategy for producing Ag nanocubes in a wide range of sizes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has been supported by grants from the Bu-Ali Sina University Research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>R.G.: conceptualization, methodology, investigation, writing–original draft.
