To address these limitations, efforts have been directed toward developing mathematical and intelligent models. Although mathematical models provide near-optimal solutions, they are time consuming, highly expensive, and demanding. Intelligent standalone models are also limited by their low predictive capability and inability to guarantee global optimal solution for the prediction of cumulative biogas yield for FFV waste. However, hyperparameter optimization of such models is essential to improve the prediction performance for cumulative biogas yield for FFV waste. Therefore, this study applies a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the prediction of cumulative biogas production. Seven (7) input variables, organic loading rate (OLR), volatile solids (VS), pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), temperature, retention time, and reaction volume, were considered with cumulative biogas production as the output. The effect of varying clustering techniques was evaluated. The three (3) clustering techniques evaluated are fuzzy c-means and subtractive clustering and grid partitioning. The hybrid model was evaluated based on some verified statistical performance metrics. Optimal root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and standard deviation error (error STD) of 0.0529, 0.0326,7.6742, and 0.0474, respectively, were reported at the model testing phase for the subtractive clustering technique being the best-performing model. The results confirm the capacity of hybrid evolutionary (genetic) algorithm based on subtractive clustering technique to predict the biogas yield from FFV and serve as an effective tool for the upscaling of anaerobic digestion units as well as in techno-economic studies toward more efficient energy utilization.</p></sec><sec id="ASec1" specific-use="web-only"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4506_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anaerobic digestion</kwd><kwd>Biogas yield</kwd><kwd>Clustering techniques</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary optimization</kwd><kwd>FFV waste</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Johannesburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13399_2023_Article_4506.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The beneficiation of waste for power generation has gained a significant momentum across the globe. Every year, billions of tons of wastes are generated around the world. By 2050, the global community would have generated 3.40 billion tons of garbage annually, reflecting a drastic increase from the current value of 2.01 billion tons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In a United Nations (UN) report, 17% of the global annual food production, estimated at 1.0 billion tons, has been wasted as of 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The breakdown shows that 61%, 26%, and 13% of food waste were from households, food services, and retail, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To add further context, the waste generated in the USA only, which is disposed of yearly, can be valued at $408 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint associated with global food wastage has been estimated at 3.3 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. With the growth in population and food processing industries, the amount of waste is likely to increase. It has also been suggested that waste will increase with industrialization and urbanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Millions of tons of food, fruit, and vegetable (FFV) wastes have been channelled to landfills accounting for nearly 50% of the fruits and vegetables produced globally on yearly basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. FFV waste represents not only product waste along the full value chain but also other associated resources including the land, water, labor, and energy used in the production of such food products. It significantly contributes to climate change since greenhouse gases are emitted during food production and distribution. Landfill or incineration approaches to FFV disposal are not advisable because of fast biodegradability of FFV in the presence of contaminating microbes. Moreover, the methane produced in the landfill may not serve any useful purpose except it is captured and utilized as a clean energy source rather than allowing it to leak into the air or dispersed as waste leading to severe environmental pollution. Food, fruit, and vegetable (FFV) wastes are rich in organic substances making it a good candidate for anaerobic digestion. While the overarching target is to mitigate waste or at least reduce waste generation, its beneficiation for value-added products could be the sustainable solution. When FFV is beneficiated, our climate benefits in two ways: landfill emission is prevented, while the fossil fuel that may have been used for energy generation is reduced or ruled out. FFV as a low-cost waste could be beneficially deployed in anaerobic digestion (AD) for energy application and value-added co-products toward better enhancement of circular economy. It has been traditionally deployed as an effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly technology for transforming liquid or organic waste into biogas and other value-added products such as organic fertilizer. The biogas produced in anaerobic digestion process can be directly converted to electricity and heat.</p><p id="Par5">AD is a complex process involving microbial consortia with numerous metabolic processes and kinetic reactions leading to CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other gases such as H<sub>2</sub>S and NH<sub>3</sub> are also produced in traces depending on feedstock characteristics and operating conditions. The generation of biogas from FFV proceeds in four stages which include hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At the hydrolysis stage, the complex organic compounds such as lipids, protein, and polysaccharides are converted into soluble monomers or oligomers. Further, during acidogenesis, the sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids generated during hydrolysis are deployed to produce organic acids such as acetic, fatty acids, propionic, butyric, hydrogen, and CO<sub>2</sub> via the activities of fermentative anaerobic bacteria. The action of bacteria makes acidogenesis the fastest process in anaerobic digestion. Alcohol and volatile fatty acids are anaerobically oxidized into acetate, H<sub>2</sub>S, and CO<sub>2</sub> during acetogenesis. This process takes place in the presence of hydrogen-producing acetogenic bacteria. At the end of this stage, the methanogens (acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic) covert acetate, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> into a mixture of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. The acetotrophics produce around 70% of methane, while hydrogenotrophic produces more energy that acetate pathway since it is not limited by rate. It has been reported that methane-producing methanogens are very sensitive to environmental changes, but hydrogenotrophic methanogens can provide more resistance to the environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some factors affect the AD process; these include pH, temperature, C:N ratio, organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The microbes are sensitive to pH since each group survive at different ranges. If the partial pressure of hydrogen increases, the methanogenesis phase of the anaerobic process may fail because of the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and reduction in pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Microbes which act during AD are equally sensitive to temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For instance, under mesophilic temperature, the activity and growth rate of bacteria decrease by 50% for each 10 °C drop in temperature. If the temperature is increase up to 37 °C, the time required for digestion process is reduced, up until a point where further increase in temperature leads to reduction in biogas yield. The biogas production reduces when temperatures decreases to 20 °C and production stops entirely at 10 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nutrients are added to a digester to support the process through the provision of necessary bacteria is required for biodegradation. Also, it is required that the proper composition of feed be maintained so as to keep the C:N ratio at the appropriate level, because low C:N ratio may result in ammonium inhibition especially for nitrogen-rich substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Apart from temperature, total solid (TS) and organic loading rate (OLR) are critical to a stable operation of AD process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The loading rate assists in the determination of the amount of FFV feedstock required to be added in a digester on daily basis subject to the size of the digester. Hydraulic retention time measures the time the solids or slurry spend in the digester during the AD process. Depending on the types of substrate and the climatic condition, HRT can go as high as 100 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Apart from the aforementioned operating parameter, several kinetic and stoichiometric parameters are associated with microbial growth and chemical reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, anaerobic digestion is more vulnerable to process instability due to substantial dissimilarity in feedstock composition and unpredictability of microbial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This further complicates the AD process.</p><p id="Par6">Although the FFV are readily available for AD, their degradation process could be very complex because of their characteristics. As a result of the complexity of this process, mathematical prediction is highly challenging, though AD is theoretically well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, the conventional analytical techniques are time consuming, highly expensive, and demanding in term of the equipment. Therefore, there is a need for modelling approaches which can provide dynamic information regarding the AD process condition. Artificial intelligent models are data-driven techniques which consider the physical processes or systems as a black box from input and output measurements. This ensures high predictive capability based on observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. AI can provide more superior techniques compared to theoretical or mathematical approaches for complex systems given multiple parameters and non-linear dependency which influences the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Artificial intelligent (AI) models have been profitably applied in predicting biogas yield due to their ability to generalize and learn complex input-output relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Several AI models have been used to model AD processes, though only few exist for the prediction of biogas yield from FFV waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Kanat and Saral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and Yetilmezsoy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] developed models for the prediction of biogas production from molasses wastewater using ANN. They noted the ability of ANN in determining the interdependence in an AD process without prior awareness of the mathematical principles or governing equations. Good prediction result was obtained bases on statistical metrics. In a study carried out by Neto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], the effects of seven (7) critical operating parameters were evaluated and deployed to predict biogas yield using an artificial neural network (ANN). Before this, most existing studies majorly consider one, two, or three operating factors despite the importance of others in extracting valuable information for the prediction and optimization of the AD processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The major limitation with the deployment of ANN is associated with its inability to guarantee global optimal solution and difficulties in knowledge representation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This is almost unavoidable considering the fundamental black box processing paradigm and several topologies which exist in neural computing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In that case, the prediction of FFV biogas production can benefit from the deployment of a system which combines the advantage of ANN and fuzzy systems with evolutionary algorithms. Fuzzy systems can represent comprehensive linguistic knowledge while reasoning through fuzzy rules, though it does not have the mechanism for parameters tuning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. On another note, neural networks can be trained and tuned from a set of input-output data stream. The combination of fuzzy system and neural network give rise to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). ANFIS is very robust with ability to learn neural networks while modelling the uncertainty, linguistic concepts, and expert knowledge. NFIS model can adapt to variation in system conditions, control noisy data, and quickly model the system with low computation resources and non-linear process structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. ANFIS is a prediction technique used in numerous fields of study in bioenergy exploration and conversion due to its capacity to map input-output inside a solution space so that local optimal values are avoided while considering fuzzy factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While building an ANFIS model, the choice of clustering technique must be thoroughly considered given its impact on the accuracy and precision of the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Clustering methods help in the identification of group where an observation belong; thus, unsuitable clustering approach may reduce the accuracy of the models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The genetic algorithm (GA), as an evolutionary technique, has been extensively used in different fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Its preference over other evolutionary-based techniques has been associated with its ability to deal with complex problems and parallelism. Evolutionary genetic algorithms (GA) are applicable to any optimization problem: stationary or non-stationary, continuous or discontinuous, linear or non-linear, or random with noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. GA optimization method stems from the Darwin Theory of Evolution which focuses on natural selection and survival of the fittest in biological genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The main objective of the approach focuses on reproducing offspring with improved genetic fitness than their progenitors. This principle of evolution is deployed through reproduction, crossover, and mutation. For hyperparameter optimization, the GA technique optimizes the base model hyperparameters according to an objective function within the solution search space until convergence on improved solution is reached. With this prowess, the GA method has been deployed as a hybrid of other intelligent predictive models, leading to an improved prediction accuracy and error minimization via parameter optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A hybrid model comprising ANFIS optimized with GA promises better results by minimizing the curse of dimensionality and internal loss of interpretability of the model when used on large input datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">From the existing studies, hybridization of GA and ANFIS model has been successfully adopted for widespread application in order to improve the prediction and optimization capabilities. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, the use of GA-ANFIS including the investigation of the effect of clustering techniques for the prediction of biogas yield from FFV has not been previously reported. The closest application was in the prediction of the heating value of biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, building on the advantages of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], this study applies GA model to predict the cumulative biogas production from FFV waste. Accordingly, the specific objectives of the present study are: (1) to develop GA-ANFIS model for the prediction of biogas yield from FFV; (2) to investigate the effect of clustering techniques on the performance of the developed model; and (3) to compare the developed predictive models based on several statistical performance indicators. The proposed model utilizes feeding, VS, pH, HRT, OLR, temperature, and reactor volume data as input variables. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the relative contribution of each input parameter toward the prediction of output. The results of these models were compared with previously proposed model based on known performance metrics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of ANFIS model</title><p id="Par9">Binary logic techniques often fail to closely approximate complex and non-linear problems. This is largely due to the insufficient knowledge or judgment error associated with human experts and the dynamic nature of the system. In this case, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has an advantage since it combines fuzzy inference linguistic transparency with self-learning capability of neural network. In ANFIS modelling, the fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network can be combined according to the Mamdani system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and Takagi-Sugeno system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] topologies. Takagi-Sugeno system is more computation efficient, amenable to rule generation alongside the optimization technique of ANN while ensuring the continuity of the output space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Succinctly, an ANFIS structure is a combination of information obtained from a fuzzy logic system and an artificial neural network. It comprises numerous membership function (MF) parameters tuned using optimization methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. A typical ANFIS structure is a five-layer topology, each of which has a number of nodes defined by logical sets of statements. These logical statements perform specific tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Specifically, the ANFIS structure comprises the fuzzification layer, the rule layer, the normalization layer, the de-fuzzification layer, and the total output layer, as discussed by Adedeji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and Miller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].

As the number of input parameters increases, the number of membership functions increases exponentially, posing a significant limitation to the performance. GP is different from subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means, because GP uses similar membership functions on the input space to generate identical partition within the symmetric function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Fuzzy rules can be generated from input-output dataset deployed during the training. This allows rapid learning process and optimization of computation time (CT). The number of the fuzzy if-then rules is equal to <italic>M</italic><sup><italic>n</italic></sup> such that <italic>n</italic> is the input dimension and <italic>M</italic> is the number of fuzzy subsets that is partitioned for each input variables. The performance of this clustering technique significantly depends on the size of the input and the grid. The finer grid typically performs better, though adaptive grid partitioning can be deployed to optimize the size and location of the fuzzy grid regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

The data were gathered across different season in different geospatial location under varying conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It covers a wide array of actual output and input parameters that dictate the behavior of FFV wastes. In this case, seven (7) variables considered as the inputs are organic loading rate (OLR), volatile solids (VS), pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), temperature, retention time, and reaction volume, while cumulative biogas production was the output. The impacts of individual input variable on the output value were established based on sensitivity analysis. This was done to determine the influential variables, which significantly contribute to the prediction of cumulative biogas yield. The type of reactors (anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)) and feeding (semi-continuous and continuous) as well as the number of stages in the digesters (one, two, or three) were described by discrete parameters. The data collected from the database were randomized and subsequently divided in a ratio of 7:3 for training and testing, respectively.

The decision to assess the impact of the clustering technique was based on the studies conducted by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which suggested that the choice of hyperplane tuning parameters such as clustering method affects the model’s performance. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the flow diagram for the estimation of cumulated biogas yield. The GA algorithm starts by initializing with randomly generated population. In the course of each successive generation, a percentage of the existing population is selected to breed a new generation. The population is ranked, and the final solution is then selected through fitness-based procedure. In this study, Roulette wheel selection techniques were used since it has been identified as the most efficient in parent selection. The crossover of fittest parents is performed to produce new offspring which reflects the attributes of the pairing parents. The crossover process is followed by mutation where new solution is searched within the available search space to obtain revolutionary results which could help in arriving at efficient solution. After the optimal solution has been selected, a clustering technique is deployed as per the requirement of ANFIS model; then, the model is trained using the processed data. If the stopping criteria are met, then the model is tested with hold out data; otherwise, the training process is repeated until the stopping criteria are satisfied. The coding of the evolutionary genetic algorithms was actualized in MATLAB program version 2020a, and the software was installed on an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-1165G7 CPU @ 2.80GHz laptop 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD machine. Iteration values of 1000, 800, and 600 were tested, but there was no discernible difference in the three cost functions. The training ends since no further progress is made and the maximum number of iterations has been reached. As a result, the shortest iteration time (600 iterations) was chosen for this investigation to reduce computational time.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Flow diagram of hybrid genetic evolutionary algorithm</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4506_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par40">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> present the step-by-step procedure that was followed in the implementation of GA-ANFIS.

The performance evaluation results were reported, while further comparison was drawn with the study conducted by Neto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The influence of the 7 input variables on the cumulative biogas production is evaluated as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The sensitivity analysis indicates that all variables have influence on the cumulative biogas yield, though to different degrees. It can be seen that HRT and VS were most influential, contributing 35% and 31%, respectively, to the prediction of cumulative biogas production. Further, pH contributes 22% to the output; however, the reactor volume is the least influential in cumulative biogas production. The significance of HRT is due to its impact on other variables such as temperature and substrate composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. When the HRT is reduced, the activity of the bacteria is reduced, while bigger HRT would require larger digester leading to higher cost and low efficiency. The HRT changes with temperature with lower HRT in thermophilic temperature, while greater HRT is required in mesophilic temperature. Also, the VS concentration of the substrate could affect the biogas production. For instance, comparison of the influent and effluent of the digester can help in the determination of the feedstock degradation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sensitivity analysis for biogas process input variables</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4506_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">It is noteworthy that the microbial growth during anaerobic digestion could be affected by the pH. In a study conducted by Jayaraj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], effects of different pH values (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) on biogas yield from food waste after 30 days of retention were investigated. pH 7 produced better biogas yield and bacteria growth. There is a relation between the feeding rate and the OLR. Higher OLR at higher feeding rate can produce larger biogas volume, and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. OLR also affect the microbial population as well the reactor performance. It is critical to optimize OLR since increase in its value may produce acidification effect and subsequent reduction or stoppage of biogas production, while decrease in OLR may reduce the biogas production efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Temperature affects the HRT, OLR, VS, microbial growth, and the cumulative biogas yield. The rate of biogas production is enhanced at higher temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. When the operation temperature changes, the biogas yield would also change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">After the effects of all variables have been verified, the GA-ANFIS model was successfully implemented in the MATLAB environment, and the resulting performance of each clustering techniques was further discussed. Figures <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> show the experimental and predicted values based on SC, FC, and GP at the testing state. The prediction based on SC shows a strong relationship and satisfactory agreement with a significantly lower misprediction between the predicted and experimental values of biogas production. However, there were more notable instances of misprediction of biogas production in FC clustering technique. This may have been due to the unequal sizes and densities of the cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The worse prediction scenario characterized by gross misprediction and underfitting was noted when grid partitioning clustering method was deployed. This affected the model accuracy as MAPE, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, MAD, and RMSE reported were poor. Although several tunings were performed using different parameters to validate the GP result, the same prediction pattern was obtained. Similar observation was obtained by Adedeji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] in their short-term prediction of wind turbine power output. This may be due to high bias and dimensionality, which increased the complexity of the model and hamper its ability to learn the pattern of the training data. The better performance of SC may be as a result of its capability to automatically extract rules that fully account for the mobility and distribution of nodes. FCM, on the other hand, is highly sensitive to outliers in the biogas dataset, due to the Euclidean norm which measures the similarity between the center of the cluster and data points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Moreover, the modelling was performed on a real-world FFV dataset, which contained noise and outliers to demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Therefore, the sensitivity FC to noise and outliers may have been partly responsible for the poor performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Experimental and evolutionary prediction of cumulative biogas yield (SC) (testing)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4506_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Experimental and evolutionary prediction of cumulative biogas yield (FC) (testing)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4506_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig><fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Experimental and evolutionary prediction of cumulative biogas yield (GP) (testing)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4506_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par46">Apart from the visual observation of the agreement between the experimental and predicted biogas yield, statistical evaluation is performed, and the results presented are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Generally, MAPE estimates the model’s forecast accuracy and fitness, while MAD and RMSE assess the magnitude of the average prediction error. Thus, it is preferred if the value of these metrics tends toward zero. Lower values of RMSE, MAPE, and standard deviation error indicate that the predictive model is more accurate and has less error. The SC clustering technique offered the best result of the three clustering methods at the training and testing stage for all evaluation metrics except for the computation time (CT). This could have resulted from SC clustering ability which can improve numerically different but similar data groups and sparse data points in a multidimensional space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Although the computation time (CT) was 70 s, the MAPE forecast of the FC was significantly off by approximately 59%, which means only 41% of the data were correctly predicted. The poor statistical performance of GP shows that global optimal value could not be attained despite the optimization technique.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Statistical evaluation of SC, FC, and GP</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Clustering techniques</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Stages</p></th><th colspan="5"><p>Evaluation criteria</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RMSE</p></th><th><p>MAD</p></th><th><p>MAPE</p></th><th><p>Error STD</p></th><th><p>CT (s)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>SC</p></td><td><p>Training</p></td><td><p>3.45E-16</p></td><td><p>2.43E-16</p></td><td><p>2.69E-13</p></td><td><p>3.47E-16</p></td><td><p>82.64</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Testing</p></td><td><p>0.0529</p></td><td><p>0.0326</p></td><td><p>7.6742</p></td><td><p>0.0474</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>FC</p></td><td><p>Training</p></td><td><p>0.199</p></td><td><p>0.1352</p></td><td><p>58.6618</p></td><td><p>0.1679</p></td><td><p>70.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Testing</p></td><td><p>0.2114</p></td><td><p>0.1523</p></td><td><p>59.2620</p></td><td><p>0.2040</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>GP</p></td><td><p>Training</p></td><td><p>0.2591</p></td><td><p>0.205</p></td><td><p>81.09</p></td><td><p>0.0657</p></td><td><p>56.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Testing</p></td><td><p>0.2487</p></td><td><p>0.1963</p></td><td><p>80.4</p></td><td><p>0.2505</p></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par47">Since the data used in this study were sourced from Neto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], the results from the current study were compared with the biogas production models based on the determination coefficient (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>). These are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. For the ANN models from Neto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], biogas production was predicted using gradient descent algorithm (Traindx), Bayesian regularization backpropagation (Trainbr), and Levenberg and Marquardt function (Trainlm). However, for all these ANN variants, SC-based evolutionary algorithms produced better performance result for cumulative biogas production since its <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> only deviates from 1 by 0.0004%. On the contrary, all the ANN models deployed by Neto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] performed better than the Fuzzy c-means clustering and GP methods deployed in this study with GP significantly closer to zero. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> =0.1872) based on GP method suggests that the model fitting of the data is poor. The likely cause maybe the high dimensionality of the dataset. In addition, it suggests than the model could not explain the majority of the dataset. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the evolutionary algorithm based on subtractive clustering technique outperforms other clustering techniques in the prediction of cumulative biogas yield.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparative assessment f prediction performance</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Models</p></th><th><p>Clustering techniques</p></th><th><p>Testing <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>GA-ANFIS</p></td><td><p>SC</p></td><td><p>0.9558</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FC</p><p>GP</p></td><td><p>0.4097</p><p>0.1872</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p>Neto et al.

Three (3) clustering techniques (SC, FC, and GP) were considered, and the sensitivity of the input variables was evaluated. The sensitivity analysis indicates that all variables have influence on the cumulative biogas yield, with HRT and VS being the most influential, contributing 35% and 31%, respectively, to the prediction of cumulative biogas production. Also, the result achieved in the study demonstrates the effect of the clustering technique on the optimization of biogas production. The application of a hybrid genetic algorithm using a subtractive clustering approach offered highly satisfactory concurrence with the experimental data for biogas production. The statistical performance metrics for training and testing phases indicated that evolutionary ANFIS based on SC could reasonably predict the cumulative biogas yield with high accuracy and low error. It also provides better reliability than other models reviewed in this study. The results confirm the capacity of hybrid evolutionary (genetic) algorithm based on subtractive clustering technique to predict the biogas yield from FFV and serve as an effective tool for the upscaling of anaerobic digestion units as well as in techno-economic studies toward more efficient energy utilization.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, O.O; Data curation, P.
