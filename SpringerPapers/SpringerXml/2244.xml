Altiplano and Coastal/Lowlands are two representative zones of quinoa cultivation in South America with contrasting soil fertility and edaphoclimatic conditions.</p><p id="Par2">In the present work, we hypothesize that the ecotypes of Quinoa from Altiplano (landrace Socaire) and from Coastal/Lowland (landrace Faro) have developed differential adaptive responses in order to survive under conditions of low availability of N in their respective climatic zones of Altiplano and Lowlands. In order to understand intrinsic differences for N competence between landraces, seed metabolite profile and germinative capacity were studied. Additionally, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of N uptake and assimilation at limiting N conditions during establishment, germinated seeds of both landraces were grown at either sufficient nitrate (HN) or low nitrate (LN) supply. We studied the photosynthetic performance, protein storage, root morphometrical parameters, activity and expression of N-assimilating enzymes, and the expression of nitrate transporters of roots in plants submitted to the different treatments.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Seeds from Socaire landrace presented higher content of free N-related metabolites and faster seed germination rate compared to Faro landrace. Seedlings of both ecotypes presented similar physiological performance at HN supply, but at LN supply their differences were exalted. At LN, Socaire plants showed an increased root biomass (including a higher number and total length of lateral roots), a differential regulation of a nitrate transporter (a <italic>NPF6.3</italic>-like homologue) belonging to the Low Affinity Transport System (LATS), and an upregulation of a nitrate transporter (a <italic>NRT2.1</italic>-like homologue) belonging to the High Affinity nitrate Transport System (HATS) compared to Faro. These responses as a whole could be linked to a higher amount of stored proteins in leaves, associated to an enhanced photochemical performance in Altiplano plants, in comparison to Lowland quinoa plants.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These differential characteristics of Socaire over Faro plants could involve an adaptation to enhanced nitrate uptake under the brutal unfavorable climate conditions of Altiplano.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nitrogen metabolism</kwd><kwd>N transport</kwd><kwd>Glutamine synthetase</kwd><kwd>Photochemical process</kwd><kwd>Chlorophyll fluorescence</kwd><kwd>Nitrate reductase</kwd><kwd>Nitrate transporters</kwd><kwd>Nitrate-sensing</kwd><kwd>Proteins</kwd><kwd>Crop yield</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>333</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12870_2020_Article_2542.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Agriculture</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Tree Biology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">Nitrogen is a nutrient of foremost importance to predict physiological performance and yield of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nitrogen (N) is a component of many macromolecules including nucleic acids and proteins. Plant N compounds also include components of the ornithine cycle and the shikimate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Nitrogen stored in seeds has an important ecological role because it is involved in seed predation, protection and germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, it was suggested that metabolites stored in seeds represent a defined metabolic status and they may play a regulatory role over gene expression, defining levels of dormancy or/and ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, metabolites in seeds play a major role in early performance of species under poor nutrient conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">After germination, the ability of seedlings for N uptake and assimilation from soils depends on various factors including, available form of N, presence of other nutrients, soil characteristics, pH, temperature, abiotic factors, biotic interactions, competition, root structure, etc. In most plant species, only a small proportion of soil N is taken up and assimilated by plant roots. Plant can capture different inorganic forms of N in the roots, but nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) is the major N source absorbed and assimilated by plants in aerobic soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nitrate reductase (NR) catalyzes the first reaction in nitrate assimilation, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Nitrite reduction to ammonium is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR). Then, glutamine synthetase (GS) incorporates ammonium into glutamine in the GS-GOGAT cycle, converting inorganic N into organic N in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Plants actively take up NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> from soil thanks to the activity of root specific transporters via a proton/nitrate-coupled mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> uptake transporters are classified in two categories: Low Affinity Transport System (LATS) and High affinity Transport System (HATS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It was observed in Arabidopsis that LATS is mainly involved in transport at high nitrate concentrations, while HATS is active at low nitrate conditions (&lt; 1 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par26"><italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic> (Chenopodiaceae) seeds have a high protein content and a complete amino acid composition. Additionally, because of its wide adaptability and ability to grow under unfavorable environmental conditions, quinoa has been declared of global importance for food sustainability by the Food and Agricultural Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Quinoa was domesticated approximately in 3000 B.C., probably on the high plateaus of the Altiplano of Peru and Bolivia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Quinoa was spread out by the Inca Empire along the whole Andean mountain range, from Colombia to Southern Chile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Today, there are more than 6000 landraces of Quinoa cultivated by farmers worldwide.</p><p id="Par28">The Altiplano and Lowlands are representative geographical areas where Quinoa plants are submitted to contrasting environmental conditions in Chile. The Altiplano is immersed in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Quinoa plants growing in the Altiplano are exposed to extreme stressful climatic conditions called “cold desert”. These conditions include high-flux solar radiation, very strong diurnal changes of temperature, limited volume of annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year) and saline soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, quinoa Lowland ecotypes (from central and southern Chile) have to deal with acidic and impoverished soils, elevated temperatures during growth and rainfall ranges from 500 to 1500 mm/year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Both places and their edaphoclimatic conditions are representative of the wide stressful conditions (that reduce the probability of nutrient uptake and assimilation) Quinoa must cope with in Chile.</p><p id="Par29">We hypothesize that ecotypes of Quinoa from Altiplano (landrace Socaire) and from Lowland (landrace Faro) have developed differential adaptive responses in order to survive under conditions of low availability of N in the different climatic zones. In this regard, we wanted to elucidate whether the contrasting landraces of Quinoa store different level of N metabolites on seeds that could determine a differential speed of germination and competitiveness for nutrients. Thus, we determined the N-related metabolite composition of seeds and their germinative capacity. Further, seedlings of both landraces were grown at either sufficient nitrate (HN) or low nitrate (LN) supply for 20 days, and several parameters were determined in order to elucidate the mechanisms of N uptake and assimilation at limiting N conditions during establishment of each quinoa landrace. These parameters included morphometrical measures, photosynthetic performance, protein storage, as well as activities and gene expression of N-assimilating enzymes (NR, GS). A phylogenetic analysis of quinoa LATS and HATS homologues was performed, and relative quantification of expression of a selected LATS gene (a <italic>NPF6.3</italic>-like homologue) and a selected HATS gene (a <italic>NRT2.1</italic>-like homologue) were also performed.

On the other hand, Faro seeds stores higher amounts of alcohol sugars, considered “sweetener” with low caloric power (0.4 kcal/g) such as arabitol and erythritol. Furthermore, Faro seeds store higher amount of oleic acid, linolenic acid and linoleic acid (fatty acid metabolites) than Socaire seeds.

Among the processes involved in activation of seed metabolism upon imbibition, purine salvage pathway (and not “de novo” synthesis) has been the proposed as a route for purine nucleotide synthesis, because of their favorable energetic reactions with lower ATP cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Purine pathway-related metabolites including AMP, UMP, xanthosine and aspartate (among others), were present in higher amounts in Socaire than in Faro seeds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It is suggested that the higher content of purine-related metabolites, ribose 5-P and TCA intermediates observed in Socaire, could be contributing to the different enzymatic reactions related with the main pathways associated with energy production and nucleic acid biosynthesis after during seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The aromatic amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine are precursors for a wide range of secondary metabolites that are important for plant growth as well as for human nutrition and health. The occurrence of higher levels of shikimic acid, caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid), p-cumaric acid (4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and ferulic acid in Socaire seeds suggests an upregulation of secondary metabolism in this landrace in comparison with that of Faro seeds. It was reported that variations on these metabolites in <italic>Amaranthus</italic> seeds could be due to different climatic conditions of the provenances, but also to their genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

It is known that roots, and specifically root tips, are important sites where plant root absorbs water and nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lateral roots proliferate preferentially in nutrient-rich zones and are repressed at insufficient N supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Nevertheless, Socaire displayed a higher number of lateral roots and higher total root length than Faro seedlings at LN supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Taking into account that it was observed a higher leaf protein concentration in Socaire than in Faro seedlings (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), we suggest that maintenance of a higher number of lateral roots might be a crucial factor contributing to the higher N accumulation observed in Socaire ecotype.</p><p id="Par59">It is known that the vast majority of N is stored principally in leaves as Rubisco and other proteins from the light harvesting complex in the thylakoid system of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Observed decreases in the levels of chlorophylls in both landraces under LN conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) could be the result of adjustments of the photosynthetic apparatus to reduce the energy captured by plants to avoid photodamage. The ability for photosynthetic apparatus adjustment in quinoa is also supported by fluorescence chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> analysis, in which similar levels of Fv/Fm at HN and LN conditions are indicating that these plants did not suffer damage of PSII. Furthermore, due the changes in the photochemical (qL) and non- photochemical quenching (NPQ) at LN, regarding HN conditions, it is suggested that both landraces experienced dynamic regulations in the use of light, modifying the energy used on photochemical process and/or in the energy dissipated to the environment as heat. The major difference in these aboveground measured parameters between landraces was the capacity of Socaire plants to maintain qL values under LN conditions. Considering that photosynthesis is the principal process that explains qL values in Quinoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], this response could be the basis of the different amount of leaf protein between landraces under LN conditions.</p><p id="Par60">It is known that LN supply (and other stress conditions) induces production of secondary metabolites, triggering protein degradation and increasing photorespiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

We have characterized, by phylogenetic analysis, different LATS and HATS gene homologues in quinoa and two other plant species from the Chenopodioideae subfamily (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> and <italic>Beta vulgaris</italic>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par63">NPF family includes a large number of genes (up to 53 members in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>). Arabidopsis <italic>NPF6.3 (NTR1.1/CHL1)</italic> was the first nitrate transporter identified. This gene is expressed in several root tissues, where this transporter performs nitrate uptake from soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. <italic>NPF6.3 (NTR1.1/CHL1)</italic> was firstly identified as low affinity nitrate transporter but, later on, it was observed that this transporter can sense the external nitrate concentration and alter their transport activity. Thus, this protein has been proposed as transceptor with N-sensing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>NPF6.3</italic> can switch to high-affinity activity in LN conditions, and an increase in <italic>NPF6.3</italic> mRNA transcripts in presence of low levels of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In fact, knockout <italic>NPF6.3</italic> mutants are defective in high affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We identified up to four homologues of <italic>NPF6.3</italic> in quinoa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). The presence of these homologues probably results from gene duplication events and suggests a fine-tuning regulation of root N uptake by the members of this gene clade in quinoa. We have studied the expression of one of these <italic>NPF6.3</italic> homologues (<italic>NPF6.3-like</italic>, Acc. no. XM_021912755) in roots of Socaire and Faro landraces submitted to either HN or LN supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). At HN conditions, gene expression of <italic>NPF6.3-like</italic> is significantly higher in Faro plants than in Socaire plants, suggesting a role of this gene in low-affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> uptake, and a putative higher activity and/or efficiency for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> uptake in Faro plants. However, this gene is significantly upregulated in Socaire plants at LN supply, suggesting a high affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> transport function for this gene in this landrace (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). In Arabidopsis, phosphorylation of a Thr residue in LN conditions promotes <italic>NPF6.3</italic> high affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, all four <italic>NPF6.3</italic> homolog sequences identified in quinoa have conserved the corresponding Thr residue. It is also interesting to note that two <italic>NPF6.3</italic> homologues identified in spinach (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) are mainly expressed in roots, they are upregulated at HN conditions, and both homologues presented different expression patterns when comparing low N and high N plant varieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, functional characterization studies must be performed in order to elucidate the functional roles of these transporter homologues in <italic>C. quinoa</italic> and in other plants of the Chenopodioideae subfamily.</p><p id="Par64">Regarding HATS, seven <italic>NRT2</italic> genes were identified and characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and it is known that the <italic>NRT2</italic> family plays and important role in nitrate acquisition from soil under N limitation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It was observed that the constitutive gene <italic>NRT2.5</italic> of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plays a role in root nitrate influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is interesting to note that plants from the Chenopodioideae subfamily have several (up to 9, in the case of <italic>C. quinoa</italic>) homologues that cluster together with this nitrate transporter of Arabidopsis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b), suggesting an important role of these genes in root nitrate uptake in <italic>C. quinoa</italic> and the other plants of the Chenopodioideae subfamily. These homologues are probably the result of gene duplication events.</p><p id="Par65">By another way, <italic>A. thaliana NRT2.1</italic> is the most studied transporter of the <italic>NRT2</italic> family, and it was characterized as the main component of the HATS for nitrate root uptake under most conditions. This gene displays a very strict tissue-specific transcriptional profile, confined to the outer layers of the root tissues, and knockout mutation of this gene results in the loss of up to 75% of the root nitrate influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Plants of the Chenopodioideae subfamily have no close orthologues for <italic>NRT2.1</italic>, but they have several homologues that cluster together with a clade containing several inducible HATS expressed in roots of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (that is, <italic>NRT2.1</italic>, <italic>NRT2.2</italic> and <italic>NRT2.4</italic>) and other two homologues (<italic>NRT2.3</italic> and <italic>NRT2.6</italic>) whose function in plants is little known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We have studied the expression of one of these HATS homologues (<italic>High Affinity Transporter 2.1-like</italic>, Acc. no. XM_021864786) in roots of Socaire and Faro plants submitted to either HN or LN supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). This gene is significantly induced in both quinoa landraces at LN supply. This result agrees with the expression patterns of its homologues in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> roots, which display a transient upregulation by N starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the case of quinoa, this upregulation was significantly higher in Socaire than in Faro plants, suggesting a putative higher activity and/or efficiency for nitrate uptake at LN supply in Socaire plants. Interestingly, it was reported that expression of a <italic>S. oleracea NRT2.1</italic>-like homologue (Acc. no. XM_022009342) is higher in roots of a low-nitrate content variety than in roots of a high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> content variety, suggesting a role in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> uptake; however, no gene upregulation was observed in LN supply conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], suggesting that the role and regulation of this homologue could be different in different plant species of the Chenopodioideae subfamily. It was reported that <italic>A. thaliana NRT2.1</italic> can be involved in lateral root development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; concordantly, we observed that Socaire plants display a higher number of lateral roots, and higher total root length, than Faro plants at LN supply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d).</p><p id="Par66">No homologues of the tonoplast-specific <italic>NRT2.7</italic> gene of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> were found in Chenopodioideae.

Socaire seeds were able to germinate faster than Faro, which could be associated to a different metabolite composition of seeds. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> treatment affected the expression of related genes, modulating root morphology and aerial performance differentially among ecotypes. Considering variation on soil quality and N sources on the different places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], specific adaptations to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> uptake between ecotypes could be shaping our results.
