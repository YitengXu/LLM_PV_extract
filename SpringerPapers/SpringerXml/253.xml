As a promising alternative or supplement to traditional cancer therapy, photothermal therapy (PTT) based on the interaction between tissues and near infrared (NIR) radiation offers many advantages such as high efficiency and minimal invasiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Owing to the excellent NIR optical performance, nanomaterials such as metallic nanostructures, metal-based semiconductor nanoparticles and carbon nanomaterials have been explored and employed as PTT agents or drug release systems in <italic>in vivo</italic> cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nanomaterials with a size range between 20 and 200 nm circumvent rapid renal filtration enabling passive accumulation in tumours at high concentrations for a longer time than organic molecules via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that can hardly be achieved by other molecular agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, unlike other small biodegradable molecules, inorganic nanoparticles generally have poor biodegradability and stay in the body for a long period of time accentuating the risk of deleterious effects. Hence, clinical adoption of nanomaterials hinges on the proper control of biodegradability as well as long-term toxicity of the materials and by-products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It has recently been reported that ultrasmall nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) undergo rapid renal filtration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> but suffer from a short blood circulation half-life, attenuated EPR effects, as well as reduced tumour accumulation and retention. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop new PTT agents which have not only the proper size enabling efficient tumour targeting, but also good biocompatibility and biodegradability ensuring that the nanoparticles can be discharged harmlessly from the body in a reasonable period of time after completion of the designed therapeutic functions.</p><p id="Par4">As a new member of 2D materials, atomically thin black phosphorus (BP) has many potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Being a metal-free layered semiconductor, BP has a layer-dependent direct bandgap varying from 0.3 eV for the bulk materials to 2.0 eV for phosphorene (monolayered BP), thereby allowing broad absorption across the ultraviolet and infrared regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Liquid exfoliation methods are commonly utilized to prepare BP nanosheets with different thicknesses and sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> for bioimaging and phototherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In particular, ultrasmall BP nanosheets (also called BP quantum dots, BPQDs) with a size of ∼3 nm have a large NIR extinction coefficient, high photothermal conversion efficiency and little cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. As an inorganic nanoagent, BP is attractive due to its inherent biocompatibility and furthermore, as one of the vital elements, <italic>P</italic> is a benign element making up ∼1% of the total body weight as a bone constituent in the human body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Recent experiments have shown that BP nanosheets, especially ones with a small thickness and size, have high reactivity with oxygen and water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and can degrade in aqueous media. Moreover, the final degradation products are nontoxic phosphate and phosphonate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, both of which exist in and are well tolerated by the human body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, ultrasmall BPQDs with good photothermal performance and biocompatibility are potential therapeutic agents. However, their actual clinical application <italic>in vivo</italic> still suffers from rapid renal excretion and degradation of the optical properties during circulation in the body.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, to accomplish high therapeutic efficacy and desirable biodegradation, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) loaded with 3 nm BPQDs is processed by an oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method to produce ∼100 nm BPQDs/PLGA nanospheres (NSs). PLGA, a well known biodegradable and biocompatible polymer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is widely used as a vehicle in the delivery of drugs and nanomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In general, the degradation period of PLGA spans several months and its degradation rate can be controlled by adjusting the chemical composition such as the monomer ratio and molecular weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Herein, the hydrophobic PLGA not only isolates the interior BPQDs from oxygen and water to enhance the photothermal stability, but also controls the degradation rate of the BPQDs in the physiological medium. The BPQDs/PLGA NSs with the optimal size enable prolonged blood circulation and effective accumulation in tumours based on the EPR effect. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are performed systematically to evaluate the performance of the BPQDs/PLGA NSs as biodegradable and biocompatible PTT agents in cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Morphology and characterization</title><p id="Par6">The ultrasmall BPQDs were prepared by a modified liquid exfoliation technique according to the method reported by our group previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>, the BPQDs/PLGA NSs produce larger tumour temperature increase than the bare BPQDs under all conditions. The better <italic>in vivo</italic> PTT efficiency of the BPQDs/PLGA NSs than bare BPQDs pertaining to tumour ablation can be attributed to two factors. First, the BPQDs/PLGA NSs have better stability than the bare BPQDs and so can maintain the photothermal performance during circulation in the body. Second, compared with the ultrasmall BPQDs with a size of ∼3 nm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), the size of the BPQDs/PLGA NSs of ∼100 nm is more appropriate for efficient tumour targeting and retension during the long blood circulation in the body.</p><p id="Par28">After the above photothermal treatments with different samples, the tumour size was measured every 2 days after the treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and no obvious sign of toxic side effects such as abnormal body weight, activity, eating, drinking or neurological issues could be observed from all the experimental groups. The tumour volume variations determined from the different groups are consistent with those of temperature (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). The mice injected with the BPQDs/PLGA NSs and irradiated by the NIR laser, their tumours shrink gradually, are obliterated only leaving black scars, and then are completely cured in ∼16 days. More importantly, not even a single case of recurrence is observed. With regard to the mice treated with the bare BPQDs, the tumour growth is not inhibited effectively and so are the mice treated with the PLGA NSs or PBS alone. The mice treated with the BPQDs/PLGA NSs are tumour-free after the treatment and all survive for over 40 days until killed. In contrast, the mice in the other groups have a life span of 18–26 days and the tumour volume is as large as 1,600 mm<sup>3</sup>. These results demonstrate the excellent efficacy of the NSs for photothermal cancer therapy of the BALB/c nude mice which have a deficient immune system. To further demonstrate the applicability of the NSs-mediated PTT, BALB/c mice, with a competent immune system, were employed as another animal model in the photothermal treatments. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>, the BPQDs/PLGA NSs also exhibit excellent photothermal efficacy to kill the melanoma tumour in the BALB/c mice without causing obvious toxic side effects. The results demonstrate that the NSs-mediated PTT is suitable for such two kinds of animals with different immune systems.</p><p id="Par29">The anticancer efficiency is further analysed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay, which is generally utilized to detect the intratumoral levels of apoptosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>, no or few TUNEL-positive cells (shown in green) are observed from the PBS, PLGA and BPQDs groups, while significant colocalization of nuclei (DAPI staining, shown in blue) and TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (shown in green) can be observed from the BPQDs/PLGA NSs group. Moreover, the apoptosis examination at macro-organizational level (∼10 mm<sup>2</sup>) shows that the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells are distributed throughout the tumour section (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). These results indicate that the NSs-mediated PTT can induce cancer cell death by activating apoptosis in the tumour.</p><p id="Par30">The depth of photothermal damage is investigated in the tumour-bearing nude mice with the tumour volume as large as 1,000 mm<sup>3</sup>. After the photothermal treatment, intratumoral apoptosis of the tumour sections at different depths was detected by a TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Most cancer cells undergo apoptosis in the tumour sections at depths of no more than 6 mm. Although evident depth-dependent decay of the PTT efficiency is observed when the depth is over 6 mm, significant apoptosis of cells can still be found from the section at the depth of 10 mm. The considerable photothermal damage to deep tissues stems from the excellent PTT efficiency of the NSs and high tissue penetration ability of NIR light. It should be noted that although the penetration depth of NIR light is limited to be no more than 10 mm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), clinical photothermal treatment of deep tumours is still achievable with the aid of specialized medical devices such as endoscopic ones in combination with optical fibres as well as implanted NIR devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">BPQDs/PLGA NSs with highly efficient photothermal performance are fabricated using PLGA loaded with 3 nm BPQDs by an oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of PLGA, rapid degradation of the BPQDs is prevented so that the photothermal performance of the BPQDs/PLGA NSs in the physiological environment is improved significantly. No appreciable toxicity and good biocompatibility are observed from the BPQDs/PLGA NSs based on the haematological, blood biochemical and histological analyses. Boasting long blood circulation in the body, the NSs after intravenous injection show efficient tumour accumulation by the EPR effect. By activating apoptosis of cancer cells even in the deep tumour tissues, the NSs give rise to highly efficient tumour ablation under NIR laser irradiation, and the NSs-mediated PTT is proven to be suitable for two kinds of animals with different immune systems.</p><p id="Par32">Compared with previously reported nanoagents, these BPQDs/PLGA NSs are especially attractive due to the unique biodegradability (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM141">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). PLGA, which is FDA-approved degrades by hydrolysis forming carbon dioxide and water eventually in a reasonable time (for example, several months). After intravenous administration into the body, the BPQDs/PLGA NSs with size of ∼100 nm can circumvent rapid degradation of the BPQDs in the optical performance during long-time circulation (for example, 24 h), and ensure sufficient tumour accumulation for highly efficient photothermal cancer therapy. After fulfilling their therapeutic functions, degradation of PLGA disrupts the NSs causing the release of the BPQDs. The BPQDs then degrade to form nontoxic phosphate and phosphonate enabling harmless clearance from the body. In addition, such slow degradation of the BPQDs circumvents the local imbalance of phosphorus <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, such BP-based PTT agent with the unique combination of biodegradability and biocompatibility has immense clinical potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par33">The BP crystals were purchased from a commercial supplier (Smart-Elements) and stored in a dark Ar glovebox and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (99.5%, anhydrous) was obtained from Aladdin Reagents.
