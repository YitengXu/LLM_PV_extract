The system is comprised of a solar panel, a lithium battery, and a control circuit. Hardware, instead of software, is used for charge management of the lithium battery, which improves the reliability and stability of the system. It prefers to use the solar energy whenever the sunshine is sufficient, and the lithium battery is a complementary power supply for conditions, such as overcast, rain, and night. The system adapts a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit to take full advantage of solar energy, and it ensures the lithium battery an extremely long life with an appropriate charging method, which shortens the frequency of the battery charge-discharge cycle. This system can be implemented with small power equipment which is especially suitable for outdoor-based wireless sensor nodes in the Internet of Things (IOT).</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Solar energy harvesting</kwd><kwd>Bimodule power supply</kwd><kwd>MPPT</kwd><kwd>WSN</kwd><kwd>Internet of Things</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13638_2015_Article_414.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Signal,Image and Speech Processing</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Communications Engineering, Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Wireless sensor network (WSN) is the second largest network after the Internet in the world, and it ranks as the first of the next ten emerging technologies.

On the other hand, reducing the power consumption of the nodes always sacrifices performances like computing. The most up-to-date power density of available battery technology cannot match the needs of most WSN for long lifetime and small form factor, which limits the use of WSN due to the need for large batteries. It also has a slight possibility that the better batteries for small devices will become available in the next few years. Energy harvesting and management may be the most convenient ways to solve the problem of making WSN autonomous and enable widespread use of these systems in many applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The state-of-the-art energy-storage techniques for energy-harvesting systems in sustainable wireless sensor nodes can be classified into two technologies, i.e., supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These two categories have their own advantages and disadvantages, involving energy-storage density, lifetime, discharging, leakage, size and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since the supercapacitors have significantly lower power density and higher leakage overhead than rechargeable batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which makes them impractical for small-package WSN nodes, we employ an energy-harvesting system using a lithium battery as the storage.</p><p id="Par5">From the electrochemical theory, we may learn that the aging of the lithium battery is influenced greatly by the self state of charge (SOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] show that lithium batteries in high SOC are more vulnerable to environmental impacts of aging and SOC cycling the batteries enhances the resistive lives. Therefore, it must be avoided that the battery always be in high SOC to extend battery lifetime, and approaches, one example of which is recharging the battery until its voltage drops below a specific level, should be taken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The charging managements are usually employed by microcontrollers for the flexibility of software designing and implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have proven that battery-charging controlled by software may have some problems in which charging logic could not work, and that the battery could not be charged under sufficient sunlight.

To prolong the lithium battery life, an intelligent circuit using RS triggers is proposed, which makes the lithium battery charge only when the battery voltage is lower than a specific value. The circuit can be divided into two main functional parts, i.e., the charging sub-circuit and the control sub-circuit. The sub-circuits are merged into one printed circuit board (PCB), and the whole system has been designed, built, and tested.

Researchers make great efforts to find out renewable energy resources from the environment for WSN usage, such as solar power, wind, vibration, heat, and RF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. How to collect and store energy effectively from the environment has been taken more and more seriously by researchers.</p><p id="Par12">Sharma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] studied a sensor node with an energy-harvesting source, and a buffer was used to store the generated energy. The sensor node periodically sensed a random field and generated packets. Only when the energy was available, the packets would be transmitted; otherwise, they were stored and waited upon. They also exploited throughput optimization, i.e., to obtain energy management policies for the largest possible data rate and the minimal mean delay in the queue. In order to increase the lifespan of WSN with powering-up methods, Ramasur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] took some efforts in a wind energy harvester (WEH) model. Their WEH consisted of a wind generator and a power management unit to store and condition the generated energy. The results showed that their aero-elastic flutter generator could produce more power compared with that of the other small-scale wind generators; however, the circuit was not equipped with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) resulting in poor efficiencies of the WEH.</p><p id="Par13">Besides harvesting the wind power, taking full advantage of the solar power may be more convenient in WSN usage. Although solar power is time- and season-dependent, it remains as one of the best choices by adapting a power management mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Yi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] put forward a wireless sensor node design based on a solar energy-power supply. They gave full consideration to energy-saving principles by adapting low-power consumption devices in every module and collected the solar energy to provide lasting power for the system.</p><p id="Par14">Another low-power solar energy-harvesting system for WSN was put forward in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], where Naveen et al. employed the system in an intelligent building. They adapted a solar energy harvester instead of an alkaline battery for the sensor nodes. They used a number of solar cells connected in series and parallel to each other to scavenge energy, and they applied a set of ultracapacitors to store up the energy. As a backup energy source, alkaline batteries were connected along with the capacitors.</p><p id="Par15">A solar-powered sensor module using low-cost capacitors as storage buffers was investigated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and only capacitors were adapted. The advantage is that the energy-charging time is shortened within a second, although the module cannot work without light illumination. A battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy-storage module was proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and an embedded processor was used to control the charging of the battery. Supercapacitors charge the battery only when their saved energy exceeds the peak requirements of processors running at full speed and ignores estimating the SOC of the battery.</p><p id="Par16">Taneja [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] et al. brought forward a kind of micro photovoltaic energy system. Alberola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] put forward another solar power system consisting of a supercapacitor and a lithium battery. To provide an uninterrupted power supply, the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] exploited two battery groups for energy storage. In charging lithium batteries, some literatures have been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The common method is that whenever the voltage of the solar panel is high enough, charging starts. According to the research of Ecker et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] have proposed a solution that the system charges the lithium battery only when the voltage is lower than a specific value. This strategy can solve the problem of charging too often and the lithium battery being in high SOC all the time; nevertheless, it may waste most of the solar power in that this system applied the lithium battery as the primary power source no matter how capable the solar panel was to supply the system or not.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par17">In this section, to begin with, we analyze some shortages of the existing solar energy-harvesting systems and then present the methodology and the hardware components of our system.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Problems to be considered</title><p id="Par18">Energy harvesting is one of the most promising technologies toward the goal of perpetual operation of WSN.

In this paper, we use “bimodule” to emphasize that the output of the system may originate from the solar panel or the lithium battery, respectively. The standard mini-USB interface is a reservation to charge the lithium battery by an external power adapter if necessary.

In terms of hardware construction, the sensor nodes usually have more sensors than the routing nodes, for example, the dissolved oxygen sensor, PH sensor etc. The total power consumption of the sensor group is larger than that of the sensor node itself, consumed by data computing and radio transmission, so that the power consumption of the sensor nodes is larger than that of the routing nodes.

Based on the premise of not affecting the system work, reducing the charge-discharge cycles of the battery is very helpful. Experimental results show that the lithium battery can work for a long time when its voltage is between 3.7–3.9 V, but if the voltage is lower than the threshold, it drops rapidly with discharge going on. So the lithium battery should be charged at once when its voltage is under the threshold. Critically, if the battery voltage is lower than the danger boundary, it may be eternally damaged, so discharge should be stopped immediately, and the system has to do something to avoid this from happening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">According to the circuit in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, when the battery voltage is lower than the threshold (whose value can be adjusted by the resistor R14 and R18), the output of U4B in LM339 and the pin <inline-formula id="IEq8"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq8_Math"><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq8_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

We can get two different operating points in the conditions of solar power or lithium battery-branch energy supply, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>. The reason causing the operating points to be different is that the output voltage of the two branches have a slight difference in the circuit. Whether the power is provided by the solar or the lithium branch, the power efficiency (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>) is higher than 60 %. It is worth mentioning that the power efficiency is up to 80 % with the lithium battery as a power supply. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref> we can find that the efficiency of the solar power branch is lower than that of the lithium branch, and at the same time, the former is more sensitive with the load resistance. The reasons for this phenomenon can mainly be concluded in two parts. The first one is that the voltage difference between input and output of the solar branch is larger than that of the battery branch, and the second is that the former components cause more power loss than that of the latter.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Output characteristics of the ISEH system. <bold>a</bold> Power conversion efficiency versus load resistance. <bold>b</bold> Output power versus load resistance</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13638_2015_414_Fig10_HTML.gif" id="MO10"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par86">In this paper, a novel intelligent solar energy-harvesting system is designed by using an MPPT circuit. Hardware, instead of software, is used for charging management of the lithium battery, which can enhance the robustness of the system greatly. Analyses based on power supply requirements are made for WSN nodes in IOT. The system can afford a stable power supply with 5-V output voltage through a standard USB interface. Lithium battery-charging strategy can also ingeniously avoid the charge-discharge cycle a lot, and thus the lifetime of the lithium battery can be greatly extended. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can switch the power supply branch automatically. When the voltage of lithium battery drops below the predefined level, it can be charged properly. The system performs stably and safely with high reliability, high efficiency, low-power loss, and simple composition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 14JJ5009, the Post Doctoral Foundation of Central South University, China, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61272495, 61379153, and 61401519).</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">ZhouY, Yang X, Guo X, et al.
