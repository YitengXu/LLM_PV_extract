Sunlight promotes microbial conversion of plant litter; this effect has been attributed to photochemical degradation of lignin, a major redox-active component of secondary plant cell walls that limits enzyme access to the cell wall carbohydrates. Here, we show that exposing lignin to visible light facilitates cellulose solubilization by promoting formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that fuels LPMO catalysis. Light-driven H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation is accompanied by oxidation of ring-conjugated olefins in the lignin, while LPMO-catalyzed oxidation of phenolic hydroxyls leads to the required priming reduction of the enzyme. The discovery that light-driven abiotic reactions in Nature can fuel H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redox enzymes involved in deconstructing lignocellulose may offer opportunities for bioprocessing and provides an enzymatic explanation for the known effect of visible light on biomass conversion.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Degradation of plant biomass, comprised of cellulose and polyaromatic lignin, is promoted by light.

However, plant cell walls have evolved to become recalcitrant co-polymeric structures to provide mechanical strength and rigidity and to provide resistance against pathogen attack, and are, thus, hard to break down<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Plant cell wall-degrading microorganisms have solved this challenge by developing multi-component enzymatic tools that act synergistically to process this highly complex and recalcitrant biomass.</p><p id="Par4">Selective oxidation of non-activated C-H bonds in crystalline cellulose by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) is crucial for efficient aerobic decomposition of plant biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. LPMOs are abundant in Nature and classified, based on their sequences, in the auxiliary activity (AA) families 9–11 and 13–17 of the Carbohydrate Active enZymes (CAZy) database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. LPMOs are mono-copper enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> that catalyze oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in insoluble polysaccharides such as cellulose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and chitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, as well as in certain hemicelluloses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. LPMOs were first considered monooxygenases as the activity was shown to depend on the presence of molecular oxygen, but recent studies have demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the kinetically relevant co-substrate making these enzymes peroxygenases rather than monooxygenases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The oxidative action of LPMOs disrupts the crystalline polysaccharide surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> thus promoting depolymerization by hydrolytic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It is generally accepted that LPMOs are the C1 factor hypothesized by Elwyn Reese and co-workers in 1950<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and that LPMOs explain why Eriksson et al. found, in 1974, that oxygen promotes biomass conversion by a fungal secretome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">LPMO catalysis was first thought to require delivery of two electrons, two protons and molecular oxygen per catalytic cycle in what would be a monooxygenase reaction (R-H + 2e<sup>−</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> → R-OH + H<sub>2</sub>O), whereas in the peroxygenase reaction, a reduced LPMO can catalyze multiple turnovers with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (R-H + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → R-OH + H<sub>2</sub>O)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A standard monooxygenase reaction set-up involves incubating the LPMO with substrate and a reductant under aerobic conditions and it has been shown that a wide variety of reducing compounds and reducing equivalent-delivering enzymes can drive LPMO reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It is currently being debated whether observed monooxygenase reactions are in fact peroxygenase reactions that are limited by the in situ generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by LPMO-catalyzed or abiotic oxidation of the reductant (e.g., Bissaro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>). Importantly, like for other redox enzymes, high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> combined with low levels of substrate will lead to autocatalytic oxidative damage in the catalytic center of the enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-driven LPMO catalysis is a double-edged sword, enabling high enzymatic activity at the possible cost of enzyme inactivation.</p><p id="Par6">Light represents an abundant and cheap source of energy that can be harvested by a photoredox catalyst to tailor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels to enzymatic reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Light-driven LPMO reactions were first described in 2016. Cannella et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> showed that the activity of a fungal LPMO acting on amorphous cellulose (PASC) could be boosted dramatically by adding chlorophyllin, a photosynthetic pigment, and light, next to the reductant, ascorbic acid (AscA). Light-driven activity of a bacterial LPMO from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>AA10C) on crystalline cellulose (Avicel) using irradiated vanadium-doped titanium dioxide (V-TiO<sub>2</sub>) was demonstrated later the same year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Both studies discussed molecular mechanisms for the observed LPMO activity, but neither considered light-induced formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from O<sub>2</sub> as the primary driver for LPMO activity, which, later, was shown to be the key driver of LPMO activity in these light-fueled reaction systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The impact of light on biomass conversion is of great interest, with repercussions spanning from the global carbon cycle to industrial biorefining.

Since secondary plant cell walls, the natural substrates of LPMOs, are rich in lignin, and since lignin is photoactive and can promote formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that light-driven redox processes involving lignin and LPMO activity can help explain the observed photofacilitation of biomass decomposition. Of note, possible effects of light may also be relevant for reactor design in industrial biorefining of lignocellulosic biomass, since pretreated feedstocks that are subjected to enzymatic saccharification with LPMO-containing cellulolytic enzyme cocktails usually contain large amounts of lignin.</p><p id="Par8">Here we report a detailed biochemical study of cellulose degradation by <italic>Sc</italic>AA10C, a well-studied model LPMO from the soil actinomycete <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, using light-exposed lignin to fuel the LPMO reaction.

We also show that the necessary priming reduction of the LPMO may be achieved through direct interactions with polymeric lignin and that LPMOs, thus, can oxidize lignin. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate the impact of visible light on the lignin structure, revealing effects on olefinic structures.

To gain more insight into lignin’s ability to fuel LPMO reactions and to assess the impact of light, we used a well-studied cellulose-active C1-oxidizing LPMO from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>AA10C, also known as CelS2) and Avicel (i.e., crystalline cellulose) as substrate.</p><p id="Par10">In the first set of experiments, we used commercially available kraft lignin to fuel solubilization of crystalline cellulose by <italic>Sc</italic>AA10C and we measured both LPMO product formation and the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in reactions exposed to light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As expected, oxidized cello-oligosaccharides were not generated in reactions lacking the LPMO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). At the lower lignin concentration (0.9 g L<sup>−1</sup>), the reaction without LPMO showed accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas the reaction with 75 nM or 500 nM LPMO showed almost identical linear progress curves for LPMO product formation and no accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that, under these conditions, the LPMO reaction was limited by generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. At the higher lignin concentration (9 g L<sup>−1</sup>), accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the reaction without LPMO was much higher (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

One potential explanation resides in the HRP/Amplex Red assay used to determine H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels. Kraft lignin serves as substrate for HRP, which will suppress the Amplex Red signal.

The levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> measured in the absence of the LPMO are the net result of formation (i.e., oxidation of lignin by O<sub>2</sub>) and degradation (i.e., oxidation of lignin by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), both of which may be dependent on light, as has been shown for a different photoredox catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

It should be noted that the spectra for LPMO-treated lignin have a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to the spectra for light-treated lignin due to a 2-fold lower lignin concentration leading to ~4-fold lower sensitivity.</p><p id="Par22">1D proton NMR of the treated organosolv lignins showed that protons of the hydroxyl groups in light-treated lignin occur at a higher chemical shift meaning that they are on average more deshielded compared to dark-incubated lignin. In contrast, addition of the LPMO resulted in hydroxyl protons becoming more shielded, as shown by a lower chemical shift (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). The degree of shielding may be interpretated as the degree of hydrogen bonding, as hydroxyl groups are strongly deshielded by hydrogen bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. These changes were observed for both the spruce and the birch lignin and suggest that light-driven oxidation and LPMO-catalyzed oxidation of lignin have different chemical consequences. Oxidation of ring-conjugated olefins, promoted by light, could lead to some depolymerization of the lignin (as also suggested by the increase in cinnamaldehyde end groups; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), resulting in increased hydrogen bonding and deshielded hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, LPMOs will oxidize hydroxyl groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which could lead to radical formation and increased polymerization. It is not surprising that, apart from the observed changes in hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl protons, no effects of LPMO treatment on the lignin structure could be detected, given that a reduced LPMO can catalyze multiple peroxygenase reactions and that, thus, oxidation of lignin by the LPMO may be much less frequent than the light-promoted oxidations that generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Probing for a possible role of water oxidation</title><p id="Par23">It has been claimed, recently, that lignin may photocatalytically oxidize H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which would mean that the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by irradiated lignin does not depend on O<sub>2</sub>, and that irradiated lignin should be able to fuel the LPMO reaction under anaerobic conditions. To assess this possibility, anaerobic experiments with ScAA10C and Avicel were performed, in the presence of lignins (soluble kraft lignin and insoluble organosolv lignin from spruce) or ascorbic acid. The reaction containing only AscA should not lead to any product formation in true anaerobic conditions whilst a control reaction containing AscA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> should generate oxidized products.</p><p id="Par24">Chromatographic analysis of reaction mixtures after 22 h of incubation under anaerobic conditions, showed that all three reactions without added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> had generated identical, low amounts of oxidized products, whereas, as expected, product levels were higher in the reaction with added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). The similar and low product levels in the reactions without added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, regardless of the reductant (AscA or lignin), indicate that all reactions were limited by the same factor, which must be traces of O<sub>2</sub>. The chromatographic analysis shows that, if water oxidation was happening at all in the reaction set-ups used here, this process must have been very slow, since neither kraft lignin nor organosolv spruce lignin were able to promote anaerobic LPMO activity above the level reached in the anaerobic reaction with AscA. We did these experiments in H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O and used H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the control reaction with hydrogen peroxide, because such an approach in principle could provide additional evidence for (the absence of) water oxidation, as explained in the legend of Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>.

We show that irradiation of lignin promotes lignin oxidation and formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which fuels the LPMO reaction.

We demonstrate that LPMO activity is improved in conditions generating higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and is inhibited by HRP, supporting the notion that the LPMO reaction is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent. Since LPMOs are susceptible to autocatalytic inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, as also demonstrated here, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, regulating the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> available to the LPMO is important. The use of lignin and light not only offers a cheap and abundant source of reducing power for LPMO reactions, but could also be used to obtain better control and regulation, as previously shown for light-driven LPMO reactions with chlorophyllin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the use of light to control LPMO activity in commercial bioreactors operating at high dry matter concentrations with for instance lignocellulose will be challenging as light is attenuated in reaction slurries. Still, light will penetrate to some extent and it is thus worth noting that the present results suggest that the outcome of lignocellulose saccharification experiments with LPMO-containing cellulase cocktails may depend on the vessel type (glass or steel) and the light conditions in the laboratory or the industrial plant. These light attenuation issues will not apply in light/lignin fueled reaction with other H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent enzymes, for example the oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons recently reported by Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">LPMO catalysis depends on reducing equivalents that are needed to bring the enzyme in its reduced, catalytically competent state.

We used the highest practical sample concentrations in the NMR analyses, to maximize sensitivity. The complexity and heterogeneity of the lignin structures requires high sensitivity, while achieving complete dissolution of samples is challenging. It is likely that the structural changes in lignin observed in this study only provide part of the picture, due to low signal-to-noise ratios, particularly for the 1D carbon spectra. Of note, the apparent lack of an effect of LPMO treatment on the 1D carbon spectra of lignin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) could to some extent be due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio in these spectra (compared to the spectra obtained in the experiments with light). Thus, we cannot fully exclude that LPMO action also leads to lignin oxidations similar to those occurring upon treatment with light. Further in-depth studies of treated and untreated lignin are needed to unravel the full impact of light and LPMO action of lignin. Such studies may eventually allow the determination of quantitative correlations between the degree of lignin oxidation, the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced and LPMO activity. Of note, revealing such correlations would require accurate quantitative detection of all LPMO products and hydrogen peroxide levels under relevant conditions, which is challenging for reactions with lignin.</p><p id="Par30">The present findings show that LPMO reactions can be fueled by light-exposed lignin and may have wide implications for how we understand biological processes related to biomass conversion in Nature.

It would be of interest to investigate whether the interplay between light, redox-active structural components, and enzymes such as LPMOs has had an impact on the (co-)evolution of lignin-rich materials and the enzyme systems that degrade these. While these are interesting possible implications and while the impact of light on biomass conversion in Nature is indisputable, the magnitude and relative importance of light/lignin-fueled catalysis by LPMOs and other H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent biomass degrading enzymes remains to be established.

The stopped-flow rapid spectrophotometer was flushed with a large excess of anaerobic buffer before coupling the sealed syringes and performing the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Kinetics data analysis</title><p id="Par41">The fluorescence data monitored with the stopped-flow was fitted to a single exponential function (y = a + b·e<sup>−kobs·t</sup>) using the BioKine32 V4.74.2 software (BioLogic Science Instruments) to obtain the first order rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>1obs</italic></sub>) for each lignin concentration.

After 24 h, identical reactions were pooled and freeze-dried prior to NMR analyses.</p><p id="Par43">Lyophilized organosolv lignin (20–40 mg) that had been incubated as described above was dissolved in 480 µL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d<sub>6</sub> 99.96 atom % D Sigma-Aldrich) and transferred to a 5 mm LabScape Stream NMR tube (Bruker LabScape). For NMR analyses, all homo- and heteronuclear experiments were recorded on a Bruker AV-IIIHD 800 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin AG) equipped with a 5 mm cryogenic CP-TCI z-gradient probe. The spectra were recorded, processed, and analyzed using TopSpin 3.6pl7 and TopSpin 4.0.7 software (Bruker BioSpin AG).</p><p id="Par44">For chemical shift assignments, the following one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were recorded at 25 °C for both the birch and spruce lignin sample series: 1D carbon with power-gated decoupling and 30° flip angle (spectral width 220 ppm, spectral resolution 64k points, number of scans 4096, interscan delay 4 s), 1D proton with 30° flip angle (spectral width 14 ppm, spectral resolution 64k points, number of scans 16, interscan delay 1 s), 2D {<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C} heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) with multiplicity editing (spectral width C 200 ppm/ H 14 ppm, spectral resolution H 2k/ C 256k points, number of scans 32, interscan delay 2 s).</p><p id="Par45">1D proton and carbon experiments were Fourier transformed using exponential windows function and line broadening of 0.3 Hz for proton and 5 Hz for carbon.

All spectra were internally referenced to the residual DMSO signal (δ<sub>C</sub> 39.5 and δ<sub>H</sub> 2.50). Comparative analyses were only done for sets of reactions with similar lignin concentrations (i.e., those treated with LPMO containing ~20 mg lignin, and those treated with light, containing ~40 mg; the difference is due to sample availability). For presenting 1D spectra together, spectral intensities were scaled to the peak intensity at δ<sub>C</sub> ~28ppm and/or δ<sub>H</sub> 0.85 and 1.24, to compensate for differences in sample mass. Chemical moieties that changed, either in light-treated or LPMO-treated samples, were annotated based on comparison of chemical shift values with published literature values (see Figure captions for references).</p><p id="Par46"><sup>1</sup>H 1D NMR investigations of the kraft lignin were performed with a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a BBFO Plus double resonance probe head at 25 °C (Bruker BioSpin AG). 10–15 mg of lignin, treated as described above, was dissolved in 1500 µL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d<sub>6</sub> 99.9 atom % D Sigma-Aldrich) and transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube.
