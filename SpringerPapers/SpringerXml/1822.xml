For example, THz systems are now being tested at international airports for security screening purposes, at major medical centers for cancer and burn diagnosis, and at border patrol checkpoints for identification of concealed explosives, drugs, and weapons. Recent advances in THz applications have stimulated renewed interest regarding the biological effects associated with this frequency range. Biological effects studies are a valuable type of basic science research because they serve to enhance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that govern THz interactions with biological systems. Such studies are also important because they often times lay the foundation for the development of future applications. In addition, from a practical standpoint, THz biological effects research is also necessary for accurate health hazard evaluation, the development of empirically-based safety standards, and for the safe use of THz systems. Given the importance and timeliness of THz bioeffects data, the purpose of this review is twofold. First, to provide readers with a common reference, which contains the necessary background concepts in biophysics and THz technology, that are required to both conduct and evaluate THz biological research.

The THz region is typically defined to include the frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 10Â THz, where 1Â THz equals 10<sup>12</sup> Hz. In terms of other frequently used units, this range corresponds to the following: wavelength Î» (30â3000Â Î¼m); wavenumber <italic>k</italic> (3.3â334Â cm<sup>â1</sup>); period <italic>Ï</italic> (0.1â10 picoseconds), temperature <italic>T</italic> (4.8â478Â K), and photon energy <italic>E</italic> (0.4â41 milli-electron volts) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the energy of THz photons is several orders of magnitude below the energy level required to ionize, or remove, valence electrons from biological molecules (typically, several eVs). Thus, âT-raysâ are classified as a type of <italic>non-ionizing</italic> radiation. This fundamental distinction is important because nonionizing and ionizing radiation generate vastly different effects in biological structures. Perhaps, the most noteworthy difference is that only ionizing radiation particles carry enough energy to cause direct ionization effects to water and biomolecules. These direct effects are particularly harmful to biological structures because they result in the formation of highly reactive free radicals, which can cause secondary or indirect damage to other biomolecules. In contrast, nonionizing radiation does not generate free radicals in biological structures, but it can cause thermal effects that are indistinguishable from effects observed from bulk heating.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The Terahertz (THz) band of the electromagnetic spectrum. </p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10762_2011_9794_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>For many years, data has been scarce at THz frequencies because suitable sources were not widely available. However, a recent surge in research activity has resulted in the development of many new types of sources and components. These new THz technologies have bridged the proverbial âTHz Gap,â and are increasingly being integrated into a host of practical medical, military, and security applications. For instance, THz imaging and sensing techniques are presently used at major airports for security screening purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], at major medical centers for cancer and burn diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and at border patrol checkpoints for identification of concealed explosives, drugs, and weapons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Widespread deployment of new THz applications has prompted increased scientific interest regarding the biological effects associated with this frequency range. In recent years, many timely investigations have been performed to investigate the possible biological effects associated with THz radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Unfortunately, however, a comprehensive review has not yet appeared in the literature which both discusses the fundamental interaction mechanisms, and also critically reviews the bioeffects studies that have been conducted to date. Thus, the purpose of this review is twofold. First, to provide readers with a common reference, which contains the necessary background concepts in biophysics and THz technology that are required to both conduct and evaluate THz biological research. Second, to provide a review and analysis of the studies reported in the literature on the topic of THz bioeffects.</p><p>This review is divided into seven sections. The first section provides a general introduction to the THz spectral band. The second section describes the composition and function of biological structures: skin tissue, mammalian cells, organelles, and biological macromolecules. The third section provides an overview of the fundamental mechanisms governing the interaction of THz radiation with biological materials. It also discusses energy deposition processes and temperature transients that result from THz irradiation of materials. The fourth section summarizes the primary thermal effects that are observed in biological materials at an organism, tissue, cellular, organelle, and molecular level. The concepts described in this section are valuable because they provide the foundation to understand THz-induced effects at all levels of biological organization. In addition, they give the reader the tools to determine whether the effects observed in THz reports can be fully attributable to the temperature rise generated during exposure. The fifth section surveys the major types of THz sources, detectors, and equipment that are used in biological research. This section also addresses the common challenges and considerations that investigators face in this field. Following the description of THz technologies, the sixth section then describes our methodology to survey the literature. This section provides a comprehensive review and "study-by-study" analysis of the THz bioeffects reports that appear in the literature. The review concludes with a summary section that addresses challenges and future opportunities in this field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background: composition and function of biological structures</title><p>THz-induced biological effects are influenced by two general factors: the THz exposure parameters (i.e., frequency, power, exposure duration, etc.) and the composition and/or properties of the biological target. This section provides background on the chemical composition and function of skin, the largest and primary biological target for THz radiation. Please note, the cornea is also an important biological target for THz radiation; however, in an effort to make this section more concise we have not provided details for this tissue. This section also serves to provide the necessary foundation that is required to understand the biological origin of tissue optical properties.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human skin: structure and chemical composition</title><p>Skin consists of two primary layers: an outer epidermis and an underlying dermis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The epidermis consists of water, keratin proteins, melanin granules, and several cell types, including langerhans, melanocytes, and keratinocytes. The main function of the epidermis is to provide a physical barrier that not only protects against water loss, but also prevents harmful external agents from entering. This protective barrier is achieved by keratinocytes. Roughly 95% of all epithelial cells are keratinocytes, thus, they are the most common type of skin cell. Keratinocytes are genetically programmed to undergo a cellular differentiation process known as keratinization.

Squamous epithelial tissue consists of five distinct layers or strata: stratum corneum (sc), lucidum (sl), granulosum (sg), spinosum (ss), and basale (sb) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Keratinocytes undergo several phenotypic changes as they progress from the inner to the outer stratum. In brief, these changes include: increases in keratin production, decreases in water content, decreases in cellular metabolism, loss of nuclei and organelles, and cellular flattening.</p><p>Although keratinocytes in the sb layer are devoid of keratin, they do have high concentrations of melanin, a pigment responsible for skin color (i.e., Fitzpatrick skin type). Melanin granules are produced by melanocytes, and they are transferred to keratinocytes via cytocrine secretion mechanisms. To date, studies have not been performed to characterize the optical properties of melanin at THz frequencies; however, comparable studies have been conducted at optical frequencies. These studies report that the absorption coefficient (<italic>Î¼</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) of melanin decreases with wavelength, and can be approximated as: <italic>Î¼</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> (cm<sup>â1</sup>) = 1.70âÃâ10<sup>12</sup>âÃâ<italic>Î»</italic><sup>-3.48</sup> (nanometers, nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Assuming this trend continues into the THz region, melanin absorption is probably weak at THz frequencies (i.e., <italic>Î¼</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>ââ¤â10<sup>â4</sup>Â cm<sup>â1</sup>).</p><p>In addition to contributing to skin color, the sb layer also assists in formation of the basement membrane (BM). The BM is the layer that separates the epidermis and dermis. It consists primarily of type IV collagen, laminin, entactin, and sulfated proteoglycans. Interestingly, to date, few studies have characterized the optical properties of these biomolecules at THz frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Such information would likely improve the accuracy of computational models that are currently used to predict THz-tissue interactions.</p><p>Immediately below the epidermis lies the dermis. The dermis provides skin with shape and structural integrity, and it ranges in thickness across the human body between 0.3 and 4 millimeters (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The dermis consists of dermal fibroblasts that are anchored in an extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM consists of fibrillar collagen embedded in a ground substance material. It is interesting to note that healthy fibrillar collagen exhibits a characteristic banding pattern with a periodicity of ~60Â nm, whereas thermally damaged collagen loses this signature banding pattern. The significance of this feature will be described in greater detail in SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">4.1</xref>. Ground substance is primarily comprised of water, collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, and gylcosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are hydrophilic molecules that sequester water volumes roughly 1000 times their own volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Due to this property, large volumes of water typically reside in the ground substance of the dermis. This property is important to note because water is the primary chromophore at THz frequencies, thus, its presence strongly governs where THz energy is deposited (see Sections 3.1-3.3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Structure and chemical composition of mammalian cells</title><p>Cells in the human body come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes; however, virtually all cells share certain characteristics (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). First, all cells are enclosed by an outer protective barrier known as the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane provides a selective barrier between intracellular contents and extracellular fluids. The plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, which contains integral proteins and cholesterol. The phospholipid bilayer is comprised of two elements: hydrophilic polar heads, which are oriented towards the outer surface, and hydrocarbon tails which are present in the interior of bilayer in the interior. The degree of saturation of the carbon-carbon bonds in the hydrocarbon tails governs the structure and order of the bilayer, where saturated hydrocarbons chains are more restricted and unsaturated chains are more fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Overall, the properties and thermal sensitivity of plasma membranes depend on the cell type, exact membrane composition, and ratio of saturated versus unsaturated hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Two distinct regions exist inside the plasma membrane of all cells: cytosol and cytoplasm (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The cytosol makes up the largest volume of cells, and it is primarily composed of water, organic and inorganic ions (i.e., sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, and chloride), and cytoskeleton filaments. Cytoskeleton filaments provide structural support to cells, and they also play key roles in intracellular transport and cellular division. The cytoplasm is a thick alkaline (pH ~7.1â7.2) liquid that contains all organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Organelles are specialized membrane-bound compartments that provide vital cellular functions. The primary organelles that are present in virtually all cells are lysosomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi complex (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p><p>Lysosomes are small compartments that are responsible for digesting damaged macromolecules, which are collected during autophagy, endocytosis, and phagocytosis processes. Digestion is performed within lysosomes by lipases, proteases, and other pH-sensitive hydrolase enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Lysosomes use membrane hydrogen proton pumps to maintain their highly acidic internal environment (pHâ&lt;â4.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition to their waste disposal functions, lysosomes also assist in the sealing and repair of damaged plasma membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria are a second class of cytoplasmic organelles that are present in nearly all cells. Nicknamed âthe powerhouse of the cell,â the main function of mitochondria is to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the mitochondria, aerobic respiration mechanisms, such as the Krebâs cycle and oxidation phosphorylation, mediate the conversion of biochemical energy from nutrients and oxygen into the form of ATP. In addition to producing ATP, mitochondria also function as a transient storage site for calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>), a cation required for many cellular functions, such as signal transduction, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Calcium entry into the mitochondrial matrix is driven by a steep electrochemical proton gradient provided by the mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨<sub>m</sub>) equal to â100 to 220Â mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, maintenance of a low ÎÎ¨<sub>m</sub> is directly linked to the formation and generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, recent data suggest that ROS production increases exponentially at ÎÎ¨<sub>m</sub>âs greater than 140Â mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Overall, mitochondria play critical roles in ATP production, cellular metabolism, signal transduction, and redox (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex are the final two major cytoplasmic organelles that are present in most cells.

Scattering arises from spatial variations in the refractive index of the tissue, extracellular constituents, and mammalian cells.

Thus, scattering in biological materials is strong at visible and near-IR wavelengths, and weak at longer wavelengths.

Water exhibits many unique properties that contribute to its strong interaction with THz radiation. One such property is the ability of water molecules to readily engage in both inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding with neighboring molecules. As a result of these interactions, water molecules create extensive dynamic hydrogen bond networks that behave in a collective manner. Interestingly, the intermolecular stretching vibrations of this network, which are the origin of macroscopic water dynamics, are quite strong at a frequency of 5.6Â THz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

The sensory nerves that reside in skin perceive hyperthermia to be a harmful stimulus, and consequently respond to it by activating an acute inflammatory response. This response, which typically lasts several days, functions to not only remove injurious stimuli, but also to initiate the wound healing cascade. The cardinal signs of inflammation are: pain, heat, redness, and swelling. These signs are primarily the result of the increased blood flow that is used to facilitate the movement of white blood cells into the injured tissue region.

For these instances, tissue damage assessment requires microscopic techniques, such as transmission polarizing, transmission electron, and multi-photon microscopy. It is important to note that visible tissue damage is used as a biological endpoint for the determination of safety standards at optical and higher THz frequencies (i.e. ANSI standards).

Specifically, Dressler <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that cells exposed to 45Â°C for 30Â min exhibit a disintegrated actin network, a rough and irregular plasma membrane, a decrease in cell size, and spheroidal cell shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p>In addition to these structural and morphological effects, temperatures ranging between 43â44Â°C for 15â50Â min can also result in the impairment of cell cycle progression and/or cause the triggering of CSR mechanisms. For example, cells exposed to 45Â°C for 15Â min were observed to undergo transient G<sub>2</sub> block, while when exposed to 45Â°C for 30Â min, they exhibited a long lasting G<sub>2</sub> phase and a late S-phase block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The CSR mechanism is well documented in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and the general consensus is that cells activate these mechanisms to combat and survive hyperthermic stress. CSR mechanisms involve many intracellular pathways, including redox, DNA sensing and repair, molecular chaperones, proteolysis, energy metabolism, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Many proteins are associated with these pathways; however, a group of 44 evolutionary conserved proteins have emerged as core mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. These proteins, collectively referred to as minimal stress proteins, are significantly upregulated by cells immediately after exposure to stress. The most widely studied family of minimal stress proteins are the heat shock proteins (Hsps), which includes Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp60, and Hsp105 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, c</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells exposed severe thermal stress with temperatures greater than 46Â°C (i.e., ablative regime) exhibit gross alterations to most cellular components (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Region 3). These effects include the collapse of cellular shape, complete destabilization and disintegration of actin cytoskeleton network, rupture of both plasma and nuclear membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], and cell death via apoptotic and necrotic pathways (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, c</xref>). In general, cells preferentially activate apoptotic pathways when they have the resources available (ATP, oxygen, <italic>etc</italic>); however, when resources are unavailable, cells die via necrosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].</p><p>Finally, in addition to hyperthermia, hypothermia or cold shock temperatures can also cause severe cellular effects (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Cold shock effects are typically divided into three time-temperature categories: (i) Mild (25â35Â°C); (ii) Moderate (15â25Â°C); and (iii) Severe (0â15Â°C). Under mild cold shock conditions cells express cold-inducible proteins (CIRP), while at more moderate conditions they express both HSPs and apoptosis-specific proteins (ASPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. At this point it may not be clear to reader why we have decided to address the effects of hypothermia. The relevance and importance of hypothermia- based effects will become clearer in subsequent sections. In brief, many THz bioeffects studies expose cells under cold shock conditions, thus, knowledge of hypothermia-induced cellular effects is critical to differentiate the origin of such effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Thermal effects on cellular organelles</title><p>Hyperthermia can cause direct effects to cellular organelles. Damage to organelles is often times a direct consequent of damage to the outer membranes of each major organelle. In this section, we shall briefly describe the thermal effects that are frequently observed on the plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, lysosomes, and nucleus.</p><p>Heat can cause several changes to the plasma membrane and its interconnected actin cytoskeleton. These effects include gross morphological changes, redistribution of membrane proteins, actin-plasma membrane detachment, membrane perforation, changes in membrane permeability, and spikes in intracellular calcium levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, c</xref>). Although surprising, given the fact that the plasma membrane provides vital cellular protection, several groups have provided compelling evidence that the plasma membrane may be the most thermosensitive cellular component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In fact, a recent study showed that morphology changes were observed in cells heated at 45Â°C for 30Â min. These effects are believed to be a direct result of cytoskeleton detachment from the plasma membrane. Data from this study also showed that these effects are continuously enhanced over the 40 to 56Â°C temperature range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p>The thermal sensitivity of plasma membranes depends on the composition and properties of the local membrane. These properties depend on the levels of cholesterol, membrane proteins, and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats. Thus, since membrane composition varies with cell type, the thermal sensitivity of cells also depends on cell type. The effect that membrane composition has on thermosensitivity has been highlighted in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. These studies specifically showed that cells supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty acids had increased thermosensivity, whereas cells supplemented with saturated fatty acids had decreased thermosensivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].</p><p>Heat can cause several interrelated effects on mitochondria: (i) disrupt membrane potential (ÎÎ¨<sub>m</sub>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]; (ii) change the redox status of cells; (iii) cause increased bursts of ROS; (iv) stimulate mitochondrial enzyme activity (i.e. citrate synthase)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]; (v) inhibit ATP production; and (vi) destabilize intracellular proteins (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Membrane disruption typically does not occur under mild heat stress (40 and 45Â°C for 30Â min), but it becomes quite pronounced under severe conditions (50â56Â°C for 30Â min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Membrane disruptions are believed to be mediated via the signaling of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apopotic Bcl-2 family members, in particular caspase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In combination, these effects are believed to directly affect cellular redox, increase the generation of ROS, reduce citrate synthase activity by almost 50%, and ultimately reduce the production level of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In fact, a recent study showed that cells decrease their ATP content by nearly 60% when exposed to a 20 min heat shock at 45Â°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. These primary effects can also lead to the destabilization of both cytosolic and nuclear proteins, which can lead to activation of CSR mechanisms, and DNA damage.</p><p>Heat can cause several effects on lysosomal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Heat stress at temperatures ranging between 41 and 43Â°C for 90Â min durations can trigger increases in lysosomal enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. In addition, higher temperatures, such as 45Â°C for 90Â min, can make lysosomal membranes leaky, resulting in the release of hydrogen and hydrolytic enzymes into the cytosol. Thus, these primary effects can cause drastic secondary effects, such as proteolysis deficiencies and impaired cellular function.</p><p>The nuclear membrane has long been considered the most thermoresilinient cellular organelle. This theory seemed reasonable given the fact that temperatures of 56Â°C for 30Â min are required to puncture the nuclear membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. A more recent report, however, provided definitive evidence that the nucleolus is a repository of stress responsive proteins that are released in response to thermal stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. This work also provided evidence that a critical underlying nuclear structure, referred to as the nuclear matrix, is the most temperature sensitive subcellular component identified to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The nuclear matrix plays several vital functions, including DNA replication, RNA processing, and DNA repair. Thus, heat shock has the potential to disrupt many critical functions of the cell, and thus may be the key mechanism underlying cell death. For further details on the thermal effects of the nucleus, we refer the reader to the following articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Thermal effects on biological macromolecules</title><p>The thermal effects observed at a cellular and organelle level are a direct result of damage to intracellular biomolecules. At a molecular level, when biological tissues are heated, the ensuing temperature rises increase the kinetic energy of the tissueâs water and biomolecules. When this excitation energy exceeds the energy provided by the intramolecular bonds, which holds the molecules together, biological molecules (i.e., lipids, proteins, mRNA, DNA) undergo conformational changes and/or denature. Thermal effects to macromolecules are typically subdivided into two groups, where higher thermal ablation temperatures (50â60Â°C) cause irreversible damage, and hyperthermic temperatures (40â48Â°C) cause reversible damage. Common reversible effects include the deactivation of enzymes, protein unfolding or denaturation, and acceleration of cellular metabolism. These effects are a direct result of the disruption of the hydrogen and disulfide bonds that maintain the tertiary structure of proteins and DNA. When intracellular proteins are reversibly damaged, mammalian cells typically activate CSR mechanisms (described above) to repair the damage (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In contrast, when proteins are irreversibly damaged, cells activate proteolysis mechanisms to degrade proteins in lysosomes.

Thus, high-power THz radiation is assumed to cause thermal effects in biological materials. In addition to conventional thermal effects, however, several researchers have proposed that THz radiation may also induce low-level thermal, nonthermal, or more appropriately, microthermal effects. These theories were initially hypothesized by Frohlich <italic>et al.</italic> in 1971 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], and more recent studies propose that these microthermal effects are mediated through the direct coherent excitation of biomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] or linear/nonlinear resonance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, several research groups have conducted extensive efforts to develop more established theoretical frameworks to support the concept of ânonthermalâ effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. These studies suggest that nonthermal coupling mechanisms may be due to the fact that THz radiation (i.e., THz = 10<sup>12</sup>Â Hz) oscillates on the same time scale (picoseconds) as the natural phonon frequencies of biological molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Interestingly, these models also contend that the coupling of THz radiation to DNA may create localized openings âbubblesâ between the DNA strands. Such openings are believed to drive double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to âunzipâ and interfere with transcription processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p><p>Modern tools are not available to detect microthermal effects; therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to verify the existence of such effects experimentally. As a result, the concept of these effects has remained a constant subject of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. However, since many observed effects reported in the THz bioeffects literature cannot be readily explained by the temperature rise generated during irradiation (i.e., conventional thermal effects) we believe that it is important that the reader is aware of these potential mechanisms and effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Terahertz biological research</title><p>Although an extensive review on THz sources, detectors, and technologies is beyond the scope of this review, a brief overview of equipment commonly used in THz biological research is valuable for subsequent bioeffects discussions.

In this section, we provide an overview of the main sources, detectors, and equipment used in THz biological research. We then proceed by describing the systems and tools used to control exposure conditions and conduct dosimetry. We conclude with a section describing the common challenges faced in THz biological research.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Terahertz sources</title><p>THz sources are typically categorized according to their principle operational scheme. The most common schemes used in THz biological research are the following: (i) direct generation laser sources; (ii) solid-state electronic devices (frequency up-conversion); (iii) accelerating electrons-based sources.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Direct generation laser sources</title><p>The three most common direct generation THz laser sources are far-infrared (FIR), electrically-pumped solid state, and quantum cascade lasers. Of these, the FIR laser is the most commonly used source for THz biological research. With initial uses dating back to the early 1960âs, the FIR laser is one of the oldest THz sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. FIR lasers typically consist of the following components (i) pump source: a tunable high power carbon diode (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser; (ii) laser cavity with a vacuum envelope container to house molecular gases; (iii) gain medium: low pressure molecular gases, such as methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and (iv) intracavity waveguides to propagate THz radiation in transverse direction. In brief, lasing action is achieved using the pump laser to excite the vibrational levels of gas molecules, which have transition frequencies in the THz spectrum.</p><p>FIR lasers exhibit several characteristics that make them an ideal source for THz bioeffects studies. First, they provide high levels of average output power, with values on the order of 100Â mW at many frequency lines. Notably, these power values are the highest levels of all commercially available bench-top THz sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Second, FIRs are widely tunable to hundreds of discrete frequency lines across the THz spectral band. Fortunately for FIR users, tuning or âhoppingâ to each discrete frequency line is straightforward and is achieved by simply adjusting the pump laser wavelength, gas type and pressure. Third, FIRs generate THz radiation that is high quality, coherent, monochromatic, continuous wave (CW), and narrow linewidth (typically ~50 kHz). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, FIR sources are easy to operate and maintain. The main drawbacks of FIR lasers are their large footprint, weight, and expense. Systems can cost in excess of several hundred thousand dollars. In summary, FIR laser sources provide high output power, a wide range of operational frequencies, and high laser beam quality; therefore, they are a very attractive source for THz biological research. Such sources are particularly useful to researchers who are interested in investigating the frequency dependence of THz-induced biological effects.

Electronic devices typically consist of a microwave synthesizer or oscillator, and a frequency multiplier element, which consists of an array of schottky barrier diodes (SBDs). In brief, the oscillator functions to generate âseedâ microwave radiation, and the SBD array functions to multiply the frequency of the incoming microwave radiation to THz frequencies (i.e., frequency up-conversion)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>].</p><p>Electronic sources exhibit several design and performance features that make them useful devices for THz biological research studies. First, they are capable of providing high levels of average output power (approximately 100Â mW) at lower THz frequencies. Second, they generate narrow line-width (10<sup>â6</sup>), CW THz radiation. Finally, they are rugged, compact, and operate at room temperature. Due to the above properties, solid state electronic THz sources are frequently used in both basic and applied research. However, despite their incredible efficiency at lower THz frequencies, such approaches are limited because they are only capable of generating a milliwatt of power at higher frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In fact, recent data indicates that the output power of electronic sources drops off between 1/f<sup>2</sup> and 1/f<sup>3</sup> with increases in frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, several groups have addressed the above challenges, resulting in the generation of higher power Gunn diodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>], frequency multiplier units based on SBDs, impact ionization avalanche transit-time devices (IMPATTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>], tunneling transit time diodes (TUNNETT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>], and resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>].

Several groups are also developing more advanced frequency-multiplier systems, such as varactors and varistors. Overall, electronic solid-state devices are a reliable source of low frequency THz radiation, and they are frequently used in THz bioeffects studies. With future advances in fabrication techniques, such sources may generate higher levels of output power at higher THz frequencies, and may increased use in THz biological research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Accelerating electron-based THz sources</title><p>Accelerating electron-based THz sources, such as backward wave oscillators (BWOs) and free electron lasers (FELs), are frequently used for THz bioeffects investigations. Interestingly, despite their striking differences both in appearance and size, BWOs and FELs both function using the same general operation principle. Basically, both sources use a system of magnets and an external structure to generate, control, accelerate, collimate, and modulate an electron beam. The primary difference between these systems is that the external structure in a BWO is a comb grating, while in a FEL it is a wiggler system. In both systems, the external structure functions to create a periodic acceleration of the electrons in the beam, which in turn results in the generation of THz radiation. In the subsequent section, we shall explain several important features of BWOs and FELs.</p><p>BWOs are table-top devices that use electron-vacuum tubes to generate THz radiation. These devices are referred to as BWOs because they use an electron beam that travels in the <italic>opposite</italic> direction of a travelling EM wave. For years after their first demonstration in 1951 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>], BWOs were primarily developed and used in Russia. However, in recent years, several companies have increased their efforts to commercialize BWOs for use in the US and Europe.</p><p>Conventional BWOs consist of a magnetic housing system (~1 Tesla), high voltage power supply (typically, 2â6.5Â kV), comb grating, cooling system, waveguide, and electron gun (cathode and anode). The frequency of the wave generated by a BWO is controlled by the velocity of the electron beam. Therefore, the output THz frequency can be directly adjusted by altering the bias voltage. Conventional BWO sources are tunable over a wide range of frequencies (0.035â1.42Â THz), provide modest power levels (0.2â100Â mW), and offer narrow linewidths (1â10Â MHz).</p><p>BWOs were utilized in several of the initial THz bioeffects studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. However, these devices have several performance and commercialization drawbacks, which have greatly limited their use. First, BWOs are quite expensive because they require sophisticated engineering and development approaches. Second, they have limited portability due to their cumbersome magnetic housing system (i.e., 27 L, 100Â lbs, 1 Tesla). Finally, they have short working lifetimes (approximately 500Â h). This is primarily because electron vacuum tubes wear down quickly due to their consistent exposure to extreme temperatures (1200Â°C), voltages (6.5Â kV), and pressures (10<sup>â8</sup> Torr).</p><p>Over the past few decades, several FELs have been developed to create high power THz radiation. Four THz FELs are located in the United States (Jefferson Laboratory, University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), University of Hawaii, and Stanford University), and several are located in Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Germany, Australia, France, Russia, and Italy. THz FELs consist of two primary components: a large electron accelerator (linac or electrostatic) and a wiggler magnetic array. The electron accelerator serves to provide a relativistic electron beam, while the magnetic field of the wiggler functions to undulate the electron beam. Electron beam modulation in turn causes the oscillation of electrons, and the emission of bright THz radiation.</p><p>THz FELs are outstanding sources for bioeffects studies because they are widely tunable both in terms of frequency and in mode of operation (CW versus pulsed). For example, the THz source at Jefferson Laboratory emits very high levels of average power on the order or 40Â W, high pulse energy of roughly 3 nJ/pulse, narrow pulsewidth (350Â fs), and a 75Â MHz repetition rate (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. The primary disadvantages of FELs are the following: large footprint, require teams of researchers to run, and expensive to engineer, maintain, and operate. Despite these limitations, FELs provide the highest output power of any currently available THz source, and thus are frequently used for THz bioeffects studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Terahertz detectors</title><p>THz detectors are generally subdivided into two groups: coherent (heterodyne) and incoherent (direct) detectors. The fundamental difference between these two groups is that coherent detectors measure both the phase and amplitude of the field, whereas incoherent detectors measure only the amplitude (i.e., intensity or power) of the radiation. In general, coherent detectors are preferable in spectroscopy applications because they have a narrow spectral range and offer ultrahigh spectral resolution (Ï/âÏ ~10<sup>6</sup>). In contrast, incoherent detectors are preferable in biological research and imaging applications because they offer high sensitivity, operate over a wider spectral range, and achieve moderate spectral resolution (Ï/âÏ ~10<sup>4</sup>). These features are particularly valuable because they permit accurate power measurements at most THz frequencies, and such measurements are critical for accurate metrology, THz beam diagnostics, and dosimetric analyses.</p><p>The most common incoherent THz detectors are thermal sensors. Examples include calorimeters, bolometers, microbolometers, Golay cells, and pyroelectric devices. All thermal sensors are similar in that they each contain an absorbing element which is attached to a heat sink. The primary difference between each detector type is the means by which they measure the temperature increases. For further details on the principles of operation of thermal detectors we refer the reader to one of the following articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>].</p><p>All thermal sensors share several common strengths and weaknesses. Common strengths include high sensitivity and wide spectral range operation. One common weakness is that measurements with thermal detectors require thermal equilibrium to be achieved. This property increases the detection time required for measurements, and generally leads to lower responsitivity than coherent detectors. In addition, each thermal detector type has unique features that investigators must consider: cost, size, weight, spectral range, ease and temperature of operation, aperture size, damage thresholds, sensitivity (i.e. noise equivalent power (NEP) in WHz<sup>â0.5</sup>, and response time (ms). In the following section, we provide a brief overview for each commonly used THz thermal sensor.</p><p>Calorimeters are ideal THz detectors for several reasons: (i) one of the few calibrated detectors (i.e. NIST-traceable) that permit absolute power measurements, which are required for laboratory standards studies; (ii) calorimeters typically have large apertures, high damage thresholds, high max power densities, and low noise levels (~10Â Î¼W); (iii) large dynamic range typically from 3Â mW to 30Â W; and (iv) physical dimensions and operation: small, light, inexpensive, and operate at room temperature. The main drawback of calorimeters is their slow response time (typically, a few seconds).</p><p>Golay cells also exhibit several features that make ideal THz detectors: (i) broad operational range (0.1â10Â THz); (ii) high sensitivity with low NEP values ranging from 10<sup>â8</sup>â10<sup>â10</sup> WHz<sup>-0.5</sup>; and (iii) superior response time (typically, several ms) (iv) large dynamic range (~100Â nW-1Â mW); and (v) high responsivity (~10<sup>4</sup> V/W). The main drawbacks of Golay are their expense, large size, and low responsivity at higher THz frequencies.</p><p>Bolometers exhibit many properties that make them one of the most commonly used THz detectors for low power experiments: (i) ultrahigh sensitivity with NEP on the order of 10<sup>â11</sup> to 10<sup>â17</sup> WHz<sup>-0.5</sup>; (ii) short response time, typically ranging from 50Â ps to 1Â ns; (iii) incredible sensitivity. The primary limitations of bolometers are the following: (i) require large crysostat systems to cool detectors to temperatures between 50 to 300 mK; (ii) broad dynamic range and sensitive to all types of energy and radiation; (iii) low maximum power handling capacity on the order of 1 mW.</p><p>Pyroelectric detectors are the most widely used ambient thermal detectors for several reasons: (i) broad operational range (0.1â30Â THz); (ii) short response time, typically less than a second; (iii) high damage threshold (50Â mWÂ cm<sup>â2</sup>); and (iv) user-friendly physical dimensions and operation: small, light, inexpensive, and operate at room temperature. Pyroelectric detectors have two main limitations. First, they provide relative power measurements, and therefore must be calibrated. Second, they have small aperatures, typically several mm in diameter, which often times is on the order of the THz beam diameter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Equipment used for controlled exposures and accurate dosimetry</title><p>In order to ensure THz exposures are conducted in an accurate, controlled, and reproducible fashion, high quality <italic>in vitro</italic> THz biological studies employ several common elements. Perhaps, the most critical element is a temperature-controlled exposure chamber. Exposure chambers are either custom built using stainless steel or plexiglass materials, or they are designed using conventional cell culture incubators. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b and c contain images of a retrofitted chamber using a cell culture incubator, and a custom-designed exposure chamber, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. Chambers generally consist of an external heater, temperature controller, gas control and purging system, sapphire windows for IR measurements, operator control area, and input ports for THz radiation.</p><p>Exposure chambers serve several important purposes. First, they ensure that the biological samples are maintained under appropriate homeostatic conditions during THz exposures (typically, 37Â°C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Maintenance of homeostatic conditions is of paramount importance because mammalian cells can undergo stress responses when exposed to room temperature conditions. As a result, such conditions can lead to biological effects that may be artifacts. Thus, when exposure chambers are not employed, it becomes difficult to determine whether the observed biological effects are a direct result of the THz radiation or are due to the non-homeostatic environmental conditions. In addition to maintaining the exposure temperature, exposure chambers can also control the CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Controlling CO<sub>2</sub> levels is important because CO<sub>2</sub> levels are closely related to intracellular pH levels, which can dramatically affect the thermosensitivity of biological materials. Another reason exposure chambers are used in THz studies is that they provide a controlled-environment, which permits maximum THz delivery to the biological sample. In summary, exposure chambers are important systems for ensuring <italic>in vitro</italic> THz bioeffects studies are performed in an accurate, controlled, and reproducible manner.</p><p>Temperature measurement devices are a second common element used in THz biological research studies. Such devices are used to measure the temperature rise generated in THz-irradiated biological samples. Temperature measurements are not only useful, but are actually required for accurate dosimetric calculations. The most common devices are thermistors, thermocouples, thermopiles, and fiber optic temperature sensors. These devices are frequently employed because they are fairly accurate, measure a wide range of temperatures, and are inexpensive. However, all of these devices suffer from the same limitation, which is that they each require direct contact with the target material. Direct contact can lead to appreciable measurement errors, which are most often due to direct optical absorption into the sensor, free space antenna effects, field perturbation, and inhomogeneity in biological materials.</p><p>Due to the limitations associated with contact temperature measurement devices, several noncontact approaches have been developed for estimating temperatures with high spatial resolution. The most common examples include IR thermographic imaging and Raman spectroscopic techniques. In brief, IR cameras estimate surface temperatures using the blackbody infrared emission of the sample, while Raman techniques rely on the recording of changes in the stretching band of the hydroxyl group in water at 3100 to 3700Â cm<sup>â1</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>].</p><p>Computational M&amp;S tools are the final common element employed in most THz studies. Computational M&amp;S techniques are incredibly valuable tools, which are finding increased use in THz biological research. For example, these tools are commonly used to determine field distribution in biological materials, to calculate the expected temperature rise during THz exposures, and to predict tissue damage thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. There are many different types of modeling techniques, but the most commonly used methods are FDTD, Finite Element method (FEM), Finite Difference, and Monte Carlo. For further details we refer the reader to the following book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Challenges and considerations for conducting terahertz biological research</title><p>In order to conduct high quality THz bioeffects studies, researchers must overcome numerous challenges and address several considerations. In the previous section, we provided an overview of THz sources, detectors, exposure chambers, and dosimetric tools. From this section, the following considerations were determined to be fundamental and should be reported in all studies: (i) exposure duration and THz irradiance incident on the biological sample or subject; (ii) characterization of THz beam quality; (iii) detailed specifications of detector: temperature of operation, aperture size, damage thresholds, NEP, and response time. (iv) use of gas- and temperature-controlled exposure chambers for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies; and (v) use of empirical and computational modeling dosimetric analysis.</p><p>In addition to the above considerations, there are several other experimental design and analysis elements that must be addressed. First, several experimental controls should be included in the design of THz experiments. These include negative controls (unexposed), sham exposed samples, and positive controls (heat, UV radiation). Ideally, thermal positive controls should be examined which use temperature-time histories that are matched to those of the THz-exposed samples. Second, the population size must be appropriate, ideally determined using conventional power analysis techniques. Third, all of the following experimental details should be provided: type of THz source, frequency, operation mode (CW or pulsed), exposure duration, irradiance, temperature of exposure chamber, and dosimetric data. Finally, all samples should be coded such that the investigators are unaware of the status of the samples until all experiments and statistical analyses are completed. This approach reduces the investigatorâs bias during analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Methodology and survey of the literature</title><p>For this review, we used several online search engines, including PubMed, Springer, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify experimental studies reported on the biological effects of THz radiation. Relevant studies published on or before March 2011 were selected from peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, proceedings, and meeting abstracts. In addition, we analyzed the project summaries for the âTHz-BRIDGEâ project--the first international THz biological research project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. We also examined more recent work initiated by the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Strahlenschutz â BfS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>] and the THz-BEAM projects. We also searched for relevant publications in the journal entitled âBulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine.â We mined this particular journal because it contains the English version for many studies originally published in Russian. Additionally, we also included an analysis for studies which were only published in Russian and Chinese. Translations for these works were kindly provided by corresponding authors.</p><p>After surveying the literature, we identified a total of 46 empirical studies. In order to provide a historical perspective on trends in this field, we classified each study by the year of publication, type of THz source, frequency range, and biological model (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The data indicates that roughly 50% of the studies used FIR sources, 13% FELs, 13% klystron or BWO sources, 9% optical sources (typically Ti-Sapphire and photoconductive antennas), and 17% electronic sources (microwave generators or other frequency upconversion sources (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The data also shows that the sources used most often in recent years are FIR lasers, FELs, and electronic sources.

The data shows that roughly 40% of the studies examined effects at low THz frequencies (0.1â0.15Â THz), and roughly 40% examined effects at higher THz frequencies (2.0â7.0Â THz). Interestingly, few studies have been performed at frequencies greater than 7Â THz or for frequencies between 0.15â2.0Â THz. The data also shows that recent studies have continued to focus on both the low and middle THz frequency ranges.</p><p>FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c is a plot of the type of biological system used in each study. The data indicates that 13 publications were reported before 1996, and 32 were published after 1996. The data also shows that most THz studies have been performed on cell cultures (40%) and on isolated biological macromolecules: protein (11%), DNA (9%), and organelles (9%). The timeline suggests that in recent years research groups are conducting more <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using human subjects, rats, and mice. In the next section we shall provide a comprehensive study-by-study analysis of each study.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Comprehensive study-by-study analysis of terahertz bioeffects studies</title><sec id="Sec25"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> studies on organisms: vertebrates (humans, rats, and mice), insects, and plants</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>Study 1. To date, the only THz bioeffects study performed on human subjects was reported by Ostrovskiy <italic>et. al.</italic> in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. In this work, the authors postulated that THz radiation may be a useful treatment for burn repair and microbial dissemination. To test this hypothesis, the authors treated patients suffering from superficial and deep burns (nâ=â14 and nâ=â21, respectively) with THz radiation: 0.15Â THz, 0.03Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, 15 minute treatments, and 7â10 treatments per day. (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results of this work indicate that THz treatments enhanced the repair of localized burns by accelerating the epithelialization process. In addition, THz treatments were shown to increase microbial dissemination in deep burns by 100 to 1000 fold. Unfortunately, empirical dosimetric data is not provided in this study, but our computational models (described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]), predict that the THz-induced temperature rise is roughly 0.1Â°C. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a contains a plot with the temperature and exposure time for these exposures and conventional thermal effects. Since these exposures result in small temperature rises, thermal mechanisms are most likely not responsible for the observed effects. The authors suggest that the effects are due to the strong absorption of nitric oxide (NO) molecules at THz frequencies. In summary, this study provides evidence that THz radiation may be a useful therapy for burn care.

In 2008, Kirichuck <italic>et al.</italic> conducted the first <italic>in vivo</italic> THz bioeffects study on a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. The authors hypothesized that THz radiation may elicit effects on the functional activity of platelets. They further postulated that such effects may be sex-specific, and may be the result of the preferential interaction of THz radiation with female hormones. To test this hypothesis, the authors exposed male and female rats (nâ=â15) to THz radiation using a microwave generator: 0.15Â THz, 0.7Â mW, 0.2 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and 15 or 30Â min exposures (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Three hours post-exposure, platelet-rich plasma samples were collected and evaluated using a platelet aggregation analyzer. Data was analyzed using several statistical tests, including Shapiro-Wilks and Mann-Whitney tests. Results from this study indicate that both male and female exposed rats exhibited complete recovery of platelet aggregation. Data also showed that female rats were more sensitive to the treatment. The authors suggest that the selective absorption of metabolites (NO, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, OH<sup>-</sup>) at 0.15Â THz may contribute to the observed effects. Empirical dosimetric data is not provided in this work, but our computational models indicate the temperature rise during treatments is less than 0.1Â°C (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The authors presume that the observed effects are not mediated via thermal mechanisms.</p><p>Study 2. Similar to their 2008 work, Kirichuk <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a second study to investigate whether THz irradiated albino rats exhibited both enhanced platelet aggregation and behavioral alterations (i.e. depression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, rats were exposed to THz radiation using a microwave generator: 0.15Â THz, 3 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations of 15, 30 or 60Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Platelet aggregation was evaluated as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>], and rat behavior was examined using a maze designed to test for depression. Experiments were carried out on 75 male rats, 15 controls, and 60 experimental stress immobilized rates. Several evaluation parameters were assessed using statistical analysis tools: total test time, total number of entries and exits, and number of peepings at various positions in the maze. The results of this study indicate that rats exposed to THz radiation for 60Â min exhibited increased levels of depression and enhanced platelet aggregation. Interestingly, rats exposed to durations shorter than 60Â min did not exhibit either effect. Empirical dosimetric data is not provided in this study, but our computational models predict that the temperature rise is less than 0.1Â°C. Appreciable thermal effects are typically not observed for matched thermal exposures, thus, the mechanisms responsible for the observed effects remains unclear (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).</p><p>Study 3. Last year, Kirichuk <italic>et al.</italic> hypothesized that THz radiation may be useful for restoring lipoperoxidation (LPO) processes and antioxidant activity in rats suffering from immobilization stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. The authors tested this hypothesis by exposing male albino rats to immobilization stress using a supine fixation technique. Rats (nâ=â75) were then randomized into several groups: control, immobilized and not THz irradiated, immobilized and THz irradiated (15Â min), immobilized and THz irradiated (30Â min). THz treatments were delivered with the source described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>] using the following parameters: 0.15Â THz, 0.7Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and 15 or 30Â min exposure durations (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). After exposures, blood was extracted and evaluated using several indices for LPO and antioxidant levels: lipid hydroperoxides, SH-groups, SOD, and vitamin E. The results of this study indicate that rats exposed to THz radiation for 30Â min exhibited statistically significant changes in several intermediate products of LPO and blood antioxidant activity. Empirical dosimetric data is not provided in this study, but our modeling data predicts that the temperature rises are less than 0.1Â°C. Such exposures are not expected to cause any significant heat-induced biological effects (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The authors propose that the selective absorption by NO molecules at 0.15Â THz is partly responsible for the observed effects.</p><p>Study 4. The most recent study using a rat model was performed earlier this year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. In this work, the authors postulated that THz radiation may be an effective therapeutic tool for the treatment of hemocoagulation and/or fibrinolysis dysfunction of rats suffering from immobilization stress. To test this hypothesis, the authors exposed the skin of mongrel white rats to THz radiation using a microwave generator source and a similar immobilization stress procedure as described in Kirichuck <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>] . The following exposure parameters were used: 0.129Â THz, 0.1Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations of 5, 15, or 30Â min. Blood was collected post-exposure, and evaluated using a solar turbidimetric hemocoagulator. Several coagulation and fibrinolytic properties were assessed: activated partial thromboblastin time; international normalized ratio; fibrinogen concentration; thrombin clotting time, and factor XIII activity. The data indicates that 5Â minute exposures did not cause an effect on the evaluated parameters; however, both the 15 and 30Â minute exposures induced normalization effects on both coagulation and fibrinolysis markers. Empirical temperature data was not collected in this work, but our M&amp;S models predict skin temperature rises of less than or equal to 0.1Â°C for the 30Â min exposures. Given the thermal bioeffects data provided in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, these tissues exposed to matched temperature rises typically do not exhibit appreciable biological effects. In summary, although the exact mechanism for the effects observed in this study is not clear, this work provides evidence that THz radiation may show promise as a useful clinical tool for normalizing coagulation and fibrinolysis dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Mice (Mus musculus)</title><p>Study 1. To date, the only THz bioeffects study performed on mice was conducted in 2008 by Bondar <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. Similar to their work where they used a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>], this group postulated that THz radiation exposures may cause behavioral effects (i.e. anxiety) in mice. To test this hypothesis, the authors exposed mice (nâ=â10â12) to THz radiation: 3.6Â THz, 23.6Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations of 15 or 30Â min. The behavior of the mice was evaluated post-exposure using an elevated âplus-mazeâ designed to test for anxiety. Several parameters were quantified and analyzed with Mann-Whitney statistical approaches: total test time, total number of entries and exits, and number of peepings at various positions in the maze. The data from this study show that mice exposed to THz radiation for 15â30Â min exhibited increased levels of anxiety. The authors reported that the mechanism and physiological responses responsible for these effects is âunclear.â Given the difficulty in collecting temperature data on mobile mice, empirical dosimetry was not conducted in this study. However, we used our computational models to predict the temperate rise for a mouse receiving direct exposure to THz radiation for 30Â min. (Note: the angle of irradiation, specular loses, and the curvature of the mouse body were considered in these calculations). Our data indicates that a maximal temperature rise of roughly 2Â°C is expected for the 30Â min exposure. Although, this temperature rise is greater than in the rat studies, appreciable thermal effects are typically not observed for matched heating exposures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Insects: Fruit fly (<italic>Drosopholia melanogaster</italic>)</title><p>Study 1. In the late 1980s, Hu <italic>et al.</italic> conducted the first THz bioeffects study using a fly model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. The authors hypothesized that THz radiation may cause genetic mutations in flies. To test this hypothesis, pupae and adult flies were exposed to THz radiation using an FIR laser. The following exposure conditions were employed: (i) 2.5Â THz, power = 10Â mW, Hâ=â3.18 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>; (ii) 6.69Â THz, power =1Â mW, and Hâ=â0.95Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup> (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All exposures were conducted for 90â150Â min. The protein expression of the flies was examined post-exposure using electrophoresis gels. The results of this work indicate that both frequencies of THz radiation affect the gene expression in flies, and that these effects were most pronounced at 6.69Â THz. Interestingly, using computational dosimetric models, we predict that both the 2.52 THz and 6.69Â THz treatments would induce temperature rises in the flies of roughly 0.5Â°C for the 150Â min exposures. Given the thermal bioeffects data provided in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, the thermal history provided by these exposures is not expected to denature proteins and/or elicit CSR mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, comparable hyperthermic studies in a fly model have not been published to date.</p><p>Study 2. Ten years ago, Federov <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects that IR and THz radiation have on fly mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. In this work, the authors exposed adult larvae flies (nâ=â40â100) to THz radiation using a FIR THz laser source: 3.69Â THz, 30.0Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure duration of 60Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The authors report that larvae exposed to THz radiation enhanced the number of somatic mutations observed in flies, which were pre-exposed to gamma-radiation. Using computational dosimetric models, we predict that both of these exposures would generate temperature rises of roughly 1.25Â°C for the 60Â min exposures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Plants: Rice paddies, black beans, and wheat</title><p>Study 1. In the mid-1980s, Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> examined the effects of THz radiation using a rice paddy model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. In this study, the authors hypothesized that THz radiation may directly affect cell growth, resulting from the excitation of the electric modes of biomolecules. To test this hypothesis, the authors exposed paddy rice to THz radiation using the same source described in Hu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. The following exposure conditions were employed: (i) 2.5Â THz, power = 10Â mW, Hâ=â3.18 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>; (ii) 6.69Â THz, power =1Â mW, and Hâ=â0.95Â mWcm<sup>â2</sup> (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Exposures were conducted for 10, 20, or 30Â minutes. The rice paddies were assessed using the following criteria: breeding speed, rate of emergence, quality of rice seedlings (i.e., number of green leaves, width of stem, and number of tiller), period to turn green, length of growing period, and number of grains per stem. The experimental results of this work are the following: (i) breeding speed increased by 16â32% for 2.52Â THz and 14â30% for 6.69Â THz; (ii) rate of emergence increased by 12â20% for 2.52Â THz and 10â18% for 6.69Â THz; (iii) quality, number of green leaves, width of stem, and number of tiller all improved; (iv) period to turn green is shortened by 1.5â2.0Â days; (v) growing period reduced by 4â5Â days; (vi) number of grains per stem increased 15â28%. The authors conclude that the THz radiation can simulate the growth of rice plants. Experiments were not conducted to examine the mechanism responsible for these effects, but the authors suggest that the direct excitation of biomolecules may be a contributing factor. Interestingly, using our computational dosimetric models, we predict that both the 2.52Â THz and 6.69Â THz treatments would induce temperature rises in the rice paddies â¤0.5Â°C for the 30Â minute exposures.</p><p>Study 2. One year after conducting their initial study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>], Peng <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a similar study on black beans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. In similar fashion, the authors hypothesized that THz radiation can affect the breeding of black beans. To test this hypothesis, the authors exposed black beans to the same THz radiation exposure parameters used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. One difference between the studies is authors used longer exposure durations (15, 30, or 45Â minutes). Black beans were evaluated using the following markers: rate of seedling emergence, initiation of budding, number root nodules, number grains per stem, and length of growing period. The experimental results were the following: (i) rate of seedling emergence increased by 8â12%; (ii) budding occurred 2â3Â days earlier; (iii) number of root nodules increased by 2.15 for 2.52Â THz and 2.27 times for 6.69Â THz; (iv) number of grains per stem increased by 25%; (v) complete growing period was unchanged, lengthened, and shortened according to exposure duration. Similar to the rice study, the authors conclude that the THz radiation can simulate black bean growth. Interestingly, using our computational dosimetric models, we predict that both the 2.52Â THz and 6.69Â THz treatments would induce temperature rises in the black beans â¤0.6Â°C for the 45Â minute exposures. Given the thermal bioeffects data provided in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, these exposures are not expected to cause any significant biological effects.</p><p>Study 3. In their final published report, Xu and Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> examined the effect of THz radiation on the growth, breeding, and esterase distribution of wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. The same THz source and exposure parameters were employed as described in Hu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]; however, a lower irradiance (1Â mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and a shorter exposure duration (30Â minutes) were used. The experimental results were the following: (i) for 2.5Â THz and 6.69Â THz the rate of seedling emergence increased by 21% and 16%, respectively; (ii) rate of survival increased by 18% and 20%, respectively; (iii) stem height, length of ear, numbers of ears, grains, and produce per stem, were all increased; (iv) reduced sterility; (v) increased levels of esterase activation and activity increased by 13â20%. The authors concluded that THz radiation may mediate its effects on wheat growth via direct modulation of esterase activity.</p><p>Study 4. In the late 1980s, He and Su <italic>et al.</italic> employed a paddy rice model to examine the effect that THz radiation has on chlorophyll mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. In this study, they irradiated paddy rice to THz radiation for 10, 20, and 30Â min (as described in Hu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]). Mutations were observed for all exposures, but the highest rate of mutation was observed for the 30Â min exposures at 6.69Â THz. Definitive experiments were not conducted to elucidate the mechanism responsible for these effects, but the authors believe that the direct excitation of biomolecules may be a contributing factor. The dosimetric data we computed using our computational models predicts that both the 2.52Â THz and 6.69Â THz treatments would induce temperature rises in the paddy rice that is less than 0.5Â°C for the 30Â min exposures. Given the thermal bioeffects data provided in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, these exposures are not expected to cause any significant thermal effects in tissues or cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> studies on excised skin tissues and blood (specialized connective tissue)</title><p>Study 1. In early 2010, Dalzell <italic>et al.</italic> used computational modeling and experimental approaches to determine tissue-damage thresholds at THz frequencies for both short (several seconds) and long duration exposures (min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. For the short exposure studies, wet chamois clothes were irradiated using the FEL at Jefferson Laboratory: 0.1 to 1.0Â THz, 2.0 to 14.0 Wcm<sup>â2</sup>, and a 2s exposure duration. For the long exposure studies, freshly excised porcine skin and egg whites were exposed using a FIR THz laser: 1.89Â THz, 189.92 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and 60Â min duration. Computational modeling tools using an Arrhenius damage model were used to predict damage-thresholds. Thresholds were also empirically determined using conventional damage score determination and probit analysis techniques. Empirical dosimetery was performed for exposures using IR cameras and thermocouples.</p><p>For the short duration experiments, the tissue damage threshold (ED50) was determined to be 7.16 Wcm<sup>â2</sup>, and the final tissue temperature was shown to be 60Â°C. As expected, the data shows that increases in incident irradiance <italic>Î¦</italic> resulted in linear increases in final tissue temperatures. For the longer duration experiments using lower irradiances, the irradiated excised porcine samples did not exhibit signs of tissue damage; however, several egg white samples showed visible signs of coagulation. The dosimetric data shows that the temperature of the egg whites increased between 10â12Â°C during the 60Â min exposures. These data points are both within the damage regions that are associated with visible tissue damage (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).</p><p>Study 2. Kirichuk and Androvov <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a study to determine if THz radiation therapies could be used to treat patients with unstable angina (chest pain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. THz radiation is known to be strongly absorbed by NO; therefore, the authors hypothesized that THz treatments may be useful for the correction of blood rheology parameters. To test this hypothesis, the authors collected whole blood from normal healthy patients (nâ=â150) and patients suffering from unstable angina (nâ=â60). Blood samples were treated with Isoket (nitrate vasodilator drug) and with THz radiation (0.24Â THz, 1Â mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 15Â minute duration) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The effects of the treatment were evaluated post-exposure using several blood rheology parameters: viscosity, aggregation, and erythrocyte deformability. The results of this work indicate that THz-irradiated isokets exhibited a reduction of blood viscosity, no effect on erythrocyte aggregation, and an increase in erythrocyte deformability. The authors conclude that THz radiation may be a feasible treatment for patients suffering from unstable angina. Practically speaking, such an application would likely require fiber optics probes to directly deliver the THz energy to the blood. Temperature data was not measured in this study, but our computational models indicate that the exposures would generate negligible temperature rises (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As a result, the effects observed in this work do not appear to be caused by macroscopic bulk heating effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> studies using mammalian cells</title><p>Study 1. In 1968, Webb <italic>et al.</italic> conducted the first study to examine the effect of THz radiation on cellular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. In this work, they examined the effects of THz radiation on <italic>E. coli</italic> cell growth. Exposures were performed with a Kylstron source using the following parameters: exposure temperature (25Â°C), 0.136Â THz, Hâ=â0.22 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, exposure durations of 30â240Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Microcolony growth areas were evaluated post-exposure using time-lapse photographic techniques, and temperatures were predicted for each exposure. The results of this study indicate that THz radiation inhibited the growth of <italic>E.coli</italic> cells. The observed effects increased with exposure duration, where the 150Â minute and 240Â minute exposures reduced cell growth by two-fold and seven-fold, respectively. The authors observed a 1Â°C temperature rise during exposures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Interestingly, mammalian cells exposed to temperatures of 26Â°C for greater than 100Â min typically undergo âcold shockâ, which is reported to affect cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. Therefore, the cold shock conditions may have partly contributed to the observed reduction in cell growth.

Zalyubovskaya <italic>et al.</italic> conducted the first <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture study exploring the effect that THz radiation has on several different human cell lines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. In this work, exposures were conducted using a FIR THz source using the following parameters: exposure temperature (25Â°C), 0.89Â THz, Hâ=â0.3â1.0 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, 15Â minute exposure durations (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The authors exposed HeLa, Hep-2, and RH cell lines. In all cell lines, the authors observed several effects: destruction of cell membrane, an appearance of multinuclear cells, an increase in nuclear size, increase in cytoplasm granularity, and increased cell death. Temperature data was not collected in this study, but our computational models predict that the rise in temperature is roughly would be 1Â°C during the exposures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). The authors suggest that all of the effects are a consequent of the direct interaction of THz radiation on lipid membrane and DNA.</p><p>Study 3. In 1975, Blackman <italic>et al.</italic> conducted an <italic>in vitro</italic> study in an attempt to replicate the work conducted by Webb <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. The authors used the same cell lines, THz source, and evaluation criteria as described in Webb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In contrast to the results observed in Webb <italic>et al</italic>., Blackman reported that THz radiation did not cause any appreciable effects on cell growth.</p><p>Study 4. Berns and Bewley <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the effect that 1.5Â THz radiation has on DNA synthesis in rat kangaroo kidney epithelium cells lines (PtK2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]. Experiments were conducted on cells at room temperature (25Â°C) using the FEL at UCSB. The exposure parameters were the following: 1.5Â THz, 2Â Î¼s pulse length, 2.6Â mJ per pulse, beam radius 0.4Â cm, 10â100 total pulses, 6s between pulses, 100Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>, average power of 0.1Â mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and exposure durations of 1â10Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Cellular morphology and DNA synthesis of the cells were examined using [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine isotopes, standard light microscopy, and autoradiographic analysis techniques. Temperatures were not measured during exposures, but the authors used computational methods to predict the temperature rise during irradiation. The data shows that 7% of the THz-exposed cells exhibited signs of cell death. Additionally, morphological changes were observed immediately (30Â minutes) post-exposure. The DNA synthesis results show that 17% of cells exposed to 100 pulses scored positive for âlightâ [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine staining, compared to only 11% of control cells. This data suggests that THz-exposed cells exhibited statistically significant increases in inhibition of DNA synthesis. The authors conducted several additional studies to investigate the mechanism for these effects, and concluded that the target is not the lipid membrane but rather DNA. The authors predicted that the temperature rise during exposures was 2.96Â°C (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).</p><p>Study 5. In 1990, Berns and Bewley <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a follow-up investigation to their 1987 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. In this work, they further hypothesized that THz radiation may elicit varied effects on the inhibition of DNA synthesis in synchronized versus asynchronized cells. To test this hypothesis, they exposed both synchronous and asynchronous Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>) to THz radiation. They employed the same FEL source as described in their previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]; however, the exposure parameters were slightly different: 1.5Â THz, 2Â Î¼s pulse length, repetition rate of 0.5â0.33Â Hz, 2.6Â mJ per pulse, beam radius of 0.0135Â cm, 100 total pulses, 1.3Â kW/pulse, and exposure duration of 5Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The authors used the same DNA analysis techniques described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]. The data indicates that synchronous and asynchronous THz-exposed cells both exhibited inhibition in DNA synthesis. In line with their hypothesis, synchronous cells exhibited higher levels of inhibition than the asynchronous cells, 22% versus 17%, respectively. During these short exposures, the authors predicted that the maximum temperature rise during THz irradiation was 2.96Â°C (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). The authors conclude that the observed effects are likely not âthermally mediated.â</p><p>Study 6. In 1991, Kiselev <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated the effects of THz radiation on the cellular production of hemolysins in rats immunized with staphylococcal vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. The authors isolated immunocompetent spleen cells from the spleen of the rats and then studied the effect that THz-exposed staphylococcal corpuscular antigens have on the production of hemolysinsâsubstances produced by staphylococci bacteria that lyse red blood cells. Exposures were conducted using a FIR THz source using the following parameters: exposure temperature (25Â°C), 0.89Â THz, Hâ=â0.06â0.25 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and 15Â min duration (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The authors observed that the THz exposures using lower irradiances (0.06â0.125 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>) induced moderate stimulation of hemolysins production by rat spleen cells, whereas higher irradiances (0.25 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>) caused a decrease in production. The authors report that the mechanism responsible for this âwindowâ effect is not clear. In addition, although the authors do not report temperature measurements, our computational models predict that the temperature rise is less than a 1Â°C during exposures (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Study 7. In 1994, Berns <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a third set of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>]. Similar to previous work, they hypothesized that THz radiation may elicit varied effects on the inhibition of DNA synthesis in synchronized versus asynchronized cells. They tested this hypothesis using both synchronous and asynchronous CHOPTK2 cells. The same evaluation techniques, FEL THz source, and exposure parameters were employed as described in Berns <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>] (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As shown in previous studies, the data shows that synchronous and asynchronous THz-exposed cells both exhibited significant DNA synthesis inhibition. Compared to the controls, the synchronous cells exhibited higher levels of inhibition than the asynchronous cells, 22% versus 17%, respectively. During these short exposures, the authors predicted that the temperature rise was 2.96Â°C (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).</p><p>Study 8. In a follow-up study to Kiselevâs work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>], Makolinets <italic>et al.</italic> conducted an <italic>in vitro</italic> study to explore the effect that THz radiation has on the migration ability of both healthy and immunocompromised rat spleen cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. Exposures were conducted using a FIR THz source using the following exposure parameters: exposure temperature (25Â°C), 0.89Â THz, Hâ=â0.13â0.25 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and 15Â minute duration (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The authors evaluated the migration ability of the cells post-exposure, and the data indicates that the migration ability of the cells was enhanced by exposure to THz radiation. Although the authors do not report temperature measurements, our computational models predict that the rise in temperature is less than a 1Â°C during exposures.</p><p>Study 9. In 2002, Hadjiloucas <italic>et al.</italic> examined the effect that THz radiation has on the growth rate of yeast cells (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. Cells were exposed at room temperature (25Â°C) using a BWO THz source: 0.2â0.35Â THz, 5.8 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations = 30, 60, 90, 120, or 150Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Microcolony growth areas were evaluated post-exposure using time-lapse photographic techniques, and temperatures were measured before, during, after exposure. The results of this work demonstrated that the cells exposed to THz radiation exhibited statistically significant increases in cell growth. For the 150Â min exposure, the authors observed a 2â3Â°C temperature rise (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Interestingly, mammalian cells exposed to temperatures of 27â28Â°C for greater than 100Â min typically undergo âcold shockâ, affecting cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. However, since yeast cells were used in this work, it is not clear what the impact of the cold shock would be on them. Therefore, the observed effects on growth rate may be contributed to both the THz exposure and the stress induced by the cold shock.</p><p>Study 10. In 2003, in one of the initial studies of the THz-Bridge project, Clothier and Bourne <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the effect that THz radiation has on human keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Keratinocytes were isolated from human skin samples, plated in polystyrene culture plates, and exposed at a temperature of 22Â°C using a Ti-Sapphire laser and optical excitation methods. Exposure parameters were the following: 0.1â2.7Â THz, power = 1Â mW, beam spot 0.1Â cm<sup>2</sup>, Hâ=â10 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations = 10, 20, 30Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Three samples were used for each exposure condition. Cellular viability was examined post-exposure using conventional assays. Data was analyzed using several statistical analysis techniques, including repeat measurement ANOVA and Dunnetts post hoc test. The authors report that THz-exposed cells did exhibit subtle increases in resazurin reduction, but these effects were not statistically significant when compared to control cells. The authors conclude that ânormal keratinocytes do not appear to be adversely affected by THz radiation.â</p><p>Study 11. In 2007, Federov <italic>et al.</italic> published a scientific proceeding that detailed the cellular effects observed in several cell lines exposed to THz radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. In this work, human red blood cells and lymphocytes were exposed to THz radiation provided by a FIR THz laser source (NH<sub>3</sub> media and N<sub>2</sub>O optical pump). The following exposure parameters were used: exposure temperature (25Â°C), 3.68Â THz, 20Â mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, exposure durations of 30â90Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Several markers were evaluated post-exposure, including cell death, cell proliferation, and lipid membrane permeability. The data from this work demonstrated that THz-exposed red blood cells exhibited increases in both cellular proliferation and membrane permeability. Additionally, the THz-exposed lymphocytes exhibited increases in cellular proliferation and 38% of the exposed cell population died post-exposure. The authors did not measure the temperature rise during exposures, but our models indicate that the rise is less than or equal to 1.5Â°C (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).</p><p>Study 12. In 2008, Clothier and Bourne <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a follow up investigation to their 2003 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. In this study, they investigated the effect that THz radiation has on several human cells lines: human epithelial keratinocytes, corneal, and ND7/23 cells. The cells were exposed at 22Â°C using a pulsed THz source with the following exposure parameters: 0.14â0.15Â THz, 80Â ns pulse duration, 24â62 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations from 10 to 1440Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Cellular viability, differentiation, membrane barrier permeability, heat shock protein, and glutathione (GSH) expression were examined post-exposure using conventional assays. The authors report that all THz-exposed cells did not exhibit detectable alterations.</p><p>Study 13. In 2008, Olshevskaya <italic>et al.</italic> examined the direct effects that THz radiation have on isolated neurons from <italic>Lymnaea stagnalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Exposures were conducted with a THz FEL using the following exposure parameters: frequencies of 0.7, 2.49, and 3.69Â THz; Hâ=â0.3â30 mWcm<sup>2</sup>, exposures â¥1Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The following effects were examined post-exposure: cell growth, neural network regeneration, cell adhesion, cell morphology, intracellular structural damage, and ability to maintain membrane potential. For all frequencies tested, the authors observed that THz radiation impacted cells in a dose-dependent manner, where subtle effects appeared at lower irradiances (â¤1.0 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>), and pronounced effects at higher irradiances (â¥30 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>) Specifically, the most significant effects were to cellular growth, adhesion (70â80% of exposed population), membrane morphology, intracellular structures, and neural resting membrane potential. Although temperatures were not measured in this study, our computational models predict that during exposures the temperature of the nerves increased by 2.0Â°C. Given the short duration of these exposures, significant thermal effects typically do not result from such conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>); therefore, the mechanism responsible for the observed effects remains unclear.</p><p>Study 14. Over the past few years, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has conducted several experiments to examine the biological effects of THz radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. The primary goal for these studies was to examine the cellular response of human mammalian cells exposed to high-power THz radiation using an optically-pumped molecular gas THz laser. In their first <italic>in vitro</italic> study, they exposed human dermal fibroblasts in a temperature-controlled chamber to THz radiation (2.52Â THz, 84.8 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, durations: 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80Â min) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. To evaluate the temperature rise during their THz exposures they employed computational and empirical dosimetric techniques: FDTD modeling approaches, infrared cameras, and thermocouples. Cellular viability was assessed using conventional viability assays. The transcriptional activation of heat shock proteins and DNA sensing genes was evaluated using conventional qPCR techniques. In order to compare the THz-induced cellular responses, they also conducted comparable analyses for hyperthermic positive controls (39.8Â°C for 80Â min) with matched thermal histories.</p><p>Data from this work shows that the computational and empirical dosimetric data were in agreement, and that the temperature of the cells increased by 2.9Â°C during each exposure. The viability data indicate that the percent of cell death increased with exposure duration, and was maximal for the 80Â min exposure (5% cell death). Interestingly, the percent of cell death and fold-increase of the heat shock proteins were comparable for both the THz and hyperthermic positive controls. In addition, the data showed that none of the DNA repair genes were up-regulated in the THz-exposed samples. The authors conclude that the results of this work suggest that the biological effects generated by THz radiation appear to be primarily photothermal in nature.</p><p>Study 15. Building on their preliminary investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>], this group conducted a follow-up study to further examine the cellular response to THz radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Specifically, several improvements were made to their previous approach: (i) computational and empirical dosimetric methods were refined; (ii) to increase statistical power of results: increased the number of samples exposed to both THz radiation and to hyperthermic stress; (iii) increased number of qPCR experiments to examine the gene expression of primary heat shock proteins and DNA repair sensing genes; (iv) conducted comparable analyses for well-established genotoxic controls (UV radiation) to closely examine effects of THz on DNA; and (v) evaluated and compared genetic response of cells exposed to THz, hyperthermic, and genotoxic stress. Aside from these differences, this work was conducted using the same cell line, THz source, dosimetric techniques, cellular response evaluation methods, and exposure parameters as described in Wilmink <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. The results of this work indicate that cellular temperatures increased by 2.9â3.0Â°C during all THz exposures. In addition, for each exposure duration tested, the THz and hyperthermic exposure groups exhibited equivalent levels of cell death (â¥10%) and 4-fold increases in heat shock protein expression. The qPCR data showed that the expression of cyclin E (CCNE2), a signature DNA sensing and repair gene, was unchanged in both the THz and heat shock exposure groups; however, appreciable increases (40-fold) were observed in the genotoxic controls (UV radiation). The authors conclude that dermal fibroblasts exhibited comparable cellular and molecular effects when exposed to THz radiation and hyperthermic stress, and that the effects observed are primarily thermal in nature.</p><p>Study 16. In a third THz bioeffects study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], this group sought to answer two fundamental questions. First, do cells exposed to high-power THz radiation die via necrotic or apoptotic mechanisms? Second, do human cells express a signature gene expression profile when exposed to THz radiation? In this study, death thresholds and gene expression profiles were evaluated for several human cell lines exposed to high-power THz radiation (2.52Â THz, 227 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, exposure durations: 5â40Â min). Necrotic and apoptotic death thresholds were determined for Jurkat suspension cells using MTT viability assays and flow cytometric techniques. In addition, confocal microscopic techniques were used to demarcate lethal spatial regions in a monolayer of dermal fibroblasts exposed to THz radiation. To determine if cells exhibit a THz-specific gene expression signature, we exposed dermal fibroblasts to THz radiation and analyzed their transcriptional response using a state-of-the-art microarray gene chip: GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Asuragen Inc, Austin, TX). This array offers comprehensive coverage of the expression level of over 47,000 transcripts and variants, including 38,500 well-characterized human genes.</p><p>The MTT viability data showed that 82% of the Jurkat cells died from the 40Â min THz exposure, while the flow cytometry data showed that only 62% of the cells died from the exposure. The flow data also indicated that 32% of the dying cells exhibited early signs of apoptosis and 30% showed signs of necrosis. This data provided evidence that THz-induced cell death was mediated using both necrotic and apoptotic processes. The confocal microscopy data demonstrated that THz-exposed cells exhibited increased lipid membrane permeability. Last, the microarray data showed that dermal fibroblasts activated many of the fundamental cellular stress response pathways when exposed to THz radiation. In addition, the data indicated that several unique genes (i.e. cytokines, interleukins, apoptosis), which were not expressed in hyperthermic controls, exhibited pronounced expression in THz-exposed cells. Overall, this work indicates that THz-induced cell death is mediated via both apoptotic and necrotic pathways. In addition, several genes appear to be preferentially expressed by cells exposed to THz radiation. This group also speculates that the identified up-regulated genes may serve as candidate biomarkers for THz exposures.</p><p>Study 17. In a recent study, Bock <italic>et al.</italic> examined the effect that THz radiation has on cellular gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. In this study, microarray gene chip and PCR analyses were performed on mouse stem cells exposed to broadband THz radiation generated with frequency mixing techniques. Exposure conditions were the following: broadband THz radiation (centered at 10Â THz), 1 mWcm<sup>-2</sup>, repetition rate of 1Â kHz, pulse duration 35Â fs, 1Â Î¼J/pulse, and exposure durations: 120, 240, 360, and 540Â min). Temperature of the cells was measured before, during, and after exposures. Three independent measurements were performed and each was conducted in duplicate. All exposures were conducted at an ambient temperature of 26.3Â°C.</p><p>The authors report that no morphological effects were observed in all THz-exposed cells. However, they do indicate that âlipid droplet-like inclusionsâ did appear in the cytoplasm after 6Â h of THz irradiation. Such effects were not observed in the shorter exposures, and the authors conclude that their appearance is dose dependent. Using IR cameras, the authors report a 0.3Â°C temperature rise in exposed cells. The authors report that the microarray data indicates that stem cells exhibit differential gene expression when exposed to THz radiation. The data shows roughly 6% of the differentially expressed genes increase in expression, 5% decrease, and 89% remain unchanged. The RT-PCR data confirmed that several genes were increased by up to 14-fold post-exposure: Adiponectin, GLUT4, FABP4, and PPARg. Additional experiments further confirmed that these changes in gene expression were time-dependent and were maximal for the 540Â min exposure. Overall, this study provides evidence that cells exposed to THz radiation appear to differentially express several genes. Since the temperature rise is marginal during all exposures, it appears that other mechanisms may be responsible for the observed effects. The authors speculate that the observed effects may be in part due to the direct activation of transcription factors, and in particular for the promoter of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG).</p><p>Study 18. Earlier this year, Federov <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>] to examine the response of hamster fibroblasts exposed to THz radiation generated from a FIR source, as described in Federov <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. Cells were exposed at a frequency of 3.68Â THz, power of 20Â mW, and exposure duration of 30, 60 or 90Â minutes. Cellular activity was evaluated using conventional viability assays to measure the optical density of formazan crystals in mitochondria. The data indicates that cells exposed to THz radiation exhibited no significant signs of damage or cellular activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> studies on lipid membranes</title><p>Study 1. In 2007, Ramundo-Orlando <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a series of experiments to explore the effect that pulsed THz radiation has on lipid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The authors hypothesized that THz radiation may cause rearrangement of the lipid bilayer that may lead to increases in membrane permeability. They tested this hypothesis using two types of enzyme-containing cationic liposomes: dipalymitoyl phoshatidylchonie (DPCC) and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylchonine (POPC). Both liposomal models were loaded with carbonic anhydrase (CA) and the substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) was added to the bulk aqueous phase. When liposomes were exposed to THz radiation, the trapped CA converts the p-NPA molecules into product with a peak absorbance at 400Â nm, which was assessed using a spectrometer. The authors examined these effects using two THz sources: (1) compact FEL (cFEL) operating in pulsed mode: 0.13Â THz, repetition rates of 5, 7, or 10Â Hz, 50Â ps pulse duration, 5â17 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, exposure duration 2Â min; (2) IMPATT THz source operating in CW: 0.15Â THz, 6.2 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations of 2 to 3Â min (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Results of this study indicate that liposomes exposed to CW irradiation did not exhibit increases in membrane permeability, but both liposomal models showed 2-fold increases in permeability when exposed to pulsed THz radiation (7â10Â Hz and â¥7.7 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>). Curiously, the observed effects were maximal at 7-Hz (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). The authors believe these effects may result from resonance-like mechanisms. They observed similar effects in a previous study where they used 7Â Hz magnetic fields and the same liposomal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. In this study, the authors reported small increases in temperature (0.05Â°C) during all exposures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Dressler <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that thermal stress protocols (51Â°C for 2Â min) can cause significant effects to plasma membrane; however, they did not observe these effects at lower temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Assuming liposomal membranes have comparable thermosensitivies as cellular plasma membranes, the results of this work indicate that the membrane effect observed could be considered ânonthermalâ and are ânot simply caused by heating.â Overall, this is a well-designed study, the authors used a sufficient sample size (nâ=â5â16), tested multiple THz sources using various repetition rates, employed appropriate experimental controls, conducted empirical dosimetry, and conducted sufficient statistical analyses.

The goal for this study was to examine the effects of THz radiation as a function of electric field. Using similar approaches described in Ramundo-Orlando <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], they examined the rate of p-PNA hydrolysis as a function of high electric field (1.0â3.0Â kVcm<sup>â1</sup>) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Data from this work indicates that the permeability of liposomes increases as a function of electric field. These effects were maximal between 2.6â2.7Â kVcm<sup>â1</sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). The authors believe the observed effects may result from the ârectification of THz pulses by liposomes.â The temperature rise during these exposures is assumed to be comparable to that observed in their previous study (~0.05Â°C) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Overall, this is a well-designed study, but several specific experimental details were omitted (i.e., sample population size, statistical approach, and beam diameter). These details would be helpful for more accurate dosimetry, and in particular for determining the THz irradiance incident on the membrane.</p><p>Study 3. In 2010, Wilmink <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects that THz radiation have on the lipid membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. The primary goal for these studies was to use infrared microthermographic techniques and fluorescence imaging methods to explore the effect that THz radiation has on the cellular membrane permeability. To examine these effects, dermal fibroblasts were plated in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes and treated with THz radiation (2.52Â THz, 227 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure duration of 0.2Â min). Cells were stained with propidium (PI) and FITC-AV-PS (Annexin V-phosphatidyleserine), and imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710) In brief, PI is impermeable to healthy cells, but is permeable to exposed or porated cells. In contrast, in healthy cells PS resides on the inner leaflet of the membrane, while in stressed cells, PS is externalized and readily binds to FITC-AV (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c, d</xref>). Microthermographic infrared images were also collected for the THz-exposed cells.</p><p>The data shows that THz irradiation increased the temperature of the cells by 6Â°C (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). Fluorescent images were collected at 5 spatial regions, from the center to the periphery of the laser beam footprint. Cells positioned at the center of the THz beam footprint stained positive for both PI and PS, whereas cells at the periphery stained negative for both PI and PS. In addition, few control cells stained positive for both PI and PS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy data showed that cells exposed to THz radiation for 12 seconds or less stained negative for both PI and FITC-AV; whereas exposures greater than 12 seconds stained positive for both PI and FITC-AV. The results of this work suggest high-power THz radiation may cause direct effects to the plasma membrane of human cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> studies on biological macromolecules</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>DNA damage assessment / genetic toxicology</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are only 4 studies published in the literature where investigators have examined the extent of DNA damage in cells exposed to THz radiation.</p><p>Study 1. In 2003, Scarfi <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a study associated with the THz-Bridgeprogram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to investigate the effect of THz radiation on blood samples. In this study, peripheral blood samples were collected from 9 healthy human volunteers. Samples were exposed to 0.12 or 0.13Â THz generated from a FEL source using following operating conditions: pulsed wave, 50 pulses, 4Â Î¼s duration, 330 pulses interval, 1 or 0.6Â mW power, 1.2 or 0.72 J energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Exposures were conducted at room temperature for 20Â min. Aliquots of untreated blood samples were used as controls. The results showed that the number of micronuclei (MN) in THz-exposed and sham-exposed control cells was comparable. In addition, THz exposure did not affect the kinetics of lymphocyte proliferation. The authors conclude that the results of this report suggest that THz radiation does not cause chromosomal damage to lymphocytes. They also conclude that due to their small sample size, their results do not provide definitive conclusions, and they recommend that similar studies be performed using a larger sample size.</p><p>Study 2. In 2007, Zeni <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a study within the framework of the THz-Bridgeprogram to examine the genotoxic effects of THz radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For this study, they obtained human blood lymphocytes from healthy human volunteers (nâ=â17). Samples were irradiated at room temperature (23Â°C) using a compact FEL laser source with the following conditions: 0.12 or 0.13 THz, 4Â Î¼s pulse duration, repetition rate of 1â10Â Hz, average power of 0.6â5.0Â mW, irradiance of 0.05â0.23 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, peak electric fields 130â193Â V cm<sup>â1</sup>, and specific absorption rates of 0.24â2Â W kg<sup>â1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Primary DNA damage (single strand breaks, SSB) was assessed using alkaline comet assays, and the incidence of MN was determined using conventional cytochalasin-block techniques. Using first principles, the authors predict that the temperature rise in the cells was roughly 0.35Â°C. The authors report that differences between the THz and control samples were not statistically significant. In addition, the cell cycle kinetics of the proliferating lymphocytes were not affected by the THz exposure.</p><p>Study 3. In 2008, Korenstein-Ilan <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a THz genotoxicity study in conjunction with the THz-Bridgeprogram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this work, human blood lymphocytes were exposed in an incubator (37âÂ±â0.03Â°C) to CW THz radiation using an electronic, frequency up-conversion THz source. The following exposure parameters were used: 0.1 THz, 0.031 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations ranging from 60, 120, and 1440Â min. The authors employed both empirical and computational dosimetric techniques to measure the THz-induced temperature rise during exposure. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques were used to determine the incidence of aneuploidy with centromere-specific probes for chromosomes 1, 10, 11, and 17.</p><p>The results were the following: (i) chromosomes 11 and 17 were most vulnerable (about 30% increase in aneuploidy after 2 and 24Â h of exposure); (ii) chromosomes 1 and 10 were not affected; (iii) asynchronous mode of replication of centromeres was increased by 40% in chromosomes 11, 17 and 1 after 2Â h of exposure, and was increased by 50% in all four centromeres after 24Â h of exposure. The authors report that âour results demonstrate that exposure of lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> to a low power density of 0.1Â THz radiation induces genomic instability. These findings, if verified, may suggest that such exposure may result in an increased risk of cancer.â These observations and statements must be viewed with caution. The authors have stimulated the lymphocytes with PHA for 1â6 hours before exposures to THz for 1, 2 and 24 hours. During this period (1â6 hours before THz exposure +1, 2 and 24 hours of THz exposure) the cells will still be in G0-G1-S-phase stage of the cell cycle, assuming the G1-phase takes 6â8 hours and the S-phase takes 24â30 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>]. The G2-phase of the cell cycle typically begins 45Â h after initial culture, and during cell division/mitosis the spindle acts to segregate the chromosomes equally into 2 daughter cells. It is well known that aneuploid cells can arise as a consequence of disturbances in spindle action(s) leading to unequal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells. Per the experimental protocol used by the authors, THz exposures might not have acted directly on mitotic spindles to induce aneuploidy when PHA-stimulated lymphocytes (1â6 hours) were exposed for 1, 2 and 24 hours. Moreover, the incidence of MN, which are caused by spindle disturbances as well as from broken chromosomes, are reported to occur in roughly 9.0âÂ±â8.0 in 8,667 samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>]. Assuming that all aneuploid cells recorded by the authors eventually appeared as micronucleated lymphocytes, the overall incidence of aneuploidy of all chromosomes (1, 10, 11 and 17) in 24 hour THz-exposed and sham-exposed control cells reported by the authors was 10.6âÂ±â5.5% and 9.0âÂ±â5.2%, respectively. These indices are within the spontaneous levels reported in the historical data base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>]; thus, this data may be interpreted as an absence of significantly increased aneuploid cells following exposure to THz.</p><p>Study 4.

Exposures were conducted at room temperature for 20Â minutes. To examine conformational changes in DNA, the authors used UV spectroscopy. The data shows that THz radiation caused changes in the optical density of the nucleotides at UV wavelengths. These effects were observed to be dose-dependent and the spectral changes were most pronounced at wavelengths between 190â220Â nm and 240â280Â nm. These results provide evidence that THz radiation may cause conformational or structural changes to DNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Enzyme activity</title><p>Study 1.

The authors exposed biomolecules to irradiation using a FIR THz source with the following operating conditions: 3.33Â THz, 5Â mJ per pulse, 40â600 pulses, and a total energy of 0.2 to 3 J. Rate reaction measurements were conducted using a UV spectrophotometer, and protein structure was assessed using a circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (290Â nm). The data shows that enzyme activity was dependent on the dose of THz irradiation. The authors report that structural changes (i.e., alpha helices and random coils) were observed in albumin exposed to THz radiation. The authors conclude that this data suggests that THz radiation can exert structural changes in proteins.</p><p>Study 2. In 2009, Homenko <italic>et al.</italic> examined the direct effects of THz radiation on two enzymatic processes: (i) the interaction of soluble or immobilized alkaline phosphatase (AP) with the substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate; and (ii) the interaction between an antibody and its antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Both enzymatic processes were exposed to THz radiation generated using an electronic, frequency multiplier THz source. The following exposure conditions were employed: 0.1Â THz, 0.08 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure durations of 60â120Â min. The data shows that the effects of THz radiation on soluble AP are not statistically significant. Immobilization of the enzyme also appeared to make AP less prone to the effects caused by the THz exposures. In contrast, the authors reported that THz radiation did, in fact, cause statistically significant decreases in the interaction of the antibody-antigen complex. The authors conclude that âexposure to low level THz radiation may interfere with the interaction of protein recognition molecules, such as enzymes and anitbodies with small molecular substrates.â</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Albumin</title><p>Study 1.

In this work, the authors exposed lypholized bovine serum albumin (BSA) to THz radiation using a FIR THz source (3.6Â THz, 10 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, 60Â min). The effects on BSA spectra were evaluated using UV absorption spectrophotometer and a circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded repeatedly 30, 60, 120, and 150Â min post-exposure. The data shows that THz radiation causes statistically significant changes to the UV and CD spectra of albumin. These effects are dose-dependent, and the authors contend that these effects suggest that the spectral changes are indicative of conformational changes in the protein molecule resulting from exposure to THz radiation.</p><p>Study 2.

The effects on BSA spectra were evaluated using a UV absorption spectrophotometer. The data reported indicates that THz radiation causes statistically significant changes to the UV spectra of albumin, and that these effects are most pronounced in the 240â290Â nm range. The authors conclude that these effects are a result of preferential absorption of the hydration shell surrounding the BSA molecules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Hemoglobin</title><p><italic>Study 1</italic>.

In this work, the authors irradiated Hb bonds to THz radiation provided by a BWO source: 2.65Â THz and 3.33Â THz, 3 mWcm<sup>â2</sup>, and exposure duration of 240Â min. Interestingly, the data shows that THz radiation caused an increase in Hb bond strength at 3.33Â THz, and a decrease in bond strength at 2.65Â THz. The authors hypothesize that the observed effect is a result of linear or nonlinear resonance effects.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Summary &amp; future prospects</title><p>Knowledge of the biological effects associated with THz radiation is critical for proper health hazard evaluation, development of empirically-based safety standards, and safe exploitation of new THz devices and applications. The studies reviewed in this report provide data on the effects of THz radiation at an organism, tissue, organelle, cellular, and biomolecular level. Each publication was critically analyzed and the effects observed have been summarized.</p><p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies conducted on vertebrates (i.e., humans, rats, and mice), THz treatments stimulated wound repair, enhanced microbial dissemination, increased fibrinolysis factors, and reduced platelet aggregation. In contrast, for the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using fruit flies, THz exposures induced differential expression of several proteins. In the studies using a plant model, exposures stimulated the growth of paddy rice, black beans, and wheat. In the <italic>ex vivo</italic> tissue studies, visible tissue damage was observed after exposures to short duration (2 seconds), high-power THz radiation (7.16 Wcm<sup>â2</sup>).</p><p>In several <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture studies, low doses of THz radiation stimulated cellular proliferation, whereas higher exposures caused visible morphological changes, induction of cellular stress response mechanisms, and cell death. THz radiation (both CW and pulsed) caused direct effects on the plasma membrane: increases in membrane permeability, membrane reorganization, and destruction. For the studies examining the effects on biomolecules, THz exposures were observed to affect both the structure and functional activity of several enzymatic processes. Finally, the majority of the genotoxicity studies performed to date show that THz radiation does not cause adverse effects to DNA structure or function.</p><p>In future studies, special care should be placed to address several key elements. In particular, sufficient details need to be provided regarding THz sources, detectors, exposure chambers, and dosimetric tools. Specifically, the following details are fundamental: (i) exposure duration and incident THz irradiance on biological sample; (ii) characterization of THz beam quality; (iii) detailed specifications of the detector (i.e., temperature of operation, aperture size, damage thresholds, sensitivity (NEP), and response time). (iv) use of gas- and temperature-controlled exposure chambers for <italic>in vitro</italic> exposures; and (v) use of empirical and computational modeling dosimetric analysis.</p><p>In addition to these fundamental considerations, emphasis should be placed to ensure that the experimental design and analysis is sufficient. Specifically, the following considerations should be addressed: (i) experimental design includes several experimental controls: negative controls (unexposed), sham exposured samples and positive controls (heat, UV radiation); (ii) the proper population size is selected using statistical power methods; (iii) all in vitro exposures should be conducted in temperature-controlled exposure chambers; and (iv) all experimental details regarding source, detector, and exposure conditions are provided, including type of THz source, frequency, operation type (CW or pulsed), repetition rate, pulse duration, exposure duration, irradiance, temperature of exposure chamber, and dosimetric data.</p><p>In summary, the use of the above practices should help reduce the number of confounding variables. These measures will hopefully help ensure that effects observed in future studies are fully attributable to the THz radiation. Such measures will also help provide researchers with more definitive evidence as to whether the observed effects are due to the macroscopic thermal effects associated with the exposures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>We wish to thank the National Academy of Sciences NRC Research Associateship program and the Air Force Research Laboratory for providing the opportunity to conduct this study.
