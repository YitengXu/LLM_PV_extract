The MMS mission was launched on March 12, 2015. The MMS mission consists of four identically instrumented spin-stabilized observatories which are flown in formation to perform the first definitive study of magnetic reconnection in space. The MMS mission was presented with numerous technical challenges, including the simultaneous construction and launch of four identical large spacecraft with 100 instruments total, stringent electromagnetic cleanliness requirements, closed-loop precision maneuvering and pointing of spinning flexible spacecraft, on-board GPS based orbit determination far above the GPS constellation, and a flight dynamics design that enables formation flying with separation distances as small as 10 km. This paper describes the overall mission design and presents an overview of the design, testing, and early on-orbit operation of the spacecraft systems and instrument suite.</p></abstract><kwd-group

explosively in the magnetotail (Burch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>, this issue). MMS accomplishes this investigation by creating an in-situ laboratory of four identical spacecraft flying in formation through Earth’s magnetopause and magnetotail.

NASA initiated formulation of the mission in May 2002 and by 2006 had assigned the mission to the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and selected the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) to lead the MMS science investigation. The mission was directed to be an in-house mission with GSFC providing project management and systems engineering, mission assurance, the spacecraft, the mission operations infrastructure, and integration and test of the four observatories. SwRI was contracted to lead the science team, design the science investigations, and provide the Principal Investigator, the integrated Instrument Suite, and science data analysis.</p><p id="Par91">This paper describes the design, construction, testing, launch and commissioning of the four MMS Observatories. The design of the mission, and the origin of many of the constraints that drove the Observatory design, are described in detail elsewhere in this issue (Fuselier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>), in the references (Gramling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). In addition a Special Session of the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference in 2009 was devoted to MMS mission design and flight dynamics (Carpenter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>).

During the first five and half months (165 days) of the mission while the orbit is precessing toward the ROI, the observatories are commissioned and the constellation is maneuvered into its initial tetrahedral science formation with a separation distance of approximately 160 km. During the next six months the first phase (Phase 1) of the MMS science mission begins as the constellation repeatedly passes through the ROI each orbit. Phase 1 is completed during the second sweep through the magnetopause ROI 12 months later and ends with the initiation of the maneuvers to adjust the orbit for the second phase (Phase 2) of the science mission. The observatories are, on average, maneuvered every two weeks to adjust and maintain the formation and attitude (spin axis orientation) with the formation size potentially being resized to as small as a 10 km separation distance based on the ongoing science results. Orbit determination for MMS is performed primarily on-board using a weak-signal GPS navigation system, as well as the GSFC Navigator system and the Goddard Enhanced Onboard Navigation System (GEONS), both of which are described in a later section of this paper. Communication is performed with an S-Band system which utilizes NASA’s Space and Ground Networks for real-time telemetry and commanding and the Deep Space Network (DSN) for science data downlink as well as telemetry and commanding. The four observatories share one space-to-ground link frequency. The MMS observatories will collect science data continuously, resulting in a volume of data much larger than can be downlinked with the available bandwidth and durations of ground communication passes. To surmount this, an innovative scheme of continuously identifying data segments likely to have captured reconnection events and tagging them for downlink while eventually overwriting data of less importance has been developed by the MMS science team (Fuselier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par94">Phase 2 of the MMS mission commences as the constellation nears the end of its second sweep through the ROI in the magnetopause and a series of maneuvers is executed to raise the apogee to <inline-formula id="IEq4"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq4_Math"><mml:mn>25</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq4_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The apogee raising maneuvers are performed over about 90 days; when these maneuvers are complete, the tetrahedral formation is reestablished with an initial separation distance of 400 km. During the next 160 days the constellation executes the Phase 2 of the science mission while sweeping through the magnetotail ROI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.) Operations in Phase 2 are very similar to those in Phase 1 but with some significant differences due to the impact of the greater apogee on both communication and navigation (Fuselier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Gramling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Baker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par95">MMS mission operations are conducted by an integrated but geographically distributed team with the Mission Operations Center (MOC) and Flight Dynamics Operation Area (FDOA) located at GSFC in Maryland, the Science Operations Center (SOC) located at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in Colorado, and the Instrument Team Facilities (ITF) located at each of the institutions that built and operate the individual instruments (Baker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>).

Spinning spacecraft are needed to deploy and maintain the wire booms and provide for continuous full sky coverage from the instrument complement, while a four-observatory formation is required to enable in-situ measurements in three dimensions, with the formation size being chosen to correspond to the scale of magnetic reconnection phenomenon. The design of the individual observatories was driven by a number of key requirements: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par97">Magnetic and electrostatic cleanliness: To measure the electromagnetic fields with the required precision, the MMS observatories were designed to have very low levels of electrostatic charge and magnetic moment in the observatories themselves. This requirement influenced the design of all aspects of the observatories. The MMS observatories have a maximum of 4 V of electrostatic charge build up and a residual magnetic dipole moment of less than 1 A/m<sup>2</sup> in flight.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par98">High accuracy orbit determination: To maintain the required formation, precision navigation is required. MMS achieves this by employing an onboard GPS navigation system, the Navigator system (Sect. <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par99">Closed loop maneuver control: To control and change the formation, propulsive maneuvers must be controlled in a closed loop manner. Closed-loop control is achieved via the use of a highly accurate accelerometer system, the acceleration measurement system (AMS) (Sect. <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">3.7</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par100">Low power avionics: Because the solar arrays must be body mounted on the spinning observatories, and thus of limited size, the avionics were required to consume the lowest possible power.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par101">Precise control of mass properties: The spinning observatories must have their spin axis aligned with the body axis within 0.65° in order for the instruments to operate properly.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par102">Modular design: To integrate and test four observatories in a time efficient manner, it was necessary to design the observatory such that the instrument suite, the spacecraft bus, and the propulsion module could be built and tested separately and then integrated to form each of the four observatories.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par103">High reliability: To achieve full mission success, all four observatories must be operational.

These cells have an average conversion efficiency of 29.5 % (Fatemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>).

Gyrodynamic corrections applied to each velocity sample using the attitude and rate products of the on-board Attitude Determination solution. Before each maneuver re-calibration of the system is handled autonomously by on-board filters that detect and estimate the AMS bias residuals and/or any shifts in the spacecraft principal axis. The on-board system is augmented by ground-estimation knowledge of the spacecraft mass properties and thruster performance. An alternate, open-loop, maneuvering sub-mode is also possible (with reduced performance accuracy) should the AMS data be unavailable (e.g. early commissioning phases). Delta-V mode uses both the axial and radial thrusters and maintains 6 degree-of-freedom of the vehicle while following the ground-commanded, time-varying, inertial velocity and attitude profiles. The Delta-H mode adjusts and maintains the spacecraft’s momentum vector magnitude and inertial direction, and is expected to re-orient the momentum of the (fully-deployed) spacecraft roughly 2.6° every two-weeks in less than forty minutes with an accuracy of 0.2° (to compensate for the apparent seasonal procession of the Sun). Delta-H mode is the primary MMS attitude control mode and controls nutation, spin rate, and momentum slews (large and small) simultaneously.

The GDS was used during flight software testing and is used by the MOC as a spacecraft simulator for procedure checkout.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Navigator Subsystem</title><p id="Par128">The Navigator subsystem provides autonomous orbit determination (position, velocity and time) using signals from the NAVSTAR GPS with absolute orbit semi-major axis accuracy of 100 m at observatory spin rates up to 3.2 rpm. The Navigator employs special signal processing algorithms in radiation-hardened hardware that enable fast signal acquisition capabilities and improved sensitivity (Bamford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>; Winternitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>). For the MMS mission, the Navigator operates both below and above the GPS constellation. A single Navigator enclosure houses both the primary and redundant Navigator main electronics. Primary and redundant ultra-stable oscillators (USOs) are mounted external to the Navigator chassis. Eight GPS receive only antennas are evenly spaced around the perimeter of the observatory and orthogonal to its spin axis. Front end electronics assemblies (FEAs) are located within one foot of each antenna on the deck struts. To accommodate spinning observatories, an innovative antenna algorithm is used to hand off the signal from one antenna to the next during acquisition and tracking of both strong and weak signals. A GEONS algorithm is used to propagate position, velocity and time during extended periods of GPS signal outages with input from the USO. The Navigator system provides International Atomic Time (TAI) to an accuracy of 325 microseconds during Phase 1 and the same accuracy during Phase 2 for at least 99 out of 100 orbits. A block diagram of the MMS Navigator system is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>. <fig id="Fig20"><label>Fig. 20</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Navigator system block diagram</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2015_220_Fig20_HTML.gif"/></fig></p><p id="Par129">The Navigator box consists of both a primary and redundant Navigator signal processor (SP) card and Navigator-RF card located in a GPS module separated by an EMI shield from a power converter card. Baseband RF is sampled by four analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and signals are processed by FPGAs and software. The Navigator box provides a 1 pulse per second truth tone and 2 MHz reference frequency to the C&amp;DH via SpaceWire and receives power mode discrete commands via RS-422 from the C&amp;DH. The PSE provides a 28 VDC unregulated bus to Navigator. The Navigator power modes are (1) active, (2) RF off, (3) ultra-low (shuts off all secondary power to the Navigator except to the USO), and off. Special radiation considerations for RF and GPS were incorporated into the design of the box.</p><p id="Par130">The Navigator flight software consists principally of the core GPS software (CGS), GEONS, real-time operating system, and the Nucleus software floating point math library. The CGS provides a number of functions including searching for, acquiring, and tracking RF signals from GPS satellites. It measures the relative delay of the RF signals and extracts data transmitted in RF Signals. The CGS calculates point solutions every 5 s when data is available and adjusts the truth tone (1 pps clock) to align with TAI. Finally, the CGS provides command and telemetry links and collects board health data.</p><p id="Par131">GEONS is government off-the-shelf software developed and supported by GSFC. GEONS contains models for forces that affect the orbit including gravity of nearby bodies, solar radiation pressure, and atmospheric drag. It applies an extended Kalman filter to propagate solutions during periods of limited or no GPS observability. It also models the error mechanism in the USO to produce better truth tone time knowledge during loss of GPS signals.</p><p id="Par132">The USO procured from Frequency Electronics Inc. utilizes a quartz crystal oscillator operating at 5 MHz with very low drift (217 μs in 65 h). It has a radiation-hardened design and is provided power by dedicated 12 V DC/DC converter in the Navigator box. To minimize temperature variations that affect performance, the oscillator is maintained in a dual oven temperature controlled environment.</p><p id="Par133">The FEAs procured from Delta Microwave are fed by the GPS antennas. They provide initial filtering and a minimum of 40 dB of gain amplification. The FEAs are powered via the RF cable from the Navigator box.</p><p id="Par134">The GPS antennas are an in-house GSFC design (Fig. <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>); they receive the GPS signals and feed the FEAs. Four antennas located on alternating apexes of each an observatory feed the primary Navigator side, and an additional four redundant antennas located on the open apexes provide block redundancy. The antennas provide a hemispherical pattern and operate in a frequency range of 1574.32 to 1576.52 MHz. The antennas have all aluminum construction at DC chassis ground potential. <fig id="Fig21"><label>Fig. 21</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MMS GPS antenna</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2015_220_Fig21_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par135">A formation flying test bed provided a high-fidelity simulation and test environment, including hardware-in-the-loop, especially for GPS receiver testing. A cesium frequency standard supplied 10 MHz and 1 pps to synchronize the simulation environment. Two Spirent GPS signal simulator racks generated 8 RF signals to run up to 2 spinning spacecraft simultaneously. Multiple portable Spirent playback simulators were utilized, and rooftop antennas allowed access to authentic GPS signals. Universal counters were used to analyze PPS errors.</p><p id="Par139">Shortly after the GPS receivers were powered on Navigator set several records for the use of GPS in space as the MMS spacecraft flew through their highly elliptical orbit: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par136">At the highest point of the MMS orbit, Navigator set a record for the highest-ever reception of GPS signals in space, at more than 70,000 kilometers above the surface of the earth.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par137">At the highest point of the MMS orbit, Navigator set a record for the highest-ever GPS solutions, at more than 70,000 kilometers above the surface of the earth.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par138">At the lowest point of the MMS orbit, Navigator set a record as the fastest operational GPS receiver in space, at velocities over 10 km/s (22,000 miles per hour)</p></list-item></list> Previous missions in highly elliptical orbits that flew GPS receivers did so for experimental use only. The GPS constellation is designed to radiate signals downwards, towards Earth’s surface. Using GPS above the constellation, in highly elliptical orbits, requires a specialized GPS receiver with technology allowing it to quickly acquire and receive much weaker signals that are radiated past the limb of the earth by the GPS satellites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Communication Subsystem</title><p id="Par140">The MMS communication subsystem provides the data and command link between the observatories and all three of NASA’s networks; the DSN, the Space Network-Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (SN-TDRSS), and the Near Earth Network (NEN) system of ground stations. Each Observatory has a redundant pair of L3-Cincinnati Electronics transponders operating at 2281.90 MHz and 2101.25 MHz for telemetry/data downlink and command uplink respectively. The transponders each have a minimum output power of 8 W. The transponders communicate with the C&amp;DH communication card via a RS-422 serial interface. The transponders are connected, via diplexers and radio frequency (RF) switch, to a pair of fixed antennas with a toroidal gain pattern. The antennas were specifically designed to provide uninterrupted communication while the observatory is spinning. Both receivers are always powered and the transponder-antenna pair with the best link, based on ground analysis, is selected and turned on by the on-board ATS for downlink during a communication pass. The RF switch is only used in the event of a failure.</p><p id="Par141">All transponders on all four observatories have the same transmit and receive frequencies although each observatory has a unique spacecraft ID (SCID) which associates command and telemetry packets with a specific observatory. During communication passes, observatories are communicated with one at a time, a design decision that simplifies integrated flight operation of four observatories.</p><p id="Par142">The communication subsystem functional diagram is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> and the antenna locations and the major components are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>. <fig id="Fig22"><label>Fig. 22</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MMS communication subsystem</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2015_220_Fig22_HTML.gif"/></fig><fig id="Fig23"><label>Fig. 23</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MMS communication subsystem elements</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2015_220_Fig23_HTML.gif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Propulsion Subsystem</title><p id="Par143">Each MMS observatory utilizes a monopropellant hydrazine blow-down propulsion system to accomplish maneuvers. The propulsion system features eight 4-lbf (18-N) radial thrusters and four 1-lbf (4.5-N) axial thrusters. The radial thrusters are utilized for spin-rate control, attitude control and delta-V maneuvers. The axial thrusters are used for nutation and attitude control, momentum change maneuvers, and providing thrust on a plane perpendicular to the plane of the observatory. The thrusters can be operated independently and simultaneously to perform attitude and orbit maneuvers, adjust and maintain formation of the observatories, and accomplish the requisite large apogee-raising maneuvers.

Precise temperature control is needed to preclude propellant migration from one tank to the next.</p><p id="Par152">A wet mass vibration test was performed on Observatory #1 to excite the correct strut to thrust tube modes with the propellant mass simulated in the propellant tanks. Water was loaded into the tanks as a mass simulator because it has a similar mass density to hydrazine. After the test, bulk water was expelled from the tanks, and multiple vacuum and hot gas cycles were used to dry the tanks to a certified level.</p><p id="Par153">A center of mass measurement system was developed to measure the propellant center of mass during fueling operations at the launch site. The system consisted of a MMS Observatory transport dolly equipped with high accuracy load cells. All propellant tanks contain internal slosh-reduction diaphragms; the nature of the diaphragms is such that they take on a characteristic shape according to the propellant loading direction and stiffness variations within the diaphragm. The diaphragm’s shape and the location of the propellant’s center of mass are unknown for any given tank. A measure of the location of the propellant’s center of mass was made so that sufficiently accurate knowledge of the observatories’ centers of mass could be provided to the attitude control system and the launch provider.</p><p id="Par154">Two engine valve driver (EVD) cards (primary and redundant) reside in the PSE and EVD System (PSEES) box. The PSEES box is a combination of the PSE and the EVD bolted together as a single chassis. Each EVD card receives commands from the C&amp;DH system and can actuate the deployment of the magnetometer booms, thrusters and latch valves. The latch valve circuits can open or close each of the four latch valves in the propulsion system, and the thruster actuation circuits can fire the twelve thrusters in the propulsion system. Various combinations of thrusters may be fired in steady-state or in a pulsed mode, depending on the desired momentum change or velocity change that is commanded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Mechanical Subsystems</title><p id="Par155">The MMS mechanical subsystems are the observatory structure, the separation systems, and the deployable rigid magnetometer booms.

The key challenge the MMS thermal control system design team faced was designing a power efficient thermal control system that was simple in order to minimize costs, required the minimal amount of electrical power as solar array size was limited by the requirement for fixed arrays and the launch vehicle fairing size while maintaining observatory thermal control within requirements through solar eclipse durations in excess of four hours during the mission (Zara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par165">On an MMS observatory active thermal control consists of primary (operational) and secondary (redundant/survival) heaters.

An example of gold plating is the spacecraft separation system rings which by necessity cannot be covered with MLI. Their gold plating allows them to gain energy while in sunlight and the conductively coupled thermal mass of the gold plated elements is then used to keep the rest of the spacecraft warm when the observatory goes into a solar eclipse—thus saving heater power and allowing the battery to discharge less.</p><p id="Par167">Operationally the MMS thermal design includes pre-conditioning heaters to support planned preheat operations before the observatories enter an extended solar eclipse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Instrument Suite</title><p id="Par168">The four MMS Instrument Suites are identical.

FPI’s instrument data processing unit (IDPU) distributes power to the spectrometers, collects individual instrument data, combines the data to provide a complete map of the plasma environment, and manages the data flow through various compression schemes.

During the detailed design phase, instrument placement on the deck was optimized to minimize FOV) obstruction. For example, the HPCA “blind spot” was placed such that its FOV straddled the mag boom. Following this exercise, the science teams reviewed the minimal obstructions and agreed that there was little to no science impact. GSFC designed and procured the decks and delivered them to SwRI for instrument integration and test. Figure <xref rid="Fig32" ref-type="fig">32</xref> shows the instrument components mounted on the inboard side of the Instrument Suite deck when integrated as an observatory. It should be noted that one FEEPS, designated top and another FEEPS, designated bottom, are mounted on the outboard side of the Instrument Suite and spacecraft decks respectively. The SCM preamp is mounted on the inboard spacecraft deck close to the harness that is routed to the magnetometer booms. The AFG and SCM magnetometers are mounted on one 5-m deployable boom and the DFG is mounted on the other boom, both developed by GSFC.

This configuration was chosen to simplify inter-instrument and IS to S/C interfaces to a point that complete testing could be conducted at the component and/or Instrument Suite level prior to Observatory I&amp;T. This minimized the amount of essential “first time” testing at the spacecraft level. The simplification of power and command/telemetry interfaces, as well as distribution of data concentration circuitry at the Instrument Suite and investigation level, allowed the various investigations (as well as the Instrument Suite) to be integrated without needing significant amounts of support hardware. This resulted not only in a simplified test program, but also test equipment simplification. Each investigation was provided with one or more essentially identical CIDP-to-instrument interface emulators, and each investigation was emulated by an instrument-to-CIDP test set which reproduced the communication interface of the emulated instrument and provided a minimal set of synthetic data at nominal volumes. The same approach was followed with the spacecraft to CIDP interfaces, with the CIDP team providing GSFC with several CIDP-to-spacecraft emulators and the GSFC providing the CIDP with a spacecraft-to-CIDP interface emulator (S2C). These emulators were installed in Ground Support Equipment Operating System (GSEOS) based computers. The simplification of interfaces also allowed interface verification to be accomplished prior to complete instrument development, reducing integration risk. <fig id="Fig33"><label>Fig. 33</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Instrument suite electrical interfaces</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2015_220_Fig33_HTML.gif"/></fig></p><p id="Par176">A total of 26 harness segments make up the Instrument Suite harness that provides the power and signal interfaces between Instrument Suite components. These include the asynchronous and synchronous serial interfaces and CIDP monitored thermistors. The harness also includes spacecraft controlled operational, survival and pre-conditioning heaters, and spacecraft monitored thermistors. SwRI and GSFC engineers worked together to develop a set of specifications to govern the build of the harnesses to meet mission EMI/EMC requirements. A deck and thrust tube mock-up with instrument connector plates were built to help facilitate placement and routing of the electrical harness internal and external to the Instrument Suite deck and to determine the locations of all of the mounting hardware. SwRI built an engineering model set of harnesses to verify design and routing prior to the build of the four sets of flight harnesses.</p><p id="Par177">The MMS spacecraft provides battery sourced primary power for the CIDP, the Instrument Suite operational and actuator functions, and the thermostatically controlled operational and survival heaters. Switched Instrument Suite and actuator power is passed to the various investigations through the CIDP; the heater power for thermostatically controlled survival and operational temperature control is passed to the Instrument Suite heaters through a separate fuse board contained within the TP-HPDB. The MMS spacecraft sends commands, receives engineering and science telemetry, and provides mission timing and synchronization information exclusively through the CIDP. This communication is implemented using the SpaceWire protocol implemented in GSFC-designed FPGA core. The SpaceWire, CIDP power, Instrument Suite power, and actuator power are provided on redundant services. Passing all operational interfaces and the instrument/actuator control powers through the CIDP allows the CIDP level testing to verify most of the interfaces with the spacecraft without depending on availability of the instruments.</p><p id="Par178">Early in the program, the system engineering team developed detailed electrical interface control documents (ICDs) that controlled all aspects of CIDP to instrument interfaces.

The CIDP communicates with the CEB, IDPU, HPCA, and ASPOC through a synchronous serial LVDS interface, and uses an asynchronous serial LVDS interface for EIS and FEEPS. In addition, the CIDP provides the operational control for FEEPS and necessary command expansion functionality for FEEPS as well as FPI. The CIDP synchronizes all investigations using an encoded LVDS pulse stream indicating Sun pulse timing, 1 pps (time at the tone) indication, and a spin sector (spin rate/5180) indicator referred to as a Delphi pulse. The synchronization interface is implemented in hardware in order to meet the CIDP 50 μs delay requirement derived from the 1 ms timing knowledge requirement across the MMS constellation. Testing the large number of interfaces between the CIDP and the instruments was made simpler by the fact that the types of interfaces are simply four: primary power, asynchronous serial LVDS, synchronous serial LVDS, and LVDS synchronization.</p><p id="Par179">The CEB and IDPU provide further power and command distribution. The CEB provides secondary referenced power to the internal DFG/AFG, EDI interface, and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) boards, and the external SCM Preamp, SDP boom electronics boards (BEB), and ADP electronics boards. The EDI-GDU instruments receive power directly from the CIDP. The CEB provides an LVDS serial interface to the EDI-GDU (through the EDI controller board), the SDP BEBs, and the internal DSP boards. The IDPU provides an LVDS command and telemetry interface and switched primary power to the DES and DIS instruments (4 each). Detailed timing and control for the FIELDS and FPI are provided by the CEB and IDPU respectively. The concentration of interfaces within the CEB and IDPU enable complete investigation testing without the need for a CIDP.</p><p id="Par180">The TP-HPDB is an integrated assembly located near the edge of Bay 1 of the Instrument Suite deck that distributes spacecraft controlled electrical power to instrument and Instrument Suite deck heaters. In addition, the TP-HPDB provided test connector panel interfaces for ground testing the ADP deployment signals, and for the commercially developed, ground use only, 1-wire thermal sensor interface that provided detailed temperature readings during thermal vacuum testing. The original Instrument Suite design routed two services for heaters through the fuse board inside the TP-HBD. Various discoveries relating to thermal damage mechanisms for the HV-801 optocouplers used in the DES, DIS, and HPCA stepping power supply required a modification of the design to allow the spacecraft C&amp;DH software to control the HPCA, DES, and DIS heaters to maintain reduced temperature ranges.</p><p id="Par181">The MMS instruments are capable of operating at their “high voltage safe” levels during ground-based test operations. This state is controlled via a “safe” connector on the Instrument Suite deck with hardware or hardware/software interlocks located in each of the instruments. The S/A panel provides the high voltage and deployable safing and arming circuits for maintaining the safety of the Instrument Suite components during ground testing. Various connector plugs were fabricated to configure the Instrument Suite during ground testing in ambient and vacuum environment. The panel is configured with flight plugs prior to fairing encapsulation at Astrotech during launch processing.

The level of redundancy selected is tailored to balance overall system reliability, development cost and the operational concept. The general approach is to provide hardware redundancy (cross-strap or block) at points of data concentration (CIDP, FIELDS CEB, and FPI IDPU) and functional redundancy where there are multiple overlapping measurement schemes. A view of the redundancy from an electrical interfaces standpoint can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig33" ref-type="fig">33</xref>.</p><p id="Par207">The hardware redundancy scheme chosen for various parts of the instrument suite depended on the complexity of the inter-component interfaces, the level of segmentation provided by those components, and the operational life of those components. For example, cross-strapped redundancy was selected for the S/C to CIDP operational interfaces. This was a natural outgrowth of the CIDPs place in the overall architecture: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par204">The CIDP is a critical function for the entire mission. Thus, the critical functionality of the CIDP required the high-reliability provided by fully redundant sides.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par205">The CIDP completely isolates the IS from the S/C. Thus, the functional isolation between the S/C and the IS allowed S/C to CIDP cross-strapping without affecting the rest of the IS.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par206">The CIDP communicates with the S/C via a SpaceWire interface and is powered by the primary bus power—the SpaceWire standard supports ease of cross-strapping (as does the ability to wire-OR power).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par208">The chosen cross-strap redundancy configuration of the S/C to CIDP operational interfaces allows a failure on one of spacecraft component sides to be handled without impacting operation of the fully functional CIDP side. The converse is also true, a failure in a CIDP side does not require a change on the S/C side.</p><p id="Par209">In contrast, the actuator power service provided to the CIDP is block redundant; that is, the primary spacecraft component provides actuator bus power only to the primary CIDP, with the same configuration on the redundant side. This simplification in the cross-strap configuration is justified by the fact that the actuator bus is only used in early mission prior to ADP and SDP deployments and does not need to have a long operational life.</p><p id="Par210">The CEB and IDPU are internally redundant data concentrator boxes, similar to the CIDP, but the data interfaces between the CIDP and CEB/IDPU are more complicated than the S/C to CIDP SpaceWire interface, requiring more complicated OR’ing for a cross-strapped configuration. Thus, we chose to configure CIDP to CEB/IDPU redundancy in block mode; that is, the CIDP-A is tied to only CEB-A and IDPU-A, while CIDP-B is tied to only CEB-B and IDPU-B. A failure on a given side in the CEB, the IDPU, or the CIDP requires that an Instrument Suite side change affecting all three components be made. This block redundancy is chosen to provide a large improvement in reliability without overly complicating the operational concept. Because the Instrument Suite is isolated from the rest of the spacecraft by the CIDP, and the CIDP to S/C interfaces are cross-strapped, the requirement to change Instrument Suite sides in a block will not affect the spacecraft configuration.</p><p id="Par211">During development, it was found that acceptable mission reliability, in the presence of some failures, could be supported on the basis of instrument functional redundancy. A “tolerable failures” table was developed to demonstrate which instrument failures could be allowed without loss of mission science among four observatories, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. There is significant overlap between instrument types and instrument observation schemes allowing a great deal of graceful degradation. For this reason, each instrument is internally non-redundant. <table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Tolerable failures for mission success</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>IS subsystem</p></th><th><p>Allowable failures for full mission success</p></th><th><p>Allowable failures for minimum mission success</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>AFG</p></td><td><p>Either AFG or DFG on all S/C</p></td><td><p>Either AFG or DFG on 3 S/C, both can fail on one S/C only</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DFG</p></td><td><p>Either AFG or DFG on all S/C</p></td><td><p>Either AFG or DFG on 3 S/C, both can fail on one S/C only</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SCM</p></td><td><p>Only on one S/C</p></td><td><p>On two S/C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SDP</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 per S/C</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 per S/C max 4 on one S/C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ADP</p></td><td><p>Both on 3 S/C (S/C with two functional ADP must have 3 SDP working )</p></td><td><p>Both on 3 S/C (S/C with two functional ADP must have 3 SDP working)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>EDI</p></td><td><p>1 of 2 per S/C</p></td><td><p>1 of 2 for three S/C and max 2 on one S/C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CEB/CIDP</p></td><td><p>Block redundant, block failure on all S/C</p></td><td><p>Block redundant, block failure on all S/C; total failure on one S/C only</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASPOC</p></td><td><p>1 of 2 per S/C</p></td><td><p>1 of 2 per S/C on three S/C, total failure on one S/C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DES</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 per S/C</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 per S/C on three S/C, total failure on one S/C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DIS</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 per S/C</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 per S/C on three S/C, total failure on one S/C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FEEPS</p></td><td><p>1 of 2 on 2 S/C</p></td><td><p>Not required</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>EIS</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 S/C</p></td><td><p>Not required</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HPCA</p></td><td><p>1 of 4 S/C</p></td><td><p>2 of 4 S/C</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Instrument Suite Integration and Test (I&amp;T)</title><p id="Par212">Instrument Suite integration started after the receipt of the first flight instrument deck at SwRI with the installation of the electrical harnesses, purge system, and thermal control hardware. The integration began with the installation of a flight CIDP and the delivery of the ASPOC instruments from Austria. In addition, pre-integration testing was performed with the HPCA Flight Model #1. Standard integration flows included performing incoming inspection, magnetic screening and safe-to-mate on all hardware prior to mechanical installation on the deck. Integration tests included initial power application, in-rush measurements and aliveness. Finally, a limited performance test was performed. Instrument Suite Deck #1 was partially integrated at SwRI.</p><p id="Par213">To collocate the GSFC and SwRI I&amp;T teams, minimize hardware shipments and mitigate the high cost of developing an environmentally controlled transporter, the MMS team decided to de-integrate and ship the instruments separately from the deck. The SwRI I&amp;T team moved its operation to GSFC to minimize the logistics of delivering a large set of flight components from GSFC and UNH to San Antonio. Once instrument integration was completed, a full Instrument Suite comprehensive performance test (CPT) was performed. An acceptance review was conducted prior to the delivery of each deck for integration with the spacecraft deck. Late hardware deliveries were mitigated by the use of engineering models (EM) and flight models that were not yet qualified. Figure <xref rid="Fig37" ref-type="fig">37</xref> illustrates the typical integration flow for Instrument Suite I&amp;T. <fig id="Fig37"><label>Fig. 37</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical integration flow for instrument suite deck processing</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2015_220_Fig37_HTML.gif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Mission Development</title><p id="Par214">The MMS Project recognized from the onset that the construction, integration, and testing of four observatories represented unique challenges that GSFC, and indeed few NASA missions had ever faced before. Beginning prior to the preliminary design review the Project focused on developing plans that were resilient to late deliveries of a given subsystem or instrument. It was recognized that the build of multiple flight copies of every subsystem and instrument would offer great flexibility during the I&amp;T phase since if a single unit encountered problems or delays a working unit could be substituted to continue I&amp;T while it was repaired. Conversely, the discovery of a systemic design or workmanship issue could impact all observatories and have an amplified effect on the mission schedule. To plan for this the Project postulated a number of worse-case scenarios and exercised detailed re-planning exercises which were presented at the major independent milestone reviews.</p><p id="Par215">The testing and qualification of four identical observatories presented the Project with the challenge of adapting GSFC standard practices and requirements that were developed to build single copies of unique spacecraft to the multiple spacecraft paradigm. The Project strove to strike the right balance between necessary testing, and the time and cost involved in “by the book” testing four duplicate spacecraft. The MMS Project devoted considerable effort to differentiating design qualification testing from testing activities that were primarily workmanship tests. It was also essential that the Project develop practices that rigorously identified and tracked the inevitable small configuration differences among the observatories and take that into account in decisions regarding necessary testing. The execution of the build and testing of the subsystems and instruments and then the observatories that resulted from this planning is described in the following sections.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Flight Hardware Manufacturing</title><p id="Par216">The MMS manufacturing effort was large, diverse and distributed among over 40 organizations including contractors, non-profit organizations, universities and internationals. A staggering total of 638 flight components and boxes were built and delivered to GSFC and SwRI for integration into four observatories. Firm, fixed price contracts were competitively awarded to vendors for off-the-shelf spacecraft components such as solar arrays and star sensors. Spacecraft avionics boards were designed by GSFC, and Instrument Suite avionics were designed by SwRI and other instrument providers.</p><p id="Par217">A parts control program was implemented per the Level 2 requirements of GSFC EEE-INST-002. De-rating analyses for EEE parts was in accordance with GSFC EEE-INST-002. A common parts buy program was implemented for cost efficiency as well as to limit the number of different part types and purchasing lots needed. The MMS Project experienced some part design and workmanship issues resulting in failures after their screening and integration into instruments, in particular with opto-couplers. An extensive screening test program at the instrument level was implemented for all FPI instruments in order to reduce the risk of on-orbit failure of opto-couplers. Additional long duration risk assessment testing was performed on a number of flight spare opto-couplers.</p><p id="Par218">Engineering test units (ETUs) were built for most components and they proved to be invaluable as manufacturing pathfinders and for troubleshooting issues. It became apparent during the ETU phase that the manufacturing effort for flight avionics boards needed to be distributed among more contractor fabrication houses to prevent schedule bottlenecks. Quality issues were also identified during the ETU phase. These led the Project to seek out fabrication houses that utilized automated board manufacturing techniques. In general, ETUs were subjected to environmental tests at qualification levels.</p><p id="Par219">To save cost, flight spares were kitted but only a limited number of spares were built. International partners elected to build flight spares. The decision to build a limited number of spares proved to be cost effective as no delays due to lack of spares were encountered. Flight spares were swapped in for an EDI, an SCM pre-amp and 2 SDP flight units. None of the spare spacecraft components or kits was needed for flight with the exception of some isolated parts that were used to replace failed parts and one spare battery that was used to replace the flight unit when launch was delayed.</p><p id="Par220">MMS followed traditional practices of testing instruments and spacecraft components at the board level, subassembly level, and instrument/component level prior to their delivery to I&amp;T. Board level testing consisted of full functional testing at room, hot and cold temperatures. The sheer number of FPI boards required for this mission drove the FPI team to develop automated board testing stations both at GSFC for board testing and at SwRI for HVPS testing.</p><p id="Par221">Most flight components were subjected to EMI, magnetics, vibration and thermal vacuum testing before delivery to I&amp;T. In general, first flight units were subjected to proto-flight vibration levels and subsequent units were vibration tested at acceptance levels. All units were tested to proto-flight thermal vacuum levels. FPI instruments were subjected to electron and ion beam testing. Likewise, HPCA, EDI, EIS and FEEPS were each tested with the appropriate sources in order to verify their performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Observatory Integration &amp; Test</title><p id="Par222">The MMS I&amp;T effort was based on the parallel processing of 1) the spacecraft bus, 2) the Instrument Suite, and 3) the thrust tube/propulsion system. This allowed progress to be made for quite some time on all three elements before they were integrated together into an observatory and work became more serial in nature.</p><p id="Par223">Both a spacecraft and Instrument Suite FlatSat comprised of engineering models were built to dry-run all test scripts before execution on the flight system. Risk reduction spacecraft and Instrument Suite decks were built for early box and harness routing checks. Both a spacecraft C&amp;DH and CIDP simulator were built for interface verification. A CIDP Engineering Model was utilized to perform early interface testing at instrument provider locations. Both the FPI and FIELDS teams performed Instrument Suite tests prior to their delivery to SwRI.</p><p id="Par224">Instrument Suite 1 was partially assembled at SwRI but was de-integrated and shipped to GSFC where integration was completed. A decision was made by the Project to accelerate the co-location of SwRI personnel at GSFC and save effort in shipping decks back and forth, so this Instrument Suite was de-integrated, shipped and re-integrated at GSFC. Subsequent Instrument Suites were integrated at GSFC. A CPT and burst tests were run on each Instrument Suite prior to its delivery to the GSFC I&amp;T team.

They were integrated in a staggered fashion with all welding and X rays performed at GSFC. Prior to its delivery and mounting on the spacecraft deck, the thrust tube/propulsion system was subjected to a proof pressure test and a thermal heater verification test.</p><p id="Par227">Significant effort was required for MMS I&amp;T planning due to the complexity of managing the staggered development of four observatories during the I&amp;T campaign. It was recognized early on that the Project needed to maintain schedule flexibility and resiliency to late instrument and spacecraft component deliveries in order to meet key schedule milestones. With this is mind, MMS was designed such that any instrument could be removed or integrated at the observatory level without de-integration of the Instrument Suite. This proved to be a wise decision because a number of instruments were integrated and de-integrated after Instrument Suite delivery to the spacecraft bus. The MMS schedule was continuously managed to minimize impacts to the critical path by swapping components between observatories and re-ordering the I&amp;T flow for integrating components in order to accommodate late deliveries.</p><p id="Par228">With four observatories to build and test at GSFC, the MMS Project encountered some unique challenges. The spacecraft are far from small, with each observatory carrying 25 instruments. In order to keep track of multiple builds, the Project utilized enhanced configuration control processes to ensure traceability for each observatory. In order to build observatories in a staggered fashion, MMS personnel were required to multi-task with board manufacturing, component testing and observatory integration and testing occurring in parallel.</p><p id="Par229">Observatories were subjected to aliveness tests, functional tests, and CPTs. Aliveness tests involved turning on all hardware. Functional tests turned on hardware and checked all copper paths. CPTs were longer tests that checked the performance of each spacecraft subsystem and instrument. RF compatibility testing was performed on all observatories for the DSN, Space Network (SN), and Universal Space Network (USN).</p><p id="Par230">A pre-environmental CPT was run for Observatories #1, 2, and 3, and a pre-environmental Functional test was run for Observatory #4. A post-environmental CPT was run for Observatories #1, 2, and 4, and a post-environmental Functional test was run for Observatory #3. Functional tests were performed on all observatories after shipment to the launch site and after transport to the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Observatory Environmental Testing</title><p id="Par231">The MMS observatories were subjected to environmental testing consisting of acoustics, vibration, shock, electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic control (EMI/EMC), and thermal vacuum tests. Qualification tests were performed only once. Other tests were performed on every observatory in an attempt to uncover workmanship issues. Observatories were generally in flight configuration for environmental tests, but there were a few exceptions where mass models were substituted for FPI and EDI instruments due to their late deliveries.

Fully stacked, MMS had a nominal mass of 5398 kg. Functional and integrated system tests with the launch vehicle were performed at the VIF prior to roll out to the pad.</p><p id="Par238">MMS was launched on March 12, 2015 at 10:44 pm EDT by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas-V series 421 launch vehicle from LC 41. The MMS launch vehicle was configured with a 4-m (14-ft) diameter extra extended payload fairing (XEPF), two solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and a single engine Centaur upper stage. The four observatories, designated MMS-1, MMS-2, MMS-3, and MMS-4, were launched in stacked configuration with MMS-1 attached to the Centaur. The Centaur was responsible for spinning the stack up to 3 rpm prior to separation, starting with MMS-4 and ending with MMS-1 with separations occurring every 5 minutes.

Due to clean room facility conflicts (unforeseen at time of confirmation), the MMS Project was required to fund the construction of a new 4300 ft<sup>2</sup> clean room. Thermal vacuum facility conflicts also forced the Project to ship observatories to NRL for thermal vacuum testing. Finally, the government shutdown in September, 2013 resulted in a month’s lost work and a corresponding slip in the MMS Launch Readiness Date. Although the government shutdown resulted in a LRD slip of one month to November, 2014, due to the crowded launch manifest schedule the Current Launch Schedule Review Board moved the MMS launch to March, 2015.</p><p id="Par245">The MMS Project is currently predicted to be completed with a total budget increase of 3.7 % over the Agency Baseline Commitment (ABC) of $1082.6M established at MMS confirmation in June, 2009.
