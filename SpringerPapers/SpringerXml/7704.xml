As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated the fabrication of a memory device with the configuration of PET/Ag/MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA/Ag via an all printed, hybrid, and state of the art fabrication approach. Bottom Ag electrodes, active layer of hybrid MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA nanocomposite and top Ag electrode are deposited by reverse offset, electrohydrodynamic (EHD) atomization and electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning respectively. The fabricated device displayed characteristic bistable, nonvolatile and rewritable resistive switching behavior at a low operating voltage. A decent off/on ratio, high retention time, and large endurance of 1.28 × 10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup> sec and 1000 voltage sweeps were recorded respectively. Double logarithmic curve satisfy the trap controlled space charge limited current (TCSCLC) model in high resistance state (HRS) and ohmic model in low resistance state (LRS). Bendability test at various bending diameters (50-2 mm) for 1500 cycles was carried out to show the mechanical robustness of fabricated device.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36195.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep36195" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep36195</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Graphene was the first two dimensional (2D) material to be found with intriguing electrical properties and unique chemical structure that led to the discovery of various materials of its kind like the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

MoS<sub>2</sub> was selected owing to its graphene like 2D structure with promising semiconducting properties. MoS<sub>2</sub> is highly suitable material to trap charge carriers due to its appropriate quantum confinement and available energy states. PVA is used as an isolating dielectric material and a supportive layer to transfer the MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes onto the bottom electrodes. Liquid exfoliation method was conducted to exfoliate pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes into a few layered and to dissolve PVA in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. Structure of PVA shows that it is a branched polymer, significantly suitable for coating a 2D material to form a highly uniform thin film. Moreover PVA is a non-toxic, biocompatible, environment friendly, cheap and non-hazardous organic polymer. This work was undertaken to comprehensively explore the resistive switching effect in a novel nanocomposite of MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA as being the potential candidate for the next generation memory device.

These images show that regions with same thickness (i.e. same number of layers) have identical contrast. The image taken by AFM illustrates a few layered nature of exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes as the average thickness is 3 nm which is equivalent to 3–4 layers as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref>. The images taken from FESEM at a high resolution show extremely high density of sprayed MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes with no gaps in between them as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. These images show a chaotic array of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes stacked mostly in plane. We attained very thin yet unbroken MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes film with conventional lateral dimensions. SEM image of a single exfoliated flake of MoS<sub>2</sub> is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref>. The prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes were further critically characterized by taking images from Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). TEM images also indicated the existence of a few layered exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes with varying thickness. The regions with darker shade have more thickness owing to more number of layers as compared to regions with light color. Edges of individual layers stacked over one another can easily be observed near the periphery of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes in High Resolution (HR) TEM image of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(d)</xref>.

It is a very useful technique for quantitatively measuring the number of layers present in exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes. Raman spectroscopy utilize inflexible scattering of homochromatic light from a laser. The energy of the photons shifts upward or downward depending upon the laser interacting with vibrations in the system. Low power laser is desirable in order to protect sample from disintegration. Raman spectroscopy was necessary for ensuring the existence of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes in the prepared solution. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a)</xref> illustrates the Raman spectra of exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> and signifies the presence of its few layered flakes.

An optical transmittance of ≈80% was observed in the as synthesized MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes. The absorbance curve is also shown along with the transmittance curve for better understanding.

Total number of layers and the transmittance of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes is inversely proportional to each other.

The difference in the peak value is due to direct and indirect bandgap in monolayer and a few layer MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes respectively. This might be due to quantum confinement effect across the 2D planes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. When 2D materials are exfoliated by mechanical approach like scotch tape method, it produces maximum flakes with large lateral size and its photoluminescence peak appears at 652 nm but when grinding and ultrasonication method is adopted different sizes of nanosheets are produced including small quantity of quantum dots and photoluminescence whose peak appears at 440 nm.

This plot suggests that LRS is governed by ohmic conduction while HRS is governed by a typical trap controlled space charge limited current (TCSCLC) model as its plot can be confined by three restricted curves based on the slope values. These results are comparable to already reported conduction mechanism for MoS<sub>2</sub>/PMMA functional thin film by Shinde <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In region I (0–0.4 V), majority of charge carriers occur due to thermionic emission owing to lower value of applied bias voltage resulting in ohmic behavior (slope ≈1). These charge carriers mainly depend on the magnitude of externally applied electric field and electronic properties of functional materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. As the applied electric field increases, electrons from the metallic electrodes gain enough energy to jump into the active nanocomposite layer of MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA. Region II (0.4–3 V) signifies that as magnitude of applied voltage increase, traps present within the active layer of MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA functional layer begin to partially fill with charge carriers hence slightly increasing the conductivity (slope ≈3) as suggested by Son <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In region III (3–4 V), the magnitude of applied electric field is further increased and all the available unoccupied energy levels or traps are fully filled by the charge carriers resulting in an exponential increase in current as I ∝ V<sup>m</sup> (slope ≈23)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This sharp increase in the current value can be associated with the exponential spread of trap states within a large bandgap between conduction and valence band of PVA polymer. On the other hand, initially the conduction band of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes is partially filled with electrons. All the electrons present in the conduction band of MoS<sub>2</sub> have complete freedom of movement. As applied electric field is increased, electrons from the valence band of MoS<sub>2</sub> gain enough energy to jump into the conduction band and fill the unoccupied energy levels. The number of electrons in the conduction band of MoS<sub>2</sub> continue to increase with increasing applied bias voltage, hence resulting in higher conductivity of the memory device. This turns the device from HRS to LRS state. The conduction of charges in the LRS is governed by ohmic conduction (I ∝ V) owing to the value of linear fit line (slope ≈1) indicating the presence of good conductive channels.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Double Logarithmic I-V curve showing the slopes for HRS and LRS with different values of slope.</p><p>This plot can be divided into three distinguish regions as separated by the three different colors.

It is a fact that lower the value of work function, lower will be the energy barrier heights, resulting in a large charge carrier flow from metal contacts into active thin film. Ag metal was chosen as the top and bottom electrode owing to its lower work function (4.26 eV) relative to the electron affinity of MoS<sub>2</sub> as compared to other metal electrodes like Pt (5.70 eV), Au (5.40 eV) and tungsten (5.1 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Several energy states are present within the band gaps of MoS<sub>2</sub> semiconductor and PVA polymer. Primarily, the charge carriers are present in energy states with lower mobility keeping the device in HRS condition. In our memory device, energy states with lower energy levels are offered by exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes. Electrons are trapped in the potential wells of MoS<sub>2</sub> due to its quantum confinement and lower energy levels. Structure of our device can be attributed to an assembly of potential wells with different widths, depths and asymmetry’s owing to the nanocomposite of n-type semiconducting MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes and dielectric PVA polymer as the functional materials. This difference is due to different magnitude of work function, HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Furthermore the states are localized in potential wells due to which movement of charge carriers takes place by hopping mechanism.</p><p>Before the application of voltage sweep, charge carriers trapped in the potential wells are in Fermi level. Initially charges are present in lowest available energy levels where they have low mobility. On the application of electric field, charge carriers gain enough energy and bending of energy barriers takes place. These excited electrons begin to flow from lower energy states into traps with higher energy. This partially fulfills the traps and conductivity of device begins to increase. As the magnitude of external applied electric field is further increased, its value reaches the threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) at which all the traps with higher mobility are completely filled with charge carriers and the memory device switches to LRS. The huge bandgap offered by PVA polymer due to its dielectric property makes it extremely difficult for the trapped charge carriers to return to their original energy states without the aid of an external power source. This insulating property of PVA restricts the flow of trapped charge carriers back to their original energy states with lower mobility resulting in remarkably high retention time. In order to turn the device back to its original resistance state of HRS from LRS an external voltage supply of opposite polarity is applied. As a result, trapped charge carriers gain enough energy to overcome the huge energy barrier offered by PVA. This turns the device back to its original resistive state of HRS. In this fabricated device, the composition of MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA nanocomposite along with the choice of top and bottom electrodes is yet to be optimized which will surely further increase the efficiency of this device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mechanical Robustness</title><p>As the device was fabricated on a flexible PET substrate therefore its mechanical robustness was examined against several bending cycles by squeezing the PET substrate in forward and backward direction.

Pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes were exfoliated by using a facile and eco-friendly method of liquid exfoliation. A relatively new, yet extremely competitive printing system known as reverse offset was employed and described in detail to deposit high resolution bottom electrodes. The all printed memory device, with the configuration Ag/MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA/Ag exhibited excellent non-volatile and rewritable bipolar resistive switching behavior. Data can be written and erased by applying a positive and negative bias of ≈3 V and ≈−3 V respectively. A high off/on ratio of 1.28 × 10<sup>2</sup> was recorded which is enough to distinguish between HRS and LRS. Significantly high retention time of ~10<sup>5</sup> sec and endurance of &gt;1000 voltage sweeps was recorded at a reading voltage of 0.7 V. Results were highly repeatable for all the nine memory cells in the fabricated 9 × 1 array. Obtained results of MoS<sub>2</sub>-PVA based memory device were superior to many of its predecessor composites of either MoS<sub>2</sub> or PVA. Moreover, mechanical robustness of MoS<sub>2</sub> and PVA based memory device has also been reported for the first time in this work. The hybrid memory device displayed excellent durability and mechanical strength when tested against several bending cycles. The presented results broaden and deepen the understanding of memory phenomena in hybrid nanocomposites of 2D materials and polymers. Resistive switching properties of this functional hybrid nanocomposite can be further improved by optimizing its formulation and selection of electrode materials for future work.

Ag nanoparticles ink (300 cps, 60 wt %) for depositing top and bottom electrodes were purchased from Paru Co.Ltd. Liquid exfoliation method was used for the synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes compared to mechanical method of scotch tape micro cleavage to achieve high throughput. Lateral flake size and thickness of raw flakes are affected by the selected exfoliation process. NMP was selected as the solvent for dispersing MoS<sub>2</sub> in PVA. NMP is a suitable choice for exfoliating MoS<sub>2</sub> powder due to its surface energy that matches well with the nanosheets of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The surface tension helps in overcoming the van der Walls forces resulting in ease of exfoliation. Grinding of pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> powder in NMP was carried out for 1 hour in a mortar followed by heating at 100 °C for 1 hour to evaporate the solvent. Furthermore ground MoS<sub>2</sub> was dispersed in NMP for probe sonication for 1 hour as grinding and sonication both are effective in exfoliation of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.
