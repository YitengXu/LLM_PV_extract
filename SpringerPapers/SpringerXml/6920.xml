Here we investigate the process for the conversion of light to electrical current in high performance layered perovskite solar cells by examining its real morphology. The layered perovskite films in this study are found to be a mixture of layered and three dimensional (3D)-like phases with phase separations at micrometer and nanometer scale in both vertical and lateral directions. This phase separation is explained by the surface initiated crystallization process and the competition of the crystallization between 3D-like and layered perovskites. We further propose that the working mechanisms of the layered perovskite solar cells involve energy transfer from layered to 3D-like perovskite network. The impact of morphology on efficiency and stability of the hot-cast layered perovskite solar cells are also discussed to provide guidelines for the future improvement.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">It is well-accepted that the two dimensional layered halide perovskite can improve the device stability of perovskite solar cells but the operation mechanism remains unclear.

Despite the significant improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved in the past few years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the concern on the poor stability, especially the moisture stability, of OIHP materials remains a major hurdle for the commercialization of the OIHP solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The low stability stems mainly from the low formation energy and hydroscopic nature of the OIHP materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. One approach to address the poor moisture stability of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite devices is to introduce layered OIHPs, or quasi-two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, which contain sheets of 3D perovskites sandwiched by long organic ligands. The hydrophobic ligands can slow down the permeation of moisture into the lead iodide octahedron, and thus impede the decomposition of the OIHPs by moisture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Since the photovoltaic devices fabricated by layered perovskite materials exhibit impressively better stability in some cases, these materials have recently attracted intensive attention, despite that their PCEs are still much lower than the 3D perovskite counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The further PCE improvement of layered perovskite solar cells relies on better understanding of their operation mechanism, which, however, remains largely elusive up to now. Tsai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> reported that the layered perovskite film fabricated with hot-casting spin-coating method showed the preferential alignment of the layered crystallographic planes along the out-of-plane direction, and assigned the high mobility in the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite components is the main reason for the efficient charge carrier extraction and thus high PCE above 12% in layered perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, the underlying working mechanism for solar cells involving layered perovskites is still not clear. For example, the morphology, phase compositions and distribution are not known yet for the perovskite thin films prepared with a composition for layered perovskites. Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> observed very different photoluminescence (PL) properties from the top and bottom film surface, which was explained by different layered perovskite phases with increasing <italic>n</italic> values naturally aligned along the vertical direction to the substrate. In addition, it is still an open question of how the photogenerated excitons efficiently dissociate in layered perovskites with exciton binding energy much larger than thermal energy at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Blancon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> proposed that the low energy edge states in layered perovskites can facilitate exciton dissociation. However, a full picture of exciton diffusion to edge states and free charge carrier extraction is still missing.</p><p id="Par5">For a better understanding of the working principle of layered perovskite solar cells, in this study, we carefully examine the morphology of the hot-cast layered perovskite thin films at both microscopic and nanoscopic scales. The results show that layered perovskite thin films comprise multiple layered perovskite phases surrounded by 3D-like perovskites. The layered flakes are much smaller than the thin film thickness. Based on the observed morphology, we propose a model for the operation of realistic layered perovskite solar cells which involves energy transfer from layered to 3D-like perovskites and charge collection through the 3D-like perovskite network.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Material preparation and device evaluation</title><p id="Par6">Achieving efficient layered perovskite solar cells is essential to establish the material platform for investigating the working mechanism.

The calculated diffraction angle 2<italic>θ</italic> values of layered perovskites (<italic>n</italic> = 2 to 4) were summarized (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The difference of 2<italic>θ</italic> values between the same crystallographic planes of (BA)<sub>2</sub>(MA)<sub><italic>n</italic>-1</sub>Pb<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>I<sub>3<italic>n</italic>+1</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 2 to 4) are within 0.12°, which are negligible compared to the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the diffraction peaks (greater than 0.45° for the XRD result presented here), making it even more difficult to index the different perovskite phases. There are not clear peaks at diffraction angles (2<italic>θ</italic>) below 14° which are characteristic of low-angle {010} reflections in layered crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In order to further determine the phase composition, XRD measurements of scraped powder of thin films were also conducted. Several extra diffraction peaks are present in powder XRD pattern (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). After comparing it with the XRD patterns of 3D perovskite powders, we concluded that these high-angle diffraction peaks more likely originate from 3D perovskites, indicating the coexistence of layered and 3D-like perovskite phases in layered perovskite films. Weak diffraction peaks at low-angle (less than 14°) can be observed in the powder XRD spectrum; the absence of such peaks in layered perovskite thin film samples might be explained by the small amount of randomly oriented layered perovskite phases present. Exciton-like absorption peaks at 1.94 eV (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and 2.05 eV (<italic>n</italic> = 3) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> indicate the films prepared from mixed precursor solution contain layered perovskites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

In the transmission mode, the incident light with wavelength less than 650 nm will be filtered after applying a 650 nm long pass filter. Therefore, the area with more layered perovskite phases appear brighter as less incoming light can be absorbed. In contrast, the area with more 3D perovskite phase appears darker in the transmission mapping images.

In the hot-casting process, hot precursor solution was casted on a hot spinning substrate. It is highly likely that the precursor solution at the liquid–air interface would reach supersaturation first due to the fast evaporation of DMF solvent at the surface, which has been confirmed by a top-crust scraping test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

The consumption of much less BA in top 3D-like perovskite layer actually pushes more BA toward the substrate side so that the ratio of BA to MA gradually increased in the leftover solution. The more BA-rich solution accelerates the layered perovskite nucleus formation and allows the formation of layered perovskites, though there is still a competition of 3D-like perovskites and layered perovskites.

This size of layered perovskite grains is limited by how fast the BA ligands can diffuse to the site for layered perovskite growth, and the competition of 3D-like and layered perovskites may interrupt the growth of large grain layered perovskites, as evidenced by the HRTEM images. The competition of 3D-like and layered perovskite formation also indicates that the film morphology should be very sensitive to the process condition such as temperature or solvent drying speed. This is again supported by the study of layered perovskite formation by slowing down the 3D perovskite formation by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to the precursor solution. DMSO in precursor solution has been shown to promote the layered perovskite growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which is also observed here by the much strong PL emission from the layered perovskites in both front and back side of the films, and clear XRD peaks at low diffraction angle (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).

Sargent and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> have reported the observation of intermediate phase in reduced-dimensional metal halide perovskites when DMSO/NMP is used in solutions.

The 3D-like crystal tends to precipitate first. As more and more 3D-like crystals precipitated, the ratio of BA to MA in leftover solution gradually increased and the BA-rich solution facilitated the afterward layered perovskite nucleus formation.

According to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we speculate that the energy transfer is more dominant in this system, because the transfer process happens at a very early delay time scale (far before 500 ps). We speculate energy transfer from the larger bandgap layered perovskites to lower bandgap 3D-like perovskites across the ligands. The layered flakes observed in our study were generally few layers, and thus we expect most of energy may be transferred to 3D-like perovskites. After energy transfer, excitons are generated in 3D-like perovskites, which will dissociate into free charge quickly due to the very small exciton binding energy in 3D-like perovskites. Thus, the transport and collection of free charge carriers was dominated by 3D-like perovskite phase which form a percolation network in layered perovskite solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Carrier transport in layered perovskite solar cells</title><p id="Par17">One way to verify whether photogenerated charges go through 3D-like perovskite phase to be collected is to measure the charge extraction time needed for both the 3D and layered perovskites with a thickness of the devices. In view of the layered structure of layered perovskites and the insulating nature of the long chain organic cations, it is intuitively assumed by us that there would be large conductivity anisotropy along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions.

Here, we used the transient photocurrent (TPC) method to measure the carrier transit time of the BA-based layered perovskite thin film solar cells (with precursor composition of <italic>n</italic> = 4) with a device structure of ITO/PTAA/layered perovskite (550 nm thick)/PCBM/C60/BCP/Cu, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>. For the TPC measurement, the RC constant of the device was carefully controlled to be smaller than the carrier transit time by reducing device area. The derived low limit for the mobility of the layered perovskite films from TPC was 0.2 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> by neglecting the transit time in other buffer layers. This mobility is comparable to the in-plane carrier mobility of layered perovskite SC, or measured mobility of polycrystalline 3D perovskite materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, but much larger than that of layered perovskites along the out-of-plane direction. Since we do not see layered flakes are large enough to connect electron and hole transport layers, the results agree well with our scenario that the charge extraction process in the layered perovskite thin films is dominated by the 3D-like perovskite phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">The morphology observed in this study can help the understanding of the device efficiency limitation and stability enhancement in layered perovskite solar cells. The layered/3D-like mixture still allows the charge extraction out of the device through the 3D-like network if the film thickness is not too large. This generally explains the high EQE of 80 to 90% achieved in the wavelength range of 400 to 650 nm. However, compared to the EQE spectrum of pure 3D perovskite solar cells, it is found that EQE within the wavelength range of 650 to 750 nm is much lower for the layered perovskite solar cells. This may be caused by the inefficient absorption of the incident photons at this wavelength range, or due to the less efficient energy transfer from the layered phases with larger <italic>n</italic> values to the 3D-like phase because of either the larger flakes or the smaller bandgap difference between them. This presents a challenge to efficiently harvesting the incident photon energies for the layered perovskite solar cells, which is the main reason that the <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> of the layered perovskite solar cells is lower than that of their 3D counterparts. Increasing the thickness of such films to enhance absorption generally does not always result in enhanced <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>, may be due to the fact that the layered perovskite flakes with non-ideal orientation embedded in 3D-like perovskite would still impede the charge transport and thus cause charge recombination. The <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of layered perovskite solar cells should be limited by the smallest bandgap phase when the photoactive layer is a mixture of multiple phases with different band gaps. This is the reason that the obtained <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of 1.13 V is comparable to the value widely achieved in 3D perovskite solar cells despite the layered perovskites has larger bandgap than their 3D counterpart. In terms of fill factor, it is much lower for the layered perovskite solar cells in comparison to the 3D counterparts, which may be caused by the increasing charge carrier recombination occurs at the layered/3D-like perovskite interface.</p><p id="Par20">Regarding the better environmental stability of layered perovskite solar cells observed in some cases, it is generally believed that this is mainly benefited from the protection of the organic ligand of the layered perovskite materials. However, the real morphology result shown here reveals that the layered perovskite films formed by hot-casting method is mainly composed of 3D-like perovskite phases with more 3D-like phases preferentially distributed on the top surface. It is intriguing to understand why their long-term stability can outperform the 3D counterparts in some cases. We speculate the enhanced stability of perovskite solar cells with addition of some 2D additive may be contributed by multiple factors. First of all, the organic ligands added in the precursor solution for layered perovskite formation must stay somewhere if they do not convert all the 3D perovskites into layered perovskites. They most likely will stay at grain boundaries which may contribute to the formation of more robust grain boundaries. Our recent studies showed that defective grain boundaries may initiate and facilitate the film degradation, because moisture, oxygen or constituting ions in perovskites can migrate much faster along them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. As a matter of fact, our previous study on the ion migration property of the layered perovskite films fabricated by the same method as reported here showed that the ion migration was largely suppressed up to 330 K in layered perovskite films both in dark and under illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This can significantly alleviate the ion migration-induced degradation of the perovskite layer, especially under illumination. Second, the addition of ligands for layered perovskites may also relieve the strain in the formed films and thus enhance the intrinsic stability of the films. The presence of lattice strain was recently observed by us in perovskite films formed through annealing process, and the lattice strain accelerates the degradation of perovskite films because ion migration in perovskite films is accelerated by the presence of strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The relief of strain can suppress the ion migration process and thus improve the photo-stability of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> thin films. We propose that the better stability of layered perovskite solar cells may also have contribution from the less-strained perovskite layer in comparison to the pure 3D perovskite films, which is confirmed by the very small XRD peak shift between the layered perovskite film on substrate and the freestanding strain-free perovskite powders scratched from the substrate (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">In summary, we conduct nanoscopic- and microscopic-level morphology characterization to reveal the real morphology of the hot-cast layered perovskite solar cells. Based on that, we propose a model to explain their working mechanism: the photons absorbed by the layered perovskite phases can contribute to the photocurrent by energy transfer process from the larger bandgap layered phases to the smaller bandgap 3D-like phase, and the carrier transport within the perovskite layer is mainly through the 3D-like phase which forms a percolating network across the vertical direction of the solar cell devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Preparation of perovskite solar cells</title><p id="Par22">The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in acetone and isopropyl alcohol under sonication for 30 min, twice for each step.
