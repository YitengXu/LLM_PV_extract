Since the report on photocatalytic water splitting in 1972 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>), a quantum yield of ∼56% has been achieved for NiO/NaTaO<sub>3</sub>-La at 270 nm for overall water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, while for visible light systems a highest quantum yield of ∼5% at 420 nm was reported for RhCrO/ZnGaON<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These studied promise solar fuel production by photocatalysis.

These papers indicate that this construction of stable photocatalysts from lightweight and abundant elements is possible and opens up new opportunities for photochemistry. The two-dimensional (2D) character of their electron systems gives further access to partly ‘exotic’ physical properties, as described for graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and layered hexagonal BN (<italic>h</italic>-BN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

From the plot of the transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus light energy, a bandgap of 2.72 eV was estimated for BCN-30. The long absorption tails in the visible however indicates the presence of intraband impurity transitions, potentially located at the surface. Further optimization of the synthesis of high-quality <italic>h</italic>-BCN alloys is certainly a valuable option.

The best sample is BCN-30, while hydrogen evolution rate gradually decreases as the carbon content further increases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM293">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Excessive amounts of carbon presumably diminish the size of ordered domains and weaken the semiconductor properties, as confirmed by the decrease in the charge-carrier lifetime with excessive carbon doped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM293">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). It is however a remarkable observation that the BCN alloys could photocatalyse hydrogen generation even without using noble metals as a cocatalyst and even with visible light.

This indicates that the surface of BCN alloys are already rather active, and one can speculate about a pro forma hydride elimination from the boron sites (corresponds to a reversible hydrogenation of a –N=B-bond) in the catalytic cycle. However, the stability of BCN under strong ultraviolet irradiation is remarkably increased by adding Pt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM293">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). We can speculate that the Pt is avoiding the over-reduction of the –N=B-structure and the consecutive reductive disintegration of the material. The overall production of hydrogen gas amounts to 4,570 μmol in these two-cycle reactions, exceeding the amount of <italic>h</italic>-BCN (1,342 μmol) and Pt (5.12 μmol). After the reaction, the structure of BCN-30 was stable as reflected by the XRD, FTIR and TEM examinations of the used photocatalyst (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM293">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). The apparent quantum efficiency of BCN-30 was calculated to be 0.54% at 405 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM293">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) by using equation (1).

It is noted that there is not clear relationship between the specific surface area and hydrogen evolution rate of BCN samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM293">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). This is due to the fact that in most solid–liquid phase photocatalysis the reaction rate is basically limited by charge separation instead of mass transfer.</p><p id="Par16">The H<sub>2</sub> generation from water is pleasing, but it constitutes only the minor half of the problem of water splitting. The other half-reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, is particularly challenging because it requires the promotion of four redox processes over a narrow potential range, the coupling of multiple proton and electron transfers, and the formation of an oxygen–oxygen bond. As a first trial to promote oxygen evolution from water by BCN, we choose RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>3</sub>, and Ni-Co layered double hydroxides (Ni-Co LDHs) as cocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

In our synthetic section, it possessed 5 h to reaction under high temperature. Maybe in the early reaction section, the C, B, N can group freely, but later the compound will reform to a lower free energy compound. Previous theory and experiment results have already testified that the bonding energy of C–C and B–N bonds is comparatively higher than that of other hetero bonds present in the ternary system, consequently, the hybrid systems will be domain-segregated into two different regions, one with C-rich domain and other with BN-enriched domain, to gain thermodynamic stability.
