Here, we investigated the relationships between green fluorescence, coral heating and tissue optics for the massive coral <italic>Dipsastraea</italic> sp. (previously <italic>Favia</italic> sp.). We used microsensors to measure tissue scalar irradiance and temperature along with hyperspectral imaging and combined imaging of variable chlorophyll fluorescence and green fluorescence. Green fluorescence correlated positively with coral heating and scalar irradiance enhancement at the tissue surface. Coral tissue heating saturated for maximal levels of green fluorescence. The action spectrum of coral surface heating revealed that heating was highest under red (peaking at 680 nm) irradiance. Scalar irradiance enhancement in coral tissue was highest when illuminated with blue light, but up to 62% (for the case of highest green fluorescence) of this photon enhancement was due to green fluorescence emission. We suggest that GFP-like pigments scatter the incident radiation, which enhances light absorption and heating of the coral. However, heating saturates, because intense light scattering reduces the vertical penetration depth through the tissue eventually leading to reduced light absorption at high fluorescent pigment density. We conclude that fluorescent pigments can have a central role in modulating coral light absorption and heating.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep26599.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep26599" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep26599</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Globally, coral reefs degrade at an alarming rate primarily because of the combined effects of climate change, pollution, overfishing and the increased frequency of coral diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Coral bleaching describes the loss of the coral’s symbiotic algae (<italic>Symbiodinium</italic> spp.) and/or associated pigments and is often induced during extended periods of above average seawater temperature in combination with high irradiance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Corals have different susceptibilities to bleaching, which can be related to a combination of factors such as the characteristics of the coral host, the clade of the symbiotic algae and the environmental history<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Recently, it has been argued that the optical and thermal properties of corals might have a central role in defining coral photophysiology and stress susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Light is scattered strongly in both coral tissue and skeleton and such light scattering can lead to an enhancement of the <italic>in hospite</italic> exposure of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400–700 nm) by about 2 times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The optical properties of coral tissue and skeleton vary strongly between coral species resulting in unique light regimes for <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> harbored within different coral hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Skeleton light scattering differs among species and such light scattering properties may partly explain coral bleaching susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, the optical properties of the tissue are also important, given that intense light scattering in coral tissue strongly modulates symbiont light exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A potentially important component of radiative transfer within coral tissue are fluorescent proteins (FPs) that are synthesized by the coral host and are homologous to the well-known green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>GFP-like pigments in corals can occur in four main colors, of which three are fluorescent (cyan, green and red) and one is non-fluorescent (purple-blue)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The fluorescent pigments (FPs) are synthesized by the coral in a premature and initially non-fluorescent form that can be stored in the coral tissue before maturing into the fluorescent form via an oxidation step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The non-fluorescent proteins are called chromoproteins (CPs) and are characterized by minimal fluorescence and high absorption efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Most FPs in corals are excited by blue-green light (450–495 nm) and emit a red-shifted fluorescence (between 495–570 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. FPs are very common in corals and it has been estimated that up to 97% of shallow water corals on the Great Barrier Reef harbor FPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>The function of FPs in corals remains unclear, albeit many suggestions have been made including photoprotection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, antioxidant activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The most commonly proposed function is that FPs protect coral symbionts from excess radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Salih <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> showed that corals with FPs showed higher values of the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, i.e. the corals were significantly less photoinhibited, when exposed to high irradiance, as compared to corals without FPs. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the expression of photoprotective FPs can be regulated depending on the degree of ambient light stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The ability to convert energy-rich solar radiation, especially damaging ultra violet (UV) radiation, into red-shifted less harmful radiation has thus been suggested to be a key aspect of the photoprotective characteristics of FPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Although photoprotection is apparently an important function of FPs in light stressed corals, they might at the same time stimulate photosynthesis in low light habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and corals located in deeper waters were found to harbor FPs primarily in lower tissue layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It has been speculated that light transmitted through the tissue can be backscattered by FPs located deeper within the tissue, thus potentially enhancing photon absorption by the symbionts located above FPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, but such a function of FPs in corals still awaits experimental confirmation.</p><p>While GFP-like pigments can affect the optical properties of corals in various ways, it has so far not been considered, whether FPs can also affect the thermal properties of corals. The temperature microenvironment is directly linked to the light absorption properties of an organism. When light is absorbed it can either result in a chemical reaction (e.g. photosynthesis), be re-emitted as light (via scattering or fluorescence) or be converted into heat (i.e. random molecular vibrations). The total temperature rise (or warming) of an organism is directly proportional to the total radiative energy absorbed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In corals, about 90% of the absorbed light energy is converted to heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The application of temperature microsensors has facilitated an understanding of the local heat generation of photosynthetic underwater organisms such as corals and biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Such measurements have shown that the coral surface temperature can increase by up to 1 °C relative to the ambient water mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The specific coral tissue surface temperature is a function of heat generation, i.e., light absorption, as well as heat transfer to the coral skeleton and to the overlaying water through the thermal boundary layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Heat generation has been demonstrated to be primarily a function of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> light absorption in corals with low FP content, e.g., the brown morphs of <italic>Porites lobata</italic> and <italic>Stylophora Pistillata</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The thermal action spectrum of coral heating showed that heating correlated with the peak absorption of Chl <italic>a</italic> (between 400–450 nm and 650–680 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>Coral FPs have been suggested to interfere with <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> light absorption through various optical mechanisms including scattering, fluorescence and light absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. For instance, some FPs absorb blue light within the peak absorption of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> (~420 nm) and re-emit part of this light as green fluorescence. Compared to blue light, absorption of green light is lower for <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> and green fluorescence could thus interfere with the coral heat budget. Additionally, intense reflection of blue-green light by FPs might lower heating by reducing coral light absorption. However, some FPs have high molecular extinction coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and could also lead to enhanced heating of corals. So far the relationship between FP content and coral heating has not been explored, albeit such knowledge could provide important insight into the regulation of the optical and thermal microenvironment and radiative energy budget of corals and thereby coral bleaching susceptibility.</p><p>In this study, we used a combination of fiber-optic and electrochemical microsensors along with imaging of variable chlorophyll fluorescence, green fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging to investigate relationships between green fluorescence, coral heating and coral microscale optics. Specifically, we investigated i) the tissue surface distribution of green fluorescence at high spatial resolution, ii) the potential relationships between green fluorescence, coral heating and tissue scalar irradiance and iii) the wavelength dependency of heating and scalar irradiance enhancement in a massive thick-tissued coral.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Corals</title><p>Sun-adapted corals were collected from shallow waters (&lt;2 m depth) on the reef flat of Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia (152°06′E, 20°29′S).

We used the same colony in order to reduce the chance that factors related to biological variability such as symbiont genotype and coral growth history would confound the relationships between green fluorescence and coral heating/optics. A culture period of about 6 weeks was chosen to ensure sufficient upregulation of FP synthesis.

A motorized micromanipulator (MU-1, PyroScience GmbH, Germany) was attached to a heavy-duty stand to facilitate positioning of scalar irradiance and temperature microsensors on the coral surface (see below for details).

Previous studies have shown that there is a strong positive correlation between green fluorescence intensity and FP concentration in coral tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While the contribution to green fluorescence between 500–575 nm in corals is dominated by GFP-like pigments, there are some GFP-like pigments that do not emit green fluorescence such as chromoproteins as well as the premature stage of some GFP-like pigments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In our study, the use of green fluorescence as a proxy for relative FP density is thus limited to the fluorescent forms (FPs) of GFP-like pigments. Additionally, blue light absorbed by zooxanthellae before it reaches gastrodermal FPs is likely to reduce the intensity of the imaged green fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

The I-PAM was equipped with a bandpass filter that had a 500–575 nm transmission range (K6-MIN/FS, Walz GmbH, Germany) in order to capture green fluorescence emitted by GFP-like proteins following blue light excitation (λ<sub>max</sub> 470 nm). The imaging system was attached to a heavy-duty stand and mounted vertically above the flow chamber with a working distance of 5 cm between the camera lens and the coral surface. The camera aperture was set to f/1.4 and the manual focus was fixed. FP imaging was performed by darkening the coral fragment in the flow chamber for 5 min before application of a brief saturation pulse (2500–3000 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for 0.8 s) to capture a single image. No other light was applied apart from the saturation pulse.</p><p>In a few cases, the fluorescence signal was oversaturated under the chosen aperture settings (f/1.4). As the amount of light detected by the imaging system is directly proportional to the aperture area, the measurements were re-done with a smaller aperture area by increasing the f-number from f/1.4 to f/2–8. To allow comparison of the FP signal obtained for different f-numbers the image values had to be calibrated. This was done by imaging a given measurement spot for all f-numbers (i.e. f/2, f/2.8, f/4 and f/8) and calculating the aperture area as:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep26599_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>f</italic> is the focal length (16 mm) and N is the f-number, i.e., the focal length divided by aperture diameter.

FPs in such a granule configuration would represent good so-called Mie scatterers exhibiting wavelength independent scattering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which would explain the observed enhancement of tissue surface PAR over all spectral bands of excitation light (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a–d</xref>).</p><p>We found a positive relationship between tissue PAR enhancement and tissue heating (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). When radiative energy interacts with a biological tissue, part of the absorbed light energy is dissipated as heat and the local heat generation is primarily a function of incident light energy and the light absorption properties of the tissue. Mathematically, heat generation is defined as: (2) <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep26599_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>, where μ<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is the absorption coefficient (cm<sup>−1</sup>), <italic>H</italic> is the radiant energy exposure (J cm<sup>−2</sup>), ρ is the density (g cm<sup>−3</sup>) and c is the heat capacity (J °C<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) of the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, in strongly light scattering tissues, such as coral tissues, the local scalar irradiance can exceed the incident radiation by several times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In such cases, heating is a function of the local scalar irradiance (E<sub>0</sub>) and not the incident radiative exposure (H)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This would thus suggest that coral tissues with enhanced green fluorescence and thus enhanced surface PAR would also generate more heat. Indeed, we found a significant positive correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) between green fluorescence and tissue heating at low to intermediate levels of green fluorescence (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus as the density of light scattering fluorescent pigment granules increases, so does the local tissue scalar irradiance, which subsequently enhances the chance of light absorption and heating by the coral.</p><p>However, our results also showed that heating saturated at high levels of green fluorescence, suggesting that the effect of FPs on coral light absorption and heating become non-linear at high irradiance (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In order to illustrate the potential mechanism underlying such non-linearity, we developed a conceptual model (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) based on basic light scattering theory and a simplified Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>). The model is further described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary information</xref>. The model assumes three simplified tissue layers, a top layer that contains the FP scattering elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> at varying densities (representative of the epidermal coral tissue layer), a middle layer of high absorption (representative of the gastrodermal layer containing <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> and/or other light absorbing elements such as chromoproteins) and a bottom layer of low absorption and low scattering (representative of the coral skeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). When light scattering in the top layer is low (low FP content) most of the incident radiation penetrates through the coral and thus light absorption and heating is low (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). At intermediate densities of light scattering (intermediate FP content), the incident irradiance is strongly diffused by the FP layer, which leads to an enhanced chance of photon absorption and heating in the lower layers (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>). Because light scattering also increases the diffuse radiant flux that escapes the tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>), both diffuse reflectance and absorption/heating is increased relative to the low FP scenario. However, as light scattering in the top layer further increases, absorption/heating will eventually saturate. This saturation is because intense scattering will reduces light penetration into coral tissue and thus leads to reduced chance of light absorption in deeper light absorbing layers below (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs 8c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4d</xref>). Thus we suggest that the observed heating saturation at higher irradiance is caused by reduced light penetration because of intense scattering by FPs in the upper tissue layers. This theory implies that at excess densities of light scattering FPs, heating will decrease because more of the light is scattered away and lost from the system as diffuse reflectance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4d</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hypothetical mechanism for non-linearity of tissue heating in coral tissue with FPs.</p><p>Three cases of FP density are shown, (<bold>a</bold>) low FP, (<bold>b</bold>) medium FP and (<bold>c</bold>) high FP. The vertical coral tissue structure shows the oral tissue layer with the epidermis (<bold>e</bold>) the connecting tissue layer (mesoglea; m), gastrodermal host cells (<bold>g</bold>) containing <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> photosymbionts (yellow circles; s). The scheme ignores the lower tissue layer (aboral tissue) and the skeleton (see text) and assumes that (i) fluorescent pigments (blue-green triangles; FP) are situated above the symbionts, (ii) that skeleton scattering is low and (iii) that tissue background scattering is constant for (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>). Incident light (black arrow) is either reflected (R), absorbed and subsequently dissipated as heat (ΔT), or transmitted and lost from the system (T). (<bold>a</bold>) Light reaches FPs, causing scattering and enhanced chance of symbiont photon absorption and heating. Part of the light reaches lower layers (dotted black arrow) where symbionts absorb light and dissipate heat. For low FP content the scattering effect is relatively small and transmission through the coral is high. (<bold>b</bold>) As FP content increases, light scattering is enhanced, causing multiple scattering between FP granules. This strongly enhances net heating of the coral tissue system. Penetration depth and transmission is somewhat reduced. Reflectivity is enhanced because of diffuse backscattering by FP. (<bold>c</bold>) At high densities of FP, strong diffuse scattering enhances reflectivity and heating by symbionts located in proximity to the FPs. However, strong scattering follows reduced penetration depth and thus reduced chance of photon absorption and heating for deeper tissue layers (red cross on dotted black arrow). Net heating is high but caused by localized scattering of a small part within the tissue. As light scattering increases further, heating will eventually decrease and most of the light is lost as diffuse reflectance. The model was supported by Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep26599_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>We found that coral tissues with highest green fluorescence revealed a high reflectivity of approximately 20% (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), in line with previously measured reflectivity of fluorescent corals reaching up to 15%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that the high reflectivity of FPs would lead to reduced tissue light absorption and tissue heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The results of this study however suggest that such a photoprotective function is likely to be FP density dependent, where low densities of light scattering FPs lead to an increase of both reflectivity and light absorption/heating (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4a,b</xref>), while high densities will lead to increased tissue reflectivity and eventually reduce light absorption under high irradiance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4d</xref>). With regard to the ongoing debate concerning the photoprotective or photosynthesis-stimulating function of FPs in corals, future studies need to consider the potential for density dependent effects of FPs on coral photobiology.</p><p>The thermal action spectrum showed lowest heating for blue light excitation when normalized to equal power for each spectral band (500 W m<sup>−2</sup>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a–d</xref>). In contrast, previous studies performed with brown non-fluorescent corals (<italic>Porites lobata</italic> and <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic>) found that heating was greatest when excited with blue light. It was shown that heating was dominated by the absorption spectrum of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> with peak absorption of Chl <italic>a</italic> in the blue (at 430 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). Assuming that the Stokes shift from blue to green would occur before light reaches <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>, as would be the case for endodermally located FPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> would be exposed to reduced blue and enriched green light. Green light absorption in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> is due to peridinin and the PCP complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, of which the total absorption cross-section is lower than for Chl <italic>a</italic> in the blue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Thus the comparably lower heating for the blue spectral band (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a–d</xref>) could be caused by significant re-emission of green fluorescence following blue light absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>Heating peaked when excited with the red spectral band peaking at around 680 nm (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This red spectral band overlaps with the second major absorption peak of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> at 675 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, thus suggesting a major contribution of Chl <italic>a</italic> absorption to the heating of coral tissue. Additionally, it is possible that non-fluorescent chromoproteins with high molecular extinction coefficients but low fluorescence (e.g. purple-blue chromoproteins) could have contributed to the characteristic heating patterns observed here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Hyperspectral imaging suggested the presence of cyan and green FPs for HF fragments and only green FPs for NF fragments (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), which matches the previous observation that especially cyan FPs are light inducible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The wavelength-dependent heating in fluorescent corals is likely a function of the specific mixture of different GFP-like proteins present. A detailed molecular analysis of the type and quantity of GFP-like proteins was beyond the scope of the present study, which focussed on linking coral optics to microscale heating in relation to green fluorescence. Future studies performing such detailed microscale measurements aligned with FP analysis of small tissue sections will provide an important next step in understanding the radiative energy regulation in green fluorescent corals.</p><p>It is important to consider other factors that could affect the absolute heating measured in the investigated tissues. Enhanced skeleton scattering within the corallite could contribute to the enhanced polyp tissue scalar irradiance, which would thus affect tissue heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, in thick-tissued corals, such an effect is likely to be negligible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. We did not quantify zooxanthellae density as our microscale measurement approach would require determining the cell density for microscopic tissue sections. Thus it is possible that tissues could have different zooxanthellae densities which would affect tissue heating. Likewise, differences in the thickness of the thermal boundary layer (TBL) between coenosarc and polyp tissues can affect the measured surface heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, a potential TBL effect cannot explain the enhanced heating of polyp areas for the HF vs. the NF fragment (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Although we cannot account for such factors, the positive correlation between green fluorescence and tissue heating independent of light acclimation and coral topography or tissue type (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), strongly suggests that the enhanced heating is caused by simple light scattering mechanisms underlying the presence of fluorescent pigments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Quenching analysis performed with PAM showed no difference in the effective quantum yield of PSII between tissues with different green fluorescence levels (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Previous studies aimed at investigating the effects of FPs on the quantum yield of PSII have produced inconclusive results. For instance, Salih <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> found enhanced maximum quantum yields of PSII in green fluorescent morphs of <italic>Acorpora palifera</italic>, as compared to their non-fluorescent counterparts. Likewise, Roth <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> studied the effects of temperature stress on corals with FPs and showed that there was a positive correlation between green fluorescence and the effective quantum yield of PSII in healthy corals of <italic>Acropora yongeii</italic>. However, other studies did not find significant effects of GFP-like proteins on variable Chl <italic>a</italic> fluorometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. For instance, no difference was found in the maximum quantum yield of PSII between fluorescent and non-fluorescent morphs of the coral <italic>Galaxea fascicularis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Likewise, no difference was found in any photosynthetic parameter for different fluorescent morphs of <italic>Leptoseris spp</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p>While our results did not reveal any difference in the quantum yield of PSII (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), they did show minor but significant differences in Y(NPQ) and Y(NO) in tissues with different levels of green fluorescence. HF polyp tissues showed lower NPQ under excess irradiance compared to HF coenosarc tissues with lower FP content (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Since NPQ is a photoprotective mechanism that dissipates excess energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and usually increases at the expense of the photosynthetic quantum yield, we would have expected a reduction in the effective quantum yield between these tissue types. However, we found no difference in the photosynthetic quantum yield but an increase in the non-regulated energy pathway, Y(NO) for HF polyp tissues (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This suggests that tissues with high amounts of FPs might be able to get rid of excess energy by other means not accounted for by NPQ. Such excess energy dissipation could be related to the photoprotective properties of FP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p>In summary, the present study investigated potential links between green fluorescence and heating of coral tissues. We showed that both coral tissue heating and scalar irradiance increased with green fluorescence and there was a positive correlation between the enhancement of tissue scalar irradiance and coral heating, albeit heating saturated at maximal levels of measured green fluorescence. Our results suggest that FPs scatter and diffuse the incident radiation, which subsequently enhances light absorption and heating of the coral tissue. However, heating saturates as strong light scattering reduces the vertical penetration depth through the coral tissue eventually leading to a reduction in light absorption at high levels of fluorescent pigments. We conclude that fluorescent pigments in corals can have a central role in modulating light absorption and heating of corals both via their fluorescent and light scattering properties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Lyndby, N.
