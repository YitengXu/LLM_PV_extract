In the most frequently employed PEC cell configuration, an n-type semiconductor (SC) photoanode (where photogenerated positive holes, h<sup>+</sup>, oxidize water to form O<sub>2</sub>) is combined with a metallic cathode (where electrons, e<sup>-</sup>, transferred from the photoanode, reduce protons to form H<sub>2</sub>). It is to be noted, in this connection that, considering high overpotentials accompanying the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on conventional (unilluminated) anodes, the SC photoanodes may arguably offer larger advantage than the photocathodes for the performance of a PEC water splitting cell. As regards the photoanodes, the only materials able to photo-oxidize water whilst avoiding photocorrosion (essentially for kinetic reasons) are metallic oxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and only few of them (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, BiVO<sub>4</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub>) feature optical absorption spectra that match terrestrial solar spectrum. Since none among those photostable - metallic oxide - semiconductors exhibits band-edge energy levels that match those of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to allow unassisted water splitting, the present efforts focus on minimizing the bias voltage allowing the photoanode to reach plateau (saturation) photocurrent when performing visible light-driven photo-oxidation of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In fact, the moderate operating potential point at which the photocurrent already reaches saturation is a precondition for combining the photoelectrolyzer with a photovoltaic (PV) cell to form a tandem device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Actually, a bias voltage of the order of 1 V (at which the semitransparent WO<sub>3</sub> photoanode approaches saturation photocurrent) may be provided by several single-junction photovoltaic (PV) cells likely to operate in a tandem device with the PEC cell.</p><p id="Par4">The principal strategy developed for improving the photocurrent-voltage (j-E) behavior of the SC photoanodes, by reducing e<sup>-</sup>-h<sup>+</sup> recombination losses, involved deposition on the photoanodes of OER electrocatalysts such as mixed cobalt phosphate-oxide (Co–Pi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or oxyhydroxides of nickel and iron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To address this issue, several authors also attempted to combine water splitting with the kinetically easier photo-oxidation of biomass derivatives to replace or complement oxygen evolution on the photoanode. However, an optimal implementation of such concept would require, rather than total mineralization at the photoanode of the used biomass-derived reagent (to form carbon dioxide), its efficient conversion into value-added products. Early studies aimed to enhance hydrogen production at the cathode via photo-reforming at the anode of biomass-derived products used principally nano-crystalline (NC) TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and ethanol as model compound acting as a hole scavenger. When an alkaline electrolyte (1 M NaOH) was employed by the authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> in the anode compartment, the ethanol solutions did not reach total mineralization due, in particular, to the formation of insoluble aldol condensation products - high molecular weight aldehydes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The latter investigations followed parallel studies in this area that used relatively low concentrations of oxygenate biomass derivatives with suspended in the solutions TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) acting as photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">However, an important advantage of the PEC cell configuration is in the facility of produced gas separation and the possibility of controlling the atmosphere in the anode compartment. Although the photo-oxidation of biomass-derived oxygenates at NC TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanodes has been shown to be highly efficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and to benefit, in addition, from the photocurrent doubling effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the large band gap of the semiconductor (E<sub>g</sub> = 3.2 eV), for the anatase form (that is the major component of the widely employed commercial P25 particles) is an evident limitation for the effective use of sunlight as the irradiation source.</p><p id="Par7">The photocurrent doubling effect has also been demonstrated for the photo-oxidation of organic C1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and larger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> molecules at nanostructured (NS) tungsten trioxide photoelectrodes that, due to their lower bandgap energy (E<sub>g</sub> = 2.5–2.6 eV), are capable to also absorb light over the visible blue portion of the solar spectrum. Despite the fact that E<sub>g</sub> of WO<sub>3</sub> is larger than the optimum value of 2-2.2 eV, the NS WO<sub>3</sub> photoanodes attained considerable photocurrent efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> due to relatively long hole diffusion length of ca 150 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> that reduces bulk electron-hole recombination within the NPs that form the film. On the other hand, the efficient photogenerated current collection at the electrode substrate is favored by large (in the range of 6.5-12 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) electron mobility in the crystalline WO<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">A more recent work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, employing thin film WO<sub>3</sub> photoanodes formed by sputtering confirmed the occurrence of the photocurrent doubling also in the case of photo-oxidation of a biomass-derived monosaccharide – glucose. Significant information that stemmed from that study was a relatively low extent of glucose conversion into CO<sub>2</sub>, in particular in more concentrated (0.1 M) solutions, that indicated the dominant formation of intermediate oxidation products that could not been identified. We note in this connection that numerous experiments on photo-reforming glucose and/or lignocellulose using suspensions of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts loaded with noble metal’s (most frequently Pt) NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, in which changes in the solution composition were monitored using high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analyses, showed the formation of a wide variety, some of them high-value, oxidation products. In one of such studies, the TiO<sub>2</sub> doping with tungsten allowed the operation of such Pt-TiO<sub>2</sub>(W) photocatalyst under sunlight irradiation while TiO<sub>2</sub> doping with nitrogen favored formation, besides H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, of arabinose, erythrose and formic acid as partial glucose oxidation products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">An interesting approach, intended to avoid the use of noble metal catalysts required to reduce protons into H<sub>2</sub> in the case of photo-reforming of lignocellulose at TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, resulted in the development of a photocatalytic system based on n-type SC cadmium sulfide quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In fact, CdS (E<sub>g</sub> = 2.4 eV) that absorbs the blue portion of the visible spectrum features the conduction band (CB) level at a potential sufficiently negative (ca −0.5 V vs SHE) to favor H<sub>2</sub> evolution in the absence of co-catalysts. To conduct photo-reforming of α-cellulose, the authors used a strongly alkaline (10 M KOH) solution, the conditions under which the surface of suspended CdS quantum dots became passivated by a CdO<sub>x</sub> overlayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, despite efficient sunlight-driven H<sub>2</sub> evolution, due to the complex chemistry involved in the synthesis of CdS quantum dots and the well-known toxicity of cadmium compounds, the latter work may be rather considered as an interesting proof of concept.</p><p id="Par10">Among few examples in which upgrading of biomass-derived compounds was performed in a PEC cell, and not in a photocatalytic system featuring suspension of SC particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, is the oxidation on a BiVO<sub>4</sub> - based photoanode of an important intermediate in biomass conversion 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-difurancarboxylic acid (FDCA) - a monomer used for the synthesis of several polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

Let us to recall that glucose is a common carbohydrate available in nature that can be obtained through the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose present in waste biomass. We demonstrate that a significant replacement of OER with the photo-oxidation of glucose results in a large increase of the photocurrents attained at the NS WO<sub>3</sub> photoanode due to the more favorable reaction kinetics and, especially, due to the occurrence of the photocurrent doubling. We probed the photocurrent efficiency as well as stability of the photoanode to also find out the most appropriate electrolyte composition, which allows the formation of the largest amount of valuable organic products – gluconic and glucuronic acids, arabinose and erythrose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and structural characterization of WO<sub>3</sub> film electrodes</title><p id="Par12">We synthesized the NS WO<sub>3</sub> films by a sol-gel method involving layer-by-layer deposition on the substrate of a colloidal solution of freshly prepared tungstic acid, complemented by the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG 300), followed by high temperature (550-600 °C) annealing in oxygen. Conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass sheets served as electrode substrates. As confirmed by repeated PEC experiments performed with the same electrodes, the use of the sequential layer-by-layer precursor deposition/annealing procedure is essential for building structurally stable, relatively thick (up to 3 μm thick) WO<sub>3</sub> films with good adherence to the substrate. A single standard application of the precursor produced typically a ~0.4 μm thick WO<sub>3</sub> film. The films used in this work were formed by three-to-eight consecutive applications of the precursor solution, each followed by the high-temperature annealing in O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min.

We consider the formation of such a porous film being the result of burning the PEG, present in the precursor, occurring during the high-temperature annealing in oxygen.

The obtained results also revealed the possibility of tuning the distribution of the glucose photo-oxidation products by the selection of anions of the supporting electrolyte and of its pH.

Since the range of thermodynamic stability of crystalline monoclinic WO<sub>3</sub> in aqueous solutions extends from strong acids to pH 4.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, in order to minimize the possibility of photo-corrosion we decided to cover the outer surface of the WO<sub>3</sub> film with a thin ~0.4 μm thick deposited layer of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (P25 from Ovonics).

Despite slightly diminished light transmission by FTO, the IPCEs attain a maximum of ~160% at 360 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7a</xref>) with still observable photoresponse extending up to 480 nm.

Since anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> (the dominant form present in P25) does not absorb (and largely transmits) wavelengths above 400 nm, we hypothesize that the increased IPCEs may be due to the dispersion/reflection at the WO<sub>3</sub> – TiO<sub>2</sub> interface of a certain fraction of visible light unabsorbed by WO<sub>3</sub>.

The powder diffraction patterns were measured in a θ/2θ scanning mode with a step of 0.02° and counting time of 10 s by step.</p><p id="Par41">Raman spectra were acquired with the Alpha 300 M + confocal microscope (Witec) equipped with a motorized stage. For analyses we used a 532 nm laser line delivered to the microscope through a single-mode optical fiber. The laser power focused at the sample did not exceed 7 mW. The backscattered Raman signal was collected through a 50× long working distance objective (NA = 0.42), and passed through a photonic optical beam to a lens-based spectrometer (Witec UHTS 300, f/4 aperture, focal length 300 mm) coupled with a back-illuminated Andor iDUS 401 detector thermoelectrically cooled to −60 °C. The spectra were collected in the range of Raman shifts from 100 to 1000 cm<sup>−1</sup> with the use of an 600 mm grating. For each sample Raman mapping was conducted on a 50 × 50 μm<sup>2</sup> area with a 1 μm step (totaling to 2500 spectra) and a 0.3 s acquisition time. The spectra were postprocessed (background subtraction and cosmic-ray removal) with the Project FIVE software (Witec). For all samples, the spectra in the mapped area were homogeneous. Consequently, an average over 2500 spectra was made for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Photoelectrochemical measurements</title><p id="Par42">The photocurrent-potential (j-E) plots and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured in a Teflon cell equipped with a quartz window, by illuminating the WO<sub>3</sub> electrode either from the side of the solution/film interface or, in some cases, through the FTO substrate. The simulated AM 1.5 G (of 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> intensity) illumination was obtained from an Oriel 150 W solar simulator. In those measurements, the exposed WO<sub>3</sub> electrode surface area was 0.28 cm<sup>2</sup>. The measurements were performed in a three-electrode configuration, with a WO<sub>3</sub> photoanode a platinum grid counter electrode and a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) in sat. KCl (E = 0.197 vs SHE) as a reference electrode. The potentials are also quoted versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the same solution. To obtain j-E plots, the potential of the WO<sub>3</sub> electrode was swept from the open circuit potential of ~0.40 V<sub>RHE</sub> (in the solutions containing glucose) to 1.6 V<sub>RHE</sub> at a rate of 10 mV sec<sup>−1</sup> using a CH Instrument - CHI 660E electrochemical work-station. The IPCE spectra of the WO<sub>3</sub> photoanodes were determined using light from a 150 W xenon lamp passing through a photoelectric spectrometer (Instytut Fotonowy) featuring monochromator with a bandwidth of 10 nm. The absolute light intensity was measured with a model OL 730-5 C UV-enhanced silicon detector Gooch&amp;Housego.</p><p id="Par43">Preliminary long-term photoelectrolyses of the anolyte solutions containing glucose, intended to check the photostability of the photoanode, were carried out in a large volume quartz cell containing 400 mL of solution with anodic and cathodic compartments separated by a Nafion membrane. In those tests, a total surface area of the WO<sub>3</sub> films deposited on FTO (~1.6 cm<sup>2</sup>) was exposed to the electrolytes. Further 20 h-long experiments intended for identifying glucose photo-reforming products were performed in a smaller Teflon cell with ca 45 mL of anolyte and ~0.7 cm<sup>2</sup> illuminated WO<sub>3</sub> surface area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Identification of the glucose oxidation products</title><p id="Par44">To identify the products of glucose oxidation GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) interfaced with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer was used. The instrument was equipped with AOC-5000 autosampler (Shimadzu) in the liquid-injection mode featuring a 10 µl syringe. The syringe was washed three times before and after each injection with ethyl acetate and then with hexane. The analytes were separated using a capillary column ZB-5MSPlus (Phenomenex): 30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm stationary phase film. The column head pressure was 26.7 kPa, the total flow of the carried gas was 9.5 ml/min, column flow 0.68 ml/min (30 cm/sec) and the purge flow was 2 ml/min. The linear velocity flow control mode was used and the split ratio was 10. The temperatures of injector, ion source and the mass spectrometer transfer line were 300 °C. The following temperature program was used: initially 50 °C held for 2 min, then linear increase at the rate of 10 °C/min to 225 °C kept for 10 min, then linear increase at the rate of 15 °C/min to 280 °C, held for 10 min.; the total analysis time was 43 min. Mass spectrometer was equipped with the electron impact (EI) ion source and operated in the scan mode in the mass range 45-500 m/z (scan time 150 ms), the solvent cut was 6 min. For the quantitative analysis of the formed products (more concentrated samples), the glucose peak was removed from the chromatogram by turning off the mass spectrometer between 25.9 and 26.3 min to avoid oversaturating the detector and damaging the ion source.
