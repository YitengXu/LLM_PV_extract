In this work we applied the technique based on the combination of time-dependent sonication and iterative centrifugation cascades, which were designed to achieve nanosheets size and the number of layers selection. First such obtained GO dispersions were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical spectroscopy. Those combined measurements showed that the intensity of the π-π peak at 230 nm seems to be very sensitive to the number of layers of nanosheets. Next, GO dispersions were used to establish influence of the size and the number of layers of GO flakes on the photocatalytic hydrogen production in the photocatalytic system, containing eosin Y as a sensitizer, triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor, and CoSO<sub>4</sub> as precatalyst. The H<sub>2</sub> production efficiency varied by a factor of 3.7 for GO dispersions sonicated for various amount of time. Interestingly it was found that too long ultrasound treatment had negative impact on the GO enhancement of hydrogen production which was related to the fragmentation of GO flakes. The photocatalytic system produced the highest amount of H<sub>2</sub> when graphene oxide occurs as monolayers and efficiency becomes lower with the decrease of GO sheets size. Our results demonstrate the importance of optimizing the size and the number of layers of the GO flakes prior to preparation of GO-based materials.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2015/19/D/ST5/00682</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2015/19/D/ST5/00682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gacka</surname><given-names>Ewelina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewandowska-Andralojc</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>15968</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_95464.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Visible-light-driven water splitting is a long-standing goal for solar energy conversion. The known systems often suffer from the low photo-to-energy conversion efficiency that is related to poor electron transport between the photosensitizer/semiconductor and the catalyst. Most of the research, that involves systems in which the light harvester and the catalyst are not chemically linked and thus interaction between the components is exclusively controlled by diffusion. A novel strategy to enhance efficient charge separation and transport in photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production systems appeared with the discovery of graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The composites photocatalyst that includes graphene could have improved charge separation which results in better photocatalytic activity. Moreover, graphene due to its unique two-dimensional structure could act as a support that increases the specific surface of the material. However, graphene is a hydrophobic material what limits its application in water splitting process. Therefore, its two hydrophilic derivatives: graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were found to be more suitable for application in photocatalytic water splitting system.</p><p id="Par3">Much effort has been recently applied to design and fabricate multifunctional materials based on GO and RGO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the past 10 years, graphene-based materials were explored by a number of research groups and the concept of incorporating graphene type materials in the photocatalytic systems have been proven valid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The first example of the use of graphene for photocatalytic hydrogen production was the system composed of eosin Y (EY), RGO with Pt nanoparticles dispersed on its surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The largest apparent quantum yield (AQE) of 9.3% was achieved under 520 nm irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial reagent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. More recently, a few graphene-based systems that employ photosensitizers and catalysts (CoSnO<sub>x</sub>, NiS<sub>x</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>) that are both derived from earth-abundant materials were also reported for photocatalytic hydrogen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Yuan et al. presented enhanced photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen generation in a non-noble metal system for photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> generation that combined Zn(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-N-methylpyridyl) porphyrin and RGO decorated with MoS<sub>2</sub> as the catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was attributed to the facilitation of charge separation in the presence of graphene. Despite proof-of-concept studies on the application of graphene-based materials in photocatalysis, there are still some challenges to be addressed, which are thought to greatly inhibit practical applications. Surprisingly, despite the fact that it is well accepted that graphene-based materials has the potential to boost the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen systems, the link between morphological properties of GO or RGO (flakes size and the number of layers) and photocatalytic performances has not been explored yet.</p><p id="Par4">However, a polydispersity of graphene flakes has brought scientist attention as it presents important issues in many applications since the properties of graphene are inextricably linked to its structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It was reported previously that many applications require controlled nanosheet properties of materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. For example, counter electrode in the dye-sensitized solar cell require small nanosheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> whereas mechanical reinforcement of composites demands large ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Lyons et al. presented that smaller flakes result in more junctions and so lower conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. More precisely, graphene can stack into a thick multilayer structure via van der Waals force decreasing significantly the material’s specific surface area and conductivity.</p><p id="Par5">We are unaware of any deliberate works in the literature on the control of the morphology parameters of GO that was applied in the hybrid materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Since there is no prior study that focuses on the GO size and the number of layers selection it is currently unclear whether those parameters actually matter in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Therefore, a systematic exploration of the effect of the GO size and the number of layers is highly required to provide a reasonable correction for optimizing the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. With this work, we aim at filling this gap. Most graphene-oxide dispersions contain large variations in the number of layers, lateral area, and shape of the graphene oxide flakes. Here we applied the technique based on the combination of time-dependent sonication and iterative centrifugation cascades, which were designed to achieve nanosheets size and the number of layers selection. Such obtained dispersions were used to establish a correlation between the photocatalytic activity of the graphene-based materials and GO morphology. Our results clearly demonstrated that both GO size and the number of layers influences the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen production, while the effect of the number of layers was much more profound.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">Eosin Y and triethanolamine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, CoSO<sub>4</sub> was purchased from Alfa Aesar and graphene oxide (GO-powder &lt; 35 mesh, C/O atomic ratio = 2.5–2.6) was purchased from Abalonyx.

The size selection was obtained by means of controlled centrifugation with sequentially increasing rotation speeds using stock GO dispersion. The dispersion was centrifuged in a MPW-352R centrifuge equipped with a fixed-angle rotor Nalgene 11469 (radius of rotor equals 90 mm). In the standard primary cascade, stock GO suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 4 krpm (100 min). The sediment was collected while the supernatant was centrifuged at 8 krpm (100 min). Again, the sediment was collected and the supernatant subjected to centrifugation at higher speeds 12 krpm (100 min). The concentration of nanomaterial in each fraction was determined by weighing the sediment after its drying overnight at 60 °C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Photocatalytic reaction</title><p id="Par9">The photochemical reaction has been performed according to procedure described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In brief, in a photochemical reaction 3 mL of an aqueous solution of TEOA (0.2 M) and a certain amount of EY, GO and CoSO<sub>4</sub> were placed in a quartz 1 cm × 1 cm cuvette. The pH of the solution was 10.8. The mixture was then degassed by bubbling argon through it for 30 min. Then the solution was stirred continuously and exposed to irradiation from a Broadband Halogen Fiber Optic Illuminator (Thorlabs' OSL2 High-Intensity Fiber Light Source with a 150 W halogen lamp). The generated H<sub>2</sub> was monitored by a gas chromatograph (GC Agilent 7890B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The experiments were repeated independently four times using each time newly prepared GO suspensions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Experimental apparatus</title><p id="Par10">Extinction spectra of the GO dispersions were measured using a two-beam spectrometer Cary 100 UV–Vis scanning from 800 to 200 nm with 1 nm step. It should be noted that the extinction (Ext) is a combination of both the absorption (Abs) and scattering (Sca) where Ext(λ) = Abs(λ) + Sca(λ). The morphology of the GO flakes were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) Agilent 5500. The AFM imaging was realized using soft tapping mode by All-In-One Al cantilever (Budget Sensors) probe C, with a nominal force constant 7.4 N m<sup>−1</sup> and resonant frequency 150 kHz on the typical scan frequency of 0.2 Hz. For such analysis, the 0.1 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> GO water dispersions were highly diluted in the ratio of approximately 50 µL:1 mL, deposited on freshly cleaved mica and left at room temperature for at least 24 h. The morphology of graphene oxide flakes was also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Quanta 250 FEG, FEI. Four water dispersions of GO (0.01 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) with different sonication time were drop casted on silicon wafer substrate and left at room temperature to dry.

The formed GO can stack into thick multilayer structure via van der Waals force decreasing significantly the material’s specific surface area and conductivity which in turn may influence on the photocatalytic performance. A sonochemical approach is widely used as a routine protocol for GO preparation prior to assembly in hybrid materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was reported previously that ultrasonic treatment influences the adsorption properties of GO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">In this work, we investigated the effects of ultrasound sonication on graphite oxide aqueous suspensions by monitoring its structural and optical properties as a function of exposure time to the ultrasonic treatment. Martinez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> studied the effects of ultrasounds, found that the number of layers in the GO sheets can decrease from more than 30 layers to less than 5 layers after 20 min of the ultrasound treatment. Here the variation in sonication time (1–80 min) of GO dispersion leads to obtain the suspensions, denoted as GO-s1–GO-s13, where GO-s1 was sonicated for just 1 min and GO-s13 was sonicated for 80 min. The resultant ultrasound-selected GO dispersions were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). What’s more, the excessive sonication of the GO dispersion can also lead to the fragmentation of GO flakes or partial reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, size-selection of the GO flakes was determined independently by cascade centrifugation (vide infra).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images (left) and AFM images (middle) with corresponding height profiles (right) of graphene oxide flakes suspensions denoted as: GO-s1, GO-s5, GO-s7, GO-s8, GO-s13.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_95464_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">To characterize the morphology of graphene oxide flakes, we used two techniques of imaging: atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The AFM is suitable for measuring the number of layers of the flakes but during one scan only a small area of the sample is embraced. If the sample is no homogeneous, drawing conclusions based on limited number of images can be inaccurate. Thus, we used additionally SEM measurements which enabled us to observe the whole area in a reasonable time. The combination of AFM and SEM analysis provided more overall insight into the influence of the GO sonication process onto its delamination and fragmentation. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents the most representative images of the GO flakes from suspensions prepared with increasing time of sonication. Based on combination of the SEM and AFM results we can distinguish several structures of graphene oxide by their size and the number of layers. The first one, stacks composed of large flakes are in shiny, light gray colour (SEM) and their number of layers can reach hundreds (AFM). The large, very dark gray flakes are multilayer sheets but built of just a few layers. The smallest, light gray flakes are monolayers of graphene oxide which favour to conglomerate together during drying up drop of the sample. Based on the analysis of both AFM and SEM results we can state that the GO-s1 suspension consisted of stacks and multilayer GO flakes. Next, the GO-s5 is a mixture of smaller stacks, multilayers and monolayers, while the GO-s7 consist mostly of small multilayers and monolayer flakes. Finally, GO-s8 suspension consists mainly of monolayers. Based on these results we can conclude that initial sonication of graphene oxide breaks down the stacks which lead to the mixture of multilayers with a wide variety of flakes height down to the monolayers. Further sonication causes gradual destruction of monolayers by reducing their area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, GO-s13). As GO is highly sensitive for the reduction even at relatively low temperatures of 130–150°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> we verify the apparent height of monolayered GO flakes by the AFM. As the apparent height of monolayered GO flakes remains 1.0 nm after each sonication stage this indicates that the reduction process does not occur upon sonication since for reduced graphene sheet the height of monolayered flake is expected to be reduced by 0.2 ÷ 0.8 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">While AFM is a reliable technique for the evaluation of number of layers of nanosheet, such a method is time-consuming and expensive, making it unsuitable for routine batch monitoring. Quantification of the number of layers of graphene oxide nanosheet via optical spectroscopy could facilitate preparation of GO dispersion with high monolayer content. Therefore, we combined AFM with optical spectroscopy in order to establish the link between the GO morphology properties and its extinction coefficients. Optical absorption spectroscopy of graphene flakes suspension produced by high-yield liquid phase exfoliation was extensively employed by Coleman’s group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. It is known that the lateral size distribution, the mean number of layers per flake and the functional groups on graphene and graphene derivatives are all important factors influencing the extinction coefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, extinction spectra of liquid-exfoliated GO, displayed the characteristic peak at 230 nm that is due to the C = C bond in an aromatic ring and the broad shoulder peak at 300 nm that can be assigned to C = O. There were no observed 230 nm peak shifts for all sonicated samples, that would indicate the partial reduction of the GO and restoration of the electronic configuration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In our previous study mild reduction of GO by ascorbic acid was accompanied by the significant red-shift of the peak from 230 to 259 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Contrary to peak position that remained unchanged, the intensity of the peak at 230 nm of GO samples increased remarkably with the increase of sonication time due to efficient exfoliation of GO sheets, as observed in AFM measurements, which created more particles in the suspension and absorb more light from the excitation. In addition, the intensity of the extinction spectra of GO dispersion decreased slightly with the increase of sonication time in the region 400–800 nm which might be attributed to the decrease of the light scattering by GO samples that are exfoliated more efficiently.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Optical spectroscopic characterization of GO dispersions (0.04 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) as a function of sonication time (1–80 min).

It was clear from Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a that the absorption coefficient of GO sample depends strongly on the sonication treatment of GO. The absorption coefficient of GO dispersion (0.04 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) at 230 nm varied from 700 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> for GO-s1 suspension that was sonicated for just 1 min to 4830 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> after 20 min of sonication (GO-s8) (inset in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). During sonication, the GO aggregates were gradually destroyed up to the point where mainly monolayered flakes were present in suspension as determined by AFM measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, GO-s8). Based on AFM analyses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, GO-s8) it was determined that the GO sample that exhibited maximum absorption coefficient at 230 nm (GO-s8) existed mainly as monolayers but the presence of 2, 3 or even more layers in the sample cannot be discarded. Interestingly prolong bath sonication (additional 60 min) of the GO-s8 did not result in any further measurable changes in the optical spectra (GO-s13) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, dashed line). It indicated that variation in the GO number of layers has a much more profound impact on the optical properties of GO than the GO flakes size since it was shown by SEM measurements that GO-s13 has decreased the size of GO flakes in comparison to GO-s8 sample (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is in agreement with previous reports on the decrease of GO flakes size upon long sonication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">As demonstrated by combined optical spectroscopy and AFM/SEM measurements, the intensity of the π-π peak at 230 nm seems to be very sensitive to the nanosheet number of layers. Therefore we could correlate the number of layers in GO flakes with absorption coefficient at 230 nm. The number of layers in GO flakes evolve during the progressive sonication from the thick aggregates with hundreds of nanometers in thick down to fully monolayer. Concurrently, the absorption coefficient ε increases during the sonication increases. This implies the proportional correlation between the dispersion excitation coefficient and the amount of GO layers.

The sediment was labeled GO-12 krpm and the resulting supernatant was referred GO-residual.

The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was studied under visible irradiation by using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial donor and eosin Y (EY) as a photosensitizer. CoSO<sub>4</sub> salt was added to serve as a precatalyst in the reaction system, and GO was added to act as an electron mediator. This system was chosen to explore the influence of the GO morphology on photocatalytic efficiency as it was found previously that the addition of GO to these components increases the efficiency of the hydrogen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

In addition our previous mechanistic studies have shown the existence of a stable charge-separation state after the addition of GO to the system of EY and triethanolamine what explains the role of graphene in the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency in the Eosin Y-based systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In the absence of GO, the H<sub>2</sub> production from EY and CoSO<sub>4</sub> system was 0.84 μmol after 1 h of irradiation. No significant amounts of hydrogen were detected in the absence of either irradiation or the photosensitizer EY suggesting that the visible light activity comes from the EY sensitization. Also no measurable amount of hydrogen was detected for the GO alone. Initially “stock” dispersion of GO-s8 (GO powder after 20 min of bath sonication) was used in order to establish the optimum GO concentration for the H<sub>2</sub> production. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. With the addition of GO, even at low concentrations, the amount of hydrogen evolution showed an increase and reached a maximum of 4.88 µmol at GO concentration as low as 1.06 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>, which is 5.8 times larger than that of the system without GO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

In all photocatalytic tests that were performed to establish the effect of GO flakes size and number of layers on hydrogen production concentration of all components were kept constant, including GO what ensured identical conditions in all experiments. GO samples treated for various sonication times were firstly prepared and characterized (by UV–vis spectroscopy and AFM) and subsequently tested in photocatalytic hydrogen production systems. As it was shown by AFM the number of layers in GO flakes of the GO sample is correlated with the absorbance at 230 nm. The increase of absorption coefficient at 230 nm (ε<sub>230nm</sub>) is related to the increase of the content of monolayered flakes. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation was explored for eight samples of GO suspensions (GO-s1–GO-s8) with gradually increase of ε<sub>230nm</sub> (from 700 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> to 4830 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>) and additionally for five samples of GO (G-s9–GO-s13) with extended sonication process (total sonication time from 30–80 min) of GO suspension with ε<sub>230nm</sub> = 4830 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition, photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production was evaluated for GO sample referred as the sonication-free GO solution which was prepared through simple dilution of the GO powder using magnetic stirrer. Interestingly for this GO sample no increase in the hydrogen production was detected in comparison to the analogue system without GO. As presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the increase of the hydrogen production with the increase of the ε<sub>230nm</sub> of the GO sample added to the system is obvious. The hydrogen production efficiency reached the maximum for the GO-s8 sample with ε<sub>230nm</sub> = 4830 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>. According to the AFM measurements, this sample GO exists mainly as the monolayers. Based on the obtained results it is clear that efficient exfoliation of the GO dispersion is crucial for obtaining significant enhancement of the hydrogen production in the presence of GO. The H<sub>2</sub> production efficiency varies by a factor of 3.7 between GO-s1 (ε<sub>230nm</sub> = 700 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>) and GO-s8 (ε<sub>230nm</sub> = 4830 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>) samples. However, more interestingly, the hydrogen production for systems with the addition GO samples that underwent prolong ultrasound treatment decreased. The efficiency of photocatalytic reaction decreased by 18% for the GO-s9 suspension sonicated additional 10 min and by almost 40% for GO-s13 that were sonicated for 60 min longer than time sufficient to achieve maximum absorption coefficient ε<sub>230nm</sub> = 4830 L g<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). An important observation is that too long ultrasound treatment have negative impact on the GO enhancement of hydrogen production. It is known that the use of sonication treatment exfoliates the multilayer GO flakes into individual GO sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, long-time sonication causes also extensive GO sheets fragmentation and defects (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, GO-s13)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The amorphization can take place, however, we do not identify the nanometric scale carbon remnants, as well as the holes in GO structure. Thus, if they are present, they are supposed to have lateral sizes range of single nanometer or lower and thus below the microscopy (SEM and AFM) resolution. Therefore, we conclude that the decrease of the hydrogen production efficiency for the GO samples that underwent long sonication treatment is related to the decrease of the GO flakes size. To avoid negative impact of such fragmentation of GO flakes on the photocatalytic activity it is important to optimize the sonication treatment. Due to various bath sonicators used in the laboratories with different frequency, power or volume there is no unique sonication time that would ensure optimum GO properties for the photocatalytic activity. Thus, the correlation between the UV–Vis absorbance at 230 nm and the amount of H<sub>2</sub> is the key, not the specific sonication parameters. Our work has shown that simple measurement of the optical spectra of the GO dispersion is reliable method for the optimization of the monolayer content. In short, the most important practical outcome of our results is that the optimum sonication time of the GO suspension used in photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production systems should match exactly the time (but no longer) required to achieve the highest absorbance of the GO dispersion at 230 nm.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Amount of H<sub>2</sub> evolved under visible light irradiation on EY–GO–Co<sup>2+</sup> system with various GO suspensions with increased time of sonication.

The small decrease of hydrogen production for GO-4 krpm might be attributed to the presence of graphene oxide aggregates as observed in AFM measurements. For the residual GO the decrease of the hydrogen production by 30% was observed in comparison to GO-8 krpm sample. The residual GO consists mostly of monolayers but with significantly smaller flakes size than fraction GO-8krpm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The EY–GO–Co<sup>2+</sup> system produces the highest amount of H<sub>2</sub> when graphene oxide occurs as monolayers and efficiency becomes lower with decrease of GO sheets size. It is important to choose appropriate conditions of sonication process to obtain GO in optimal form as monolayered flakes with the biggest, possible area. The influence of the GO number layers on the hydrogen production can be related to the change of surface area which subsequently may affect the interaction with precatalyst Co<sup>2+</sup>. The interaction of GO and EY was found previously to be weak and therefore we do not expect to be dependent on GO morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, presumably, the change in the size and dispersion of Co nanoparticles on the GO surface is responsible for the observed changes of hydrogen production upon variation of GO morphology.
