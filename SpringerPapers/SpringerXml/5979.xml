Biofuel production from renewable sources is widely considered one of the most sustainable alternatives for environmental and economic sustainability. Microalgae are currently being promoted as one of the most promising liquid biofuel feedstocks due to their rapid growth, high lipid production capacity, and carbon–neutral cycle. In this study, whole microalgae cells were utilized as raw material to produce solid biofuel, i.e., Bio-Coke, and this study aimed to investigate the possibility of microalgae Bio-Coke as an alternative to coal coke. The results show that Bio-Coke can be produced from microalgae in the temperature range of 80–100 °C. The apparent density is between 1.253 and 1.261 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, comparable to the apparent density of lignocellulosic Bio-Coke. Additionally, the calorific value is higher than the calorific value of lignocellulosic Bio-Coke and within the range of the calorific value of subbituminous coal. Therefore, microalgae Bio-Coke can be utilized to replace coal coke usage in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group

need for energy without neglecting future generations, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) program. However, despite the urge to search for more sustainable energy sources, fossil fuel remains the largest share of the energy mix, with oil contributing up to 31.2%, while coal is the second largest fuel, accounting for 27.2% of total primary energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Meanwhile, the share of renewable energy rose to record highs but only accounted for 5.7% of total consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The dirtiest of fossil fuels, coal, is responsible for 30% of global emissions and a major contributor to the air pollution that has taken a devastating toll on the health of local populations. The Glasgow climate summit (COP26) produced a new global pact committing governments to take increasingly ambitious steps to address the climate crisis. It was announced that 190 countries and organizations committed to phasing out coal power in the 2030s for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and in the 2040s (for non-OECD). Therefore, the development of new technologies that can deliver fuel from renewable resources is indispensable. Among the renewable energy resources available, microalgae represent a potential source. Microalgae, which are third-generation feedstocks, show a promising future as biofuel stocks due to their features.</p><p id="Par3">High lipid content in microalgae makes them suitable for energy use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With their significant potential, microalgae are expected to surpass first- and second-generation feedstocks. The conversion of microalgae into liquid biofuel has received much attention. Several mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic techniques have been developed for lipid extraction. However, the cell disruption process, including lipid extraction followed by trans-esterification, is costly, produces a high volume of waste, and is considered a major bottleneck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the oil part of algae biomass is approximately 30%, and the remaining 70% is an algae byproduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, the conversion of microalgae into solid biofuel or Bio-Coke is an alternative conversion of microalgae into biofuel in a less expensive way without residue. Solid biofuel can be a good alternative to conventional solid fossil fuels dominated by coal.</p><p id="Par4">Lignocellulosic biomass has already been recognized as an alternative to solid fossil fuels, especially coal. Pelletizing and briquetting are well-known densification treatments to produce solid biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass. However, there is a need to improve their ability to burn at high temperatures for longer combustion times. Bio-Coke is a new densification method that aims to overcome these problems. Bio-Coke exhibits moderate calorific value and good mechanical strength. This method shows almost 100 percent yield on a weight basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A comprehensive study showed that Bio-Coke is superior to pellets and briquettes due to its increased density and compressive strength at both room temperature (25 °C) and high temperatures (700 °C); furthermore, Bio-Coke demonstrates an ability to burn at high temperatures for a longer combustion time compared to pellets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Bio-Coke produced from various lignocellulosic biomass wastes in Malaysia had apparent densities ranging from 1.255 to 1.438 g/cm<sup>3</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], while apparent densities of biomass pellets ranged between 0.8 and 1.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another superior characteristic of the Bio-Coke is that its combustion duration was 1300–2081 s. Nevertheless, since the calorific value depends on the raw material, the calorific value of lignocellulosic Bio-Cokes is similar to that of the pellets and briquettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A study shows that the calorific values from various lignocellulosic Bio-Cokes from abundant waste in Malaysia were 16.48–19.15 MJ/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In Japan, where Bio-Coke densification technologies were developed, Bio-Cokes have been manufactured from a wide variety of biomass wastes for various project purposes. They have been applied as fuel in boilers or waste incinerators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Bio-Coke is also comparable to coal coke. Bio-Coke can be mixed with coal coke in metal casting as a heat source as well as a carburizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, this Bio-Coke can be further carbonized to produce carbonized Bio-Coke in a short time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This carbonized Bio-Coke is comparable to biochar, which can substitute pulverized coal applied in pulverized coal power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">However, it is widely known that the grinding process of lignocellulosic biomass prior to solid fuel production is expensive due to high energy consumption, accounting for approximately 33% of the entire electricity requirement of the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Energy consumption is typically dependent on the type of lignocellulosic biomass used. A study reported that softwoods like corn stover and switchgrass require 11.0 and 27.6 kWh/metric ton for size reduction, whereas hardwoods like pine and poplar chips require 85.4 and 118.5 kWh/metric ton, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Several experiments have been performed to utilize microalgae as a binding agent in solid biofuel production from lignocellulosic material. The results indicate a better strength of the pellet with the addition of up to 30% weight microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An experiment to utilize 100% microalgae as raw material to produce fuel pellets was also conducted. The results show that algal pellets verified all standards used as fuel in biomass boilers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, there has not been any study to apply microalgae as the raw material for Bio-Coke production.</p><p id="Par9">In this study, <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, a species of microalgae, was utilized as a raw material for Bio-Coke production. <italic>E. gracilis</italic>, a photosynthetic protist, produces protein, unsaturated fatty acids, wax esters, a unique β-1,3-glucan called paramylon, and other valuable compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Under anaerobic conditions, wax esters become the main storage compounds in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>gracilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]<italic>.</italic> These esters are composed of medium-chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols, which can be converted into biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>E. gracilis</italic> used in this study was in the form of dry powder as received from the producer company. Microalgae biomass is generally harvested at cell sizes between 3 and 30 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This fine powder form is advantageous because it provides a greater number of contact points, a larger exposed surface area, and a higher surface energy per unit weight regardless of the physical and chemical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This powder form was one of the advantages of microalgae as the raw material over lignocellulosic material. It is widely known that the grinding process required to produce raw uniform material is the most expensive, time-consuming, and energy-intensive process involved in the preparation of lignocellulosic solid biofuel. All the Bio-Coke production was conducted at a loading pressure of 21.7 MPa. A high loading pressure generally resulted in the formation of a solid bridge via the diffusion of molecules between particles, increasing the density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The moisture contents of the raw materials were 7% ± 0.25%. Initial moisture content is a significant factor in Bio-Coke production because it influences the solid fuel’s calorific value, combustion efficiency, and mechanical durability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A study of solid biofuel production from major lignocellulosic biomass suggested that a low moisture content of approximately 5% to 10% resulted in denser and more durable solid biofuel than a high moisture content (15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Previous studies of Bio-Coke production from lignocellulosic biomass suggested formation temperatures between 120 and 180 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, for microalgae biomass, several attempts at formation temperatures above 100 °C resulted in high backpressure in the equipment and produced cracked Bio-Coke. Hence, the formation temperatures were set between 40 and 100 °C. After the target temperature was achieved, samples were held for 6 min and 15 s. The retention times between 5 and 10 min produced Bio-Coke with better compressive strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A small 20 mm diameter molding was chosen for this study.

Since 2005, Euglena Co. has successfully developed large-scale outdoor cultivation for <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. The estimated theoretical maximum production of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> was approximately 48 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day or 17 kg/m<sup>2</sup>/year, although actual outdoor cultivation resulted in a maximum proliferation rate of only 25 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day or 8.85 kg/m<sup>2</sup>/year.

Therefore, successful microalgal cultivation generally requires light, carbon, various macronutrients, and several micronutrients. Microalgae use light to conduct the photosynthesis process. Light, one of the essential elements in microalgae growth, may be supplied naturally or artificially. Nevertheless, a study suggested that the application of artificial light would increase the cost of production by US$ 25.3 per kilogram of dry-weight biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Current commercial large-scale cultivation of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> is located at Ishigaki Island in Okinawa prefecture, Japan. The reference solar radiation intensity is approximately 18 MJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day. It is required to discover other sites for larger-scale production of <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. The requirement of such land candidates includes the availability of operational land area (at least 3000 ha), climate (at least 3 h of average daily sunlight, 500 mm of average annual rainfall), and country risk (low level of crime and terrorism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Countries in tropical regions, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, offer benefits for microalgae cultivation.

Furthermore, tropical microalgae can grow throughout the year compared to microalgae in temperate and subtropical environments. Temperatures below 15 °C generally impede microalgae growth, while temperatures above 35 °C are lethal for some species.

Tropical regions bring beneficial features for microalgae as they provide uninterrupted and well-distributed light to support the continuity of the photosynthesis process. Although microalgae do not contain lignin, which usually acts as a binder in Bio-Coke production, proteins in microalgae can replace this function, implying that Bio-Coke can be produced from all types of biomasses. The apparent density of this microalgae Bio-Coke is comparable to the apparent density of the lignocellulosic Bio-Coke. Apparent density is beneficial for storage and transportation as well as its physical performance in the combustion process. The combustion of the produced Bio-Coke could reach a temperature of more than 1000 °C, and the calorific value is comparable to that of subbituminous coal.</p><p id="Par46">Moreover, the possibility of the formation of Bio-Coke by microalgae may imply that one of the origins of coal coke might be due to the accumulation of photosynthetic microorganisms underground for a long time because the pressure and temperature underground at 1000–2000 m could be similar to the conditions of the formation of Bio-Coke by microalgae in this study.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>VCK, TI, and HH designed the research; VCK, SN, and NSK performed the experiments; WJY, KS, KI, and NAO prepared and provided materials, equipment, and analysis result, VCK, KS and HH wrote the manuscript; MAMY, FNMA, and NAO helped in the preparation of manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by The University of Tokyo.
