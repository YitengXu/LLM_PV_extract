Because this topic is widely neglected by academics and activists alike, the chapter first describes how the abstract nature that we now call energy was organized during the nineteenth century in conjunction with new waves of capitalist mechanization centred on labour control and productivity. It then goes on to set out some of the ways in which the social or ecological contradictions of thermodynamic energy are intensified in the twentieth-century bioeconomy. Finally, the chapter draws out some of the implications for how social movements might place themselves more strategically in struggles over today’s bioeconomy.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en" specific-use="web-only"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bioeconomy</kwd><kwd>Energy</kwd><kwd>Thermodynamics</kwd><kwd>Labour</kwd><kwd>Mechanization</kwd><kwd>Inequality</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-68944-5_Chapter_5.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">This chapter takes a step back from the empirically detailed studies of the bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm1"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> boom in Latin America, Asia and Europe that comprise the bulk of this book in order to focus on some of the underlying historical dynamics of bioenergy. It does so out of the conviction that only an activism that takes account of the exploitation<index-term id="ITerm2"><term>Exploitation</term></index-term> and appropriation common to specific instances of bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm3"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> development is likely to be effective in the long term against the degradations<index-term id="ITerm4"><term>Degradation</term></index-term> and threats to survival that it entails.</p><p id="Par3">The chapter concentrates mainly on the contradictions of the thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> developed in the nineteenth century as a background for sketching how bioenergy perpetuates and accentuates these contradictions, and what the consequences are for biofuel developers, energy<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Energy</term></index-term>transition<index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Transition</term></index-term> enthusiasts and bioenergy critics. Interleaved with this exposition are reflections on how social movements<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>Social movements</term></index-term> might place themselves more strategically in bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> struggles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Thermodynamic Energy as Politics</title><sec><p id="Par4">There is little point in studying bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> without some idea of what it is. Clearing away some common confusions, anachronisms and teleologies is crucial at the start.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par5">The biggest confusions are around energy itself, not just bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term>. These confusions can be found in the writings of many respected contemporary historians such as E. A. Wrigley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>), Rolf Sieferle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>), J. R. McNeill (Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>), Kenneth Pomeranz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2000</xref>) and Vaclav Smil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>). Such writers tend to assume lazily that every society in history has possessed fundamentally the same hunger for greater and greater supplies of an item they call “energy<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Energy</term></index-term>”. They seldom define this item or inquire into its history. For example, Wrigley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>, pp. 42, 44, 191, 205), Sieferle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>, p. 137) and McNeill (in Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>, p. 848) each write that an energy “bottleneck” in pre-industrial societies frustrated an intrinsic, pan-human desire for growth—a bottleneck that was only broken with the advent of the fossil fuel era in nineteenth-century Europe.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par6">But there was no such bottleneck (Malm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). There was no such energy. The practice and theory of energy<index-term id="ITerm13"><term>Energy</term></index-term>, energy stocks and energy sources that we take for granted today did not exist before 1800. At that time, no extensive industrial conversion and transfer infrastructure existed that was capable of uniting and commensurating various thermal, dynamical, electrical and other phenomena into the unitary, indestructible, abstract force that only later came to be called “energy<index-term id="ITerm14"><term>Energy</term></index-term>”. It was not yet possible even to think about disentangling muscular exertion, wood<index-term id="ITerm15"><term>Wood</term></index-term> burning and falls<index-term id="ITerm16"><term>“Falls”</term></index-term> of water (say) from the diverse social or natural contexts in which they were embedded, re-entangle them into systems of exchangeable “equivalents”, and accumulate the transformed result into a single pile. Before then, as historian Joel Mokyr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>, pp. 20–21) observes, “the notion that a horse pulling a treadmill and a coal fire heating a lime kiln were in some sense doing the same thing would have appeared absurd”. None of these things were “energy consumption”. Energy<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Energy</term></index-term> had neither use-values nor exchange value<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Value</term></index-term> because there was nothing identifiable as such to be valued. There were no “energy companies”. There was no “energy sector”, no “energy outlook”, no “energy planning”, no “energy transition”, nor any “energy alternatives<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Alternative</term></index-term>”. It would have been hard to explain units of measurement like joules, BTUs, kilogramme-metres, ergs, dynes, calories, therms, newtons or barrels of oil-equivalent. Concepts such as “energy return on investment<index-term id="ITerm20"><term>Investment</term></index-term>” (EROI) would have been incomprehensible. Although steam engines were already being used early in the eighteenth century for specialized purposes (indeed there had been toy steam engines in ancient Greece), they had not yet begun converting the latent heat of coal stocks into mechanical energy on a scale<index-term id="ITerm21"><term>Scale</term></index-term> sufficient to restructure whole industrial, transport and shipping systems. The electric batteries first described in 1800, which transform chemical energy into electrical energy and back, were as yet only a curiosity. Dynamos for converting mechanical energy<index-term id="ITerm22"><term>Energy</term></index-term> into electricity did not exist until 1830 or become industrially significant until the 1870s. Electric motors for converting electricity back into mechanical energy appeared only in the 1830s and were embedded into industry only in the 1890s. It was only in the mid-nineteenth century, similarly, that the telegraph began to entrench the mutual convertibility of electricity and magnetism into everyday experience worldwide. Solar<index-term id="ITerm23"><term>Solar</term></index-term> cells that could convert sunlight to electricity were not built until 1839. Internal combustion engines for converting chemical to thermal to mechanical energy<index-term id="ITerm24"><term>Energy</term></index-term>, although conceived before 1800, began to be marketed only in the 1860s and 1870s.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par7">Correspondingly, it was only between around 1820 and 1850 that today’s <italic>concept</italic> of energy<index-term id="ITerm25"><term>Energy</term></index-term> (if anything that remains so incoherent can be called a concept) began to take shape via thermodynamics (see Thermodynamics: The First and Second Laws). Thermodynamics developed principally out of the project of a certain privileged group of male Northern Europeans to theorize industrial heat engines (Daggett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>, p. 37). It was impelled largely by the need to help machines provide business with labour productivity increases, labour discipline, labour<index-term id="ITerm26"><term>Labour</term></index-term> concentrations and relative independence from a multitude of ingrained human and more-than-human rhythms, as well as speedier realization of the value<index-term id="ITerm27"><term>Value</term></index-term> of commodities (Malm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>; Huber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). Its “regulative idea” of unified energy also influenced the mapping and organizing of new frontiers for extraction<index-term id="ITerm28"><term>Extraction</term></index-term> of fuels for capital’s conversion devices. To adapt the terminology of Naoki Sakai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1997</xref>, p. 41), the growth of energy<index-term id="ITerm29"><term>Energy</term></index-term> science, like that of so many other disciplines, was not “determined by the existence of its object”. Rather, the object that emerged was “made possible by the existence of the discipline”.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Thermodynamics<index-term id="ITerm30"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term>: The First and Second Laws</title><p id="Par8">In 1865, the great German physicist Rudolf Clausius summarized thermodynamics in two laws:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par9">The <italic>energy</italic> of the universe is constant.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">The amount of <italic>usable energy</italic> declines (i.e. <italic>entropy</italic><index-term id="ITerm31"><term><italic>Entropy</italic></term></index-term> tends to increase in a closed system).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">The First Law inspired capitalists to try to put the entire universe to work. It conceptualized a monolithic “energy<index-term id="ITerm32"><term>Energy</term></index-term>” that was both inexhaustible and interconvertible. Whatever capital needed to make machines run—mechanical force, heat, electricity, magnetism, light—could be conjured up from any other form of energy that was lying around, given enough ingenuity.</p><p id="Par12">The Second Law revealed the other side of the story. It showed that the more that capital instrumentalized waterfalls, fire, wind<index-term id="ITerm33"><term>Wind</term></index-term>, coal, magnetism and so forth as being mere aspects of this great pool of abstract energy<index-term id="ITerm34"><term>Energy</term></index-term>, the less of the new energy actually became available for capital’s own use. The more that energy was converted back and forth into different forms (Smil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>, p. 26), the more of it was “degraded”. Linear time assumed a new prominence in the shape of an arrow indicating a one-way trip towards universal “heat death”.</p><p id="Par13">The contradiction between the two laws reflects the contradictions of the capitalist society that gave rise to them. The First Law helped capital treat the world as a limitless, fungible resource<index-term id="ITerm35"><term>Resource</term></index-term>. The Second Law exposed the flip side: waste<index-term id="ITerm36"><term>Waste</term></index-term>, pollution and disorder that would ultimately cripple industrial capital itself.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par14">Yet even after the First Law began to be formulated, energy<index-term id="ITerm37"><term>Energy</term></index-term> was still not treated as a single abstract fluid that could be transferred in large quantities over long distances. The first articulations of the Law set up methodologies for calculating equivalences among previously separated domains like motion and heat, but did not mention conservation or transformation<index-term id="ITerm38"><term>Transformation</term></index-term> of a singular energy. For example, James Joule, the brewing capitalist who in the 1840s struggled to fix a mechanical “equivalent” for heat, “never said that all forces are essentially differing manifestations of the same ontological ‘thing’” (Mirowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1989</xref>, p. 42). That reification was introduced by Lord Kelvin in 1851. Even at the turn of the twentieth century, textbooks were still presenting the First Law more as a “principle of equivalence” than as the “principle of conservation of energy<index-term id="ITerm39"><term>Energy</term></index-term>” (Coelho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>, p. 2651). To be sure, the latter usage is now the popular one (Mirowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1989</xref>, p. 13). Yet the same energy science that has encouraged the public to fetishize energy as an object has also, paradoxically, continually undermined the fetish. By the 1880s, for instance, Hermann von Helmholtz found himself “in cautious retreat from the conception of energy as a mechanistic substance” (ibid., p. 47). In 1918, Noether’s Theorem, developed by the Göttingen mathematician Emmy Noether, “drove another nail into the coffin of energy as a substance”, cementing a sense that “energy was not really any one thing, but rather a flexible means of expressing symmetry principles” (ibid., p. 72). In 1943, the Harvard physicist P. W. Bridgman argued that energy<index-term id="ITerm40"><term>Energy</term></index-term> was just too “hybrid” for it to be possible to set up a “parallelism” between it and “ordinary material things” (Bridgman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1943</xref>, p. 115). In the 1960s, the Nobel physicist Richard Feynman famously reminded his audience that the First Law had never actually described “anything concrete”: “we have no knowledge<index-term id="ITerm41"><term>Knowledge</term></index-term> of what energy <italic>is</italic>” (Feynman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>, volume 4, chapter 1). By 2011, it was possible for one prominent thinker to define energy<index-term id="ITerm42"><term>Energy</term></index-term> simply as a “relationship of difference that tends to eliminate itself”, a “gradient across which there is a tendency to even out and dissipate”—that is, as a <italic>form</italic> rather than a <italic>substance</italic> (Deacon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>, pp. 218–219). Nothing could be further from the technocratic picture of energy as a universal fuel with sources dotted around the landscape. Yet in a sense, the conception of energy as form rather than substance has been present from the very beginning of thermodynamics<index-term id="ITerm43"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term>. It derives ultimately from the inspired analogy explored by the early nineteenth-century French thermodynamicist Sadi Carnot between the “falls<index-term id="ITerm44"><term>“Falls”</term></index-term>” (<italic>chutes</italic>) of water that riverside mills captured and the “falls” from hot to cold that made heat engines work (Carnot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1988</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1824</xref>]). Although Carnot himself thought of heat as a substance, his metaphor paved the way for a conception of energy<index-term id="ITerm45"><term>Energy</term></index-term> that emphasized relations and terrains rather than magical stuff.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par15">Throughout its early development, energy science was created largely by engineers who shared the interests of business. “An <italic>economic</italic> point of view formed the root of thermodynamics”, historian Theodore Porter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1994</xref>, p. 141) emphasizes. “Economic and physical ideas grew up together, sharing a common context”. As historians of science Crosbie Smith and M. Norton Wise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1989</xref>, pp. xx–xxi) note, the mathematical physics of Lord Kelvin was “thoroughly permeated” by an industrial capitalist cosmovision. Nor would energy<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Energy</term></index-term> as we know it have come into being without empire, for which thermodynamics was a welcome way of reorganizing activities belonging to diverse networks of life into a monolithic, unitary “energy<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Energy</term></index-term>”-supporting worldwide deployment of steam engines, vortex turbines and transoceanic cables. Indeed, the emergence of coal as an imperial “fossil fuel” itself played a part in cementing thermodynamic energy into political thinking worldwide. Simply because it was by nature abundant, concentrated, easily transportable and accumulable, usable in a wide variety of contexts, and completely independent of annual plant growth cycles, coal (and later, oil<index-term id="ITerm48"><term>Oil</term></index-term> and gas) was an avatar for the kind of “universal energy equivalent” that thermodynamics was already advocating. It was not that there had always existed a primordial pan-human need for more and more abstract “energy<index-term id="ITerm49"><term>Energy</term></index-term>” that fortunately just happened to be relieved one day by fossil fuels. Rather, fossil fuels themselves helped shape the idea of such an energy. Of course, for millions of years, long before <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> came along, processes had been going on that were later described as the transformation<index-term id="ITerm50"><term>Transformation</term></index-term> of sunlight into thermal energy, thermal and chemical into mechanical energy, mechanical energy into electricity and so forth. None of that began in the nineteenth century. But without post-1800 imperial reorganizations of relations among humans and nonhumans, energy<index-term id="ITerm51"><term>Energy</term></index-term> and its ideology could never have become so hegemonic.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par16">If capital and empire made thermodynamics<index-term id="ITerm52"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> what it is, thermodynamics fully returned the favour (Daggett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). Thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> was there to carry out an unlimited amount of what early nineteenth-century Cornwall engineers measured as the “duty” done by given quantities of coal (Cardwell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1993</xref>, p. 117). It was pictured as being available to business anywhere on earth or off it. “Energy sources” became geographic features, whether they were rivers with steep drops, coal seams, oil<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>Oil</term></index-term> fields, peninsulas with steady high winds<index-term id="ITerm55"><term>Wind</term></index-term>, uranium deposits, deserts with high rates of insolation, forests<index-term id="ITerm56"><term>Forest</term></index-term> with chippable trees or stretches of soil<index-term id="ITerm57"><term>Soil</term></index-term> suitable for oil<index-term id="ITerm58"><term>Oil</term></index-term> palm, jatropha or sugar cane. Mapped in this way, energy<index-term id="ITerm59"><term>Energy</term></index-term> sources could be made to overlie, overlap or even obliterate other geographical features such as cultivated land, indigenous territories, water sources, grazing grounds or customary property or political boundaries. The abstract energy symbolized in the First Law of Thermodynamics became a real part of the world, entangling itself into the emergent “abstractified” forms of work, society, space, water and nature that to some extent had preceded it on the early modern landscape. Thermodynamics was thus a crucial technique of enclosure of commons across Europe, India, Africa and the Americas. It was also indispensable to the mobilization of millions of newly landless labourers and slaves in centres of mechanization, as well as to the growth of the role of commodity exchange in providing the necessities of life.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par17">Today’s thermodynamically rationalized “biofuel complex”, for instance, has engendered a new concept of “marginal land” in the tradition of older colonial<index-term id="ITerm60"><term>Colonial(ism)</term></index-term> notions of “waste<index-term id="ITerm61"><term>Waste</term></index-term>” and <italic>terra nullius</italic>.

Like the twentieth-century notion of “sacrifice zones” (National Academy of Sciences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1974</xref>), this geographic/thermodynamic methodology tends to obscure many other features of the land in question (Nalepa and Bauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). These include not only the capacity to supply<index-term id="ITerm64"><term>Supply</term></index-term> medicine, provide building materials and sustain hunting, gathering, grazing and subsistence farming.

Until firewood from a common woodland becomes “energy<index-term id="ITerm71"><term>Energy</term></index-term>”, it is not necessarily scarce in an economic sense (Lohmann and Hildyard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>, pp. 63–64). Correspondingly, it is only with thermodynamic energy that modern waste<index-term id="ITerm72"><term>Waste</term></index-term> really comes into its own, as well as the types of human labour<index-term id="ITerm73"><term>Labour</term></index-term> that are needed to help clean up, stow, reuse, manage, absorb or hide it. Thermodynamic energy is all about putting together diverse Carnotian “falls<index-term id="ITerm74"><term>“Falls”</term></index-term>” or irreversible erosions of difference across broad geographies. As such, it unavoidably generates forms and volumes of “waste<index-term id="ITerm75"><term>Waste</term></index-term>” energy specific to the age of the Second as well as the First Laws of Thermodynamics. This is so whether the “falls” in question consist of water sluicing through dam penstocks, air impacting on the blades of windmills, “falls” of electrons through the electrolyte of batteries connected to closed circuits, “falls” from hot to cold within aircraft engines, or “falls<index-term id="ITerm76"><term>“Falls”</term></index-term>” of soil<index-term id="ITerm77"><term>Soil</term></index-term> fertility into sterility on industrial biomass<index-term id="ITerm78"><term>Biomass</term></index-term> plantations. Water can’t be returned to the height from which it falls using only its own energy<index-term id="ITerm79"><term>Energy</term></index-term>, nor ash, heat and CO<sub>2</sub> reassembled into coal. That makes it all the more imperative to find cheap ways of clearing detritus out of the way so that costs can be saved. Any locomotive that is to go on pulling railway coaches has to be provided with a place to vent its smoke, and workers to scrub it free of soot. Every Google translation machine needs dedicated, cheap living human or non-human activity to clear away the debris it generates, whether it be carbon dioxide or inappropriate word sequences.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par19">But usable energy<index-term id="ITerm80"><term>Energy</term></index-term> can become “waste<index-term id="ITerm81"><term>Waste</term></index-term>” also just by being allowed to lie around unused. For example, the “falls<index-term id="ITerm82"><term>“Falls”</term></index-term>” of river systems that are not exploited with hydroelectric dams that “break” the falls become viewed by technocratic organizations such as the Mekong River Commission as “wasted resources”, much to the bemusement of communities that have depended on them for generations. Other wastes emerge after the dams are built and the reservoirs behind them silt up, removing the “fall” and necessitating dredging that must be powered via the exploitation<index-term id="ITerm83"><term>Exploitation</term></index-term> of further “falls” elsewhere.

For example, as the literary historian and physicist Barri Gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>, p. 9) observes, the Second Law idea that the amount of energy “beyond our use” tends to increase in a closed system can’t escape questions such as: “What use? And who’s <italic>we</italic>?” That generically anthropomorphic “we” (Georgescu-Roegen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1975</xref>, p. 351) would be unlikely to include indigenous peoples<index-term id="ITerm91"><term>Indigenous people</term></index-term> for whom what physicists would call the “unavailable” or “disordered” energy in a calm lake is far from useless, or peasants<index-term id="ITerm92"><term>Peasants</term></index-term> who deny that the energy<index-term id="ITerm93"><term>Energy</term></index-term> in a fast-flowing river is “wasted” unless converted into hydroelectricity<index-term id="ITerm94"><term>Hydroelectricity</term></index-term>. The reality, indeed, is that thermodynamics tends to hide a vast, churning, enduring “underground” of anti-thermodynamic energies. These energies are around us always and everywhere, in cities as well as rural areas, in hospitals and factories as well as irrigation systems. Examples include the growth of vegetables in contemporary urban gardens in Milwaukee; the burning of commons firewood in Chiang Rai; or the bubbling of springs in the water-hill-village systems of Totonac communities in the Sierra Norte de Puebla (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>). The logic of such energies militates against aggregating them with one another and disentangling them from the limited goods of subsistence in the manner of the First Law of Thermodynamics. It also militates against becoming overly preoccupied with the Second Law, whose barrier to a notional “ideal efficiency” is more of an object of dread to capitalist technocrats and ecological modernizers than to ordinary people.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par21">For millions of individuals virtually all of the time, and for everybody at least some of the time, periodically refusing thermodynamic energy’s claim to be able to subsume anti-thermodynamic energies into itself is just a matter of common sense and survival. So, too, is keeping at arm’s length thermodynamic projects featuring relentlessly mounting levels of disorder and waste<index-term id="ITerm95"><term>Waste</term></index-term> that require professional management and concealment. Many rural areas worldwide reveal living retorts to such projects in the form of homely ways of working the vernacular wastes of commons—as when food waste is integrated into animal-raising, animal waste into field care and plant waste, cleaned up and recycled through fire, into the care of grain, forests<index-term id="ITerm96"><term>Forest</term></index-term>, water and humans alike. From a subsistence perspective<index-term id="ITerm97"><term>Subsistence perspective</term></index-term>, such practices are not “renewable energy”. They are not energy at all.

An ordinary rural community striving to take care of a local stream that never runs dry is typically not preoccupied with Wilhelm Ostwald’s thermodynamically inspired “energetic imperative”—“do not waste any energy, make it useful” (Ostwald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1912</xref>, p. 85)—nor Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1971</xref>) similarly motivated Malthusian cautions. For such a community, the Second Law is not necessarily a problem, any more than a perpetual motion machine that overcomes the Second Law is a shimmering “sublime object of ideology” (Žižek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1989</xref>). Nor would there be any point in praising such a community for “efficiency<index-term id="ITerm101"><term>Efficiency</term></index-term>”. Efficiency as understood today, riven by some of the same deep contradictions that afflict capital and thermodynamics (Polimeni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>), derives from a different context, that of industrial machines and their interpolation into societies organized around limitless accumulation.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par23">The irony is—and this is an insight that is unfortunately missing from nearly all current global energy and climate debates, including debates over bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm102"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> and the so-called energy transition—that anti-thermodynamic energies<index-term id="ITerm103"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> are not only ubiquitous, but also, paradoxically, essential to maintaining the precarious status of thermodynamic energy itself. Together, the two form a “contradictory unity” (Harvey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>) analogous to those that uneasily link living with dead labour<index-term id="ITerm104"><term>Labour</term></index-term>, use value<index-term id="ITerm105"><term>Value</term></index-term> with exchange value<index-term id="ITerm106"><term>Value</term></index-term>, unpaid reproductive work with wage labour<index-term id="ITerm107"><term>Wage labor</term></index-term>, and commons with capitalist forms of socio-natural organization. Unavoidably, “inside” the monolith of official energy<index-term id="ITerm108"><term>Energy</term></index-term> can always be found a “hidden abode” (Fraser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>) inhabited by a plurality of vernacular energies that it converts, commensurates, parasitizes, degrades and exhausts, yet which through their very opposition make it possible to accumulate surplus value<index-term id="ITerm109"><term>Value</term></index-term> (Toscano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>). To capitalist planners, for example, a common woodland may at first sight look like either raw material for thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm110"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> or an obstacle to be eliminated to make way for a hydroelectric dam, oil<index-term id="ITerm111"><term>Oil</term></index-term> refinery or wind<index-term id="ITerm112"><term>Wind</term></index-term> farm that produces more of it. Yet when economic crises hit and the planners themselves face redundancy, they may suddenly find themselves “recognizing” the woodland’s non-thermodynamic energies as a useful zero-cost subsidy that helps maintain local workers pending their re-employment in the service of machines powered by thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm113"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term>. Or the planners may find themselves paradoxically dependent on the creative subversion that commoners exercise by thieving grid electricity to sustain subsistence systems dedicated to thwarting the commensuration of “little-e” energies<index-term id="ITerm114"><term>Little-e/little energies</term></index-term> into thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm115"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term>. In practice, it is only in conjunction with non-energetic, non-entropic or “negentropic” (Schrodinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1944</xref>) enclaves in commons and elsewhere that the massively energetic, massively entropic machines reliant on thermodynamic energy become capable of working for capital for any significant length of time.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par24">To put it another way, thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm116"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> did not emerge once and for all in the nineteenth century.

The experience of—for example—the Indonesian oil<index-term id="ITerm154"><term>Oil</term></index-term> palm plantation worker in Malaysia<index-term id="ITerm155"><term>Malaysia</term></index-term> or Indonesia<index-term id="ITerm156"><term>Indonesia</term></index-term> (see Janina Puder and Hariati Sinaga in this volume) lies at the intersection (Crenshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1989</xref>) of multiple oppressions: landlessness, subjection to machine discipline, precaritization, externalization of reproduction<index-term id="ITerm157"><term>Reproduction</term></index-term> costs, nation, patriarchy, race, class<index-term id="ITerm158"><term>Class</term></index-term>—but now also the expanded hegemony of nineteenth-century thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm159"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term>, as increasing amounts of biomass<index-term id="ITerm160"><term>Biomass</term></index-term> are pressed into service as substitutes for energy-dense hydrocarbons. The Indonesian woman migrant in Malaysia<index-term id="ITerm161"><term>Malaysia</term></index-term> cannot be spoken for by the male plantation worker, nor by the Indonesian peasant<index-term id="ITerm162"><term>Peasants</term></index-term> woman, nor by the formally educated Northern critic of thermodynamics, nor by a committee of the three. Yet while only she can say “when and where she enters” onto a path of liberation (ibid., p. 160), it is also true that only with her entry along that path that <italic>others</italic> struggling with thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm163"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> can also enter.</p><p id="Par30">In their analysis of the “biofuel delusion”, Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2009</xref>) conclude that<disp-quote><p id="Par31">we do not need alternative energy sources to keep alive an obsolete pattern of economic growth.

A strategically effective critique of bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm166"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> developments has to go all the way down into energy<index-term id="ITerm167"><term>Energy</term></index-term> itself.</p><p id="Par33">One last way of summarizing the lesson of this chapter is to note the sense in which all bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm168"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> developments <italic>inherently</italic> entail the intensification of what this book’s title refers to as “global inequalities<index-term id="ITerm169"><term>Global inequalities</term></index-term>”. At a time when debates about energy equality are still overwhelmingly concerned only about the <italic>distribution</italic> of energy and of the costs of its production and circulation, it is more important than ever to stress that the prior issue is actually the <italic>constitution</italic> of energy. In a sense, inequalities are what thermodynamic energy<index-term id="ITerm170"><term>Thermodynamic energy/laws</term></index-term> is <italic>for</italic>. It should surprise no one that access to electricity, heat and motive power remains so skewed throughout the world, nor that so many have to suffer to make energy<index-term id="ITerm171"><term>Energy</term></index-term> available to so few. From its beginning, thermodynamics has been a mode of denying practices that hundreds of millions of people depend upon to flourish and subsist. It is an integral part of a political settlement achieved and precariously maintained since the nineteenth century under which frontiers of appropriation are organized to make it possible for fossil<index-term id="ITerm172"><term>Fossil</term></index-term> capital to go on getting something for nothing from a commons both human and extra-human (Moore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). Global inequalities<index-term id="ITerm173"><term>Global inequalities</term></index-term> connected with bioenergy<index-term id="ITerm174"><term>Bioenergy</term></index-term> development and energy transitions<index-term id="ITerm175"><term>Transition</term></index-term> can’t begin to be seriously addressed without addressing energy<index-term id="ITerm176"><term>Energy</term></index-term> itself.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks for help to Simon Pirani, Nick Hildyard, Ivonne Yanez, Maria Backhouse, Fabricio Rodríguez and the Junior Research Group on Bioeconomy and Inequalities at Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, where another version of this paper was presented.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Alexander, J.K.
