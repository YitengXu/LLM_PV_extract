These factors have developed a wide gap between energy demand and supply due to insufficient local production, necessitating a clean energy supply for all. The photovoltaic device's economic and environmental merits have made it the most suitable clean energy alternative to help developing countries such as Nigeria achieve the SDG-7. However, apart from the device's low efficiency, which is undergoing intensive study globally, other factors affect the penetration of the technology in developing countries, particularly Nigeria. This report systematically reviews the literature on the country's energy crisis and renewable energy potential, leading to an overview of solar energy potential and penetration. The potential of the technology and its penetration in the country were provided. A list highlighting challenges hindering technology penetration was also provided, and a solution for each was recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The rapid increase of the world population and present-day industrial development and lifestyle have created a massive demand and energy supply gap. This gap demands a rapid increase of substantial clean, stable, and reliable energy supply. The over-dependency on depleting fossil fuel in generating energy for our daily demand increasingly affects our environment and deteriorates human health. Access to stable and reliable energy is still a dream for most developing countries, and its deficiency is ominous for development, as energy access is crucial to economic development, socio-economic activities, agricultural activities, and living standard. According to Akinyele et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>); Sanusi and Owoyele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2016</xref>); Baurzhan and Jenkins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>); and Monyei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>), about 1.2 billion individuals are still living without access to modern (stable) energy, with about 50% of them residing in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria, the country with the highest population in the region, has about 100 million citizens living without clean and stable energy (Akinyele et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>; Yakubu &amp; Ifeanyi-Nwaoha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2017</xref>). This signifies that the country is suffering from acute energy poverty.</p><p id="Par3">Nigeria is endowed with conventional energy resources (Non-Renewable) and renewable energy resources (Biomass, Hydro, Solar, and Wind) that are sufficient to satisfy the demand of its populace and export the excess to neighbouring countries as a tradable commodity to generate funds. Thus far, the in-house supply is still inadequate and unable to meet the country's demand, and this is continuously increasing due to a continuous increase in population, requiring an immediate response before it reaches an unrecoverable situation. This inadequacy of supply has several consequences. The Nigerian government has disbursed billions of dollars over the last two decades to improve and boost energy supply using conventional energy resources, yet the country is still plagued with severe energy shortages (Usman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>). The numerical value relating to some investments is provided in this report's subsequent section. This energy supply shortage poses challenges to both the rural and urban populations. However, the problem is most severe in the rural areas, where the majority of the population lives without access to the national grid, and besides, even the majority of urban dwellers suffer from an unstable and insufficient power supply. The frequent power outages have compelled many Nigerians to adopt self-energy generation using various fossil fuel-powered generators to generate electricity for domestic, commercial, and industrial consumption. The by-products of this have adverse effects on humans and the environment.</p><p id="Par4">Energy deficit leads to poverty, economic decline, low standard of living, citizen hardship, and many more negative impacts. Conversely, a constant and stable energy supply is fundamental to the development of a nation. According to Ikem et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>), energy supply is the pivot supporting the development wheel. Ayodele and Ogunjuyigbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>); Oseni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2012</xref>); Oyedepo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2012a</xref>); Rafindad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>), Anumaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>), and Akuru et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) established that stable and reliable energy (electricity) supply is exceptionally significant and it is an essential ingredient and a necessary tool that plays a vital role in the economic development, poverty reduction, industrial, agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, infrastructural development, employment, and security. It also plays a vital role in ensuring that basic needs and services (food and water, housing, health services, and education) are adequately provided. Anumaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>) stated that the contemporary world depends on abundant energy for developmental growth.</p><p id="Par5">Moreover, Nigeria's energy poverty is very alarming (Edomah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>), with some reports describing the electricity's performance records as appalling (Ebhota &amp; Tabakov, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>); thus, it becomes imperative for unceasing research on the energy situation to provide possible solutions to mitigate the problem. Worldbank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>) also stated that many people live without access to the grid, making the situation very concerning, affecting the citizens and economic growth of the country. Several types of research have been conducted to explore the potential of clean and reliable energy in Nigeria. Sambo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2009</xref>) stated that clean energy is the solution for Nigeria's acute energy crisis, predominantly in rural areas. Ajayi and Ajayi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>) stated that fossil fuel by-products are harmful to humans and the deleterious environment. Aliyu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) also believe that there is a need to rigorously pursue renewable energy technology to conquer Nigeria's continuing energy deficit to progress. Such renewable energies as clean energy should be considered viable options for sustainable electricity production in Nigeria.</p><p id="Par6">As earlier stated, rapid population growth has made the energy demand increase beyond the supply in Nigeria. The country has suffered from this energy deficit for over two decades. The majority of the populace does not have access to the national utility grid and are left with the option of self-energy generation using firewood and/or fossil fuel that significantly affects both the environment and its inhabitants. The exploitation of renewable energy to compensate for the rapid increase of population, especially in the country's remote areas, could be a solution (Mohammed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2013</xref>). Several prior studies have established that a sufficient and stable energy supply is vital to any country's development. Without the minimum required access to energy for many of its population, a nation cannot develop and sustain itself beyond a subsistence economy.</p><p id="Par7">Prior studies show that renewable energy can resolve the persisting energy crisis in the country that has lasted for over two decades. Some of these research papers are as follows: Shaaban and Petinrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>) concluded that the country is suffering from an acute electricity deficit and advocate that the use of renewable energy can solve the persisting energy crisis in the country by bridging the demand and supply gap as well improving the living standards of the people residing in the rural areas. Ohunakin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>) studied the current and future perspectives on renewable energy application in Nigeria. The research concluded that energy demand is very high and continuously increasing because of the continuous increase in the population. The researcher further recommended exploiting the renewable energies available and diversifying the energy supply. Anumaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>) concluded that the Nigerian government alone could not provide adequate funding to supply electricity. They recommended that private and foreign investors are required to promote the integration of renewable energy to minimise low access to electricity in rural areas. Mohammed et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2013</xref>) concluded that renewable energy could serve as a solution to the energy poverty in the rural areas and further recommended that in order to keep with the pace of rapid population growth in the country, there is a need to exploit renewable energy to compensate for the energy deficit.</p><p id="Par8">Ajayi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>) conducted an assessment of solar and wind resources' potentials in Northern Nigerian and concluded that solar photovoltaic technology is a viable option to facilitate sustainable development goals. Akimbami (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2001</xref>) conducted an analytical review of renewable energy policies in Nigerian. The researcher concluded that renewable energy resources could decentralise energy supply and increase energy security. Akuru et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) highlighted the potential of renewable energy in Nigeria and concluded that a 100% renewable energy supply is possible in Nigeria because it has already been achieved elsewhere; however, it requires a substantial financial commitment. As reported by Dodondawa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>) and Daily_Trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>), the Managing Director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mr Bayo Ojulari, stated that Nigeria requires approximately USD 40 billion to USD 200 billion so as to close the energy gap which would provide 30 gigawatts (GW) to 175 GW generation capacity. However, this estimation does specify if the generation is renewable or not but is exceptionally huge.</p><p id="Par9">Aliyu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) reviewed and presented the current status of Nigeria's primary renewable energies and their potentials. They recommended and promoted the integration of renewable energy in the supply mix. Ikem et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>) presented an overview of the Nigerian national electricity grid, concluded an inadequate flow of information regarding renewable energy, and recommended that the Nigerian government pursue the renewable energy policy yet implemented. The research further stated that renewable energy resources could also increase reliable and stable supply, sustaining its growth. Sambo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2009</xref>) presented the role of renewables in bridging the energy demand and supply gap. This prominent researcher in Nigeria concluded that renewable energy is a viable option to solve the country's persisting energy crisis.</p><p id="Par10">This study aims to provide a comprehensive insight into Nigeria's electricity scenario and highlight the potential of renewable and non-renewable sources in the region with the challenges hindering their penetration, furthermore, to recommend a solution that could be used as a foundation for conducting further scientific and social/political science studies for the country's development and substance of renewable energy section.</p><p id="Par11">There are about 14 types of review, and each comes with methodologies that prescribe a critical scientific and philosophical approach known as Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis (SALSA) to yield a high standard quality report that could contribute to the advancement of research and development (Grant and Booth, 2009). This study adopted systematic search and review, combining comprehensive search with a critical assessment with minimal narrative to provide recommendations based on the synthesised evidence. This particular review system attempts to acquire broad knowledge in the area of study provide insight about it rather than resolving or answering a complex search. The approach used search engines such as Google, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and ResearchGate database. Keywords such as Nigeria, energy in Nigeria, electricity in Nigeria, renewable energy in Nigeria, solar energy in Nigeria, RE potential and penetration in Nigeria, electricity crisis in Nigeria, and factors influencing electricity crisis in Nigeria, challenges causing lower RE penetration in Nigeria were used to search on the various databases mentioned above. A broader time scope of over two decades from 1999 to 2021 was considered during the search with a comparative analysis with the most recent papers to identify disparities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Brief historical background of electricity in Nigeria</title><p id="Par12">Historically, electricity generation in Nigeria can be traced to1896 in Lagos state, 15 (fifteen) years after it was first produced in England (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Oseni, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2012</xref>). In 1929, Nigeria Electricity Supply Company (NESCO) commenced its construction operations of a hydropower plant in Jos, Plateau state, in the Northern part of the country (Kumar &amp; Nagarajan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>; Monyei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>). In 1951, the colonial legislative council established the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) through parliament. The body was established to manage electricity supply and development (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Monyei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>; Vincent &amp; Yusuf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2014</xref>). In 1962, expansion led to the Niger Dam Authority (NDA) development through the Nigerian parliament's act to construct and maintain dams for electricity generation, water supply, agriculture, and irrigation activities (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). The agreement at that time was all energy produced by NDA would be sold to ECN.</p><p id="Par13">In 1972, Nigerian Electricity Power Authority (NEPA) was established, ECN and NDA were merged to form NEPA, and the Authority was mandated to control and manage the entire activities of the power sector (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). NEPA monopolised the sector for over 3 (three) decades (1972â2005). It managed both the country's generation, transmission, and electricity distribution. With the rapid increase of population, the demand continued to increase, and it reached a stage where the demand superseded the supply coupled with dilapidated infrastructure and unqualified workforce; NEPA was finding difficulties in managing the sector. Therefore, in 1979, the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) was established through parliament with the statutory mandate to strategically plan and coordinate national energy policy (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">In 2001, National Electric Power Policy ( NEPP) was introduced, which led to the power sector revolution. This policy developed an Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) documented in the same year, but the document was not signed until 2005 (Vincent &amp; Yusuf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2014</xref>). After this process, NEPA was transformed and renamed Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). In the same year, the president signed the Power Sector Reform Bill law and established the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to regulate energy sector activities, issue licences to stakeholders, determine and regulate tariffs, and enforce standards. The commission enabled the unbundling of the sector and involvement of the private sectors in both generation and distribution, but this privatisation process was delayed by union agitation and protests until 2006 (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). In 2005, NERC was also established Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) as a limited liability entity to manage the National Integrated power projects (NIPP) in the Niger Delta region (Usman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">In 2010, Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) PLC was established through an act of parliament with a mandate to serve as a broker between distribution companies and Independent Power Producers (IPP) (Usman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>). The federal government also established the Nigerian Electricity Liability Management Company (NELMCO) to oversee the assets and liabilities of the PHCN in the same year; another reform called the Power Sector Roadmap was lofted (Monyei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>). Finally, privatisation of energy generation and distribution was completed in 2014, and companies were handed over to respective purchasers accordingly (Usman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>). In 2015, the federal government approved National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy (NREEEP).

These seasonal durations differ by region: the Southern part experiences a more extended rainy season from March to December with a maximum of 2600Â mm/yr, and December to March is the dry season. The Southern part is usually wet and hot. On the other hand, the Northern part is usually dry and hot, with an average temperature range between 32Â Â°C and 42Â Â°C. The rainy season in Northern Nigeria commences around April and lasts till October with about 110Â mm/yr, and the dry season is from October to April and is accompanied by dry, dusty wind (Harmattan) (Giwa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>; Oji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012</xref>; Shaaban &amp; Petinrin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Nigeria's electricity infrastructure</title><p id="Par18">Nigeria is a country that has access to abundant non-renewable and renewable resources capable of harvesting electricity. However, electricity generation to meet up with the demand has been one of the country's significant challenges. According to Akinyele et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>), Nigeria's electricity infrastructure's low status has led to increased use of fossil fuel to power generators by a large number of Nigerians to meet their daily needs. This problem has left many Nigerians without an option other than to adopt self-energy generation using fossil fuel-powered generators and traditional biomass. According to Anumaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>), Nigeria's electricity grid generation has been dominated by gas and other oil, hydroelectric, and coal sources. In 2014, Nigeria produced around 30 TWh of electricity distributed in the following manner: Oil 6 TWh, Hydroelectricity 6 TWh, Gas 18 TWh, solar energy 0.028 TWh (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2021c</xref>).

In 2017, the total installed capacity increased to about 14,380Â MW from 27 generating plants across the country, out of which only about 7527.5Â MW was available and between 3000 to 5000Â MW is supplied (Akuru et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). According to National Bureau for Statistics (NBS) (NBS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2017</xref>), the peak generation was attained on 24 January 2017, where about 5846Â MW (140,316 MWh) was generated, and about 5747Â MW (137,920 MWh) was supplied. This shows remarkable improvement in the sector. However, the supply is still inadequate, and more alternative clean sources must be harnessed.</p><p id="Par22">The power transmission is solely managed by the Transmission Company of Nigeria, owned by the government, characterised by power losses and dilapidated infrastructures. The transmission system has a network of about 12,300Â km in length with about 5523.8Â km of 330Â kV lines and 6801.49Â km of 132Â kV lines (Ikem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>; Usman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>; Vincent &amp; Yusuf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2014</xref>). There are 137 transmission stations across the country consisting of 32 330/132Â kV substations with an installed capacity to transform 7688 MVA. The remaining 105 are 132/33/11Â kV substations with an installed capacity of 9130 MVA (Vincent &amp; Yusuf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Although the country has a huge energy deficit, it is constrained to an agreement to export part of its generated electricity to neighbouring West African countries such as Niger and Benin republics (Adeoye and Spataru, 2020). About 395Â km of 132Â kV transmission line goes from Nigeria to Niger republic and additional 255Â km of 330Â kV transmission line proposed by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) before 2030 (Adeoye and Spataru, 2020). Similarly, about 70Â km of 330Â kV transmission line stretched from Nigeria to the Benin republic (Adeoye and Spataru, 2020).</p><p id="Par24">In recent years, the government has been improving the transmission network and its infrastructure. Transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses are drastically dropping but are still considered high. In 2013, Nigeria recorded losses of about 35% (Ikem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>), while in 2014, the country recorded about 16.107% losses through transmission and distribution (WorldBank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2017a</xref>). These losses dropped to about 8% in 2016, the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO) target. Additional projects to expand the transmission network are ongoing, and it is expected to extend the network with about 986Â km of 330Â kV and 705Â km of 132Â kV.</p><p id="Par25">Distribution is the third sub-sector of the power system, which interacts with the consumers. The sector comprises 11 electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) with their various load allocations. Their distribution capacity is only around 5000Â MW to 6000Â MW because they inherited old assets, and about 40% of them have been more than 50Â years old in operation. Poor electricity distribution is a significant contributor to T&amp;D (Transmission and Distribution) losses (Ezeokoli &amp; Ifeanyi-Nwaoha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2018</xref>). The substation transformers at the distribution level receive the voltage at about 115Â kV and convert it from 4 to 34Â kV. In contrast, the line transformer converts the energy to primary voltage, typically about 240Â V and 480Â V. The distribution sector is facing challenges such as poor infrastructure, weak and inadequate coverage, inadequate working tools, obsolete communication technology, staff that lacks training, insufficient funding, and lack of maintenance (Vincent &amp; Yusuf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Nigeria's energy scenario</title><p id="Par26">Nigeria is facing severe challenges in electricity generation and supply. The national grid supply is mainly characterised by continuous fluctuations, frequent power outages, and system instability (Onohaebi &amp; Eseosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2014</xref>). According to Oseni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2016</xref>), a typical Nigerian house has access to an average of five hours of electricity supply daily from the national grid. Ajayi and Ajayi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>) stated that the national grid's Nigerian electricity production has not been sufficient to meet the country's demand, promoting self-generation using traditional biomass and fossil fuel. The country's electricity supply has sunk into a quagmire for over two decades. The supply is grossly insufficient and inadequate to meet the population's demand, continuously increasing; thus, the demand and supply gap is also rapidly widening. As stated earlier, Nigeria has an approximate population of over 200 million with an average estimated demand of 31.2 GW, and the country has an installed capacity of 14.38 GW with an average supply capacity of 6 GW (Akuru et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). It implies that the electricity generation system can only produce about 40% of its installed capacity. If the thumb rule, which says every 1,000,000 people require a minimum of 1000Â MW, is applied to Nigeria, it will require about 200 000Â MW (200 GW).</p><p id="Par27">Electricity production from renewable sources, excluding hydroelectric, is still 0% (WorldBank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2017b</xref>). However, the status has recently changed with the aggressive development of solar energy installation. According to World Energy Council (WEC) (WEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2020</xref>), indicators, energy access, renewable energies, corruption, trade barriers, and liquefied natural gas, the critical uncertainty that Nigeria's leaders are struggling with; energy poverty, electricity prices, energy subsidy, and energy efficiency are significant uncertainties requiring government attention in 2020.

A considerable amount of money was invested in the sector in the last two decades, but a slight improvement has been recorded. Almost USD 20 billion was used to revive the Nigerian electricity sector, but the minimal effect (Newman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>). No one can appropriately account for the money. The investment was a policy intended to provide additional sources (renewable energy) such as solar photovoltaic installation in generation mix (WeForum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018</xref>); that could boost generation and reduce reliance on grid national grid through mini-grids and isolated areas. The power supply that is inadequate and unreliable continues to compel people to self-energy generation using traditional firewood's fossil fuel and use. These have serious negative repercussions on our health and the environment. A significant number of lives have been lost due to the emission of these fossil fuel generators, and quantitative figures in respect of the lives lost were presented in some reported accidents cited in the subsequent Sect.Â 3.1.1 of this report.</p><p id="Par29">The insufficient supply of electricity and drop of the oil and gas prices in the international oil market has compelled and dragged Nigeria's economy into a recession.

Furthermore, about a 20% reduction was recorded in 2011 alone. Also, the researcher further stated that domestic electricity consumption increased from 37.1% to 63.8%. This shows that the population is increasing, and industries are either shutting down and/or using alternative sources to generate their electricity. The continuous multiple power outages and unpredictable supply have an extremely negative impact on Nigeria's economy. It has paralysed the country's industrial sector by compelling them to adopt self-energy generation using fossil fuel generators, increasing the production cost. It is noteworthy that Nigeria's electricity consumption is very low, according to Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>.

According to AfDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>), Nigeria's manufacturing sector has recorded a general decline in 2016. It has been estimated that about 272 firms have shut down, which causes industrial capacity utilisation of electricity to automatically drop to 35.4% in 2016 from 51.4% in 2015 (AfDB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>). Similarly, Aliyu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) stated that to produce an item in Nigeria will cost nine times (9X) higher than to produce it in China because self-energy generation constitutes about 40% of the total production cost. The researchers further stated that MAN (Manufacturers Association of Nigeria) reported that about USD 11,340 million is spent on fuelling and maintaining fossil-fuelled generators weekly. These data indicate that the lack of a stable electricity supply seriously affects the country's industrial and manufacturing sectors.

The Nigerian government is losing huge sums due to power outages. Trillions of Naira (Nigerian Currency (â¦)) are spent running and maintaining fossil-fuelled generators. The Nigeria Council for Renewable Energy (CREN) estimates that power outages lead to a loss of â¦126 billion (USD 984.38 million) annually (CREN 2009, cited Nnaji et al.

Similarly, Ayodele and Ogunjuyigbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>) also reported that it had been estimated that â¦3.5 Trillion had been spent on running and maintaining fossil-fuelled generators in Nigeria.

Considering the high costs of fossil fuel alone used in running power generators in Nigeria, it is evident that renewable energy such as solar energy systems is becoming cheaper alternatives (Mohammed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">According to Oyedepo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2012b</xref>), despite the abundant natural resources reserves (fossil fuel) in Nigeria, which are underexploited, with the present rate of exploitation and extraction, it has been estimated that reserves (of non-renewable energy) will be low to the point where it would be uneconomical to continue the exploration in the next 40Â years. It will, therefore, become necessary to start exploring and triggering the adoption of other alternative sources such as renewable energy systems and implement them as soon as possible. The renewable energy potential in the country is enormous, and according to Sambo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2009</xref>), renewable energy in Nigeria is a viable solution to the current energy crisis in the country. The country's potential is more than 1.5 times fossil fuel resources in energy terms (Shaaban &amp; Petinrin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>). Harnessing renewable energy resources such as solar energy can solve all the persisting problems affecting the country's electricity supply, thereby promoting sustainable urban and rural socio-economic development. Aliyu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>); Shaaban and Petinrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>) point out that solar energy is the backbone and driving force of other renewable energies such as hydro, biomass, and wind. Ozoegwu et al.

Based on these resources, population, and other factors, the country is categorised as the giant of Africa. The country relies on the oil and gas industry as its primary revenue source (Adom &amp; Adams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Unfortunately, these resources are not correctly used to resolve the persisting socio-economic problems and other challenges, including the country's energy crisis for more than two decades. Substantial financial resources of over â¦2.1 trillion from 2014 to 2020 obtained through oil and gas exploitation were invested by the government through its central bank (Anyaogu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>) towards boosting the electricity sector development; however, several factors such as policy instability and corruption hindered the improvement of the sector (Roy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Nigeria is a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Country (OPEC). When combined, Nigeria and Libya's crude oil reserve accounts for 2/3 (two-thirds) of the African oil reserve. In Nigeria, oil was first discovered in a town called Oloibiri, in Bayelsa State, in the Niger Delta, South-South region, in 1956, just before independence. The country has witnessed a steady increase in exploration activities over the decades. This exploration growth arises from a funding scheme that has to do with production-sharing arrangements. The exploration activities are onshore and offshore (in the Atlantic oceans). In 2015, the country had about 29 active oil rigs, a pipeline network of 5001Â km around the country, with about 22 (twenty-two) oil depots (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). According to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) (DPR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>), Nigeria has five functioning oil and gas refineries (Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC) in New Port Harcourt, WRPC in Warri, Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) Kaduna, PHRC Old Port Harcourt, and Niger Delta Petroleum Resources (NDPR) with a total production capacity of 446.0 (1000 barrels per day (b/d)) but produces only 8.2 (1000 b/d), while the country's oil demand is about 469.8 (1000 b/d) (OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). These clearly show the low performance of local refining capacity, as crude oil is exported for refining purposes and then imported back for local consumption. This low performance is caused due to poor maintenance, inadequately trained professionals, underfunding, corruption, and vandalism (Roy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2020</xref>; Otombosoba, 2021).</p><p id="Par53">Nigeria has enormous oil resources, yet its populace frequently suffers from shortages of oil products. Based on the above facts relating to insufficient refining capacity, the country's crude oil export reached about 2008.2 (1000 b/d) (OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). The country has a proven crude oil reserve of 36,890 million barrels (OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). In 2015, Nigeria produced about 2329 b/d, while in 2016, the country produced about 2053 b/d, a decrease of about âÂ 11.9%, and a further decline to 1737.4 barrels/day in 2020 (OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). Its refining capacity is about 446.0 (1000 b/d), and the output of the refined petroleum products is about 28.3 (1000 b/d), while the country's oil demand is about 469.8 (1000 b/d) (OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). In 1999, it was documented that the country had a proven reserve of 25 billion barrels. In 2004, it increased to about 34 billion barrels in 2017, and it would continue to increase to about 37 billion barrels, and by 2030 it is projected to reach 68 billion barrels (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>) potentially. In 2015, Nigerian OPEC production percentages were reduced to 5.8% compared to 7%, which had a devastating effect on the country's economy because of the overdependence on the oil and gas sector (Wijeratne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">The gas reserves are proven to be extremely large at 3 (three) times the amount of oil in the country, making the second global reserve after Algeria. In 2020, Nigeria had a proven natural gas reserve of about 5.4 trillion m<sup>3</sup> (cubic metre), equivalent to 190.4 trillion ft<sup>3</sup> (cubic feet). In 2019, the country produced 49.3 billion m<sup>3</sup>, which is 45.1 tonnes of oil equivalent of natural gas, while in 2016, it produced 48.3 billion m<sup>3</sup> (BP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>; OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). About 35.9 billion m<sup>3</sup> of natural gas was exported (OPEC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). Nigeria had been wasting its gas through gas flaring in the Niger Delta until 1990 when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) concluded the agreements and established Nigeria LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) 2 (two) years later, and commenced production in 1999 (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). According to Shaaban and Petinrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>), about 45.8 billion kWh of heat discharge into the South-South region of Nigeria from gas flaring of about 1.8 billion ft<sup>3</sup> of gas daily led to the country being rated among one of the highest CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) and GHG (green house gas) producers in the world. According to Anumaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>); Shaaban and Petinrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>), Nigeria is assumed to be one of the world's highest gas flaring nations. Anumaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>) further stated that the country is losing vast quantities through this gas flaring, with an estimated USD 18.2 million every day. These vast resources could generate electricity and other developmental and infrastructural projects.</p><p id="Par55">Coal is the oldest natural resource discovered and exploited in Nigeria. It was discovered in 1909, and mining began years later, having a recorded production output of 24.500 tons in 1916 (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). About 95% of the production was consumed locally for transportation (railways), industrial activities (cement production), and electricity production, unlike oil and gas. The country has a proven reserve of about 639 million tonnes of coal, and the inferred reserves are estimated at 2.75 billion tonnes (Anumaka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). The utilisation of coal drastically dropped just after the discovery of crude oil. The diesel-powered trains and various sources of electricity generation were also introduced in the country. The available potential can still be utilised in production activities and power generation, but its by-products severely negatively affect human health and the environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Nigeria's renewable energy outlook</title><p id="Par56">Renewable energy is the energy that is replenishing and non-deplete-able.

According to reports, Nigeria is endowed with intensive sunshine, with an average of 6.25Â h per day, ranging between 9.0Â h in the far Northern boundary and about 3.5Â h in the coastal areas, meaning that Nigeria receives average solar radiation of about 12.6Â MJ/m<sup>2</sup> /day at the Southern coastal latitudes and about 25.2Â MJ/m<sup>2</sup> /day in the far Northern part of the country, giving the mathematical average as 18.9Â MJ/m<sup>2</sup> /day (Gaglia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>; Ilenikhena &amp; Ezemonye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2010</xref>; Nnaji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2010</xref>; Ohunakin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>).

Despite this massive amount of solar energy striking the earth's surface, several developing countries such as Nigeria encounter difficulties harnessing the resources. According to Mohammed (2017), several developed countries have recorded electricity stability after investing in solar. Investing in solar energy harvesting technologies can reduce or eradicate energy poverty in the developing world and promote the reduction of green house gases (GHG).</p><p id="Par71">There are three significant ways to convert solar energy into electricity: solar photovoltaic conversion, solar thermal conversion, and concentrated solar power conversion. These technologies are devices that convert solar energy into a usable form of energy. These technologies are briefly discussed in the subsequent section of this paper, emphasising photovoltaic because it is the most utilised solar technology in Nigeria and worldwide.</p><p id="Par72">Solar thermal conversion is achieved by using the Sun to heat a fluid to a certain steam level that can drive turbines to generate electricity. A solar thermal collector uses solar radiation to heat the fluid; then, the evacuating air is the steam that drives the turbines, and the heated fluid is transferred into a storage tank (Leggett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2009</xref>). The required temperature for solar thermal depends on the intended application and the type of solar collector. Solar thermal has many other conversion techniques and can be used for various applications. In Nigeria, solar thermal is used to generate solar cooking, crop drying, incubating, water heating for industries, hospitals, prisons, and households (Aliyu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). According to Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21) (REN21, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>), solar water heating collectors had a cumulative global installed capacity of about 479 GW<sup>th</sup> at the end of 2019, from a 1% decrease from the previous.</p><p id="Par73">Concentrated Solar Power technology converts sunlight into energy using heat. It is designed to collect and concentrate sunlight to generate heat that drives energy generators such as turbines or solar cells to produce electricity (Green-Rhino-Energy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>). Devices such as lenses and mirrors are used to collect, focus, and concentrate solar radiation onto the photovoltaic cell to increase the device's generation and efficiency (Shanks et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2016</xref>). This form of electricity generation requires immediate utilisation and a cooling mechanism to protect from overheating in the system as the temperature is excited in a split second (Siyabi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2017</xref>). It has been developed to reduce the photovoltaic system's cost by illuminating solar cells with a very high-intensity light using the lenses.</p><p id="Par74">There are various methods in which concentrated solar energy generation can be accomplished, either trapping the light or utilising the refractive and reflective devices to increase sunshine intensity. The technology is in the market's introductory stage, and in 2019 it has an installed capacity of about 6.2 GW (IRENA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2018</xref>). There is no record of the concentrated solar power technology installation in Nigeria.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Solar photovoltaic</title><p id="Par75">This device uses photovoltaic effects when exposed to solar radiation to generate electricity. Photons become excited when exposed to solar radiation and then release electrons collected by wires to generate a direct current of electricity that most needs to be converted to alternating current using converters (Leggett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2009</xref>). The produced energy can be stored using a storage device such as a battery or transmitted to load for utilisation. The device continues to generate energy as long as it is exposed to sunlight.</p><p id="Par76">The photovoltaic effect was first discovered by a French scientist named Alexandre Edmund Becquerel in 1883. The scientist observed while experimenting with metal and electrodes. In the same year, the first photovoltaic cell from selenium wafers with about 1% efficiency was developed by an American inventor called Charles Fritts. In 1888, the first US patent for the photovoltaic cell was received by Edward Weston. In 1901, Nikola Tesla also received another US patent for the technology and a capable methodology utilising solar energy. In 1904, Albert Einstein published the theoretical basis of the photovoltaic effect, which earned him a Nobel Prize in 1923 (Akinyele et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). This critical development was advanced by a Polish scientist called Jan Czonchralski in the mid-twentieth century, who developed the silicon cell with 11% efficiency in 1958 at an unaffordable price (USD 1000/W) (Akinyele et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>; Kalogirou, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>). Baurzhan and Jenkins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>) reported that the levelized cost of energy generated from the solar photovoltaic system was very high, but the cost has decreased and will continue to decline with the recent technological development. Also, Roche and Ifeanyi-Nwaoha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>) stated that the solar photovoltaic system's cost drastically dropped by 60% between 2010 and 2015, and the cost of the technology is projected to drop further by 5.9% in 2015. The low cost of technology was due to the higher appetite for the solar photovoltaic electricity harvesting system and massive production (Sundaram et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2016</xref>). With this rapid declination of PV module prices, the technology has a promising future. However, despite this decline in photovoltaics' cost price, some developing countries like Nigeria are yet to utilise the technology's potential and continue to face energy starvation.</p><p id="Par77">The photovoltaic effect occurs when an influx of solar energy hits a cell and gets absorbed by an atom's valence electron, creating pairs of electron holes. The level of electron energy increases according to the amount of photon absorbed. When the photon's energy is greater than the semiconductor bandgap, the electron with excess energy will escape to the conduction band, where it will have freedom of movement. Therefore, the absorption of photon releases an electron that can be collected by employing an electric field across the cell's back and front (Kalogirou, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>). When conductors are attached to this electric field with positive and negative terminals, it forms an electrical circuit, and electrons are collected in form electrical current called photocurrent (<inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mtext>ph</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Ohunakin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>) stated that solar energy systems have proven reliable for many decades in developed countries. According to REN21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>), in 2019, the global cumulative solar photovoltaic capacity was about 627 GW and net annual addition of about 115 GW of electricity in the same year.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>) and Ozoegwu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017</xref>) reported that most of Nigeria's available solar energy systems are limited to simple load electricity appliances in households and street lighting. In contrast, Sambo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2009</xref>) reported about 15Â MW of isolated solar photovoltaic installation across the country. Also, many standalone installations of solar energy systems in the country are not adequately documented, resulting in the inaccurate data aggregation of solar PV penetration. Ozoegwu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017</xref>) stated that there are no accurate figures for the status of solar energy penetration in Nigeria, meaning there is no comprehensive statistical record such as a database for the deployment of solar energy technology in the country, which shows that the utilisation of solar energy is difficult to be ascertained highlighting that penetration might still be weak. Monyei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>) and Mohammed et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>) concurred and supported this claim by stating that there is no exact and accurate data on the status of solar energy penetration in the country, but it has been established that so far, the solar energy has zero contribution to the national grid supply mix.</p><p id="Par86">Nigeria's solar potential is very high but not adequately exploited. However, the Northern part of the country receives more solar radiation, and for that reason, it will be more suitable for solar electricity generation. If only 1% of the Northern Nigeria land area is made available for electricity generation from a solar energy system using 5% efficiency, about 333,480Â MW of electricity may be generated at a 26% capacity factor (Sambo &amp; Bala, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2012</xref>). As attractive as this may seem, the implementation concerns cannot be overlooked because it is practically impossible. Recently, in an attempt to integrate solar energy into the supply mix, the Federal Government approved a policy called NREEEP (National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy), which intends to increase the percentage contribution of solar energy to the total energy supply mix to about 3% by 2020 and 6% by 2030 as the minimum contribution (NREEEP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>). Also, NASENI (National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure) is a company that has been established to develop solar PVs in the country to promote and enhance the penetration of the technology. Aliyu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) observe that solar energy penetration in the country is prolonged and further claim that technology's cost is 20 times higher than conventional fossil fuel. On the other hand, Mohammed et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>) stated that solar energy technologies are now becoming relatively affordable as more households in the developed world are using the technology, and it is strategically vital for developing countries to adopt the technology as most of them are located in regions with high solar radiation.</p><p id="Par87">Solar energy contribution to the nation's energy mix remains very negligible in the country when compared to its potential. This low penetration can be attributed to component failure, low awareness, technical problems, government policy, environmental factors, and vandalisation (Rui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>; Oyewumi and Oluiobi, 2015; Iledare, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>). However, many local research centres are making giant strides in technology research and development to promote it to become a household commodity (Ilenikhena &amp; Ezemonye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2010</xref>). The solar energy system's application to supplement fossil fuel technologies or become part of the supply mix will ensure sustainable energy development, which has enormous advantages such as easy integration, zero noise and air pollution, replenishable resources, low maintenance cost, and a long operational life cycle (Luderer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par88">Ozoegwu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017</xref>) also stated that the integration of solar energy systems into Nigeria's national grid in the past is nil, currently is also nil, and future status may only be seen on memoranda of understanding. In contrast, some large solar farms were recently commissioned: 1Â MW (Nigeria-Electricity-Hub, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>), 7.1Â MW in Bayero University Kano (Energy_Storage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>), and 1.2Â MW in Usman dam (Off_Grid_Nigeria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>), Abuja. Also, several solar farms projects are under construction, such as 100Â MW in Sokoto, 50Â MW in Nasarawa State, 100Â MW in Katsina State, 100Â MW in Kaduna State, and 100Â MW in Bauchi State (Evwind, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>). A total of 27.96Â MW PV installation has been reported towards the end of 2019 (IRENA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2018</xref>). However, the amount is meagre than other developing countries in the region, illustrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>. The country with less energy demand a smaller population than Nigeria has high PV penetration rates even though Nigeria started using technology.<fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>PV installed variation among three sub-Saharan countries (IRENA, 2020)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2022_2308_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p id="Par89">However, there are a large number of ongoing on-grid solar energy projects in the country, such as 1Â MW solar project, which the French oil company launched in Northern Nigeria (Aliyu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>); 58 projects embarked by the Energy Commission of Nigeria (E.C.N.), 3Â MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects by Delta State Government; Zamfara State solar electrification, 600 projects by Rural Electrification Agency; Niger State 300Â MW solar power plant and the Anjeed Kafanchan 15Â MW among others. The Nigerian government signed an M.O.U. (memorandum of understanding) with a US-based company to provide 1200Â MW electricity from solar PV projects within two years at the cost of over USD 2 billion (Masâud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>). Recently, Nigeria has launched a USD 75Â m project to use solar PV in generating electricity for its citizens (Power_Technology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par90">The significance of solar energy development and integration into the supply mix is clear and well recognised. Aliyu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) hold the view that solar energy technology has an enormous advantage to resolve the energy poverty of small settlements in remote areas that are not connected to the national utility grid and provide other necessities such as rural clinic electrification, water supply, traffic lighting, and school lighting. Ohunakin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>) also point out why solar energy should be integrated into the country's supply mix. These reasons are: solar energy can reduce carbon footprint, provide energy security, improve supply, improve rural electrification, and create job opportunities. Nigeria must bridge the gap between demand and supply by using renewable energy technology such as solar to overcome its present electricity crisis and pursue economic prosperity. However, security issues, infrastructural deficit, corruption, vandalism, local content, underfunding, institutional, and human capital development are some challenges that the technologyâs penetration is encountering (Rui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>; Gian, 2017; Oyewunmi and Olujobi, 2015; Iledare, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Challenges facing solar technology penetration in Nigeria</title><p id="Par91">This paper also highlights some challenges confronting solar energy penetration in the country, and without good penetration, sustainable development would be compromised. Ohunakin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>) highlighted the drivers and barriers of solar energy penetration in the country, such as lack of public awareness, government policy, theft, and solar technology vandalism. Akinboro et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>) also reviewed standalone PV installation for Nigeria's residence and industries. Researchers highlighted the problems and recommended a possible solution. They highlighted the issues confronting solar installation in Nigeria and recommended using solar PV in a hybrid to avoid blackouts. Similarly, in a research paper, Sambo and Bala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2012</xref>) discussed solar energy penetration in Nigeria and highlighted solar energy penetration status and challenges. Based on the papers mentioned above, a summary of the challenges confronting the penetration of solar technology is categorised into three groups as follows:</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Technical</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Present level of research and development</title><p id="Par92">There is no in-depth research on the challenges confronting solar energy penetration in the country, and most local research centres are not focusing their efforts on that. There is no state-of-the-art research on technological development related to solar energy in the country, causing slow penetration of the technology (small scale or large scale) due to funding constraints; thus, the technology is yet to become widely available. The country has inadequate human capacity building and related training in solar energy development, installation, and maintenance (Mohammed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Technology and equipment fabrication</title><p id="Par93">Considering solar irradiance potential in Nigeria, the country has a low level of fabrication technology rating. Several companies such as Lumos, Auxano Solar, Solmont Technologies, and Sunhive strive to establish solar photovoltaic assembling lines in the country. As earlier established, NASENI is the only indigenous establishment in the country recorded to be manufacturing solar photovoltaic (NASENI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2011</xref>); otherwise, most solar photovoltaic systems identified in the country were imported, and most of them are found to be substandard products (Ohunakin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Component failure</title><p id="Par94">Several solar energy technologies in the country tend to drop in performance or become inefficient shortly after installation (Ikem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>). This component failure is mainly caused due to use of substandard technology and/or environmental and climate effects such as dust formation on the photovoltaic panel (Oji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012</xref>). It makes the users turn away from using the devices and gives them a negative image.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Technical problem</title><p id="Par95">Fundamental design problems such as suitable geographical site identification, load profile determination, intermittency of resources, and the inclination angle are ignored by inexperienced personnel engaged in a solar installation in the country (Sambo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2014</xref>). The country has few professionals capable of designing and installing the appropriate setup for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings but are primarily engaged with other solar energy-related activities, allowing inexperienced personnel to handle the installations. There is the insufficient technical knowledge of developing energy management systems to integrate solar energy technology with the national grid.</p><p id="Par96">Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is wholly owned by the government and is affected by inconsistent and inadequate funding. As earlier stated, outdated facilities in its network characterise TCN incapable of accommodating the energy generated; additional solar farms might face the same challenges. The transmission company cannot meet its expansion plan as it is engulfed with debt and cannot generate sufficient funds to tailor it to purchase new equipment (Ibukun &amp; Adebayo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Poor maintenance</title><p id="Par97">Nigerians have a very poor maintenance culture. Many solar photovoltaic projects in the country fail because of low maintenance (Sambo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2014</xref>). The solar photovoltaic installations around the country are not kept clean, and with dust particles, birds' droppings, and other materials on top of the panel, the system's performance tends to decrease. Chanchangi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>) reported how dust activities in the region significantly affect the PV system performance and hinder its penetration and utilisation. The dust has been reported in other regions to significantly affect the performance of PV technology (Chanchangi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Gupta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Economical</title><sec id="Sec27"><title>Affordability</title><p id="Par98">As earlier stated, most Nigerians live below the poverty line, and most of them reside in rural areas where electricity access is low; as such, most of them cannot afford to acquire a complete solar energy setup because of the price. The price of solar energy technology and its installation cost is still considered expensive in this part of the world, especially among the rural population (Giwa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>; Ikem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>; Mohammed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>; Oji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Cost of generation</title><p id="Par99">The initial cost of installing solar photovoltaic technology is very high compared with other energy harvesting systems such as diesel generators in the short run. However, the technology is far cheaper in the long term. The affordability issue by low-income earners will appear, as most people living without access to the national grid cannot afford the technology (Ikem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Debt</title><p id="Par100">The energy sector faces increasing illiquidity, and massive losses as generated electricity cannot be quickly sold since most of the population bypasses electricity from the grid to avoid payment. This scared up potential investors as it is difficult to profit from the investment (Babatope &amp; Solomon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par101">Energy companies are in serious debt as the sector has been impacted by liquidity and solvency, restricting them from meeting up their targets. However, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is working to restructure the debt policy on energy sectors, thereby preventing the companies from filing bankruptcy (Babatope &amp; Solomon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par102">Lack of payment discipline by Nigerians is a factor that affects the existing supply system in the country as consumers are refusing to pay their bills. It was reported in 2020 that Nigerians owe N273.42bn electricity debt (Nwachukwu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>). Internationally, indebtedness is increasing by the day as customers such as Mali, Niger, and Togo owe massive amounts, with the total owed by the three countries to be around USD 69Â m (Jeremiah, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>)<bold>.</bold></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Policy</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Government policy</title><p id="Par103">There have been policy implementation U-turns over the years by the Nigerian government regarding integrating solar energy in the national supply mix due to government ignorance. However, the NREEEP policy that aims to contribute about 3% in 2020 to about 6% in 2030 of solar energy to the national supply mix is available (Giwa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>), but has not been fully implemented; as the government has not yet fully implemented some of the sub-policies such as a subsidy programme, incentives and any other palliative mechanism to encourage and attract potential investors to the sector (Giwa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>; Ikem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>; Mohammed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>). There is a lack of importation taxation waivers in the power sector. According to Ohunakin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>), import duty for solar technology is about 21%, which is side compared to petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals, which is crude of 5%. Policy instability has the potential investors to doubt the commitment credibility of the government, which position the private sector investment to be at a high-risk level in the country (Roy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Lack of awareness</title><p id="Par104">The inadequate dissemination of information related to the enormous solar energy potential in the country and lack of awareness related to immense solar PV benefits leads to scepticism in the majority about the deployment of solar energy technology for energy generation (Giwa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>; Mohammed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>; Ohunakin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>; Oji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012</xref>).

The area with high energy demand in the country is more prone to theft and vandalism of solar energy technologies due to insecurity and insurgency (Ohunakin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par106">Vandals remove or cut some transmission cables or infrastructures in protest against government policy or for stealing purposes. This poses a significant concern for the transmission of generated electricity from solar energy infrastructures. The activities of vandals significantly impact the transmission infrastructure and have persisted over two decades, leading to the continuous breakdown that negatively impacted the living standard of Nigerians (Ibukun &amp; Adebayo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Security instability</title><p id="Par107">Security is paramount for the penetration of renewable energy technology. Security instability has been a significant concern in Nigeria, with the activities of terrorists, kidnappers, insurgents, militants, and bandits across the country (BBC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>); it is posing a threat to enabling investment environment even though there is a substantial potential market due to population and demand gap. The insecurity directly affects all aspects that could enhance the penetration of renewable energy technology in the supply mix. Investors would require a secured region to commit; similarly, installed infrastructure must be secured over a long period for its return investment. Local research and development could only be achieved in a stable and secured environment.</p><p id="Par108">Ohunakin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>) reported that kidnapping and killings across the country, particularly in Northern Nigeria, have impeded the construction of some power plants and other infrastructure that could promote the country's penetration of renewable energy technology. This is assumed to stymie potential threats to the future development of the solar energy infrastructure, especially at a large scale. Miftahu and Oruonye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>) reported that the country is overwhelmed by security challenges from terrorism, insurgency, conflicts, community-based militias, and bandits, making it a high-risk and vulnerable region that affects all kinds of investment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Discussion and policy recommendation</title><p id="Par109">The rapid growth of Nigeria's population has created a wide gap between the demand and supply of electricity, and the overdependence on fossil fuel has severe adverse socio-economic, environmental, and health effects. The country suffers from an unstable, unreliable, and inadequate electricity supply. Energy poverty is very high, yet the enormous abundant renewable energy in the country is still untapped. The economic and environmental benefits of the PV technology have made the system the most sustainable clean energy solution to enable developing countries to achieve the UNâs SDG-7 target. This has led countries such as Nigeria to invest in solar energy to increase the penetration of renewable energy in their supply mix and reduce global warming. However, as mentioned in this report, the technology faces several challenges, one of which appears to be a technical problem.</p><p id="Par110">Reviewing the related literature emphasises that PV systems are developing at an incredible increasing rate. The reason is the favourable solar conditions and new supporting legislation. However, dust activities act as substantial barriers to PV development. A thorough literature review was also provided to understand these activities, origins, and frequencies.</p><p id="Par111">The main aim of this study was to review the Nigerian scientific research concerning energy deficiency and the potential of renewable energy in the country, focusing on solar energy technologies and their development, penetration, and the problems hindering penetration. In conclusion, several challenges for further research were identified, and the recommendations in these regards can be summarised as follows.</p><p id="Par112">Nigeria has abundant renewable energy resources readily available for tapping and integrating to supply mix with a more promising future in solar PV. Therefore, the government should speedily prioritise solar PV development across the country.</p><p id="Par113">Research and development need additional funding from both the government and private sectors to examine various solar PV technology performances across the country and provide benchmarks for future innovations that would suit the regional conditions.</p><p id="Par114">Regulators such as standard organisations should ensure that substandard renewable energy products are prevented from penetrating the local market. All renewable energy products should be subjected to rigorous tests for certification before being allowed into the local market.</p><p id="Par115">More technical personnel across the country should be trained on the standard solar photovoltaic installation and maintenance procedures. Vocational training could be provided to qualified and desired candidates to reduce wrong PV installation practices.</p><p id="Par116">An overhaul of the transmission company should be conducted, starting with an audit to forecast the peak demand and possible peak generation. New infrastructures should be installed to accommodate maximum potential generation from various renewable sources, especially solar PV.</p><p id="Par117">PV installation maintenance required background research across the country to investigate the impact of various parameters such as soiling (dust accumulation), temperature, shading, and accidental damages. Moreover, their influence concerning the technology's performance, since most of the parameters are site-specific. This would ease determining a cost-effective approach and the required frequency for optimum PV yield performance. Practical experiment concerning the impact of the parameters mentioned above is relatively understudied; it opens up a wider gap in the research and development (R&amp;D) for the solar PV community.</p><p id="Par118">Energy losses from PV due to dust are an issue that cannot be ignored and can be an obstacle to achieving renewable energy targets in Nigeria. In this context, this recommended further investigation concerning an approach that could sustain and maintain a certain level of performance over the device's life cycle.</p><p id="Par119">Since the price of solar photovoltaic is dropping, other related components should also be subsidised to assist low-income earners in acquiring the technology. Another alternative is that a tax incentive policy should be implemented to reduce the cost prices of the technology. The institution should be encouraged to offer interest-free loans for solar energy deployment. The government should also offer incentives such as subsidies, taxation waivers, and investment loans in the sector. These financial supports will reduce the initial high cost of solar technologies in the country.</p><p id="Par120">Policy U-turn should be avoided, and development continuity should be embraced to complete energy projects fully.</p><p id="Par121">The Nigerian government must pursue the documented Nigerian Renewal Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy (NREEEP) for incorporating renewable energy in the supply mix, diversifying and increasing the supply. The government should also try to implement the policy and its recommendations since the 3% target of solar energy inclusion in the supply mix set for 2020 has not been met, and 2030 is fast approaching.</p><p id="Par122">More awareness campaigns should be developed at all levels through seminars, workshops, promotional exercises, and media adverts to highlight and publicise the benefits and opportunities associated with solar technology to encourage people to adopt the technology. Both private and government sectors should conduct an awareness campaign.</p><p id="Par123">Appropriate measures such as anti-theft screws, cementing photovoltaic base, and inscription should be employed to prevent theft and vandalisation of solar energy technologies. Continuous surveillance improvement by law enforcement agencies will also assist in preventing both theft and vandalisation.</p><p id="Par124">Finally, solar energy remains the most viable option to solve the persisting energy crisis in Nigeria as it can supply electricity from off-grid and remote areas. It can reduce both the pressure mounted on fossil fuel and has a limited negative impact on our ecosystem and its inhabitants and, as such, should be urgently exploited. This research study is limited to secondary information as no primary data were collected; however, it is highly recommended to investigate the country's actual penetration level of solar energy technology. This might require a considerable resource but would be very useful for planning and other data application. Reviewing the Nigerian energy sector and focusing on solar PV potential revealed several challenges, as presented in the previous section. This study recommended a thorough investigation of the challenges, particularly the technical problem and PV maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par125">The rapid growth of Nigeria's population has created a wide gap between the demand and supply of electricity, and the overdependence on fossil fuel has severe adverse socio-economic, environmental, and health effects.
