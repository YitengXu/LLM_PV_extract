Combined analysis using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis confirms the change of the chemical formula from oxidized Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.9</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>3.00</sub> to reduced Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.9</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2.90</sub> for the bare sample. By contrast, a significant concentration of oxygen vacancy is additionally formed <italic>in situ</italic> for Mn- or Cr-doped samples by reducing the oxidized Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>M<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>3.00</sub> (M = Mn, Cr) to Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>M<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2.85</sub>. The ionic conductivities of the Mn- and Cr-doped titanate improve by approximately 2 times higher than bare titanate in an oxidizing atmosphere and 3–6 times higher in a reducing atmosphere at intermediate temperatures. A remarkable chemical accommodation of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules is achieved on the surface of the reduced and doped titanate and the chemical desorption temperature reaches a common carbonate decomposition temperature. The electrical properties of the cathode materials are investigated and correlated with the electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes. Direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis at composite cathodes is investigated in solid-oxide electrolyzers. The electrode polarizations and current efficiencies are observed to be significantly improved with the Mn- or Cr-doped titanate cathodes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep07082.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep07082" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep07082</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Currently, much attention is being focused on global warming and climate change, which is caused by the large consumption of fossil fuels, resulting in a large quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. High-temperature CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis in an oxide-ion conducting solid-oxide electrolyzer has the potential to directly convert electrical energy into chemical energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Using an external potential, CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are electrochemically reduced to CO at the cathode, whereas the oxygen ions are transported through the oxide-ion conducting electrolyte to the anode side to form oxygen gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>A solid-oxide electrolyzer based on Ni-YSZ cermet has been widely used for high-temperature CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis to generate CO fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, Ni metal can be easily oxidized to form NiO without a flow of reducing gas, which may cause a loss of electronic conductivity and failure of the electrode. In addition, poor resistance to redox cycling and the low stability performance limits its application in a solid-oxide electrolyzer. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Ni metal for the splitting of CO<sub>2</sub> is relatively high; carbon deposition most likely occurs and leads to the degradation of cell performance. Some reports have indicated that the deposition of carbon is likely caused by reactions that occur over the catalyst and carbon deposition is likely to occur when hydrocarbons exist in the reactants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recently, perovskite (La<sub>0.75</sub>Sr<sub>0.25</sub>)<sub>0.95</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>Cr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (LSCM) has been demonstrated to be an efficient ceramic cathode for direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis in the absence of a reducing gas flowing over the composite cathode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, this cathode is not ideally adapted to a strong reducing potential due to the p-type conduction mechanism of the LSCM, which results in a large electrode polarization resistance. In addition, our previous study demonstrated that strong reducing potentials can lead to adverse chemical and structural changes in LSCM under the electrolysis conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>The perovskite strontium titanate is an active and redox stable material that possesses high n-type electronic conductivity upon reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The metallic behavior of the electronic conductivity adapts well to the strong reducing atmosphere of the cathode under electrolysis conditions. Currently, more attention is being paid to the niobium doping of the B-site, where Nb<sup>5+</sup> partially substitutes Ti<sup>4+</sup>, which significantly improves the electrochemical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. According to a previous report, the electrical conductivity of Sr<sub>0.9</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>Nb<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3.00</sub> that was pretreated at 1400°C for 5 h in a H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere reached approximately 340 S·cm<sup>−1</sup> at 800°C in a reducing atmosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Chen et al. also studied the effect of Ga doping in A-site-deficient Sr<sub>0.9</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>Nb<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3.00</sub> and determined that the sample with 10% Ga doping that were pretreated at 1400°C for 10 h in 10%H<sub>2</sub>/Ar exhibited the highest electrical conductivity in a 10%H<sub>2</sub>/Ar atmosphere at temperatures from 630 to 830°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, other reports have also demonstrated the excellent redox stability of SrNb<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> materials after oxidizing and reducing treatments in air or humidified H<sub>2</sub> at high temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, a composite cathode based on niobate-titanate would adapt to the reducing conditions of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis in an oxide-ion conducting solid-oxide electrolyzer. The niobate-titanate solid solution can be partially electrochemically reduced (Ti<sup>4+</sup> → Ti<sup>3+</sup> and Nb<sup>5+</sup> → Nb<sup>4+</sup>) at applied potentials and the active Ti<sup>3+</sup> or Nb<sup>4+</sup> can act as a catalytic active site to further improve cathode performances with favorable kinetics in addition to significantly improving the electronic conductivity due to the high concentration of Ti<sup>3+</sup> or Nb<sup>4+</sup> in the B-sites.</p><p>In a solid-oxide electrolyzer, the insufficient adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> is always the limitation at high temperature, which leads to the local starvation of CO<sub>2</sub> at the cathode, restricting the cathode performance and current efficiency because linear CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the absence of polarity do not easily chemically adsorb and activate, especially at high temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In general, the local starvation of CO<sub>2</sub> primarily leads to large electrode polarizations and low current efficiencies for CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis at high temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our previous report, efficient CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis was demonstrated in an oxide-ion conducting solid-oxide electrolyzer with a cathode based on La<sub>0.2</sub>Sr<sub>0.8</sub>TiO<sub>3.1</sub> and promising electrode polarizations have been achieved under a series of external voltage loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, mass transfer limitation, especially the insufficient adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, was observed at the cathode and the current efficiency for the production of CO was only approximately 36%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the defect sites with oxygen vacancies on the surface of solid-oxide materials provide promising possibilities for the chemical adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> because these defects may act as host sites to accommodate linear CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, which is expected to significantly increase the onset temperature of the chemical desorption of CO<sub>2</sub> and benefit the solid-oxide electrolyzer cathode with a certain amount of oxygen vacancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, the chemically adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are expected to be strongly activated on these vacancy-related defect sites and be favorable for electrochemical reduction at high temperatures.</p><p>In this study, redox-active Mn or Cr is introduced into the B-site lattice of Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.9</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>3.00</sub> (STNO) to create oxygen vacancies <italic>in situ</italic> for high-temperature CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis. The <italic>in situ</italic> formed oxygen vacancy is expected to not only chemically accommodate CO<sub>2</sub> molecules but also activate the electrode by enhancing the oxide-ion conductivity. The electrical properties, including the electronic conductivity, oxide-ion conductivity and n-type metallic behavior, have been investigated. The chemical desorption of CO<sub>2</sub> of the Mn-doped STNO is examined. Direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis with a cathode based on Mn- or Cr-doped STNO is performed in an oxide-ion conducting solid-oxide electrolyzer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All of the chemicals (99.9%) were purchased from SINOPHARM Chemical Reagent Co.

Appropriate amounts of SrCO<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> powders were mixed together and ball-milled for 15 min in acetone. The dried powders were pressed into pellets and fired at 1300°C for 10 h in air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

(La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>0.95</sub>MnO<sub>3−δ</sub> (LSMO) was also synthesized using the above method by mixing stoichiometric amounts of La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SrCO<sub>3</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub> with a heat-treatment temperature of 1100°C for 10 h in air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

The phase formations of the STNO, STNMO, STNCO, LSMO and SDC powders were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, 2θ = 3°·min<sup>−1</sup>, D/MAX2500V, Rigaku Corporation, Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis with selected area diffraction was performed to examine the oxidized and reduced STNO, STNMO and STNCO powders with a JEM-2100F field-emission transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV. The specific surface area of the oxidized STNO and STNMO powders was tested using the brunauer-emmett-teller (BET) method (low temperature adsorption of nitrogen, Quadrasorbevo, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 to analyze the surface of the oxidized and reduced STNO, STNMO and STNCO powders. The binding energies were calibrated to the C<sub>1s</sub> peak at 284.6 eV. TGA testing of the STNO, STNMO and STNCO samples was conducted using a thermal analyzer at 10°C·min<sup>−1</sup> in various atmospheres (STA449F3, NETZSCH).</p><p>Approximately 2.5 g of the STNO, STNMO and STNCO powders was pressed into bars and sintered at 1300°C for 10 h in air for the conductivity tests. Before the conductivity tests, the STNO, STNMO and STNCO bars were reduced at 1400°C for 10 h in 5%H<sub>2</sub>/Ar. The DC four-terminal method was used for the conductivity test in a reducing atmosphere (5% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar). The temperature ranged from 400 to 800°C at a rate of 3°C·min<sup>−1</sup>. The conductivity was recorded with an online system with a time step of 10 s. The conductivity was recorded as a function of temperature from 400 to 800°C at the beginning and then as a function of the oxygen partial pressure (<italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub>) from 10<sup>−20</sup> to 10<sup>−2</sup> atm. First, the flow rate of 5% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar was controlled at 60 ml·min<sup>−1</sup> throughout the test to maintain the <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> at approximately 10<sup>−20</sup> atm. The air flow was controlled at a rate of 0.5 ml·min<sup>−1</sup> to change the <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> after terminating the input of 5%H<sub>2</sub>/Ar. The total volume of the gas chamber was 12000 ml. The conductivity was recorded at 800°C. The conductivity and <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> were simultaneously measured using an online multi-meter (Keithley 2000, digital multimeter, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA) and an online oxygen sensor (Type 1231, ZrO<sub>2</sub>-based oxygen sensor, Noveltech, Australia), respectively. The testing time per 1 lg<italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> was approximately 1 h below −13 and above −6, which is sufficient to main equilibrium; however, the oxygen partial pressure rapidly changed between −13 and −6 as the oxygen partial pressure was sensitive. The conductivity of the oxidized samples was tested from 400 to 800°C in air. In addition, the ion conductivity of the samples was tested as a function of temperature using the electron-blocking electrode method for the oxidized and reduced states, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The ionic conductivity (σ<sub>ion</sub>) can be calculated using the expression σ<sub>ion</sub> = (1/R<sub>ion</sub>)(L/A), where R<sub>ion</sub> (in Ω) is the resistance obtained from the online multi-meter or the impedance data, L is the thickness of the sample (0.1–0.2 cm in the test) and A is the cross-sectional electrode contact area of the sample (2.0–3.0 cm<sup>2</sup> in the test). The ionic conductivity of YSZ pellets was tested and used as a reference.</p><p>The YSZ electrolyte support with a thickness of 1 mm was prepared by dry-pressing the YSZ powders into a green disk with a diameter of approximately 15 mm followed by sintering at 1550°C (2°C·min<sup>−1</sup>) for 20 h in air. The two surfaces of the electrolyte were mechanically polished and ultrasonically washed in ethanol and distilled water. The slurries of the STNO/SDC, STNMO/SDC or STNCO/SDC cathodes were prepared by milling the STNO, STNMO or STNCO powders with SDC powders at a weight ratio of 65:35 in alpha-terpineol with the appropriate amounts of the cellulose additive. The LSMO and SDC powders were also mixed together at a weight ratio of 65:35 in alpha-terpineol with the appropriate amount of the cellulose additive to prepare the anode slurry. Then, the two types of slurries were coated onto the two sides of the electrolyte covering an approximately 1 cm<sup>2</sup> area and the sample was sintered at 1000°C for 3 h in air. The current collector of the silver paste (SS-8060, Xinluyi, Shanghai, China) was printed on both surfaces of the electrodes. The silver wire (0.4 mm in diameter) was used to form the circuit using conductive adhesive (DAD87, Shanghai Research Institute for Synthetic Resins, Shanghai, China) and treated at 550°C for 0.5 h in air. The symmetric cell was prepared using the same method described above. The AC impedance spectroscopy for the different symmetric cells was studied at the open circuit voltage (OCV) using various H<sub>2</sub> and CO pressures at 800°C using an electrochemical station (IM6, Zahner, Germany). The frequency range was 1 MHz to 100 mHz and the current perturbation was 10 mA. The flow rates of the gases at 20 ml·min<sup>−1</sup> and various hydrogen and CO pressures were controlled by the mass flow meter (D08-3F, Sevenstar, Beijing, China). The electrolysis cells were sealed into a homemade testing jig using ceramic paste (JD-767, Jiudian, Dongguan, China) for the electrochemical test. CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis in the solid-oxide electrolyzers based on the STNO/SDC, STNMO/SDC or STNCO/SDC cathode was performed under various applied voltages at 800°C in CO<sub>2</sub>. The AC impedance spectra and current density as a function of voltage curve (I-V curve) of the electrolysis cell were recorded. The frequency range was 1 MHz to 100 mHz and the voltage perturbation was 10 mV. An online gas chromatograph (GC9790II, Fuli, Zhejiang, China) was used to analyze the CO concentration of the output gas from the electrolyzers. The current efficiency was calculated by dividing the tested value by the theoretical value of CO production calculated using Faraday's law.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 (a) and (b)</xref> present the XRD Rietveld refinement patterns of the oxidized and reduced STNO powders, respectively.

Based on the experimental and calculated results, the phase structure of both the oxidized and reduced samples is consistent with the perovskite structure with a space group of Pm-3m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The crystal cell parameter of the oxidized STNO is 3.9146(8) Å, which is slightly smaller than that of the reduced STNO (i.e., 3.9191(8) Å). The chemical oxidation states of Ti and Nb are +4 and +5 with ionic radii of 0.605 and 0.69 Å, respectively, in the oxidized STNO. By contrast, a portion of the Ti and Nb has been transformed into Ti<sup>3+</sup> (0.67 Å) and Nb<sup>4+</sup> (0.74 Å) in the reduced STNO sample, which may cause the cell parameter expansion, even though oxygen loss is observed after the high-temperature reduction. Nevertheless, no phase transition is observed in the STNO even after the high-temperature treatment in a reducing atmosphere, which confirms the superior redox stability of the niobate-titanate ceramics. As demonstrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 (c) and (d)</xref>, the XRD Rietveld refinement patterns of single-phase STNMO show the successful partial replacement of Ti with Mn at the B-site. The refinement of the oxidized and reduced samples yields χ<sup>2</sup>, wRp and Rp values of 1.196, 5.64% and 4.47% and 1.365, 5.90% and 4.53%, respectively. The cell parameter is 3.9139(4) Å for the oxidized STNMO, which is smaller than that of the oxidized STNO sample due to the smaller ionic radii of Mn<sup>4+</sup> (0.53 Å) in contrast to Ti<sup>4+</sup> and Nb<sup>5+</sup>. However, the cell parameter of the reduced STNMO increases to 3.9187(6) Å due to the partial transformation of Mn<sup>4+</sup>, Nb<sup>5+</sup> and Ti<sup>4+</sup> to Mn<sup>3+</sup> (0.645 Å), Nb<sup>4+</sup> (0.74 Å) and Ti<sup>3+</sup> (0.67 Å), respectively, leading to expansion of the cell parameters in the reduced samples. A similar change is also observed for Cr-doped STNO in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 (e) and (f)</xref>. The refinement results of the oxidized and reduced STNCO yield χ<sup>2</sup>, wRp and Rp values of 1.329, 6.22% and 4.09% and 1.024, 6.40% and 4.37%, respectively. For the oxidized STNCO, the cell parameter is 3.91304(4) Å, which is slightly smaller than that of the oxidized STNO because a small amount of Cr<sup>6+</sup> (0.44 Å) is present in STNCO. However, the cell parameters of the reduced STNCO increase to 3.91461(27) Å because of the transformation of Cr<sup>6+</sup>, Nb<sup>5+</sup> and Ti<sup>4+</sup> to Cr<sup>3+</sup> (0.615 Å), Nb<sup>4+</sup> (0.74 Å) and Ti<sup>3+</sup> (0.67 Å), respectively, leading to the expansion of the cell parameters of the reduced STNCO. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref> presents the XRD patterns of the Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.9−x</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>Cr<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (x = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) powders after calcining in air at 1300°C for 10 h; however, a single-phase material is only achieved with x = 0.1 (Sr<sub>0.95</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>Nb<sub>0.1</sub>Cr<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, STNCO).

According to the fitting results, the Cr<sup>3+</sup>/Cr<sup>6+</sup> ratio is ~45.96:54.04 for oxidized STNCO, which indicates that Cr<sup>6+</sup> is the main chemical state in the oxidized sample. By contrast, Cr<sup>3+</sup> is the main chemical state for reduced STNCO and all the Cr<sup>6+</sup> is reduced to Cr<sup>3+</sup> (576.1, 576.9, 579.2 and 586.1 eV) in a strong reducing atmosphere, as observed in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 (f)</xref>. The XPS data reveals that Cr<sup>6+</sup> is chemically reduced to Cr<sup>3+</sup> by treating the STNCO samples in a reducing atmosphere, which is expected to create oxygen vacancies and the oxygen vacancy concentration is strongly related to the amount of low-valence ions at the B-sites. Thermogravimetry is common employed to analyze oxygen nonstoichiometry.

The conductivity of the reduced STNO sample is higher than that of the reduced STNMO and STNCO, which is most likely due to Mn or Cr doping at the B-sites of STNO. Therefore, the electron is consumed by the hole generated by the combination of the oxygen vacancy and atmospheric oxygen. The conductivities of the reduced STNO, STNMO and STNCO samples are strongly dependent on the <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, as observed in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6 (b), (c) and (d)</xref>. The n-type conductivity rapidly decreases as the <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> increases from 10<sup>−16</sup> to 10<sup>−15</sup> atm, which is due to the conversion of Ti<sup>3+</sup> to Ti<sup>4+</sup> in the gradually decreasing reducing atmosphere at 800°C. However, the conductivity does not change over a wide range of <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, which is most likely due to the rapid change in the <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> in this range and the sample is not in an equilibrium state, which causes an inconsistent change in the conductivity. In addition, a significant decrease in the conductivity is observed for <italic>p</italic>O<sub>2</sub> above 10<sup>−4</sup> atm due to the sufficient oxidation of Ti<sup>3+</sup> to Ti<sup>4+</sup> in the samples and the sample finally transforms into a p-type conductor with a low conductivity at 800°C in air.

The introduction of redox-active Mn or Cr significantly enhances the ionic conductivity of STNMO or STNCO in contrast to STNO due to the creation of charge carriers and oxygen vacancies in the sample.

However, the oxygen vacancy most likely prefers to exist at the grain boundary and further promote the ionic transport in sintered samples. Upon reduction, the STNMO or STNCO sample with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibits significantly improved oxide-ion conductivity, which is approximately 1 order of magnitude higher in a reducing atmosphere at intermediate temperatures.

For the STNO cathode at 800°C, the maximum current density reaches approximately 250 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup> at 2.0 V and the current density based on the STNMO and STNCO cathode greatly improves to approximately 348 and 332 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup> under the same conditions, respectively. Above 1.1 V, the current densities of the STNMO or STNCO composite electrodes increase steeply compared with the STNO composite cathode, which indicates that Mn or Cr doping significantly enhanced the cell performance for CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis based on the STNMO or STNCO cathode. The chemical adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in the STNMO or STNCO composite electrode substantially contributes to the improved cell performances. The enhanced ionic conductivity of STNMO or STNCO is also expected to improve the charge transfer in the composite electrode/YSZ interfaces. To study the electrolysis performance of the solid-oxide electrolyzers with the STNO, STNMO and STNCO cathodes, the cells were operated with the cathodes fed pure CO<sub>2</sub> at 800°C, as shown in <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13 (b)</xref>. The current density with the STNMO cathode reaches approximately 91, 138 and 200 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup> and that based on the STNCO cathode reaches approximately 86, 137 and 192 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup> at 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 V, respectively; these values are much higher than those of the cell with the STNO cathode under the same conditions.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) I-V curves for three types of electrolyzers at 800°C in CO<sub>2</sub>; (b) the performances of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis for the electrolyzer at 800°C in CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep07082_Fig13_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref> presents the <italic>in situ</italic> AC impedance spectra recorded for a series of applied voltages ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 V at 800°C for the STNO, STNMO and STNCO composite cathodes. In general, the R<sub>s</sub> values are stable. However, the R<sub>p</sub> values considerably decrease as the applied voltage increases from 1.0 to 2.0 V. The applied voltage electrochemically reduces the composite cathode and enhances the mixed conductivity, resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the composite electrode. Two semicircles are observed in the impedance spectra (i.e., the high-frequency arcs (R<sub>1</sub>) and low-frequency arcs (R<sub>2</sub>)). At a high frequency, R<sub>1</sub> of the solid-oxide electrolyzers with cathodes based on bare STNO decreases to approximately 0.40 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup>. By contrast, R<sub>1</sub> for the cell with the STNMO cathode decreases to approximately 0.20 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> and is further enhanced under high applied potentials. The R<sub>1</sub> value for the cell with the STNCO cathode also decreases to approximately 0.22 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> at 2.0 V. R<sub>1</sub> is representative of the charge transfer at high frequency and the improved R<sub>1</sub> indicates that the increased oxide-ion conductivity of STNMO or STNCO significantly improves the charge transfer. At a low frequency, the mass transfer, R<sub>2</sub>, dominates the electrode process of the solid-oxide electrolyzers due to the dissociative adsorption, gas conversion and species transfer at the three-phase boundary. R<sub>2</sub> for the cell based on the STNO cathode substantially improves from 3.59 to 1.05 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> for applied voltages of 1.0 to 2.0 V, suggesting improved gas conversion kinetics at high voltages. By contrast, R<sub>2</sub> for the cell based on the STNMO cathode significantly decreases to 2.47 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> at low voltages and is further enhanced to 0.51 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> at high voltages (the R<sub>2</sub> for an electrolyzer based on a STNCO cathode is significantly reduced from 2.54 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.0 V to 0.46 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> at 2.0 V), which demonstrates the significantly improved mass transfer due to the chemical adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in the composite cathode. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S7 (a)</xref> presents the <italic>in situ</italic> AC impedance spectra for the electrolyzers based on the STNMO cathode under various CO<sub>2</sub> flow rates at 1.4 V. The R<sub>s</sub> value is stable at 1.4 V; therefore, it is set to 0 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> in the figure. The low-frequency process, R<sub>2</sub>, is strongly related to the flow rates of CO<sub>2</sub>; R<sub>2</sub> decreases with increasing flow rates of CO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, an equivalent circuit is used for the impedance spectra in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figs. S7 (b, c and d)</xref>. The results indicate that R<sub>2</sub> decreases from 1.48 to 1.32 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> for flow rates of CO<sub>2</sub> ranging from 10 to 30 ml·min<sup>−1</sup>, which confirms the relationship between the gaseous mass transfer and the flow rates of CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., the polarization performance is improved by increasing the mass flow of CO<sub>2</sub> through the cathode).<fig id="Fig14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>In situ</italic> AC impedance plots for electrolyzers based on (a, b) STNO, (c, d) STNMO and (e, f) STNCO at various voltages with the flow of CO<sub>2</sub> at 800°C.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep07082_Fig14_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> shows the rate of CO production and the current efficiency of the electrolyzers with cathodes based on STNO, STNMO and STNCO for CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis at various applied voltages in pure CO<sub>2</sub>.

As observed in <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15 (b)</xref>, for the STNO cathode, the maximum current efficiencies are approximately 70% in a flow of CO<sub>2</sub> at 800°C. By contrast, the maximum current efficiencies with the STNMO or STNCO cathodes increase by approximately 82% under the same conditions. Therefore, the solid-oxide electrolyzers based on the STNMO or STNCO cathodes exhibit better performance than those based on the STNO cathode. To validate the short-term stability, direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis was performed at a fixed voltage of 1.6 V at 800°C for 24 h with pure CO<sub>2</sub> flowing over the cathode. As observed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figs. S8 (a) and S9 (a)</xref>, only a slight decrease in the current density occurs within the first few hours.

In addition, SEM and EDS mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figs. S8 (b) and S9 (b)</xref>) were employed to analyze the cathode surface after short-term operation for high-temperature CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis.

No other phases except for STNMO, STNCO, SDC and YSZ are present before and after the CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis test at 800°C.

The XRD, XPS and TEM results reveal lattice expansion in the Mn- or Cr-doped samples. In addition, the TGA results indicate that the <italic>in situ</italic> generated oxygen vacancies due to the reduction of Mn or Cr are responsible for the remarkable chemical adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> at high temperatures. With Mn or Cr doping, the ion conductivities exhibit a robust enhancement; however, the electronic conductivity is significantly decreased. In addition to the promising electrode polarization based on the Mn- or Cr-doped electrodes, the current efficiencies of approximately 80% are notably improved by Mn- or Cr-doped electrodes for direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis. Furthermore, the electrodes based on the Mn- or Cr-doped cathodes exhibit good stability for direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis, which indicates that both cathode types can be used as excellent cathodes for oxide-ion conducting solid-oxide electrolyzers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21303037), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2013M53150) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2012HGZY0001).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>J.Z. conducted the experiments.
