With the shipping industry contributing to a whopping 3.3% in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the International Maritime Organization has adopted short-term measures to reduce the carbon intensity of all ships by 50% by 2050. One of the means to achieve this ambitious target is the utilisation of propulsion systems powered by sustainable energy. This review paper summarises the current state of the adoption of renewable energy and alternative fuels used for ship propulsion. Special focus is given to the means of these alternative energies in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and Goal 13 (Climate Action). A state-of-the-art for various ships powered by renewable energy and alternative fuels is investigated and their technologies for mitigating carbon emissions are described. The cost for each technology found in the literature is summarised and the pros and cons of each technology are studied.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Renewable energy</kwd><kwd>Alternative fuels</kwd><kwd>Green shipping</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>UN Sustainable Development Goals</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">R-MOE-E103-F010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tay</surname><given-names>Zhi Yung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/43621_2023_Article_132.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>CO<sub>2</sub> emission trends</title><p id="Par32">1.12 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) were released by ocean-going vessels in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This value was equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from over 205 million cars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, international shipping contributed to around 3.3% of global annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions calculated in the third greenhouse study by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since global trade is constantly growing, IMO also predicted that the emissions from international shipping could grow between 50 and 250% by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Based on the data found on IEAâs website that track the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from international shipping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the emission reduction was not on track with the IMOâs goal.

With an estimated emission of around 1,056 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2018, the maritime industry itself was responsible for 2.89% of global GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, with the onset of new renewable technologies and alternative fuels, the emissions from the maritime industry are expected to be cut down significantly. The industrial revolution for ship propulsion led to innovative technologies such as steamships and the introduction of coal, followed by new generation ships powered by oil. The 4<sup>th</sup> industrial revolution for ship propulsion will see the use of clean energy in the evolution and growth of the shipping industry. Currently, thanks to the mission set by IMO, ships using heavy fuel oil (HFO) that produce GHG such as Sulphur Oxides (SO<sub>x</sub>) and Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) were required to reduce their sulphur content to 0.5% or less in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, stricter measures were put in place in Emission Control Areas (ECA) such as the North Sea and the coast of the United States, designated under the MARPOL Annex V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Technology has also evolved, and shipping companies are considering various methods to achieve the intended zero emissions in their ships, such as using electric propulsion ships loaded with batteries, and next-generation marine fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia and biofuel. Furthermore, the use of wind and solar power is also being considered as a hybrid propulsion system integrated with conventional diesel-powered vessels to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions.</p><p id="Par35">According to a report by International Energy Agency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the current policy framework estimates that low- and zero-carbon fuels are projected to make up roughly 2% of total energy consumption in international shipping in 2030 and 5% in 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This falls severely short of the 15% in 2030 and 83% in 2050 set in the Net Zero Scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To reduce emissions, other renewable energy technologies need to be implemented such as the technology of using ammonia as the fuel source for international shipping, which is the main low-carbon fuel that is projected to reduce emissions in the Net Zero Emissions Scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].â¯The various initiatives to decarbonise the shipping industry in alignment with the UN SDGs are provided in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Sea transportation and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</title><p id="Par36">The shipping industry and research community have been actively seeking means to reduce GHG emissions since the initial strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions from ships was adopted by IMO in 2018.

The articles suggested that LNG must be combined with various efficiency measures to meet the 50% climate target whereas wind assistance presents a strong potential to reduce fuel consumption.</p><p id="Par37">While numerous review articles touched on the utilization of RE and AF in the maritime industry from the techno-economical, fuel efficiencies, policies etc. points of view, this review article is motivated by the role the maritime industry could play in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030 via the use of RE and AF. Set up in 2015 and adopted by the UN Member State, the UN SGDs are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a âshared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the futureâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The IMO as part of the UN family is actively working towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the associated SDGs. The IMO has committed to reducing GHG from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to the 2008 level, with a vision to phase GHG out entirely in this century. Recognizing the fact that around 90% of traded goods are carried by sea transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], there is no doubt that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development could only be achieved with sustainable sea transportation.</p><p id="Par38">The IMO has taken steps towards raising awareness of the UN SDGs in the maritime industry looking to further cooperation and partnership building to help implement the 2030 Agenda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

The utilization of RE and AF as the power sources for sea transportation as a means to tackle climate change (SDG13) is then outlined in Chapter 4. This is followed by a review of how these alternative sources of energy could be used to achieve SDG7, SDG9 and SGD13.

Although this number is relatively small compared to other sectors, such as land transport (i.e., road freight vehicle, passenger vehicle and rail in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)â76.67%, and comparable to aviationâ11.14% (note that these values are not plotted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> but calculated directly from the data obtained from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]), the continuing growth of sea-borne goods transportation could result in a surge of global GHG emissions by 50% by 2050 if no initiatives are taken to mitigate the GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The shipping industry has been looking into RE and AF-powered propulsion systems as a means to achieve this goal. Renewable energies such as wind and solar produce power without releasing harmful GHGs like CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. As part of a global energy future, clean energy is important for the environment to reduce the risk of environmental disasters, such as fuel spills and natural gas leaks arising from the traditional use of hydrocarbon fuel. On the other hand, AFâany fuels that are not petroleum basedâsuch as liquified natural gas (LNG), hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels and methanol could play a significant role in mitigating carbon and other GHG emissions. Note that although it is possible to produce 100% clean ammonia and hydrogen from renewables, also known as green ammonia and green hydrogen respectively, these two fuels are classified as AF in this paper as they can also be produced from non-renewables and thus produces CO<sub>2</sub> and GHG emission in the production process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Carbon emissions from various means of transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43621_2023_132_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par41">In this section, the state-of-the-art technology review of the currently available RE and AF-powered shipping vessels will focus on the various types of technologies, their carbon and GHG emission, pros and cons as well as some examples of existing and conceptual designs to provide a background for facilitating the discussion in Sect.Â <xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">3.7</xref>.

Some of these REs have achieved a high maturity level, with some being adopted in the existing vessel and new-built vessels.

The Flettner rotor can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and achieve fuel reduction by up to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] whereas the fuel consumption of UT Challenger using the hard wing sail technology could be reduced by 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

A case study was done by a team of researchers in Sweden where they considered a hybrid solar powerâPEM fuel cell and diesel generator propulsion system for a cruise ship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. The study compared the cost of a cruise ship relying 100% on diesel generators and the hybrid RE system.

However, considering the fact that the PEM fuel cell system for the cruise ship is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 4.39% yearly which approximates 902,364 kWh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>], this presents an attractive alternative. While the cost for other AFs, i.e., biodiesel, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia fuel cells are relatively higher as compared to their fossil fuel counterparts, the prices are expected to decrease with the increase in the maturity level of the AF technology.

The cost of solar PV panels is currently at an attractive price between $2.60 to $3.20 per watt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. A report by Thandasherry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] that compared the CAPEX and OPEX between the solar-powered vessel and diesel-power vessel showed that in the long run over a life cycle of 20Â years, the solar power alternative can save at least three times the total cost compared to the traditional diesel-powered option.</p><p id="Par103">The CAPEX for RE and AF-powered vessel is usually higher than the vessel running on fossil fuels, due to the cost of the propulsion system and special equipment needed to accommodate these RE and AF such as specialized tanks. However, the OPEX is expected to reduce in the long run. E.g., while the CAPEX for a nuclear-powered vessel could be 16.5 times higher than a conventional diesel vessel, the OPEX of the former is half of that of the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The overall cost analysis shows the total cost of a nuclear-powered vessel will be lower than the diesel vessel after the 8<sup>th</sup> year. This makes the nuclear-powered propulsion systems a promising candidate for decarbonizing ships considering the shipping industry has to phase out fossil fuel eventually to achieve the CO<sub>2</sub> emission set by IMO, i.e., 50% CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by 2050 and eventually phase out by 2100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>SDG 9: build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation</title><p id="Par104">Government spending on energy research and development is on an increasing trend as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> where the spending grew by 3% with robust expansion in Europe and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>].

The state-of-the-art of RE, i.e., solar-, wind- and nuclear-powered propulsion technology was first reviewed followed by the AF, i.e., LNG, hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels and methanol fuel-powered vessels. The pros and cons of these RE technologies and AF were also compared. While wind and solar energy could not yet be used to power large commercial vessels fully, wind-assisted vessels could reduce fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions significantly (20% for Flettner rotor, 50% for hard wing sail and 20% for kite technology). Nuclear energy is currently used mostly in navy vessels and icebreakers but has a huge advantage to being used in commercial vessels as it does not require frequent refuelling and is commercially attractive in the OPEX in the long term. The comparisons for AFs showed that the LNG performs better in most aspects except in terms of GHG emissions, where ammonia and hydrogen are the best options. The cost of ammonia and hydrogen is however too high compared to their AF counterparts.</p><p id="Par115">The impacts of adopting sustainable propulsion systems in ships in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals were presented. Three UN SDGs were targeted, i.e., <italic>SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all</italic>, <italic>SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialisation</italic> an<italic>d foster innovation</italic> and <italic>SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.</italic> For SDG 7, it was demonstrated that the cost for LNG and hybrid propulsion systems between RE/AF with diesel engines could be attractive to make such technologies feasible for adoption. Sustainable energy propulsion, in particular, LNG fuel has pushed for new infrastructure to the maritime green transition, and this has revolutionised the supply chain to ensure sufficient, sustainable and affordable AF for the maritime industry in line with SDG9. Last but not least, the RE and AF have a direct impact towards achieving SDG 13 in reducing carbon and GHG emissions, thereby playing an important role in mitigating the impact of climate change.</p><p id="Par116">The IMO has created an SDGs Strategy, which calls for the strengthening of partnerships in the implementation of the SDGs. This has seen a surge in collaboration between various stakeholders such as academia, industries, government agencies and classification societies in research and technology on RE and AF. Government agencies have taken steps to support member states in implementing the SDGs in the maritime industry, with a trend of increasing government spending on energy research since 2016. E.g., the Maritime SDG Accelerator under the Danish Maritime Business Association and UN Development Program (UNDP) was introduced to enable the acceleration of sustainable innovation and business development delivering on the SDG targets. The Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint has set a goal for all domestic harbour craft in the Singapore Sea to operate on low-carbon energy solutions by 2030 and to be fully powered by electric propulsion and net zero fuels by 2050, aligning with Singapore's commitments under the UN SDGs. The decarbonisation of the maritime industry is an ongoing effort and the current initiatives undertaken by various stakeholders in adopting RE and AF in achieving the UN SDGS are encouraging and promising. The continuous concerted effort from the stakeholders with the aim to achieve UN SGDs will ensure a more sustainable future free of poverty and all people enjoy peace and prosperity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to thank Miss Kesha Martiny D/O Yagasundaram forÂ compilation of data.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Zhi Yung Tay: Conceptualization, writingâoriginal draft preparation, writingâreview and editing, visualisation, supervision
