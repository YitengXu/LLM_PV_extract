We report a multimodal host–guest complexation strategy to overcome this challenge using a crown ether, dibenzo-21-crown-7, which acts as a vehicle that assembles at the interface and delivers Cs<sup>+</sup> ions into the interior while modulating the material. This provides a local gradient of doping at the nanoscale that assists in photoinduced charge separation while passivating surface and bulk defects, stabilizing the perovskite phase through a synergistic effect of the host, guest, and host–guest complex. The resulting solar cells show power conversion efficiencies exceeding 24% and enhanced operational stability, maintaining over 95% of their performance without encapsulation for 500 h under continuous operation. Moreover, the host contributes to binding lead ions, reducing their environmental impact. This supramolecular strategy illustrates the broad implications of host–guest chemistry in photovoltaics.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">It remains a challenge to achieve a balance between performance and stability, as well as addressing the environmental impact of perovskite solar cells.

They nevertheless still suffer from poor operational stability and degradation under ambient conditions, while presenting a potential negative environmental impact from the toxic lead component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the performance is still limited by defects and impurities that enhance non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Conventional passivation is an effective strategy to remove defects from the surface of films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, yet a number of defects remain in the bulk and it is vital to mitigate both types of defects. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) and FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-rich perovskites are particularly preferred for photovoltaic applications due to their superior optoelectronic properties and thermal stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the photoactive black phase (3C, α) readily transforms to the undesired wide-bandgap (2H, δ) phase under ambient conditions. Moreover, several polytypes (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) can be formed, as evidenced both experimentally and theoretically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, with the δ polytype being the most thermodynamically stable at ambient temperature (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). To address the thermodynamic instability of α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, it has been previously shown that using alkali metal cations could be an effective strategy to stabilize the black phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, this bulk approach results in homogenous doping that comes at the expense of increasing the bandgap and hampering the formation of high-quality films without addressing the detrimental lead impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we introduce an unprecedented concept of multimodal host–guest-complexation of dopants to simultaneously modulate the surface and bulk composition of perovskite films through a synergistic effect of the host, guest, and the host–guest complex, which we demonstrate for the case of Cs<sup>+</sup> metal ions. The polar solvents that are commonly used (e.g., water, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc.) for dissolving metal halide salts could dissolve or damage the perovskite film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This prevents the use of these solvents to dissolve metal halide salts for the treatment of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based perovskites. Crown ethers are known to serve as vehicles for different ions, for example in phase-transfer catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, forming host–guest complexes via ion–dipole interactions between the oxygen atoms of the macrocycle and the metal cation, with remarkable selectivity for certain alkali metal ions due to the complementary size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We exploit this key property of crown ethers and their molecular assemblies to infuse Cs<sup>+</sup> ions onto the perovskite film without damaging them, by dissolving the complex in an orthogonal non-polar solvent (e.g., chlorobenzene). We have employed dibenzo-21-crown-7 (DB21C7) as a proof of concept due to its strong affinity for Cs<sup>+</sup> ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, forming a well-defined host–guest complex (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This complex is soluble in chlorobenzene, which is compatible with the perovskite solution-processing. This strategy was found to substantially decrease defects and improve the morphology of perovskite films without significant change in the optoelectronic properties, resulting in high performance and stability. The synergistic effect of the host, guest, and their complex enables simultaneous passivation of the surface and bulk defects, while reducing the environmental impact of lead.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Effect of crown-ether-mediated interfacial Cs doping on the properties of perovskite films.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Molecular structure of the CsI–DB21C7 complex. <bold>b</bold> Schematic representation of the gradient and homogeneous Cs doping of perovskite films.

The control films were based on FAPbI<sub>3</sub> or a FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-rich composition of (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.97</sub>(MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.03</sub> unless otherwise noted. The synthesis of the CsI–DB21C7 complex is detailed in the Methods section and its complexation by cesium cations was subsequently verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). An additional annealing step was then carried out to promote the infusion of Cs<sup>+</sup> into the bulk of the perovskite film, to form a gradient-doped structure, which increases stability without compromising the optimal optoelectronic properties, unlike homogeneous doping (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The treatment conditions (i.e., concentration, annealing temperature, annealing duration, and counter ion) were optimized (as detailed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) and samples with the optimized condition were studied further, labeled as target below.</p><p id="Par6">The surface composition of the perovskite films was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

This confirms that Cs<sup>+</sup> has been successfully transferred to the target perovskite film. Moreover, the XPS spectra in the Pb 4<italic>f</italic> level range (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) reveal two main peaks associated with Pb 4<italic>f</italic><sub>7/2</sub> and Pb 4<italic>f</italic><sub>5/2</sub> at 138.5 and 143.3 eV, respectively, attributed to Pb–I species, along with two smaller peaks located at 136.6 and 141.6 eV that arise from the presence of metallic Pb. The metallic Pb peak vanishes in the treated film, which suggests the host crown binds to the undercoordinated Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions which are responsible for the formation of metallic Pb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This would greatly benefit the operational stability of the PSCs which suffer severely from the presence of elemental Pb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

In the attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>), the shift of the characteristic C–O stretching vibration peaks of DB21C7 after treatment of the perovskite is consistent with the interaction between the crown ether and Pb<sup>2+</sup> in the perovskite phase.</p><p id="Par7">The morphology of the perovskite surface was then analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). The target Cs-doped perovskite film shows larger grain sizes compared to the reference, with the appearance of needle-like structures and fewer grain boundaries due to increase of the size of the grains upon treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This could be the result of preferential binding of the DB21C7 at the boundaries, similarly to other molecular modulators that contribute to reducing grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Elemental mapping of the treated perovskite films by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) further suggests that the needle-like structures contain carbon and Cs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>), and are thus likely to be the CsI–DB21C7 complex, in accordance with the XPS analysis.</p><p id="Par8">In addition to these structural changes, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) demonstrate that the electronic structure at the surface of the treated perovskite film differs from that of the control samples. The target Cs-doped perovskite surface exhibited a higher and more homogeneous electrochemical potential than that of the control film, in accordance with a decrease in the number of grain boundaries upon treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>). The UPS results also show that the surface band structure has changed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>), since the work function decreases from 4.14 to 3.83 eV, i.e., by 0.31 eV, as determined by a linear extrapolation of the secondary electron cutoff (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>; left). This change is consistent with the shift of the surface potential probed by KPFM. Moreover, the logarithmic extrapolation of the leading edge (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>; right) provides a value of 1.45 eV for the valence band maximum (VBM) of the control perovskite and 1.71 eV for the treated perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The VBM of the treated sample surface is slightly larger than the bulk bandgap of 1.56 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which is an indication of a possible bandgap widening at the perovskite surface due to Cs incorporation upon treatment. Such surface bandgap widening can be helpful in suppressing interface recombination, and the corresponding structural origin of these interfacial changes is further investigated below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Structural properties of perovskite materials</title><p id="Par9">The structural properties of the perovskite films were analyzed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Apart from the perovskite phases, unreacted PbI<sub>2</sub> (<italic>q</italic> = 0.9 Å<sup>−1</sup>) and, in some cases, even hexagonal phases, can be detected on the surface of the control films (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). Conversely, in the treated sample, the PbI<sub>2</sub> peaks almost completely disappear while additional low-q signals appear located at <italic>q</italic> = 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> and below (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>). These low-q signals might be ascribed to new unknown surface species, the CsI–DB21C7 complex. The new peak at <italic>q</italic> = 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> also occurs in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (pXRD; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>) of perovskite films after treatment. Since a broad peak around <italic>q</italic> = 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> has also been observed in the pXRD pattern of CsI–DB21C7 powder, this peak might therefore arise from the formation of crystals of CsI–DB21C7. To verify this hypothesis, we generated a crystal structure of CsI–DB21C7 based on previously reported crown ether crystal structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7d</xref>) and optimized it by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (computational details provided in the Methods). The simulated XRD patterns reveal that the first peak is positioned at <italic>q</italic> = 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>) in good agreement with the experimental observations. Therefore, we propose that the new peak at <italic>q</italic> = 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) corresponds to the CsI–DB21C7 complex, while the three peaks below <italic>q</italic> = 0.5 Å<sup>−1</sup> could arise from slightly different polymorphs, i.e., different complexes in the solid state, which are known to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Structural characterization of perovskite films.</title><p><bold>a</bold>–<bold>b</bold> GIWAXS two-dimensional reciprocal space maps of <bold>a</bold> control sample, <bold>b</bold> treated sample at an incidence angle of 0.12°, probing the surface of the material.

Lower incidence angles imply a smaller probing depth in the material and thus increased surface sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7e</xref>). For the target Cs-doped film, the intensities of the perovskite peaks increase with the probing depth, indicating that the modified surface has a lower perovskite content than the bulk of the material (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In contrast, the control sample shows only a slight increase in the perovskite signal with increasing probing depth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which is much less pronounced than the target sample, indicating a homogeneous perovskite composition. Moreover, much more PbI<sub>2</sub> is found in the control sample than in the treated sample. In the former, there is more PbI<sub>2</sub> near the surface than in the bulk; however, in the latter, the PbI<sub>2</sub> content increases with incident angle in a similar manner to the perovskite signal, indicating a homogeneous distribution throughout the perovskite film, and the total amount is greatly reduced upon surface modification. This is expected to enhance the stability of the Cs-doped perovskite films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The peak intensity of the surface species associated with the CsI–DB21C7 complex remains approximately the same throughout the probed range of incident angles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), in accordance with it being located exclusively on the surface of the film. This is not surprising considering that the complex is too large to diffuse into the perovskite lattice. The X-ray reflectivity (XRR) scans (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7f</xref>) yield an estimated minimum thickness of the surface layer (i.e., crystallite size in the vertical direction) of approximately 15 nm.</p><p id="Par11">The hexagonal 4H phase of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> can also be found near the film surface of some of the control samples, but in none of the target samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a, b</xref>). This might originate from incomplete conversion to the perovskite (α) phase, since the structure of the 4H phase is a combination of δ (face-sharing) and α (corner-sharing) phases, suggesting that the 4H phase could constitute a possible intermediate during the conversion from δ to α phase. The 4H polytype, however, is converted into the α-phase perovskite structure at the Cs-rich surface of the treated samples. To understand the effect of Cs<sup>+</sup> incorporation on the 4H polytype, we calculated the relative energies of the 4H polytype and the α phase as a function of Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>). The calculation reveals that Cs<sup>+</sup> doping with increasing concentrations significantly decreases the stability of the 4H phase as compared to α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, the formation of a Cs-rich surface benefits the stabilization of α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. The formation of a wider-bandgap Cs-substituted perovskite at the interface between the bulk perovskite and the hole transporting material would also be beneficial for the hole extraction and inhibition of charge recombination. Furthermore, with increasing angle of incidence, i.e., increasing penetration depth, the perovskite unit cell parameter increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). This effect is much more pronounced in the target sample, which indicates a smaller unit cell near the surface than in the bulk due to the higher concentration of Cs<sup>+</sup>, which is smaller than FA<sup>+</sup>, corroborating the gradient of incorporation of Cs<sup>+</sup>. The XPS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c, d</xref>) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>) depth profiles further verify the infusion of Cs<sup>+</sup> ions (as detailed in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Elucidation of the Cs doping and passivation at the atomic level</title><p id="Par12">To gain atomic-level insight into the effect of Cs<sup>+</sup> ion-complexed crown ether on hybrid perovskite materials, we performed solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) experiments.

There is no evidence of the signal corresponding to the Cs<sup>+</sup> in the crown ether complex (CsI–DB21C7; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) although, due to its broadness, the intensity of this signal would be far lower.

This indicates that the cuboctahedral cavity is more distorted upon exposure of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film to CsI–DB21C7, which is consistent with the incorporation of Cs<sup>+</sup> ions into the perovskite lattice. For the thin-film sample with gradient Cs doping, ssNMR further confirms the incorporation of Cs<sup>+</sup>.

In addition, the large complexation energy of DB21C7–Pb<sup>2+</sup> (−8.93 eV) strongly suggests that such complexes could form on the surface of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, which would be further beneficial for the suppression of uncoordinated Pb defects.</p><p id="Par15">The dissociation of Cs<sup>+</sup> ions from the crown ether and its incorporation into the perovskite phase are expected to cause changes in the electronic structure of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, which are further analyzed via DFT calculations to assess the benefits of the gradient doping.

Although the compositions are slightly different and we recognize the limitation of the periodic models, the effect of the different doping distributions can nevertheless be inferred. The M1 (1 × 4) model was constructed by replacing an entire 2 × 2 layer of FA<sup>+</sup> by Cs<sup>+</sup>. Similarly, the M2 (2 × 2) model was constructed by replacing 2 FA<sup>+</sup> cations in each of two adjacent layers by Cs<sup>+</sup> ions. Lastly, the M3 (4 × 1) model was constructed by replacing one FA<sup>+</sup> cation by Cs<sup>+</sup> in each of the 4 layers. Models M1 (1 × 4) and M2 (2 × 2) represent inhomogeneous surface treatment of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, which do not show a significant difference in the bandgap (1.28 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8e</xref>) compared to the pure FAPbI<sub>3</sub> (1.32 eV), in accordance with the experimental findings. The compositions represented by models M1–M2 feature an FA-rich and a Cs-rich domain. The band edges are found to be dominated by the Pb and I contributions from the FA-rich region, which remains undistorted, hence maintaining the band gap of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. However, the bandgap of the Cs-rich region is, as demonstrated by the corresponding projected density of states (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8c, d</xref>), larger than that of the FA-rich region, allowing for a more efficient charge extraction and lower recombination. On the contrary, in the case of the more homogeneously Cs-doped model M3 (4 × 1), a significant increase in the bandgap is observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) due to considerable structural distortion (octahedral tilting away from 90° to more orthorhombic environments), which leads to shifts of both the VBM and conduction band minimum (CBM; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8e</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">To investigate potential benefits of Cs<sup>+</sup> incorporation for defect passivation at the atomic level, we performed a DFT study of a FA<sup>+</sup> vacancy-containing surface of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>.

Furthermore, after releasing the Cs<sup>+</sup> ions, the remaining crown ether assemblies also play a passivating role as a modulator of surface defects, further improving the PSC performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This is in accordance with the binding mode previously assessed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Consequently, the synergistic effect of the Cs<sup>+</sup> gradient structure and crown ether surface modulation contribute to the significant improvement of photovoltaic performances through a multimodal host–guest complexation approach, i.e., beneficially affecting both bulk and surface properties. This strategy could also be employed in the delivery of other alkali metal cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which we demonstrate by using Rb<sup>+</sup> ions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>); however, we note that since, unlike Cs<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup> has been shown not to incorporate into bulk perovskites by occupying A cation sites, rather passivation of grain boundary defects by Rb<sup>+</sup>-rich phases is the most likely mechanism in this case, as previously indicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, we further illustrate the generality of the approach by fabricating different perovskite compositions, both Br/MA-based and Br/MA-free FAPbI<sub>3</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>). We note that the perovskite compositions based on excess A-cations (such as FAI) are not the subject of this investigation.

To evaluate the TRPL data we applied a kinetic model described in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

This indicates that the nonradiative recombination channels in perovskite films have been suppressed by the treatment, which was further demonstrated by the increased perovskite emission in the cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>) and decreased ideality factor <italic>n</italic> (from 1.51 to 1.41; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>).

The analysis of performance losses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) shows that a significant improvement in non-radiative losses is observed, decreasing from 20.2% in the control device to 12.6% in the target device, confirming the role of the reduction of non-radiative recombination as the main driver for the performance improvement observed here. Meanwhile, a notable improvement in transport losses (10.7% to 5.2%) is also observed, arising from decreases in series resistance and ideality factor, which are both traced to the suppression of interfacial defects or barriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The suppression of interfacial defects is also relevant to the overall stability of the resulting devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Stability and environmental impact</title><p id="Par21">We investigated the stability (shelf life) of the perovskite films and the corresponding devices by exposing the films to an ambient air environment of 60 ± 10% relative humidity and temperature of 25 ± 1 °C, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–b</xref>). The monthly average humidity during the aging test is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>. The Cs-complex surface treatment was found to significantly enhance the stability under these conditions, as the target perovskite film was stable in air for more than one year (380 days), while the control film degraded completely within 5 days. In addition, we probed the long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated PSCs under one-sun illumination by maximum power point tracking (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The target device exhibited very high photostability, maintaining &gt;95% of its initial PCE over 500 h of illumination, whereas the control device degraded to 80% of initial PCE in the first 300 h. The enhanced ambient and operational stability can be attributed to a lower concentration of defects at the interface between the hole transport material and the perovskite absorber, as well as to fewer impurities (including excess PbI<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and non-perovskite polytypes) on the surface and in the bulk of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, caused by Cs<sup>+</sup> infusion via the host–guest complexation and the corresponding nanostructures. Finally, the devices maintain &gt;90% of their operational stability over 300 h at elevated temperatures of 85 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Under these accelerated aging conditions, the stabilities of the control and treated devices are comparable, which is likely due to the bulk becoming more homogeneous, whereas the surface still retains a local Cs-rich gradient structure as indicated by the elemental mapping (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). Moreover, the capacity for competitive complexation of Pb cations (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) enables lead leakage to be suppressed, which has been probed by immersing the solar cells in water and quantifying the lead content, showing that presence of the crown ether hosts mitigates the detrimental environmental impact of lead (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). This has been shown for the optimal concentrations of the crown ether used in the solar cell fabrication, which is rather low, and increasing this content is likely to further suppress the environmental impact of lead. Treatment with Cs-crown ether complexes therefore provides a versatile approach for the enhancement of performance and stability of perovskite-based devices, while reducing their environmental impact by virtue of multimodal host–guest complexation, suggesting wide-ranging applications.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Stability and enviromental impact.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Ambient stability of the control perovskite film (left) and target perovskite film (right) based on the evolution of the XRD patterns of the perovskite films stored in an ambient environment for various times. <bold>b</bold> The average relative humidity during the aging process in Lausanne, Switzerland. <bold>c</bold> Maximum power point tracking measured with the unencapsulated device under full solar illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in N<sub>2</sub>, 25 °C). <bold>d</bold> Thermal stability of perovskite devices at an elevated temperature of 85 °C. <bold>e</bold> Assessment of lead leakage upon immersing solar cells into water.

The structures of Cs-doped cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> were optimized at DFT level using the PBEsol functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> within the Quantum Espresso suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. To study the effect of different doping models, 2 × 2 × 6 supercells of cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> were used. The model 1 × 4 was constructed by replacing an entire 2 × 2 layer of FA<sup>+</sup> by Cs<sup>+</sup>. Similarly, the model 2 × 2 was constructed by replacing 2 FA<sup>+</sup> cations in 2 layers by Cs<sup>+</sup> ions. Lastly, the model 4 × 1 was constructed by replacing one FA<sup>+</sup> cation by Cs<sup>+</sup> in each of the 4 layers. To study the effect of Cs<sup>+</sup> on defects at the perovskite surface, FAI-terminated slabs of cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> were employed. FA<sup>+</sup> vacancy-containing slab was created by removing one FA<sup>+</sup> from the surface. Cs<sup>+</sup>-treated slab with a FA<sup>+</sup> vacancy was created by filling the FA<sup>+</sup> vacant site by a Cs<sup>+</sup> ion. A vacuum gap of 25 Å was used for all slab structures to prevent interaction of the slab images. A k-point grid of 2 × 2 × 1 (4 × 4 × 1 for post processing analyses) and ultra-soft pseudopotentials for valence core electron interactions with a plane wave basis set of 60 and 420 Ry kinetic energy cutoff for the expansion of the wavefunction and the density, respectively, were employed for both bulk and slab structures. The hybrid PBE0 functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was utilized to calculate band gaps taking also spin orbit coupling (SOC) effects into account, with norm-conserving pseudopotentials of 80 Ry wavefunction cutoff and 320 Ry density cutoff. To compare valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of different configurations, energy levels were aligned with respect to the energy levels of 5<italic>d</italic> orbitals of Pb atoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par38">Further information on research design is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project leading to this application has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant agreements No. 785219, 881603, and 764047.
