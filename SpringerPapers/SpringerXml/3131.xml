In this paper, the high-quality large-size graphene film was first prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method; then, graphene film was transferred to SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate; next, the graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> and graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structures were prepared by the atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition method, which can be achieved by directly growing WS<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub> material on graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate. Finally, the test characterization of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures was performed by AFM, SEM, EDX, Raman and PL spectroscopy to obtain and grasp the morphology and luminescence laws. The test results show that graphene/TMDs vdWs hetero-structures have the very excellent film quality and spectral characteristics. There is the built-in electric field at the interface of graphene/TMDs heterojunction, which can lead to the effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Monolayer WS<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub> material have the strong broadband absorption capabilities, the photo-generated electrons from WS<sub>2</sub> can transfer to the underlying <italic>p</italic>-type graphene when graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structures material is exposed to the light, and the remaining holes can induced the light gate effect, which is contrast to the ordinary semiconductor photoconductors.

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par12">The size of traditional silicon-based metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors become smaller with increase in the chip integration, and the preparation processes of device become much more complicated, so researchers have begun to focus on the ultra-thin hetero-structure-based optoelectronics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The two-dimensional (2D) hetero-structures can be combined by the weak van der Waals (vdWs) force between the layers and the strong covalent bond of the layer. The layers can be separated by breaking the weak van der Waals bond and then easily transferred to other substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The formation of new atomic-level 2D vdWs hetero-structures can be achieved by stacking the different 2D materials, and the synergistic effects of 2D hetero-structures become very important. Meanwhile, there are charge rearrangements and structural changes between adjacent crystals in hetero-structures, which can be regulated by adjusting the relative orientation of each element material. The different hetero-structures can not only maintain the properties of single material, but also produce the new physical characteristics under the synergy effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The vdWs hetero-structures are the material guarantee for exploring the new physical phenomena and laws, which can provide more possibilities for the nano-electronic devices with excellent photoelectric properties.</p><p id="Par13">Since the 2D-crystalline materials have the strong interactions against a light, they have attracted extensive attentions as photosensitive materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Graphene is the atomic-level 2D material with excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties, which has the wide application in the optoelectronics field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the defect of zero band gap limits the application and development of graphene. The structure of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) materials is similar to that of graphene, and its band gap width changes with the layer number and thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The TMDs and graphene materials with complementary advantages are superimposed together, which can promote the application of graphene and TMDs materials in the photoelectric detection field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The high mobility of graphene can ensure the rapid response of device, and the Van Hof singularity in electronic state density of TMDs materials ensures the strong interaction between light and materials, which can effectively enhance the absorption of light and the generation of electron–hole pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The 2D hetero-structures were widely used in the new electronic and optoelectronic devices, which is due to its transport characteristics of charge tunneling or charge accumulation, flexible energy band engineering and unique interlayer exciton characteristics. Therefore, the interlayer synergy interaction between graphene and TMDs materials can effectively control the band structure, magnetic properties and the exciton properties of hetero-structures. The graphene/TMDs hetero-structures have the high photosensitivity and light response performance, which is due to the strong quantum confinement effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. At present, there are the few studies on the controllable preparation methods of the large-area, large-size and high-quality graphene/TMDs hetero-structures. And the preparation processes of hetero-structures are complicated, which is still a big challenge in terms of repeatability and controllability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, it is difficult to understand and grasp the spectral characteristics of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures, which largely hinder the application of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures in future optoelectronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In this paper, graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> and graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structures were composed of three kinds of semiconductor materials with different dielectric constant, band gap width and absorption coefficient. The 2D materials were directly grown on the single crystal graphene film of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate to form the graphene/TMDs hetero-structures, which can ensure the clean interface and atomic level transition of hetero-structures. The structure of graphene, MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> can be analyzed by the AFM, SEM, EDX, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy to master the spectral characteristics of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures, which can be used to prepare the high-speed electron mobility transistors (HEMT) and photoelectric detectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and Movement of Graphene</title><p id="Par15">The large-area, high-quality graphene film was prepared by CVD system, which is composed of the tube furnace, gas mixing system and vacuum machine.

Subsequently, it was dried by blowing argon gas. Finally, it was inserted in the middle of the quartz tube, and we installed the system and corrected the air pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The specific conditions of the annealing processes at stage 1 were the following: the annealing temperature, time and the flow rate of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas were 1000 °C, 20 min and 30 sccm, respectively. At this time, the surface of copper foil would form the large area single crystal domain, and H<sub>2</sub> gas can reduce copper oxide, which can obtain the high-purity copper substrate. The growth temperature remains constant while entering stage 2, the flow rate of H<sub>2</sub> gas was adjusted to 10 sccm, meanwhile 35 sccm methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) gas was also introduced, the growth time and growth pressure were, respectively, maintained for 10 min and 1.08 Torr, and the growth rate of graphene was approximately 16 μm/s in our CVD experiment, which would ensure the preparation of relatively uniform monolayer graphene film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Finally, the tube furnace was quenched to room temperature at a certain rate, which can avoid damaging the surface of substrate.</p><p id="Par17">The following describes the transfer-specific processes of monolayer graphene material to SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. First, PMMA solution with a mass fraction of 4% was uniformly spin-coated on the surface of monolayer graphene material with a size of 1 cm × 1 cm, the rotation speed and time were 3000 R/min and 1 min, respectively. Next, the copper foil substrate was etched by the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution with a mass fraction of 3%, and the treatment time was 3–4 h. Then, the PMMA/graphene by the glass slide was rinsed repeatedly in deionized water 2–3 times, and PMMA/graphene was removed to the 50 °C constant temperature table by SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate, which can remove the water vapor between monolayer graphene material and SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate, and the monolayer graphene material can be better attached to SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate. In this step, SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate with a size of 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol and water for 15 min, and the surface of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate is very clean and uniform, which is conducive to the growth of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures. Finally, PMMA/graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si was put in acetone solution for 3–4 h to dissolve PMMA and repeatedly wash it with alcohol and deionized water to ensure that monolayer graphene film can be transferred to SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Preparation of Graphene/TMDs Hetero-structures</title><p id="Par18">In CVD dual temperature zone tube furnace, the graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate was used for the growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> material. The MoO<sub>3</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub> and sulfur powders were used as the growth molybdenum source, tungsten source and sulfur source, respectively. The high-purity Ar gas was also used to prepare the graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub> and graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structures, respectively. First, the quartz boat with 100 mg sulfur powder was placed at the upstream of tube furnace. Then, 2 mg MoO<sub>3</sub> powder (or WO<sub>3</sub> powder) was filled in another quartz boat, and the graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate was flipped upside down on MoO<sub>3</sub> powder (or WO<sub>3</sub> powder). And then, the quartz boat equipped with the graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate and MoO<sub>3</sub> powder (or WO<sub>3</sub> powder) was inserted into the high temperature area of tube furnace. The heating belt was wound on the quartz tube to heat the sulfur powder, which would ensure that sulfur powder was well controlled and uniformly evaporated, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. Next, the high-purity Ar gas with a flow rate of 50 sccm was used as carrier gas, the evaporation temperature of sulfur powder was controlled at 150 °C, the growth temperature and growth time of MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> were 750 °C, 920 °C and 10 min, respectively.

The specific temperature change diagram is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b. Subsequently, sulfur powder began to sublimate to the sulfur vapor, and the sulfur vapor reaches the high temperature area of tube furnace, which can be driven by Ar gas. It can be fully reacted with MoO<sub>3</sub> and WO<sub>3</sub> powder, and the product was deposited on graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate. Therefore, the growth rate of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures was consistent with that of TMDs materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

First, the surface morphology of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures can be observed by optical microscope, SEM and AFM. The layer number of hetero-structures can be judged according to the different contrast of hetero-structure sample. Then, the spectral characteristics of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures were tested and characterized. The growth morphology, growth pattern and growth mechanism of TMDs materials on graphene surface were analyzed and speculated based on the characterization results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Next, Raman spectroscopy has the advantages of quickness, high efficiency and low destructiveness in terms of characterizing 2D materials. It can directly observe the interaction of electron phonons on the sample surface, which has a very wide range of applications in 2D materials. The layer number and crystal quality of 2D materials can be effectively judged by analyzing the characteristic peak position of Raman spectra, the characteristic peak position wave number difference and other characteristics of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures. Finally, the PL spectra were also an important method for characterizing and analyzing 2D materials. When the bulk material is thinned to monolayer material, the band gap width of TMDs material changes from the indirect band gap semiconductor to the direct band gap semiconductor. Meanwhile, the fluorescence effect was significantly enhanced, and there are the obvious characteristic peaks in the PL spectra. However, if the crystal quality of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures was not high, the characteristic peak intensity of PL spectra would be small even if the sample has few layers or monolayer. Therefore, the layer thickness and crystal quality of sample can also be judged by PL spectra. In addition, the distribution, element type and concentration percentage of graphene/TMDs hetero-structures films can be obtained by FESEM and EDX. Meanwhile, the AFM test was also used to grasp the surface cleanliness, roughness and material thickness of hetero-structures film samples.</p><p id="Par20">Both the PL and Raman spectra were collected by the LabRAM HR Evolution high-resolution Raman spectrometer, which was produced by HORIBA Jobin Yvon (French company) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

The shape of WS<sub>2</sub> was regular and complete, and the thickness was uniform, which is much larger than the size of mechanical peeling sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, since the fluorescence intensity of WS<sub>2</sub> sample is highly uniformly distributed, the triangular monolayer WS<sub>2</sub> film has the higher quality and lower defects. It can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d that the morphology of WS<sub>2</sub> film sample is triangle, and the thickness of WS<sub>2</sub> film is 0.83 nm, which indicates the preparation of monolayer WS<sub>2</sub> film. In addition, SEM was also used to analyze the morphology of WS<sub>2</sub> sample film, and the morphology was the regular triangular with uniform thickness, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e.

When the bulk WS<sub>2</sub> changes to monolayer material, E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub> and A<sub>1g</sub> characteristic peaks appear the blue-shifted and red-shifted, respectively. Therefore, the layer number can be judged by the wave numbers difference between two characteristic peaks, and the wavenumber difference was 65.7 cm<sup>−1</sup>, so the triangular WS<sub>2</sub> grains were monolayer material. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, the strongest luminescence peak was located at 626 nm, and the corresponding band gap was 1.98 eV, which is consistent with the band gap width of monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>. As we all know, the PL intensity of 2D material is related to the crystal quality and layer number. The 2D material has the fewer defect and layer number, and the luminous intensity is higher, which indicates that the crystal quality is better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The variable power characterization can be performed at the nW level to prevent the laser irradiation from damaging the sample. It can be found by observing Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c that the peak position of E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub> plane vibration mode remains basically unchanged with increase in the excitation power, and the A<sub>1g</sub> vibration mode between the planes moves to the short wave number direction. This is because the A<sub>1g</sub> vibration mode has the great relationship with electron concentration, and the increase in electron concentration would lead to the reformation of band gap. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, the PL spectra intensity of WS<sub>2</sub> increases with the laser power increases, and there exists the fluorescence quenching phenomenon, which is due to the reformation of band gap and the interlayer interaction of hetero-structures. At the same time, it can also be found that the local temperature of material did nearly not change with increase in the laser power. This is because WS<sub>2</sub> is the atomic layer-level nanomaterial.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Spectral characterization of WS<sub>2</sub>. <bold>a</bold> Raman spectra at different positions, <bold>b</bold> PL spectra at different positions, <bold>c</bold> power Raman spectra and <bold>d</bold> power PL spectra</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11671_2020_3439_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">The layer number characterization and quality information of graphene material can be obtained by Raman spectroscopy. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, the Raman diffraction spectra of graphene at different positions has the three main characteristic peaks, D peak, G peak and 2D peak, were, respectively, located at 1330 cm<sup>−1</sup>, 1583 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 2674 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The D peak is related to the disorder of graphene lattice structure, and the position of D peak was blue-shifted when graphene material has more lattice defects, which can reflect the defects and impurity content of crystal. The 2D peak is the two-phonon second-order resonance Raman peak, which can indicate the carbon atoms arrangement of graphene material. Besides, the G peak is caused by the E<sub>2g</sub> mode of first Brillouin zone center, the peak height increases almost linearly with the layers number of graphene, and the G peak intensity is related to the doping of graphene to a certain extent. The relative ratio of 2D peak and G peak can be used to roughly determine the layers number of graphene, and the ratio of D peak to G peak would decrease when the defect density is increased. The weak D peak appears in the Raman spectra of graphene when the growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> (or WS<sub>2</sub>) material was completed, which indicates that the graphene domain still maintains the high quality. The 2D peak intensity of exposed graphene area weakened, which is affected by the high-temperature growth process. The full width at half maxima (FWHM) of graphene 2D peak gradually increases with increase in the layers number, and the peak position of 2D peak is blue-shifted, which may be related to the energy band relationship of graphene material. The electronic energy band structure splits with increase in the layers number, and a variety of phonon resonance scattering processes would occur. The exciton peak would be excited by absorbing more energy, which would lead to the blue shift of 2D peak position. The peak intensity of G peak at Point C and E is significantly higher than that of 2D peak. The <italic>I</italic><sub>2D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub> ratio decreases with increase in the thickness, and the transferred graphene in this experiment was not very uniform, which is within the allowable range.

The G peak and 2D peak were, respectively, located at 1581 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 2672 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and the intensity of two characteristic peaks differs greatly.

It can be found that the intensity of E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub> characteristic peak was higher than that of A<sub>1g</sub> characteristic peak intensity, and the E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub> and A<sub>1g</sub> characteristic peaks were located at 349.3 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 417.1 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The Raman spectra 2D and G peaks of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure were, respectively, at 1591.5 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 2680.9 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and the peak position of 2D and G peaks rise compared with pure graphene, which may be related to the effective interlayer coupling of WS<sub>2</sub> nano-sheets and the strain effect generated by the high temperature heating during CVD growth. The Raman spectra of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure material is only the sum of the individual separated WS<sub>2</sub> and graphene spectra, which can confirm the formation of vdWs heterojunction interface. The PL spectra intensity is related to the crystal quality and layer number. Raman spectroscopy focuses on the influence of hetero-structures formation on the vibration modes, and the electronic band structure of TMDs hetero-structures material can be mainly obtained by PL spectra. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b shows the PL spectra of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure at different points. The strongest luminescence peak was located at 624 nm, and the corresponding band gap was 1.99 eV, which is consistent with the band gap width of monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>. The graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure material at different positions has the different intensity and shape of PL spectra, and the crystal quality is not very good. Therefore, the preparation processes of hetero-structure need to be further improved. The PL spectra intensity of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure is weaker than that of WS<sub>2</sub>. This is because the inter-layer coupling of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure changes the exciton fluorescence of hetero-structures region, which would lead to the separation of electron–hole pairs and the reduction in fluorescence. Meanwhile, the peak position shifts when the graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure is formed, and the transfer of charge can cause the shift of Fermi surface, which can make the free excitons change into the charged excitons. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c shows the power Raman spectra of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure. The in-plane phonon mode E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub> characteristic peak and the out-of-plane phonon mode A<sub>1g</sub> characteristic peak were, respectively, at 356 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 418 cm<sup>−1</sup>, where the above characteristic peak is increased with increase in the laser power. The peak position and shape of characteristic peak were uniform within single crystal, and the electronic characteristics of WS<sub>2</sub> on graphene/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate were uniform. The thickness of WS<sub>2</sub> sheet can be determined according to the frequency difference between A<sub>1g</sub> and E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub> characteristic peaks, and the average distance was 62 ± 0.2 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which is consistent with the thickness of monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>.

First, the spectral background rises when wavenumber increases, and the background comes from the PL spectra of WS<sub>2</sub>, which confirms the presence of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure. Next, WS<sub>2</sub> material can suppress the 2D characteristic peak intensity of graphene. Finally, both G peak and 2D peak of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure shift upward compared with the spectra of bare graphene material. Due to the interlayer coupling between graphene and WS<sub>2</sub>, the 2D peak would also shift up, and the mechanical strain also has the impact on the Raman shift of graphene. The enhancement factor (EF) is the ratio of the maximum peak intensity of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure divided by the maximum peak intensity of graphene. The maximum peak intensity of G peak increases from 460 to 830, and the maximum peak intensity of 2D peak increases from 340 to 1460, and the corresponding EF were 1.8 and 4.3, respectively. The D peak signal is significantly enhanced when the graphene/TMDs hetero-structures is formed. Therefore, the <italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub> ratio of monolayer graphene is weaker than that of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure. This is because the extrusion of WS<sub>2</sub> on graphene has the effect on the structure of graphene, which would result in the appearance of a small number of defects. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, the PL intensity of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure is higher than that of bare graphene, which may be related to the effective interlayer coupling and the strain effect. Meanwhile, the maximum intensity of PL spectra is increased from 270 to 1410, and the corresponding EF is 5.23. The intensity enhancement of characteristic peak can be attributed to the coupling of graphene/WS<sub>2</sub> hetero-structure.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Raman spectra and <bold>b</bold> PL spectra characteristics comparison of graphene before and after WS<sub>2</sub> growth</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11671_2020_3439_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">Raman spectroscopy can be used to evaluate the crystal quality and film thickness of 2D materials.

The reason is that the coupling between layers can be enhanced when the two materials are stacked to form the hetero-structure, which would generate the interlayer interaction forces.

The maximum intensity of strongest peak increases from 7450 to 19,320, and the EF of PL spectra are 2.6.
