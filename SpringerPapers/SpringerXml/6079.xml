Here we demonstrate a “quantum ratchet” device that avoids this limitation by inserting a pair of linked states that form a metastable photoelectron trap in the bandgap. It is designed both to reduce non-radiative recombination, and to break the Shockley–Queisser limit by introducing an additional “sequential two photon absorption” (STPA) excitation channel across the bandgap. We realise the quantum ratchet concept with a semiconductor nanostructure. It raises the electron lifetime in the metastable trap by ~10<sup>4</sup>, and gives a STPA channel that increases the photocurrent by a factor of ~50%. This result illustrates a new paradigm for designing ultra-efficient photovoltaic devices.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Intermediate band photovoltaics have the potential to increase traditional solar cell efficiencies by placing an intermediate band energy level between the valence and conduction bands, but they suffer from short carrier lifetimes because of Shockley-Read Hall recombination.

They work by placing an IB level in the bandgap that introduces a parallel excitation channel, allowing the sequential-two-photon-absorption (STPA) of sub-bandgap energy photons. A number of practical implementations based on well-established semiconductor nanostructure fabrication technologies, including quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and superlattices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> have been reported. However, the short IB lifetime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> means they also induce high levels of Shockley-Read-Hall interband recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> that lower the cell voltage.

The upper one (intermediate band, IB) is optically coupled only to the valence band (VB) and the lower one (Ratchet band, RB) is optically coupled only to the conduction band (CB). A rapid irreversible scattering process links the two, so their carrier populations are characterised by the same quasi-Fermi level. In spite of the energy, Δ<italic>E</italic>, lost in the IB ⇒ RB transition, idealised global optimisation models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> predict limiting QR device efficiencies of &gt;46% (Δ<italic>E</italic> ~ 270 meV) at one sun and ~63% at full concentration (Δ<italic>E</italic> = 0).

A test device was designed in order to isolate the photocurrent contribution of the STPA channel experimentally. The bandgap corresponding to the VB ⇒ IB transition (taking place in the 25 nm thick In<sub>0.05</sub> Ga<sub>0.95</sub> As layer adjacent to the QW’s), was designed to be the lowest energy interband transition in the multilayer, so that it could be driven without generating photocarriers anywhere else. In order to optimise the fraction of IB electrons being scattered into the metastable RB state, rapid IB ⇒ RB scattering was facilitated by designing the QW superlattice so that neighbouring wells had confined state energies separated by an optical phonon energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The device was packaged in a bevelled configuration to allow the RB ⇒ CB transition to be driven with p-polarised light, as is required by the dipole selection rules for ISBT’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Using high speed, time resolved STPA photocurrent measurements, we find here that the QR design increases the electron lifetime in the RB state by ~10<sup>4</sup> to ~10 µs.

The VB ⇒ IB transition was resonantly driven with a <italic>λ</italic> = 850 nm, ~150 ps pulse filtered out from an optical fibre supercontinuum source, with a bandwidth of 2.5 nm and a pulse power/energy up to 2.5 W/0.4 nJ. The RB ⇒ CB transition was driven with a bank of tuneable quantum cascade laser (QCL) diodes, giving 6 µm &lt; <italic>λ</italic> &lt; 10 µm pulses ~100 ns long and ~800 µW CW power. This corresponded to a mean pulse power/energy of up to approximately 80 mW/8nJ.</p><p id="Par8">The two pulse trains could be mechanically chopped (at ~465 Hz for the VB ⇒ IB supercontinuum beam and ~535 Hz for the RB ⇒ CB QCL beam) to measure their single photon contribution to the photocurrent with independent lock-in amplifiers. The QCL beam generated no detectable single photon photocurrent, whereas the supercontinuum beam generated a photo current I–V curve with a pronounced low-current plateau in the 0.4–0.8 V bias range, indicative of the QR action (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">In common with IB cell devices based on semiconductor heterostructures the electronic transport in our device is temperature sensitive and so the STPA measurements must be done in a way that avoids artefacts due to sample heating. STPA experiments presented in the literature have used either CW sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, or ones that are chopped at a low fixed frequency, and thermal effects have been shown to give changes in photocurrent at the 10’s % level (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and supplementary material therein). These thermal artefacts are avoidable by modulating the illumination sources at rates that are fast compared with the systems’ thermal time constant. The fact that this has been achieved can be checked by verifying that the STPA signal is independent of the modulation frequencies. One of the unique aspects of the present work is that we used a frequency mixing circuit to drive a third lock-in amplifier at a frequency corresponding to the difference between the modulation frequencies of the two laser beams. This is done in order to isolate the fast contribution to the photocurrent that originates from the STPA excitation process.</p><p id="Par10">In the lower-noise, mechanically chopped experimental configuration, the frequency mixing was achieved with a custom made digital electronic circuit. However, we also checked that the signal was unchanged when we took the experiment to the highest frequency available. This was achieved by mixing the (fixed) 100 kHz modulation frequency of the supercontinuum source with an 80 kHz pulse train from electronically triggered QCL’s in an analogue diode mixer, and lock-in detecting at the ~20 kHz difference frequency. This gave a STPA signal that was the same to within experimental error as the much slower mechanically chopped experiment. However, for technical reasons the mechanically chopped setup gave a better signal-to-noise ratio and was used for all the data presented here. At all times, the STPA signal disappeared when either laser was blocked, and no STPA signals were found with a control device that was grown with a large bandgap layer inserted into the QW superlattice in a way that was designed to block the IB ⇒ RB transport.</p><p id="Par11">The 14 K photocurrent I–V curve (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) shows an almost zero-current plateau on the 0.4–0.8 V bias range, consistent with efficient charge-trapping in the RB state, (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Only samples showing this plateau gave an STPA photocurrent signal and it was only ever non-zero within this bias range. At lower forward biases the field is enough to extract electrons from the RB state into the CB one (as signified by a pronounced increase in the VB ⇒ IB single photon photocurrent at this bias, see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). At higher forward biases, the IB ⇒ RB ratchet is too shallow to scatter the IB electrons quickly enough into the RB state to collect a significant fraction of them before they recombine back into the VB state.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>STPA photocurrent. <bold>a</bold> Filled squares: 14 K photo current–voltage curve for the quantum ratchet device, showing the 0.4–0.8 V current plateau where carriers are effectively trapped in the RB state.

Order of magnitude estimates (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) indicate that at this stage electron space charge accumulation in the RB state would start to generate enough field to flatten the IB ⇒ RB ratchet potential.

All the results reported here were obtained by electronically varying the delay between the pulse trains on a much longer timescale, one that was limited by the 10 µs pulse repetition rate.</p><p id="Par15">The lifetime measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed a decay time that was comparable with the 10 µs laser repetition rate, i.e., a ~10<sup>4</sup> fold enhancement over the approximately nanosecond values typical of interband recombination in direct-gap QW materials. Its bias (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) dependencies both showed an approximately reciprocal relationship with those of the STPA photocurrent, furthering the argument that the lifetime enhancement in the RB state is key to achieving effective two-photon absorption. As the device temperature is raised from 14 to 50 K, (by which time the RB lifetime reduces from ~10 to ~0.8 µs), the time averaged STPA photocurrent has dropped by a factor of ~3 before becoming lost in the measurement noise.

This suggests that the measured lifetimes are limited by a thermally activated process. Estimates of the effects of carrier screening, and band filling (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) suggest that the former flattens out the ratchet potential at carrier densities roughly a decade lower than those when the Fermi energy starts to rise significantly in the RB, so we surmise screening it is the dominant contribution to the saturation effect in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. When the saturation sets in (at ~0.25 nJ/pulse) we estimate a RB occupancy of ~1.3 × 10<sup>11</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, which compares with the ~6 × 10<sup>11</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> needed to completely screen out the ratchet potential (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">At the optimum bias (0.63 V) the STPA channel increases the time-averaged photocurrent by 0.5% of the single photon current generated by the interband pumping alone, (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). However, ISBT lifetimes lie typically in the sub-ps range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, so it is likely that all the STPA photocurrent occurs within the ~100 ns QCL pulse; correcting for the 100:1 duty cycle in the QCL pulse train implies an actual STPA photocurrent that is ~50% of the single photon value.</p><p id="Par18">A quantitative analysis (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) implies a reasonable IB-RB scattering efficiency of ~57%. The low overall power conversion rates are predominantly due to combination of a low (~7.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) optical coupling factor to the RB-CB transition in the present experimental geometry, and to a low escape probability into the CB (~3.9 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) for electrons excited into the upper level of the RB QW. Based on the literature on QW infrared detectors (QWIP’s), both of these can be increased towards unity. A variety of surface patterning techniques have been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> that couple normally incident mid-IR light with efficiencies up to ~90% to the vertically polarised ISBT. The escape probability has been shown to be exponentially dependent on field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and QWIPs routinely achieve values close to 100% by utilising fields that are ~40 times higher than the ~4 × 10<sup>6</sup> Vm<sup>−1</sup> present in the RB region of this test device.</p><p id="Par19">The present design uses a materials system chosen because of its mature growth technology, and it operates with transition energies which are lower that would be needed to beat the SQ limit in practice. Future experiments, with wider bandgap semiconductor materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> would be needed to match the transition energies on the ratchet device to the spectral content of the solar spectrum. At the same time, this would increase the trapping energy for the RB level, to give higher temperature operation.</p><p id="Par20">In conclusion, we believe that this proof-of-principle result, and the dramatic (×10<sup>4</sup>) lifetime enhancements achieved, argue the case for the quantum ratchet concept having an important role in a new family of ultra-efficient PV devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Device design and fabrication</title><p id="Par21">The device was grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on an undoped GaAs substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), chosen to be transparent to the QCL laser beam.

Towards the end of the cascade, the Aluminium fraction in the barriers is increased to 0.7 to increase the electron trapping in the RB state and thereby increase the likelihood of STPA. From the RB state a second, mid-infrared, photon is required to excite the electron into the continuum of intrinsic bulk Al<sub>0.3</sub> Ga<sub>0.7</sub> As to register a photo-current. The threshold energy for this transition was designed at 0.195 eV so as to be attainable with the available quantum cascade laser sources.

In order to be transparent to the mid-IR radiation, both the buffer layer and substrate were nominally undoped GaAs. Both the p- and n-contacts had to be formed on the top of the devices, by exposing the n-type layers for metallisation (In–Ge, 20 nm/Au 200 nm) with a partial etch of the wafer. For the p-type metallisations (Au 5 nm/Zn 10 nm/Au 200 nm) we chose to use a series of ring-shaped Ohmic contacts ranging in diameter from 50–400 µm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The centres of each of the circular mesas were positioned to align with the centre of the mid-IR beam after it had been refracted by the bevelled substrate. A mesa etch was performed to isolate individual devices and bond pads for both the p- and n-contacts were then formed using Ti, 20 nm/Au, 200 nm. In the case of the bond pad for the p-contacts, an insulating layer of 200 nm silicon nitride was deposited first to prevent shorting of the device (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Device structure. <bold>a</bold> Photolithography schematic used for device fabrication.

For this reason, the wafer was cleaved along a line ~300 µm away from the ring mesas (i.e., a distance roughly equal to the substrate thickness) and a 45 °C chamfered edge was polished into the rear side of the substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The high (<italic>n</italic> = 3.3) refractive index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> of the substrate means that on entering the sample from the reverse, the refracted beam travels at an angle close to 45 °C through the substrate and impinges on the QW’s in the device at this angle.
