However, there is currently a strong debate whether fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) might be the better solution. The question arises as to how a fleet of FCEV influences the operating cost, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and primary energy demand in comparison to BEVs and to Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle (ICEV). To investigate this, we simulate the urban food retailing as a representative share of urban freight transport using a multi-agent transport simulation software. Synthetic routes as well as fleet size and composition are determined by solving a vehicle routing problem. We compute the operating costs using a total cost of ownership analysis and the use phase emissions as well as primary energy demand using the well to wheel approach. While a change to BEV results in 17–23% higher costs compared to ICEV, using FCEVs leads to 22–57% higher costs. Assuming today’s electricity mix, we show a GHG emission reduction of 25% compared to the ICEV base case when using BEV. Current hydrogen production leads to a GHG reduction of 33% when using FCEV which however cannot be scaled to larger fleets. Using current electricity in electrolysis will increase GHG emission by 60% compared to the base case. Assuming 100% renewable electricity for charging and hydrogen production, the reduction from FCEVs rises to 73% and from BEV to 92%. The primary energy requirement for BEV is in all cases lower and for higher compared to the base case. We conclude that while FCEV have a slightly higher GHG savings potential with current hydrogen, BEV are the favored technology for urban freight transport from an economic and ecological point of view, considering the increasing shares of renewable energies in the grid mix.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Urban freight transport</kwd><kwd>Multi

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction and motivation</title><p id="Par2">Commercial road vehicles including buses cause 35.6% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the German transport sector. In order to achieve the climate protection goals in this sector, GHG emissions must be reduced through alternative vehicle drive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The current focus is on battery electric vehicles (BEV) due to the complete avoidance of local emissions and a comparably high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, vehicles powered by Fuel Cell (FC) can be an alternative solution solving several issues of BEV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to locally emission-free driving, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) offer the advantages of a short refueling time of only a few minutes and a diesel-equivalent range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. By converting urban freight transport from ICEV to FCEV, delivery routes, loading and refueling times can be maintained. In contrast, BEVs have range constraints due to the conflict between payload and battery size and require charging times of up to several hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The question this paper intends to answer is whether these advantages are sufficient to make FCEV advantageous over BEV in decarbonizing urban transport, despite their lower overall efficiency.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Technical requirements</title><p id="Par3">Currently, there are mainly prototypes of FC trucks. These include light 7.5t trucks such as the Fuso Vision F-Cell or heavy-duty semitrailer tractors such as the Nikola Motors Tre, which is expected to be ready for series production by 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], fuel cells in buses have already reached a lifetime of 25,000 operating hours. This is expected to be sufficient for most trucks to avoid an expensive change of the FC. FC trucks usually store gaseous hydrogen using pressure tanks of type 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] with comparably low pressure of up to 350 bar. Therefore pre-cooling of the hydrogen is unnecessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are many ways to produce hydrogen using fossil and renewable energy sources. Today, 54% of hydrogen in Germany is produced as a by-product of other production processes and 46% is produced by steam reforming of natural gas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regenerative hydrogen production can be implemented, for example, with Power-to-Gas (Power To Gas (PtG)) plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There are currently 86 gas stations in Germany (as of August 2020) for FCEV refueling. Six of them offer hydrogen pressure of 350 bar and are therefore compatible for fuel cell buses and trucks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>State of research</title><p id="Par4">Several studies have already examined the conversion from diesel to FC trucks: The “Mobility and Fuel Strategy of the Federal Government” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] examined the research and development needs of FC trucks. The study carried out a market and technology analysis for Germany. The aim of the model is to test the potential market uptake of alternative drive systems. General conditions such as vehicle class, type of drive, infrastructure, traffic volume and general data such as development of freight traffic or energy scenarios are considered. The model depicts the purchasing decisions of truck operators, taking into account different types of truck usage. The study calculates total cost of ownership (TCO) and well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions for each truck class and drive type. Other studies that consider FCEV for a future market uptake are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Yazdanie et al. analyze the WTW emissions and primary energy demand of ICEVs, BEVs, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and FCEVs of passenger cars considering fossil energy and renewable energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They determine the consumption values per km for the different types of drive, and the emissions and energy requirements of the different vehicle types. Lombardi et al. present a performance comparison and the ecological effects of four truck classes and the types BEV, ICEV, PHEV and Plug-in FCEV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They use a rule-based and optimized consumption model based on the pontryagin minimum principle. Using two different synthetic drive cycles they calculate the WTW GHG emissions and the WTW primary energy demand using the consumption values. Transport and distribution are taken into account in the WTW path. Lee et al. compare the primary energy consumption and WTW emissions of FCEV and ICEV trucks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A high-resolution longitudinal dynamics model and real vehicle measurements generate the necessary data. For hydrogen production, they consider steam reforming with natural gas and hydrogen as fuel in liquid and gaseous form. Further studies that investigate different hydrogen production paths are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Daneberg investigates the potentials of FC trucks, their TCO,, hydrogen costs, and the infrastructure required for the Oslo-Trondheim route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The author uses a case study to determine the economically most suitable case depending on hydrogen costs and fleet size. Hall and Lutsey deal with the TCO for zero-emission trucks for the Los Angeles area, California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. They investigate the costs and number of hydrogen filling stations for low, medium and high fleet compositions for long-haul tractor-trailers, port drayage, and local delivery trucks. Further studies that investigate the costs of FCEVs are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The summary of the current state of research shows that the topic of fuel cell drive has already been investigated in market ramp-up models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the conversion of car traffic to alternative drive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the environmental impact of individual vehicles and production paths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and infrastructure and operating costs of trucks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, there is no study that examines the effects of a complete conversion of the entire urban logistics sector to FC trucks. Changes in costs, emissions, and primary energy demand are still pending, especially taking into account the influence of current and future hydrogen production and system prices. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, prototype FC trucks have not been used as reference vehicles so far. Martins-Turner et al. use the transport simulation MATSim to investigate the usability of BEVs in comparison to ICEVs for urban freight transport using the food retailing logistics in Berlin as a case study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Changes in transport costs, WTW emissions and primary energy demand of ICEVs and BEVs are computed and compared. Since no such study for FCEVs exits so far, the following research question arises: Can FCEVs outperform BEVs in terms of TCO, WTW emissions and primary energy demand when considering a complete decarbonization of urban freight transport?</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par5">To find an answer to the research question posed, this study applies the following methodology, which is divided into supply planning, simulation of freight transport, TCO, and well-to-wheel analysis, to the use case of delivering goods to food retailing stores in Berlin.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Tour planning</title><p id="Par6">To deliver food to the various sales locations, nearby distribution centers (so-called “hubs” or “depots”) are first supplied. From there the goods are distributed further to the retail stores. Due to its focus on urban transport, this study considers the latter. No data about the actual routes are available. It is furthermore expected that a complete conversion to BEVs or FCEVs will require a rescheduling of routes. Hence, a Vehicle Routing Problem Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a cost-based objective function is solved using the open-source software jsprit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This provides a plan of the delivery routes as well as a certain fleet composition at minimal cost. Real data from the investigation area are used to define the VRP. These are divided into internal and external factors. Internal factors are the location of the hubs and the available vehicle types which differ in variable and fixed costs (determined using TCO) and maximum capacity. External factors include demand for goods, delivery location, and the time windows for delivery. They are taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which is also the basis of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Also, the transport network and the traffic are external factors that are taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Simulation of freight transport</title><p id="Par7">To simulate the different cases for urban freight traffic, the openly available, agent-based simulation software MATSim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] is used. MATSim simulates each vehicle of the transport system as a so-called agent in a transport network, whereby various activities such as receiving and delivering goods are carried out. With this simulation setup, the scenario of urban freight traffic with FCEV can be implemented. In this study the Open Berlin scenario is used to generate background traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. After 10,000 iterations of the VRP solver, a single MATSim simulation for one day is performed. Subsequently, the costs and calculated fleet composition are examined and the distance and travel times covered by the vehicles are retrieved. The energy demand of the fleets is calculated from the driven distances and the vehicle class specific consumption values which can be found in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Using the GHG emissions and primary energy factors multiplied by the hydrogen demand, the total GHG emissions and the energy demand for the different fuels of WTW can be compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Total cost of ownership (TCO)</title><p id="Par8">In order to determine the variable and fixed costs for the fleet composition, the life cycle costs are investigated. One method to analyze these costs is the TCO. Fixed costs such as acquisition costs and variable costs such as operating costs of the product are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This allows the comparison of the different drive types in terms of operational costs over the product life cycle. In this paper, the TCO method according to the “Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2030” (BVWP, Federal Transportation Plan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] is established for FCEV as already done for BEVs and ICEVs in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Four truck classes are considered: light (7.5 tons), medium (18 tons), heavy (26 tons), and heavy (40 tons). For the 40 tons trucks, trailers are included in the cost calculation. The purchase price of the trucks is depreciated half by time and half by kilometers driven. In cost accounting according to BVWP, no insurance costs or other taxes are considered. However, from a supplier’s business point of view, these costs are important to consider. Therefore, corresponding values from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] are used. BEVs and FCEVs are expected to have lower maintenance costs than ICEVs due to fewer components installed. However, there are no sufficient studies proving this assumption yet. Therefore, the maintenance costs from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for ICEV are used for all drive classes, therefore most likely overestimation the costs for BEV and FCEV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Well to wheel analysis (WTW)</title><p id="Par9">The WTW analysis describes the energy paths of energy carriers from the source to the wheel, distinguishing between Well To Tank (WTT) and Tank To Wheel (TTW).

Cutoff Unit database serves as a basis to model the processes and flows for the WTT analysis of the respective energy carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For better comparability of the energy sources from the ecoinvent database and the data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], the lower heating value was taken into account as a basis. For BEVs and FCEVs the TTW path equals zero, as no emissions arise due to the energy conversion within the vehicles.

Since the demand model in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] is based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], this study relies on the same model for comparability. Following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], there are 1057 food markets in Berlin that place approximately 1928 inquiries for goods per day. These inquiries are served by 15 food suppliers (carriers) with 17 distribution centers. The goods are divided into the categories fresh, frozen and dry, which are handled separately. Technically, this leads to 45 carriers that have to be considered in the VRP. The loading time per pallet is approximated with 3 minutes. It is possible that the trucks can be loaded several times at the depots. Not all vehicle sizes are available to all carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Martins-Turner et al. show that today a BEV excluding battery costs about 1.6 times as much as a complete ICEV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, it is assumed that in the future a BEV without a battery will cost the same as an ICEV. These are the two case distinctions for vehicle costs (BEV160 and BEV100). In this study it is assumed that BEV160 represents today’s market and will therefore be operated with today’s electricity mix. In contrast, BEV100 represents a future scenario and is therefore operated with an electricity mix of 50% wind and 50% solar power. BEVs are designed in the same weight classes as the ICEVs. The batteries are dimensioned in such a way that, taking into account the increased permissible total mass for emission-free commercial vehicles in the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], there is no change in payload compared to ICEVs. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) commercial vehicle batteries with a price of 600/kWh on pack level are used. All other specifications for the first three cases can be viewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The novelty in this study are the two cases with FCEV. The layout of FCEV is equivalent to BEV, but with a smaller battery and the FC and tanks as additional components. Therefore the cases FCEV160 and FCEV100 are defined analogously to the BEV cases. As there are currently no FC trucks in series production, the Nikola Tre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for the 40t truck, the prototype from the partner project ASKO Scania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] for the 26t truck and the concept truck Fuso Vision F-Cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] for the light 7.5t truck are selected as reference models. FCEV prototypes for the medium 18t truck are still pending, therefore separate assumptions are made. FCEVs have an approximately 1.8 times higher TTW consumption due to the energy conversion in the FC for which an efficiency of 55% is assumed according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. According to Kurzweil the FC of a vehicle is mostly kept at an optimal operating point and the remaining power is provided by a battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus the consumption value of the 18t truck can be calculated with the consumption value of the BEV in the same weight class divided by a fuel cell efficiency of 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The consumption values for the 7.5t, the 26t and the 40t truck result from the range and stored energy in the form of hydrogen indicated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The values appear plausible, as similar values result with the aforementioned calculation method. For all FCEV classes, the same system power as in the BEV case is assumed in order to be able to compare them fairly. In FCEV, the system performance is made up of the power of the fuel cell and the battery. The hydrogen tank of the 18 tons FCEV is dimensioned to achieve a similar range as for ICEVs. For the FCEV cases, the vehicle configurations in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> result. The simulation results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that the assumed ranges of the FCEVs are sufficiently high for all truck classes so no intermediate refueling is needed.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Overview of vehicle and fuel scenarios</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12544_2022_525_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Calculated driving distances of FCEVs</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12544_2022_525_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Vehicle specifications of FCEV classes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>FCEV class</p></th><th align="left"><p>7.5 tons</p></th><th align="left"><p>18 tons</p></th><th align="left"><p>26 tons</p></th><th align="left"><p>40 tons</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p>Comparable models</p></th><th align="left"><p>Fuso Vision F-Cell</p></th><th align="left"><p>–</p></th><th align="left"><p>ASKO Scania FCT</p></th><th align="left"><p>Nikola Motors Tre</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Range [km]</p></td><td align="left"><p>300</p></td><td align="left"><p>500</p></td><td align="left"><p>500</p></td><td align="left"><p>800</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Energy consumption [kWh/100km]</p></td><td align="left"><p>111</p></td><td align="left"><p>193</p></td><td align="left"><p>275</p></td><td align="left"><p>333</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>System power [kW]</p></td><td align="left"><p>210</p></td><td align="left"><p>305</p></td><td align="left"><p>370</p></td><td align="left"><p>440</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Fuel cell power [kW]</p></td><td align="left"><p>75</p></td><td align="left"><p>80</p></td><td align="left"><p>90</p></td><td align="left"><p>120</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Battery power [kW]</p></td><td align="left"><p>135</p></td><td align="left"><p>225</p></td><td align="left"><p>280</p></td><td align="left"><p>320</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Hydrogen fuel [kg]</p></td><td align="left"><p>10</p></td><td align="left"><p>29</p></td><td align="left"><p>33</p></td><td align="left"><p>80</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Battery capacity [kWh]</p></td><td align="left"><p>40</p></td><td align="left"><p>50</p></td><td align="left"><p>56</p></td><td align="left"><p>70</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cost parameters</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Vehicle prices</title><p id="Par12">Since the construction of BEV and FCEV are very similar except for fuel cell and tank, the same chassis costs presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] are assumed for both vehicle types.

Accruing infrastructure costs are not examined in detail within the scope of this study, but are integrated in the assumptions of hydrogen prices.

One possible solution is PtG, which are ideal at locations with adequate available space and wind or sunshine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The renewable electricity is directly usable in electrolysers to produce hydrogen. The future case consists of 50% electrolysis with wind power and 50% electrolysis with solar power (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The electricity generated by offshore wind turbines is used to produce hydrogen which is then distributed by pipelines to the filling stations. For generating electricity from offshore wind turbines the process from ecoinvent is used. Subsequent processes such as electrolysis, power distribution and compression on the retail side are taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and included in our calculations. The energy required for these processes results from the future energy-mix (Electricity (future)). As regions like North Africa have sunny days almost all year round, there is a high potential for power-to-gas plants. The electricity generated by photovoltaic systems can then be used directly to produce hydrogen. In this study it is assumed that 50% of future hydrogen will be produced in this way.

This is mainly driven by the fixed costs for BEVs, which are 38 to 49% higher than those for ICEV because of the high battery price. These also influence the distance variable cost.

According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the energy requirement for the Italian electricity mix is 2.86 kWh/kWhEl, which is 16% higher than the German electricity mix for 2019.

From a cost point of view, FCEVs have higher operating costs due to the price of hydrogen and similarly high investment costs. The advantage of a diesel-equivalent range and refueling time of FCEV is decisive for the decision of the preferred technology, if refueling is necessary to complete the delivery route. However, in the use case at hand the BEVs can reach 56% of all destinations without intermediate charging and 90% with one-time intermediate charging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. With additional public fast charging stations in the operation area, all tours can be performed with BEV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">With regards to WTW emissions, FCEV have a small advantage over BEV when considering current electricity and hydrogen mixes. However, this hydrogen mix cannot be scaled arbitrarily, since about half of the hydrogen is a by-product from chemical processes, which in all likelihood will not be expanded by an increased demand for hydrogen. Since all of the hydrogen produced today is already absorbed by the market (especially the chemical industry), it can be expected that an increase in consumption by FCEV in the transportation sector would require new generation pathways. Therefore, we have performed the sensitivity analysis where the hydrogen is generated from current electricity. This leads to a high increase in WTW emissions even compared to ICEV. The effect would be similar for hydrogen produced entirely from fossil resources. It is therefore obvious that a positive effect in terms of WTW emissions can only be achieved by hydrogen from renewable sources, as the case FCEV100 shows. However, the achievable savings from directly using the renewable electricity in BEV are significantly higher as shown in the case BEV100.</p><p id="Par29">In this study, the investigation of GHG emissions is only related to the energy consumption of the fleets. Thus, the environmental impacts of production, end of life, infrastructure and maintenance are out of scope. For a complete evaluation of the environmental impacts per vehicle fleet, a complete life cycle assessment Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) would be necessary. However, since commercial vehicles have a substantial higher lifetime mileage than passenger cars, the production and recycling emissions account for a smaller proportion of the complete life cycle emissions. In terms of energy consumption, the FCEV160 case is competitive with the ICEV case. However, the primary energy demand of BEV is preferable in all cases for the truck fleet of urban freight transport, since with both, the current electricity mix of Germany and the renewable electricity mix BEV have a smaller primary energy demand than FCEV and ICEV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion and outlook</title><p id="Par30">This study examines battery electric and fuel cell electric drive technologies with the objective to investigate their decarbonization effects on urban freight transport. ICEVs operated with diesel provided the base case. The food retailing in Berlin serves as a use case. Considering today’s technology and fuel prices, a transition from ICEVs to BEVs would increase costs by 23%. A change to FCEV has more than twice the increase with 57%. In the considered future cases with lower fuel and technology prices BEVs are 17% higher compared to the base case. The transition to FCEVs is with 22% higher costs compared to the base case, still more expensive than BEV but the difference is smaller. When the transition to locally emission free trucks is considered today and today’s electricity and hydrogen mixes should be used, FCEVs hold the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 33%. This way, they outperform BEV, which would only achieve a reduction of 25% compared to the base case. However, as previously shown, this effect cannot be scaled up, since these savings are based on the fact that a large part of the hydrogen is a by-product. As soon as more hydrogen has to be produced from today’s electricity or fossil fuels, the advantage of the technology becomes smaller and at some point turns into a disadvantage.</p><p id="Par31">When more renewable energy is taken into account, the superiority of BEV is indisputable. If 100% renewables are considered, the savings potential of BEVs is with 92% significantly higher than that of FCEVs with 73%. The analysis of the primary energy demand shows that with Germany’s electricity mix of 2019 11% less primary energy would be used when deploying BEVs. For the exclusive use of renewables, this value rises to 53%. FCEVs on the other hand cause a 9% increase in primary energy demand today and 60% more with renewable hydrogen. The range advantage of FCEVs shows to have no importance due to short delivery routes in this urban use case. To make FCEVs more competitive, the price of hydrogen has to decrease, which may result from economies of scale when demand for hydrogen rises. In further studies on the decarbonization of urban freight traffic, a mixed fleet composition of BEVs and FCEVs should be considered. The BEVs’ batteries could be designed for short delivery routes, which would result in lower costs due to a smaller battery size. FCEVs can be used to cover the long delivery distances. Prospective research should also investigate FC and BE trucks for rural freight transport. Here, the range advantage of FCEVs could be the game changer for the decarbonization of freight transport. The option of producing hydrogen using PtG plants with surplus regenerative electricity for FCEVs makes sense from an energy utilization point of view. Depending on the configuration and purpose of the PtG plant, the produced hydrogen can be converted into electricity or transported to filling stations. With regard to primary energy demand, the question arises as to which of the WTW paths is most efficient for BEVs or for FCEVs. This issue may be the subject of further studies. To better assess the environmental impact of the two technologies, it would be interesting to conduct a full LCA that considers the production, operation and disposal of the vehicle fleets in addition to the WTW emissions. The result of this study is that FCEVs can outperform BEVs in terms of GHG emissions when considering today’s hydrogen production and a very small fleet of FCEVs. But in all other considered categories and most importantly when assuming increasing shares of renewable energy, BEVs are the preferred technology choice for urban freight transport. According to our results BEVs are cheaper in total operation cost, reduce the primary energy demand and with rising shares of renewable energies in the grid, they have a higher potential to lower GHG emissions compared to FCEV.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.
