Many of the key approaches to achieving this transition in the critical areas of transportation, buildings and manufacturing depend on new materials and new approaches to rapidly increase electrification. This article reviews the overall energy landscape and highlights specific areas where new materials are critical to enabling transitions in energy storage, hydrogen utilization, transportation, buildings and the chemical industry and the articles on these topics that follow. How these transitions can be best integrated and the global societal impact of these transitions is also discussed. The development of new materials is instrumental in accelerating the move to a cleaner electrified society. The “<italic>electrification of everything”</italic> is increasingly important if we are to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and materials will play a critical role realizing this

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Fundamentally, society and its technologies are at the tipping point in changing from our historic carbon-based technology to carbon neutral or carbon negative approaches. Many of the key approaches to achieving this transition depend on moving to electrification and offer the potential for a truly sustainable energy system. A key focus of this transition is the move from our current dependence on thermal energy from fossil fuels for transportation, buildings, and chemical industry to electrified technologies that can be driven by renewable electrons and solar thermal energy. In many areas these transformations are taking place very rapidly, enabled by new generations of materials that reduce the cost of renewable electrons and their storage, enhance renewable thermal energy, and extend the range of these technologies’ applications. This power generation and storage is coupled to new generations of technologies developed to use renewable electrons, such as the advent of electrified transportation. This issue of <italic>MRS Bulletin</italic> focuses on this trend which some have named the “<italic>electrification of everything”</italic>—with a fundamental assumption that by electrifying everything from transportation to the chemical industry through the use of renewable electrons we can potentially create a carbon-free energy system. The economics of this transition is increasingly compelling. As per the Wall Street Journal:<disp-quote><p id="Par3">You’ve also come face to face with one of the hottest, and most poorly understood, buzz phrases in energy—the “electrification of everything.”</p><p id="Par4">The concept, most simply put, is that more of the energy we use will come from the electric socket. Instead of having fuels like natural gas or oil or gasoline flow directly into our homes, offices, manufacturing facilities and cars, those fuels—and other sources of energy—will increasingly be converted to electricity first.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par5">As renewable electrons become both more available and more cost competitive with any conventional energy source, the breadth of their potential application significantly increases. This trend is key to enabling this transition. In 2017, the solar industry achieved the US Department of Energy’s original SunShot 2020 cost target of $0.06 per kilowatt-hour for utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) solar power three years ahead of schedule, dropping from about $0.28 to $0.06 in 2017. The most recent 700 megawatt (MW) PV facility in Portugal has a bid power cost of $0.013/kWh, which makes this historically one of the lowest costs of electricity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> In addition, land-based, utility-scale wind is one of the lowest-priced energy sources available today, costing 1–2 cents per kilowatt-hour after the production tax credit in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p><p id="Par6">Clearly, as the cost of renewable electrons becomes the cheapest form of electrical energy, the electrification of everything is enabled and its overall attractiveness increases significantly. However, many key issues remain, including the magnitude of the challenge required for the generation, distribution, and storage of renewable electrons so 24/7 operation is available globally, to all people. Nonetheless, if sources of reliable abundant renewable electrons can be achieved, this can lead to a paradigm shift across a broad range of energy use areas, from transportation and buildings to industry and new refining methods. But only if technologies are available to make use of renewable electrons. Electric vehicles (EVs) are an example where miles/gallon equivalents are approaching 150 miles per gallon using new battery and motor technologies. Consequently, materials and the technologies in which they are integrated, will play a critical role in meeting the challenge of the electrification of everything.</p><p id="Par7">This issue of <italic>MRS Bulletin</italic> will illustrate both the potential of moving from present hydrocarbon sources of energy to renewable electrons and the materials challenges this transition poses. Clearly, the challenges are area specific and impact a broad swath of society. To better understand where materials could play the most significant role in the electrification of everything, we need to understand the energy use landscape.</p><p id="Par8">From <bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>1</bold></xref>, the greatest opportunities for impact upon electrification are in transportation and industry followed by the buildings sectors. <bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>2</bold></xref> shows the forecast of the growth in electrical consumption.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The breakdown of primary energy consumption by area.

To impact the climate and to be economical, the transition to electrification must take place rapidly and be powered by electricity available 24/7 and demonstrate a high level of energy systems integration. Despite the rapid reduction in the cost of renewables the overall supply of renewable electrons is at present limited worldwide. The demand for power continues to increase at a little over 2% per year according to the IRENA report 2021.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> 2.8TW of renewable energy is currently installed (for a generation capacity or 400 TWh or roughly 10.4% of global electricity production).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="Par10">Overall, this transformation is motivated by the continuing issues associated with climate change, but ultimately it must make current practical economic sense as well. Moving increasingly to electrification is one of the fastest ways to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and recent cost reductions in renewable energy have enabled a rapid growth of renewables worldwide, which is starting to offset production by other means.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> This will require better interconnections for bidirectional electrical flow, new models for on demand electricity delivery and the ability to handle vastly more sources and syncs for renewable electrons. This must ultimately be driven by much more sophisticated models and controls from the nanoscale to the very large scale (<bold>Figure</bold><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>3</bold></xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The breakdown in the sources of renewable electrons by geographic area. <italic>Source</italic> International Renewable Energy Agency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2021_248_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">Overall, if significant penetration of renewables occurs worldwide and there are enough terawatts of renewable electrons, then society can shift to a nearly carbon-free, sustainable energy economy. The challenge is ensuring the energy from renewable electrons is available when needed and then prioritizing where we will use them and how to integrate this use in a fair and equitable way globally. To do this we need to look more closely at the challenge of mitigating the intermittent nature of many renewable sources.</p><p id="Par12">This will be covered in more detail in the article by Arent et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials for electrical energy storage</title><p id="Par13">As previously discussed, given the variable nature of many renewable electron sources, there is an increasing need for low-cost, carbon-free energy storage to achieve grid integration with 24/7 performance. As the demands for electrification increase, so does the necessity for storage. Storage can take many forms. Currently the most utilized electrical energy storage systems are pumped hydroelectric. This technology is about 1/3 the current cost of lithium-ion batteries. However, it is limited in its distribution going forward since it requires two large water reservoirs to be constructed close together but at different heights. For more flexible electricity storage the approaches maybe thermal storage in the form of molten salts, batteries (Li-ion and flow batteries), electromechanical storage such as flywheels or creating energy carriers such as hydrogen from water. The amount of energy storage required in the future is significant. Recent estimates suggest that to achieve 90% renewables by 2035 will require 1 TWh of storage to mitigate the intermittency issue worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Ideally this could be readily achieved at $0.02/Wh but many experts believe that even at $0.1 or $0.15 dollars per watt hour there would be enough penetration to impact the overall renewables market. <bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>4</bold></xref> shows the effective learning curves for both silicon solar cells and Li-ion battery technology. Interestingly, the slopes are very comparable and the data seem to track similarly indicating with increased market penetration, storage cost can be significantly reduced toward the $0.02/Wh goal, thereby enabling high penetration renewables. The articles in this issue will discuss recent advances in energy storage.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The decrease in Solar cell and Li-ion battery costs as production increases. <italic>Source</italic> Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Maycock, Battery University, MIIT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2021_248_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">This will be covered in more detail in the article by T.M.

Thus, in addition to storing renewable electrons, one could use those electrons to create hydrogen. Having abundant renewable hydrogen is enabling for many areas, including energy storage, transportation, and industry. The specific energy (Wh/kg) of hydrogen combined with fuel cells is up to four times greater than Li-ion batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> At present there is an increasing political and industrial interest in the availability of hydrogen. It offers ways to decarbonize a range of sectors, including long-haul transport, chemical and iron and steel production, where it is proving difficult to meaningfully reduce emissions. Despite very ambitious international climate goals, global energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reached an all-time high in 2018. Outdoor air pollution also remains a pressing problem, with around 3 million people dying prematurely each year. All of these are strong motivators for switching many of these areas to renewable hydrogen. Historically, hydrogen has been derived primarily from fossil resources. As a consequence hydrogen use and storage is already at industrial scale around the world (approximately 80 million tons, as shown in <bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>5</bold></xref>), but its current methods of production are responsible for annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions equivalent to those of Indonesia and the United Kingdom combined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup><fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Global hydrogen production since 1975. <italic>DRI</italic> direct reduced iron steel production.

Fortunately, the use of renewables for hydrogen production is increasing by almost 26 MW per year for electrolysis but it remains much less than 1% of all the hydrogen produced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Despite the fact that the amount of electrically generated hydrogen is currently very small, the applications space is large including among others chemicals, metals, electronics and glass-making industries.</p><p id="Par17">There are a number of approaches to facilitate the production of hydrogen by carbon-free means, including electrolyzers, thermal, and nuclear approaches. Within these approaches there are options as well. For example, in electrolyzers there are solid oxide electrolysis cells, which operate at high temperatures, polymer membrane electrolysis cells which operate at low temperatures, and alkaline electrolysis cells. Note that many of these approaches require steam which can be made by thermal means. In the thermal area, approaches include solar-thermal-chemical production of hydrogen by direct reaction (STCH) usually using concentrated solar power, or heat from nuclear reactors, or the use of geothermal sources. Many hybrid electrochemical/thermal systems are being investigated as well not only for hydrogen as an energy carrier but also for NH<sub>3</sub> for the same use. In the cases, above both the heat and electrons can be generated using renewable resources.</p><p id="Par18">Currently hydrogen generated by renewable electrons is not cost competitive with fossil generated hydrogen (not including CO<sub>2</sub> remediation) as shown in <bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>6</bold></xref>. However, note that if carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) is included this substantially affects the hydrogen cost. The cost of producing hydrogen with renewable electrons is close to natural gas with carbon capture.

Recent studies and some developmental efforts indicate that there is a substantial overall energy cost reduction opportunities for retrofitting existing buildings and this is of increasing interest at all levels from the national to the local community levels. In addition, there is a clear need enable their integration in new construction. All of these areas are challenging from a materials perspective as will be discussed in the article on buildings. It is clear that developing an integrated approach to the electrification of building function such as l heating and cooling, windows, lighting and communications will require new functional materials and new smart materials to be integrated with the active systems.

We next consider the application of these electrons to electrification of the transportation, buildings and industrial sectors. We understand this is a broad swathe of technologies, and to achieve the goal will necessitate a new energy infrastructure that can only occur with a large scale integration across all of these areas and are thus enabling for each other. Finally, we will discuss how materials can be used to help ensure this transition to renewable electrons is done in a manner that promotes social justice and encourages energy democracy.
