id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The program for laser plasma physics includes five plenary talks and eight oral sessionsÂ  (see Abstracts of the first Asia-Pacific Conference on Plasma Physics in the reference links). The five plenary speakers come from China, Japan, Korea, and France. One of these plenary talks on laser plasma-based laboratory astrophysics was selected by the solar and astrophysics program committee. Among the oral sessions, two sessions were organized jointly with the Asian Committee on Ultra-Intense Laser (ACUIL), the Asian collaboration network for high-intensity lasers. There were a total of 27 invited talks and six oral talks presented in the oral sessions and four posters in a poster session. Among the invited and oral presentations, seven talks were on inertial confined fusion, 12 talks on laser-driven particle acceleration and radiation, ten talks on high-energy density physics driven by lasers, and four talks on high-power laser systems and technologies. There were five invited and oral presentations from France and UK. In this summary report, I try to highlight the main reported progresses in the four different topics with the help of many speakers. A concluding remark is made at the end of the summary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Inertial confined fusion driven by lasers</title><p id="Par3">The investigation on inertial confined fusion (ICF) remains one of main interests in laser plasma and is one of the main drive forces for the development of this area ever since 1970s (Kaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>). Even though tremendous new progresses have been made in the central hotspot ignition scheme for ICF driven by the indirect-drive (ID) approach and direct-drive (DD) approach (Hurricane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>; Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>), there are still significant challenges regarding fusion ignition and fusion energy (Edwards and Danson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). Experiments on NIF in LLNL suggest that both peak ablation pressure and the implosion velocity need to be further enhanced, and the hydrodynamic instabilities need to be further controlled to improve the implosion symmetry. New ignition schemes for ICF are still highly desired to push the ICF research forward.</p><p id="Par4">The plenary talk by He [P1] reported a novel hotspot ignition scheme for ICF driven by a so-called hybrid-drive (HD) approach (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). This is, however, not just simply combining the laser ID and DD approaches. This scheme runs in two phases. In the first phase, a layered fusion fuel capsule inside a spherical hohlraum is ablated by lower ID radiation temperature, resulting in the pre-compression of fusion fuel and the formation of a long-scale corona plasma. In the second phase, the DD lasers are injected and absorbed near the critical surface, generating a supersonic electronic-thermal wave (ETW). The ETW is significantly smoothed during propagation in the long-scale ID corona plasma and finally slows down to a sonic ETW. This process behaves like a âsnow plowâ, piling up the low corona plasma density into the high-density platform between the sonic wave front and the ID ablation front, and resulting in a far higher HD plasma pressure than the ID ablation pressure. The resulting HD pressure not only strongly suppresses the hotspot deformation and the hydrodynamic instabilities, but also provides a large PdV work on the hotspot and results in non-stagnation ignition according to their simulation. The experiments on the boosted HD pressure and smoothing effect of supersonic ETW are being carried out at the ShenGuang (SG)-III laser facility (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">In his plenary talk, Miquel [P13] presented an overview on the Laser Megajoule (LMJ) program in the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). The French Fusion program combines the physics models, numerical simulation and experimental validation (Miquel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2016</xref>). Six experimental configurations have been defined during the ramp-up of LMJ. LMJ has been working in the second configuration (2 bundlesâ=â16 beams, 60Â kJ, 4 diagnostics) since the end of 2016, providing good overall performances. Three other bundles are mounted and will be activated the next year (third configuration, 150Â kJ, 10 diagnostics). Three activities are performed at the same time: mounting of new bundles, commissioning of the previous assembled bundles, and physics experiments. CEA is developing a thematic approach on LMJ and has defined eight experimental topics for the simulation program. Several physics campaigns have been performed since 2014 and have addressed three of these topics. About ten experiments are planned till 2019 and will address six different topics. The first implosions with D2â+âAr capsules are planned in 2019. In addition, associated with the LMJ, the PETAL laser has been developed (Batani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Casner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). This is a multi-PW beam coupled to LMJ, which offers the opportunity to study a wider area of physics. A record of 1.2Â PW (840Â Jâ700Â fs) was obtained in 2015. Pulse duration was improved (570Â fs) and should bring the power to 1.8Â PW. For academic access to LMJ-PETAL, two calls of proposals for 2017â2020 have received a great success (25 proposals), and six experiments have been selected by the international scientific advisory committee. LMJ-PETAL was ready for the first international academic experiments in December 2017.</p><p id="Par6">To achieve ICF fusion ignition, it is required that a hohlraum should produce a very high symmetric X-ray drive in the ID approach (Lindl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">1995</xref>; Atzeni and Meyer-ter-Vehn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>), which remains a major challenge for ICF. In the invited talk by Lan [L-I21], a novel spherical hohlraum with six cylindrical laser entrance holes (LEHs) of octahedral symmetry was presented, called as the octahedral spherical hohlraum (Lan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">c</xref>). It is shown that such a hohlraum can not only provide the capsule a radiation drive with natural, robust and very high symmetry without any supplementary technology, but also a high-energy coupling efficiency from the hohlraum to the ignition hotspot. Since 2013, considerable progresses have been made in the design of the octahedral spherical hohlraum (Huo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2015</xref>; Shu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2015</xref>; Duan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>; Lan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2016</xref>). Meanwhile, a series of experiments of the Spherical Hohlraum Campaign (SPHC) have been performed on the ShenGuang laser facilities in Shanghai and Mianyang in China to test its performance (Huo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">b</xref>; Xie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2016</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2017c</xref>; Shu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2018</xref>). Finally, it is proposed to use 2Ï lasers for future ignition facilities with a configuration designed for the octahedral spherical hohlraum and to use a foam wall to increase the coupling efficiency from the laser to the capsule (Lan and Song <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2017</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">In indirect-drive ICF, the symmetric radiation drive is critical to the capsule implosion but difficult to achieve due to the non-uniform laser radiation inside the hohlraum. Nevertheless, the angular distribution of the radiation flux escaping from the hohlraum LEH is sensitive to non-uniform radiation properties such as laser spot and plasma motion, which therefore provides an effective way to study the hohlraum radiation properties. The invited talk by Yang [L-I24] reported an experimental investigation on the hohlraum radiation properties through the angular distribution of the radiation temperature performed on the SG-III prototype in Mianyang. Comparison between the experimental observations and the two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations was carried out (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">b</xref>; Hao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2014</xref>). The difference between the 2D simulations and the real 3D effects caused by limited beam numbers on SG-III prototype laser facility was considered, and the influence of power balance and pointing accuracy of laser beams on the measured results was evaluated. Both vacuum- and gas-filled hohlraums were used to study the non-uniform radiation properties by investigating the angular distribution of the X-ray flux.</p><p id="Par8">In addition to the conventional ICF schemes of central ignition, there were some talks on advanced ignition schemes, for example, the fast ignition (FI) scheme (Kodama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2001</xref>). Gu [L-I16] reported their experimental and theoretical progresses on fast ignition (FI). By use of SG-II upgraded (SG-IIU) laser facility in Shanghai, delivering totally 24Â kJ nanosecond laser (8 beams) for compression and 1Â kJ at 10Â ps heating laser, several decomposed and integrated FI experiments were performed recently (Gu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). Pre-compression experiment was carried out to obtain the density and area density of the cone-in-shell FI target driven by the indirective approach. Some flat-target experiments were used to test the capability of the picosecond laser. Based on these decomposed experiments, the integrated experiments via the cone scheme were performed and a 200-fold neutron enhancement was observed. The results confirmed the favorable heating effect of the picosecond lasers, where the heating efficiency can reach about 10% calculated from the measurements of neutron yields, density and spot size. Following these encouraging results, they have planned to carry out more FI experiments with their scheme in the future.</p><p id="Par9">In recent years, it is found that high magnetic fields may significantly improve the performance of ICF both for conventional schemes and fast ignition schemes. For fast ignition, electron guiding by external magnetic fields in dense plasma was demonstrated by experiments, as presented in the talk by Santos [L-I21]. Using high-energy ns pulses, they observed that a single-turn coil produced discharge currents of 100Â kA and then magnetic fieldsâ~â500Â T were generated, as measured by proton deflectometry and high-frequency bandwidth B-dot probes (Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>; Law et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2016</xref>; Morace et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2017</xref>). Hot electrons ejected from the irradiated cathode provide the source for the quasi-static super-AlvÃ©nic current (Tikhonchuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2017</xref>). The magnetic field was successfully applied in experiments of laser-generated relativistic electron transport into solid matter. The imposed magnetic field ofâ~â600Â T yielded an unprecedented enhancement of a factor five on the relativistic electrons energyâdensity flux at 60Â Âµm depth as compared to unmagnetized transport conditions. The transported electron beams were characterized by imaging the coherent transition radiation emitted from the targetsâ rear surface in conjunction to benchmarked 3D PIC hybrid simulations, which were coupled to a coherent transition radiation post-processor. Under optimized experimental parameters, 70% of the electron beam energy is transported to the rear side within the size of the electron beam source (Bailly-Grandvaux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Based upon the numerical simulation, Wang [L-I25] presented a magnetically assisted (MA) scheme for fast ignition. He and his collaborators developed an integrated simulation approach (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2015a</xref>), the so-called âtwo-system PICâ model, in which the fast electron generation by laserâplasma interactions and electron transport in real-density plasma (up to 300Â gÂ cm<sup>â3</sup>) can be simulated integratedly. In this way, the energy coupling from the laser to the target core region can be calculatedly self-consistently. In their simulations, they changed the density scale length of preplasmas, corresponding to different laser contrasts and found that the preplasmas in the cone had significant effects on laser-to-core coupling (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2015b</xref>), which may explain the discrepancy found in different experiments with the cone scheme (Key et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2008</xref>; Theobald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2011</xref>; Shiraga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2011</xref>). To reduce the preplasma effect, they proposed the MA fast ignition scheme using a cone-free target supplemented by an external 20-megagauss magnetic field to guide the fast electron motion (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2015b</xref>). It was found that laser-to-core coupling with this scheme can reach 14%, which is much higher than that without the magnetic field and that with the cone scheme, typically at around 2 and 6%, respectively. More recent simulations suggest that fusion ignition conditions may be reached with heating lasers at the 30Â kJ level (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Some progress in block ignition scheme was presented by Wang [L-I3]. Fusion reactions of protons with the boron isotope 11 (HB11) can be considerably enhanced when PW laser pulses in picosecond duration are used to ignite fusion in a non-thermal way by direct conversion of laser energy into acceleration of plasma blocks, which have charge neutrality (Hora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). This block acceleration was discovered before (Sauerbrey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1996</xref>), which may be used to solve the difficulties of the HB11 reaction (Hora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>). Preliminary experimental results were reported by some European groups (Picciotto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2014</xref>). A further improvement is due to measurements of an avalanche reaction (Hora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>) that was explained by elastic nuclear collisions in non-equilibrium plasmas (Eliezer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Furthermore, properties of the plasma explosion process were studied recently by Wangâs group with multi-fluid hydrodynamics and PIC simulation (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2017a</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Shigemori [L-I23] presented a talk on a new type of ablators for direct-drive ICF targets. Both the neutron yield and areal density for ICF ignition depend significantly on the level of laser imprinting (Nora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2014</xref>). To mitigate the laser imprinting, investigations were carried out previously by thermal smoothing (Obenschain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2002</xref>; Karasik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>; Nishikino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2002</xref>). However, thermal smoothing is not effective either for long wavelength perturbations or when the effective separation distance between laser absorption region and ablation front is small in very early timing. Recently, they performed experimental investigation on the effects of diamond strength on surface perturbation due to the irradiation non-uniformity.

Significant progress has been made in the last two decades in this area, which was built upon the new understanding of the related physics and the technical development of ultrashort high-power lasers and plasma targets. Currently, major efforts are being made for the improvement of the electron beam quality (low energy spread, small emittance, high stability) (Esarey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>), enhancement of beam energy (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2013</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2013</xref>; Leemans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2014</xref>), and the development of various radiation sources from the accelerated electrons for applications (Giulietti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">With multi-PW laser pulses, LWFA has the possibility to produce over 10-GeV electron beams in a single stage with an acceleration distance of a few tens of centimeters. With conventional linear accelerators, it requires kilometer scale of acceleration distance to obtain the same energy level. In the plenary talk, Kim [P 7] presented an overview of LWFA and relevant activities at the Center for Relativistic Laser Science (CoReLS) in Gwangju, Korea. Multi-GeV beams have been demonstrated in the last few years (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2017</xref>). Recently, one of the two PW beamlines has been upgraded to a 4-PW 20-fs laser to explore relativistic laserâplasma interactions and strong field QED effects (Sung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2017</xref>). The interaction chamber for LWFA was upgraded to accommodate the 4-PW laser pulses and performed commissioning experiments in 2017. In the commissioning experiments, electron beams atâ~â4.5Â GeV with an energy spread about 20% was obtained by focusing a positively chirped 30-fs 52-J laser pulse by F/50 spherical mirror on a 7Â cm gas medium at the density of 1.5âÃâ10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.

The mixed gas will be used to test ionization injection for reduced beam energy spread and higher electron energy over 10Â GeV, which can be applied to generate bright gamma rays by Compton backscattering as well as to investigate the strong field QED effects via the laser electron collision.</p><p id="Par16">In the plenary talk, Hosokai [P21] reported the status of the LWFA research project under the ImPACT-UPL Program in Japan. This 5-year program starting from 2014 was funded by Japanese government for promoting innovative and high-impact R and Ds. As one of the projects of this program, Project 1 on LWFA and XFEL aims to realize repeatable GeV class accelerator with the staging LWFA scheme. With electron energy gain over 1Â GeV in 10Â cm, energy spread less than 1%, beam divergence less than 1Â mm mrad, the beam could be used to generate 1Â keV X-ray beam by a microundulator with a length of 10Â cm or less. Plasma micro-optics (PMO) as one of key techniques for stable beam generation provide excellent stability of electron beams (Mizuta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2012</xref>; Nakanii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2015</xref>), which can be produced by laser prepulses.

In the talk given by Hua [L-I8], it was reported that a high-energy (70Â MeV) fs LWFA electron beam can be used to probe the field structure of plasma wake. The highly transient, microscopic wakefield is reconstructed from the density-modulated ultrashort probe bunch after it has traversed the wake. This technique enables visualization of wakefield and its evolution in low-density plasmas, and is a new diagnostic tool for the study of wakefield acceleration (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Li and Leng [L-I9] reported their progresses on LWFA at Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (SIOM), CAS. Based on the front end of 10Â PW laser, they built a 200Â TW/1â5Â Hz Ti: sapphire laser system with good performance for driving LWFA. In particular, they had demonstrated the generation of high-brightness electron beams from a 2-stage LWFA, the maximum 6-D brightnessââ¼â6.5âÃâ10<sup>15</sup>Â A/m<sup>2</sup>/0.1% with charge 10â80Â pC in the energy range of 200ââ¼â600Â MeV (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2016</xref>), which is comparable with the state-of-the-art LINAC drivers.

Two optimized ionization injection schemes had been proposed and demonstrated via numerical simulation. By use of certain initially unmatched laser pulses, the electron injection can be constrained to the very front region of the mixed gas target, typically in a length of a few hundreds of micro meters determined by laser-driven bubble deformation. As a result, the final electron energy spread is largely reduced. It is called self-truncated ionization injection (Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2014</xref>), which was demonstrated experimentally in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Mirzaie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2015</xref>; Hafz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>). In the second scheme, using two laser pulses with fundamental frequency and high harmonics co-propagating in a gas target, ionization injection can be further controlled by proper choice of the two laser field amplitudes. Due to the phase velocity difference of the two color pulses, the injection length can be controlled within a short distance of few tens of micrometers. Electron beam with ultralow energy spread less than one percent was demonstrated numerically (Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Zhang [L-I20] presented an X-ray laser-driven wakefield accelerator in a nanotube to further increase the acceleration gradient as compared to normal LWFA driven by lasers in optical wavelength. It has been proposed before that electron acceleration gradients can be much enhanced to the TeV/cm level when the wakefield is driven in metallic crystal (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1986</xref>; Tajima and Cavenago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">1987</xref>). Here the wakefield is induced by a coherent, ultrashort X-ray pulse guided by a nanoscale channel inside a solid material. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that an acceleration gradient of TeV/cm is attainable, which is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the normal plasma-based wakefield accelerations in low-density plasma. In addition to particle acceleration, the scheme can also produce high energy photons at tens of MeV (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2016b</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Associated with LWFA in plasma, Sengupta [L-I7] presented their theoretical work on the breaking of relativistically intense longitudinal waves in plasma. They found that the wavebreaking occurs via a process called phase mixing. Phase mixing results in crossing of neighboring electron orbits due to the temporal dependence of phase difference between oscillating electrons. This temporal dependence of the phase difference between neighboring oscillating electrons can be caused by the background density inhomogeneity and/or relativistic mass variation effects. In particular, they found that the longitudinal AkhiezerâPolovin wave breaks via phase mixing at the amplitude well below its wavebreaking limit when it is longitudinally perturbed. Therefore, they believe that experiments depending on AkhiezerâPolovin wavebreaking limit for their interpretation may require revisiting. They further found that longitudinal waves in warm plasma also break via the process of phase mixing. A series of work had been published by their group on this topic (Verma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2012</xref>; Sengupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2011</xref>; Mukherjee and Sengupta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Laser plasma-based radiation and plasma photonics</title><p id="Par22">Based upon LWFA-produced electron beams, X- and gamma rays can be produced in plasma.

With the laser pulse off-axially injected in a straight channel, the centroid oscillation of the laser pulse causes a wiggler motion of the whole accelerating structure including the trapped electrons, leading to strong synchrotron-like radiations with tunable spectra and with controllable polarization of the produced X-rays (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2016</xref>). It was further shown that a ring-shaped synchrotron was possible in a curved plasma channel. Due to the intense acceleration and bending fields inside plasmas, the central part of the sources could be made within palm size, which is attractive for applications. Recent studies suggest that a curved plasma channel can be applied to staged LWFA for high-energy electron accelerators (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Besides wakefield-based X-ray radiation sources, Qiao [L-I30] presented their studies on the brilliant gamma ray emission from near-critical plasma with ultra-intense laser pulses.

By irradiating ultra-intense ultrashort laser pulses on nanosized cluster targets, protons were accelerated to a few MeV due to Coulomb explosion (Murakami and Mima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2009</xref>). In particular, the cluster targets were made of two or three atomic components to produce quasi-monoenergetic protons. The 50â100Â nm sized spherical targets were optimized in structure to provide a quasi-monoenergetic proton source, where the conversion efficiency from absorbed energy to proton kinetic energy amounts was as high as 30%. Neutrons are generated via the reactions between lithium and the protons. Optimizing the laser and target parameters, they maximized the coupling efficiency of neutron yields. A most salient feature of the optimized target is the hollow structure. As long as the quasi-monoenergetic proton beam overlapped with the peak of p-Li reaction rate, one can maximize the neutron production rate.

They demonstrated that high-contrast multi-picosecond pulses were advantageous for proton acceleration. Laser-driven ion acceleration with the laser intensity ranging from 10<sup>18</sup> to 10<sup>22</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup> is predominantly governed by the absorption mechanism of laser energy into hot electrons. In their experiment, it was found that the plasma electrons were heated beyond the typical scaling law (Yogo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2017</xref>), which is often considered to be at the ponderomotive potential (Kemp and Divol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2012</xref>). The experiment was performed using LFEX laser of Institute of Laser Engineering (ILE), Osaka University, which provides four beams of 1.5Â ps (FWHM) duration. By setting intervals of 1.5Â ps between the four pulses, the overall pulse duration becomes 3Â ps when two pulses are used and it becomes 6Â ps when four pulses are used. The maximum laser energy in total was 1Â kJ (250Â J for each laser beam) and the intensity was 2.3âÃâ10<sup>18</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> on the target. The focal spot diameter was set to be 60Â Âµm (FWHM), which made a beneficial effect on the electron recirculation around the target. When they expanded the pulse duration of the laser from 1.5 to 3Â ps at the fixed laser intensity, the electron temperature was drastically enhanced up to 1.1Â MeV, exceeding the ponderomotive potential around 0.2Â MeV for the laser intensity of 2.3âÃâ10<sup>18</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>.

By combining four beamlets with a small angle, hence having the interference patterns at the overlapping point, the laser absorption and the conversion efficiency from laser to hot electrons were much better than those with only one beam under the same laser energy and intensity. The four LFEX laser beamlets were focused on a 5Â Âµm Al foil followed by a single beamlet focused on the same type of target in different shots. A significantly higher hot electron temperature and proton peak energy, as well as laser-to-electron/proton energy conversion efficiency were measured in case of the four interfering beamlets.

For more than a decade, they have performed laboratory experiments in connection with astrophysical phenomena, to improve the understanding of radiation hydrodynamics (Vinci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2005</xref>) and to validate numerical schemes and assumptions in simulations. Their recent experiments focused on highly radiative shocks in interaction with solid obstacles (Koenig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2017</xref>) (impact for molecular clouds physics) and RayleighâTaylor instabilities (RTI) that play a major role in astrophysical fluid dynamics. First, the highly radiative shocks in their experiments were generated in a low-density gas-filled cell obtained on the GEKKO XII laser facility. The shock waves were generated using an ablator-pusher target (CH/Au/Ti), designed to limit as much as possible the preheating produced by the hot corona. The propagation media was Xe or He gas, with the aim to compare radiative effect in each medium. High-velocity shock waves were generated (100â140Â km/s) with a clear influence of a radiative precursor on a spherical obstacle mimicking interaction with molecular clouds. Regarding the RTI instabilities, they might be responsible for the absence of spherical symmetry in the shape of the supernova remnant, and might affect the dissipation of the energy. Currently, models are often not accurate enough, as even the late-time behavior of a single-mode RTI is not well-known. In this context, they performed an experiment on LULI2000 to deepen our knowledge on highly nonlinear RTI. The two media for the development of the instabilities were, respectively, brominated plastic and low-density foam. The interface was initially modulated (120Â Âµm wavelength with 20Â Âµm in amplitude). X-Ray radiograph using Pico2000 (80Â J, 1Â ps) was performed. In both cases, 2D radiative hydrodynamic simulations were performed with the FLASH code developed at Univ. Chicago.</p><p id="Par38">Cho [L-I2] from GIST in Korea reported the study of warm dense plasmas with ultrafast X-rays. Series of time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy experiments were performed to investigate thermal properties and bonding of several elements in warm dense matter (WDM) conditions, where the thermal energy is comparable to the Fermi energy and the ions are strongly coupled. For warm dense Cu, the electronâion relaxation was determined experimentally, and compared with various theoretical models. The electronâphonon couplings were temperature dependent and enhanced by a factor of 4âââ6 compared to previously known value (Cho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). For SiO<sub>2</sub>, dynamics of SiâO bond braking and a creation of electronic states within the band gap were observed. These provide a description of how SiO<sub>2</sub> transforms from an insulator with well-defined local structure to a high-temperature liquid with reduced SiâO bonding (Engelhorn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Jakubowska [I-I32] reported the generation of high pressure in aluminum by femtosecond laser irradiation. The talk reported about results obtained in a recent experiment at the LOA using a Ti:Sa laser for the creation of strong shocks using short-pulse lasers. The produced shock pressure can initially be in excess of 100 Mbar even if it is not maintained in time due to the short duration of the laser pulse. Indeed, the generated shock immediately becomes a blast wave, i.e., a pressure pulse that travels in the material and gradually decreases its pressure. Blast waves are important in physics being present in a variety of phenomena: nuclear explosions, astrophysics (i.e., supernovae explosions), and hydrodynamics. For this reason, blast waves generated by short-pulse relatively high-intensity lasers had already been studied in gases. Works had focused on generating high Mach number blast waves (Edens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>), studying deflagration and detonation (Yoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2008</xref>) and realizing experiments in the framework of laboratory astrophysics (Moore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2005</xref>). Blast waves were also observed in solids (Budil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>) using a very high-energy petawatt laser at Livermore, where the involved mechanism was not discussed in detail. In the experiment by Jakubowska and collaborators, a laser system delivering 3Â J in 24Â fs pulses with a 10<sup>8</sup> contrast was focused at <italic>I</italic>â~â10<sup>21</sup>W/cm<sup>2</sup> on Al flat targets of different thicknesses 3, 6, 10, 15, and 50Â Âµm. A streak camera was looking at the emission from target rear side. The analysis of the streak camera signal reveals a signal with three different phases: (1) a rapid emission following the passage of the hot electrons (due to thermal heating and to optical transition radiation), (2) a thermal decay due to plasma expansion and cooling, and (3) a final thermal emission peak. The transit time between two emission peaks corresponds to a supersonic velocity, supporting the evidence for shock wave generation. The work done to analyze the experimental results was divided into two steps. In the first step, a semi-analytical model was used to calculate the energy deposition of hot electrons in the target and the building of the temperature gradient, taking into account hot electron production by the relativistic intense lasers and hot electron transport. In the second step, this temperature gradient was used as input parameter for 2D hydrodynamics simulations performed with the code CHIC (Maire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>; Breil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Simulations show different interesting phenomena like the propagation of the blast wave, and the rapid expansion of the material due to the hot electron-induced strong preheating. The two effects, reduction of density (implying an acceleration of the shock wave) and reduction of blast wave pressure (implying a deceleration) compensate each other resulting in a blast wave moving at constant velocity in the expanding material.</p><p id="Par40">Batani [L-O6] reported their work on the refraction index of shock-compressed water in the megabar pressure range. The study of matter in extreme states is interesting from many fields of physics going from laboratory astrophysics to inertial confinement fusion (Batani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). One particularly interesting material in the field planetological research is water, which is one of the main components of the mantles of giant planets like Uranus and Neptune (as well as of many recently discovered extra-solar planets). The observation of large and non-symmetric magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune has attired interest toward the phase diagram of water at very high pressure, and the possible transitions towards conducting states (either metallic or superionic). In this context, they presented results on water with different phases and the variation of its refraction index as pressure and temperature increases (due to the action of laser-driven shock waves) (Batani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>). Results for the refraction index of water can be grouped into three different categories: lower pressure and temperature (approximately <italic>P</italic>â~â0.4 Mbar and <italic>T</italic>â~â0.2Â eV), higher pressure and temperature (<italic>P</italic>â~â1 Mbar, <italic>T</italic>â~â0.5Â eV), and high pressures at lower temperature (<italic>P</italic>â~â1.2 Mbar, <italic>T</italic>â~â0.3Â eV). The experimental results were compared to theoretical calculations performed at CEA via the quantum molecular dynamic calculations with the ABINIT-ATOMPAW code (Holzwarth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>). The optical conductivity was obtained by applying the KuboâGreenwood formula (Mazevet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2010</xref>). Theoretical calculations produce results in the same ranges of observed experimental results and are in qualitative agreements with them. Finally, they interpolated theoretical and experimental results using an extended LorentzâDrude model.</p><p id="Par41">Short-pulse-induced hydrodynamic can be roughly divided into two regimes (Pasley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2017</xref>): (1) hydro driven directly by the laser [e.g., hole boring/radiation pressure (RP) driven]; or (2) hydro driven indirectly by pressure gradients induced by heating. It is relevant to inertial fusion energy (IFE) in the areas addressing fast ignitor hotspot, fast ignitor cone-tip physics and structured collimators. In addition, short pulses enable creating extreme conditions, which may be relevant to issues in IFE and elsewhere in HED physics: (a) ICF hotspot dynamics, (b) studies of high-temperature opacity and EOS. In these cases, the hydro may or may not be a desirable feature of the short-pulse interaction. Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior under the influence of a short pulse is however vital to designing such experiments. A range of different hydrodynamic effects may arise due to the illumination of a target with a short-pulse laser. Hydrodynamics in dense plasmas at sub-RP intensities is driven predominantly by pressure gradients. Modeling is challenging requiring a range of different codes to tackle the different stages of the interaction (prepulse, main pulse, later motion). In the meanwhile, few diagnostics are capable of resolving hydrodynamic behavior occurring on picosecond timescales. In addition, high-energy short-pulse laser plasma interactions generate intense competing ânoiseâ signal, further complicating diagnosis. Pasley [L-I28] presented their study of the hydrodynamics induced on thin solid targets by the irradiation with ultra high-intensity short-pulse lasers. This work was carried out through collaboration with collaborators in TIFR in India and RAL in the UK. At TIFR, short-pulse-driven hydro has been measured directly in the lab with a pump-probe configuration, using 400Â nm probe to record hydrodynamics driven by 800Â nm pump beam (30Â fs) at moderately high intensity (5âÃâ10<sup>16</sup> to 1.5âÃâ10<sup>17</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>). This has allowed showing the generation of strong shocks and also how shock strength depends on the level of laser pre-pulse (therefore we can âcontrolâ shock strength by changing the prepulse). Markedly higher velocities achieved in the case of high-contrast interaction (Adak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). The generation of acoustic waves was observed with Doppler spectroscopy measurements with a temporal resolution of around 100 femtoseconds. Measurements with very high temporal resolution reveal unexpected oscillatory behavior in the reflectivity. Combined reflectivity and Doppler measurements could be explained by an approximately sinusoidal density disturbance propagating down the density gradient through the probed density contour (Adak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). The source of such a disturbance at the appropriate frequency (hundreds of GHz) was found by looking at simulation results. Simulations revealed that the prompt heating of the preformed plasma (picosecond contrast isâ~â10<sup>â4</sup>, nanosecond contrast isâ~â10<sup>â8</sup>) results in a velocity flow gradient. This drives the acoustic modulations.</p><p id="Par42">In experiments carried at RAL using the VULCAN PW laser at <italic>I</italic>â~â2.5âÃâ10<sup>20</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> (duration 700Â fs, energy 300Â J) and planar target (three layers: XÂ Âµm CHâ0.2Â Âµm Alâ4Â Âµm CH where the thickness of the front layer was varied between 4 and 64Â Âµm), the emission from the rear side of the target was measured (not directly illuminated by the laser) in the XUV range using XUV multilayer mirrors (Lancaster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>). Emission shows a characteristic âholeyâ shape, particularly strong in the case of targets with 4Â Âµm CH at front. Calculations show that the formation of a ring-like emission pattern is a stable feature of these experiments. Different codes have been used for the rad-hydro modeling (Hyades, h2d and FLASH). They show that the ring-like emission is most pronounced (and similar to the experiment) when a compression wave is formed: pressures in these waves can run to hundreds of Mbar. Also, the radius of the ring-like emission structure formed is dependent on injection properties of the electron beam.</p><p id="Par43">Hu [L-I29] reported their work on laserâs interaction with magnetized plasma. A magnetized laser plasma facility was built at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), which is composed of a nanosecond heating laser beam (6Â J/527Â nm/7Â ns), a femtosecond detecting laser beam (2Â mJ/800Â nm/50Â fs), and a 7â30Â T pulsed magnetic field generator (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). A series of laser plasma evolution experiments were performed (Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2018</xref>). First, when a high-speed plasma stream produced by laser ablated solid target expands in an external transverse magnetic field, an asymmetric hollow plasma bubble is formed. Hall MHD simulation shows that the asymmetry of the bubble is induced by the Hall effect. Second, the enhanced laser ablation by the external 7Â T magnetic field was observed in plasma optical images. The target surface, which contacts the plasma bubble, is heated by the energy transport along the surface of the plasma bubble. Thus, the debris and the target surface surrounding the laser focus spot are ablated and increases the plasma generation. Finally, when an external magnetic field was added along the laser channel in underdense plasma, the electron thermal transport was found to be suppressed by the magnetic field, which enhances the plasma temperature. This may be applied to restrain the stimulated scattering process in laser fusion. They found that 20â30Â T external magnetic field was needed to mitigate the stimulated scattering process on Chinaâs SG-III prototype laser facility.</p><p id="Par44">X-ray diagnostics of high-energy density states of matter are critical in this area. Zhao [L-O2] reported an experimental study of K-shell absorption spectra in dense plasma. Highly compressed warm dense matter and hot dense plasma are relevant to the states of matter in planetary interiors and inertial confinement fusion. In their work, X-ray radiation-driven shocks driven by the SG-II laser facility were adopted to generate the dense plasma under high pressure (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2012</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2017</xref>). In their experiment on warm dense matter, colliding shocks driven by laser-converted radiation were used to compress aluminum/silicon to over twice solid density and low temperature below 1.0Â eV. X-ray absorption spectra were obtained, which provided direct information about the density, temperature, electronic, and ionic structures of dense matter. The measured K-shell edge was compared to quantum molecular dynamics calculations. In their hot dense plasma experiment, the aluminum sample was heated by M-band emission and compressed by radiation-driven shocks. The time-resolved 1Â s-2p absorption features from F-like to C-like ions were observed in series with the radiation ablating.</p><p id="Par45">Pikuz [L-O1] reported new diagnostics development for pump-probe experiments, which combine pulsed power lasers as pump and XFEL beams as probe to investigate the transient behavior of solid materials such as lattice dynamics. This requires proper monitoring of shock wave strength, stability of shock wave generation, initial structure of used targets and homogeneity of XFEL probe beam. A few methods have been proposed and tested to control these parameters (Pikuz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2016</xref>; Ruiz-Lopez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Huang [L-O4] reported simulation studies on electron energy spectrum produced in magnetic reconnection in laser-produced plasma. Based upon their 2D PIC simulation, it was found that magnetic reconnection in laser-produced plasma can be divided into two stages, squeezing stage and reconnection stage (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2016</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">b</xref>). In the first stage, due to the expanding and squeezing of the two plasma bubbles, the toroidal magnetic field is enhanced, especially in the colliding region. The magnetic field enhancement leads to a large Alfven speed, which is responsible for the rapid reconnection in the second stage. Two kinds of electron acceleration mechanisms are involved in the two stages, the betatron mechanism and the Fermi-like acceleration. After these acceleration processes, the electron energy spectrum shows a Maxwellian distribution at low energy and a power-law distribution at high energy.</p><p id="Par47">Under very different laser parameters from those studies mentioned above in this section, Ji [L-I31] reported their investigation on near-QED regime of laser interaction with overdense plasma. Laser plasma interaction in the near-QED regime (10<sup>22</sup>â10<sup>25</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>) exhibits exotic features other than relativity. While this regime is not yet accessible in laboratories at the moment, PIC simulation provides the most powerful tool to explore the new physics therein. They did full 3D PIC simulations to systematically investigate the interaction process at such extreme intensities and found that radiation of electrons in the laser field could fundamentally change the particle dynamics (Ji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">c</xref>). First, electrons transfer a significant fraction of their energy to radiation, producing MeV gamma photons at a very high efficiency. Thus, the laser energy absorption channel is notably tuned in a way that electrons get less portion of energy from the laser while photons obtain more, as the laser intensity rises. Second, electrons experience strong feedbacks due to radiation reaction (RR) force. They show that the RR force could be strong enough to compensate for the expelling laser ponderomotive force, so that electrons can be trapped inside the laser pulse instead of being scattered off. This anomalous trapping mechanism leads to a dense plasma bunch confined within the most intense region of the laser beam, which may be measured in experiments in the future. Furthermore, these confined electrons fiercely emit gamma photons at efficiencies up to 35%. Therefore, ultra-bright gamma ray emission becomes the most prominent feature in such laser plasma interaction. The threshold for radiation reaction trapping of electrons is shown to be proportional to the cubic root of the ratio between the laser wavelength and the classical electron radius. In the presence of plasma, this threshold can be significantly lowered down to about 10<sup>23</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>. In a proper interaction geometry, they found that it might be possible to observe RR effect at 10<sup>22</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> intensity level by doing laser electron collision using one single laser beam irradiating a micro-channel structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Development of high-power laser systems for relativistic laser plasmas</title><p id="Par48">High-power laser systems are critical for all applications from laser fusion, laser-driven particle acceleration, to high-energy density physics and laboratory astrophysics (Danson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>).

Earlier in 2015, the generation of 192.3Â J laser pulse from a 150Â mm in diameter Ti:Sapphire crystal was demonstrated (Chu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). In 2016, a novel temporal dual-pulse scheme was developed to suppress the parasitic lasing (PL) and transverse amplified spontaneous emission (TASE). The maximum output energy of 202.8Â J was obtained from the 150Â mm diameter Ti:S booster amplifier with a pump energy of 320.0Â J, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 49.3%. The compressed pulse duration of 24.0Â fs was measured with a throughput efficiency of 64%, leading to a peak power of 5.4Â PW (Gan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>). The contrast is 10<sup>â10</sup> about 50Â ps before the main pulse based on the single shot contrast measure method (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2017b</xref>). In the end of 2016, this temporal dual-pulse pump technique was used in the 235Â mm Ti:Sapphire to generate 339Â J laser pulses, which is the largest Ti:Sapphire crystal and maximum output energy from Ti:Sapphire amplifier. It was estimated that it could support the 10Â PW peak power output. Besides the 10Â PW laser project based on Ti:Sapphire crystal, they also had demonstrated a 1Â PW OPCPA laser amplifier based on a 100Â mm size Lithium triborate (LiB3O5 or LBO) crystal (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2015</xref>).

The contrast of the generated pulses is better than 10<sup>12</sup> and the final focused intensity is higher than 10<sup>22</sup>Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Such laser performance can lead to significant progress in physical experiments. The key features of the J-KAREN-P laser system architecture are: (1) the high-contrast front end source based on a combination of some saturable absorbers and low gain OPCPA configuration, (2) the main amplification composed of four moderate gain Ti:Sapphire amplifiers, employing simple off-axis beam expanders with low aberration, (3) the adaptive control of the residual spectral phase based on a high dynamic range Dazzler and the active wavefront correction based on a deformable mirror, (4) the main compressor stage based on four high-quality large-sized gold gratings. Using a 120Â mm diameter Ti:Sapphire crystal and the total pump energy at a 0.1Â Hz repetition rate, the maximum output energy of 63Â J was achieved with an incident energy of 92Â J.
