To make a compromise decision, comparing PFSs is essential. Several approaches were introduced for comparison, e.g., distance measures and similarity measures. Nevertheless, extant measures have several defects that can produce counter-intuitive results, since they treat any increase or decrease in the membership degree the same as the non-membership degree; although each parameter has a different implication. This study introduces the differential measure (DFM) as a new approach for comparing PFSs. The main purpose of the DFM is to eliminate the unfair arguments resulting from the equal treatment of the contradicting parameters of a PFS. It is a preference relation between two PFSs by virtue of position in the attribute space and according to the closeness of their membership and non-membership degrees. Two PFSs are classified as identical, equivalent, superior, or inferior to one another giving the degree of superiority or inferiority. The basic properties of the proposed DFM are given. A novel method for multiple criteria group decision-making is proposed based on the introduced DFM. A new technique for computing the weights of the experts is developed. The proposed method is applied to solve two applications, the evaluation of solid-state drives and the selection of the best photovoltaic cell. The results are compared with the results of some extant methods to illustrate the applicability and validity of the method. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine its stability and practicality.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Multi-criteria group

making these complex interrelated decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Managers are under continuous pressure to account for the challenges and opportunities that exist in such a competitive environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. They need to address all the issues associated with their decisions. This task can have a direct impact on the effectiveness as well as the efficiency of the decision-making processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, in the analysis of practical decision problems, it is difficult to meet the requirements in dealing with complex decision-making problems by expressing the preferences of experts through accurate values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Multiple criteria decision‐making (MCDM) is a branch of operations research and an advanced mathematical tool that explicitly evaluates the feasible alternatives over conflicting multiple criteria in decision‐making to identify the optimal solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As it is usually challenging for a single individual to take all the sides of a problem into full consideration due to the increasing complexity of decision contexts, group decision-making (GDM) becomes necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Group decision‐making (GDM) is a process in which multiple individuals interact simultaneously to analyze problems, evaluate the possible available alternatives characterized by multiple conflicting criteria, and choose a suitable alternative solution to the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In consequence, multiple criteria group decision-making techniques (MCGDM) have been proposed to consider the opinion of different decision-makers/managers with distinct skills and varied knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The fuzzy theory was first introduced by Zadeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to imitate human reasoning and cognition. It has been widely investigated due to its strong ability to deal with complex nonlinearities and to model systems with uncertain parameters in practical applications, e.g., fault detection for security-critical engineering, for instance, wind turbine, power network, and nuclear industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It also proved to be successful in handling some of the aforementioned difficulties in the decision processes and became a cornerstone in the development of innovative, robust, and flexible MCDM methods for making better business decisions. It also encouraged researchers to propose several extensions and generalizations of fuzzy sets to cope with the increasing complexity of imprecision and vagueness associated with various practical applications. For example, neutrosophic fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], hesitant fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], picture fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and spherical fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, several variants of each type have been proposed, e.g., the bipolar neutrosophic sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], complex single-valued neutrosophic sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the dual hesitant fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and the complex spherical fuzzy sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Each of these sets has its characteristics, and the employment of these sets in diverse applications depends mainly on the application and the uncertainty and ambiguity of the information. Various MCDM and MCGDM methods that utilize diverse fuzzy sets have been utilized in solving various applications, e.g., economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], green supplier selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, MCDM methods played a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are one of the most prominent extensions. IFSs were initially introduced by Atanassov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to generalize the concept of fuzzy sets. Instead of giving the degree of membership only to an element in a given set, an IFS gives a degree of membership and a degree of non-membership. The sum of these two parameters is less than or equal to one. Yager and Abbasov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Yager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] proposed Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) as an advanced development of IFSs. The main purpose is to enlarge the value range of the preference information. Similar to IFSs, PFSs are characterized by the same two parameters expressing the degrees of membership and non-membership. However, the sum of the squares of these two parameters is equal to or less than one. Therefore, PFSs provide a wider domain and are more capable of modeling vagueness and uncertainty in various practical applications. PFSs can also interpret human preference and non-preference information in a broader sense.</p><p id="Par6">The suitability of PFSs for expressing ambiguous information has attained many researchers’ attention. Remarkable contributions in the family of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methods have been made utilizing PF information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Zhang and Xu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] presented an extension of TOPSIS method in the PF context with applications. Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] developed a PF hierarchical QUALIFLEX approach with application in risk evaluation of strategic emerging industries. Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] made a case study on selecting the governor of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank utilizing a TODIM approach that handles PF-MCGDM problems. Wan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] proposed a three-phase group decision-making method using PF information with a haze management example. Akram et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] extended the ELECTRE-I method using PFSs in a group decision-making environment with applications in health safety and environment management. Akram et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] developed a two-phase Pythagorean fuzzy version of ELECTRE III method to take full advantage of the capabilities of PFSs.</p><p id="Par7">In the Pythagorean fuzzy environment, measuring the difference between PFSs plays an important role in inference problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Therefore, several approaches were proposed for estimating the difference. The most salient methods are distance measures and similarity measures.</p><p id="Par8">Similarity measures were introduced as an important and useful tool to find the degree of similarity between two objects. Several functions were proposed to express the degree of similarity between sets and were applied in different applications, e.g., physical anthropology, automatic classification, ecology, psychology, information retrieval, medical diagnosis, and pattern recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The similarity measure is one of the research hotspots in fuzzy set theory. It is also known to be an important tool in MCDM. The most commonly applied similarity measures are Jaccard, Dice, and the cosine similarity measures. Up till now, similarity measures determine how much two PFSs are similar or dissimilar, but they do not differentiate the PFSs based on the dissimilarity, i.e., they measure how much they are similar but do not reveal which one is better and to what extent.</p><p id="Par9">Similarity and distance measures are two faces of a coin. Most similarity measures are based on distance measures. Comparing two PFSs depends to a large extent on both measures. Although many studies proposed several distance measures, still extant distance measures have some flaws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. First, they can produce counter-intuitive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Second, they might fail to derive the maximum distance measure value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This will influence the ranking values of the alternatives and produce false results. Therefore, one of the open issues in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment is how to measure the distance between two PFSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Up to now, the extant distance approaches that have been proposed in the literature compute precise distance measures for PFSs. According to Habib et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], how can we be sure about the distances between PFSs, while we cannot be sure about the sets themselves? Then, it is not acceptable to specify exact distances between PFSs.</p><p id="Par11">The main defect in the extant measures can be attributed to the treatment of the parameters of a PFS equally, although each parameter has a different influence, i.e., an increase in the membership degree has the same influence as an increase in the non-membership degree, although the former is an advantage and the latter is a disadvantage. Hence, it is important to find a discrimination method that preserves the identity of each parameter of a PFS to avoid the deficiencies of both distance and similarity measures that result in counter-intuitive results.</p><p id="Par12">Since the two parameters of a PFS, the membership <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In this attribute space, a new concept is proposed to differentiate PFSs, the differential measure (DFM).</p><p id="Par13">In this article, the concept of differential measure (DFM) is introduced as a new approach for comparing PFSs. It is a preference relation between two PFSs by virtue of position in the attribute space and according to the closeness of their membership and non-membership degrees. The extant distance measures and similarity measures have several drawbacks due to the equal treatment of the membership (support) and non-membership degree (opposition), although each direction has a different implication. The DFM utilizes signed distance to account for the impact of each component of a Pythagorean fuzzy assessment. An increment in the support direction is considered a positive step, while an increment in the opposition direction is considered a negative step. Since similarity measures indicate how much two PFSs are similar and do not reveal which one is better and, to what extent, the DFM can better indicate the discrimination degree of PFSs when making a decision. Two Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) are classified as identical, equivalent, superior, or inferior to one another, giving the degree of superiority or inferiority. A new method for MCGDM is proposed based on the introduced DFM. Furthermore, a new technique for computing the weights of the experts is developed. Two practical problems, namely, the evaluation of solid-state drives and the selection of the best photovoltaic cell, are solved in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment using the proposed method. Then, the applicability and feasibility of the model developed in this article are demonstrated by comparison with some existing techniques. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to illustrate its stability and practicality. Consequently, the contribution of this study is triple manifold.</p><p id="Par14">Since PFSs are more flexible than IFSs to deal with absurdness and uncertainty and to cope with human evaluation information, it is necessary to pay more attention to group decision‐making in this context.

Information measures encompass several approaches, such as distance measures, similarity measures, entropy, inclusion measures, divergence measure, and correlation coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Comparison methods include score functions, accuracy functions, closeness index, and comparison value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

The similarity measures are used mainly to differentiate between different fuzzy sets. Most of the proposed similarity measures are derived from distance measures.</p><p id="Par22">Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] developed a novel decision method based on a new similarity measure to address MCDM problems in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] investigated the relationship between the distance measures, the similarity measures, the entropy, and the inclusion measures for PFSs. They proposed some information measures for PFSs with their applications. Qin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] introduced new distance measures for PFSs and employed them in a MCDM application. Peng and Dai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] initiated a new axiomatic definition of the Pythagorean fuzzy distance measure which is expressed by a PFS reducing the information loss and retaining more original information.</p><p id="Par23">Wei and Wei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] proposed ten similarity measures between two PFSs using the cosine function and applied these similarity measures to pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. Biswas and Sarkar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] proposed a series of similarity measures based on point operators for Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Chen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] presented a flexible and multipurpose definition of a distance measure for PFSs based on the Minkowski distance model. Li and Zeng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] proposed several distance measures for PFSs which takes into account the four parameters that can be used to define a PFS, namely, the degree of membership, the degree of non-membership, the strength of commitment, and the direction of commitment. Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] also proposed a variety of distance measures incorporating five parameters this time, the previous four parameters together with the indeterminacy degree. They also presented some similarity measures based on these distance measures.</p><p id="Par24">Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] presented some novel Dice similarity measures for PFSs to handle pattern recognition, citation analysis, information retrieval, and multiple attribute decision-making. Hussian and Yang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] proposed some distance measures based on the Hausdorff metric and developed some similarity measures using these distance measures.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] examined the use of Pythagorean fuzzy distances and similarity measures in a minimum spanning tree agglomerative hierarchical clustering method.</p><p id="Par25">The Pythagorean fuzzy entropy (PFE) is used to measure fuzziness and uncertainty occurring in a PFS. High entropy indicates more information in the process; a high entropy value represents low uncertainty. The PFE is mainly used in Pythagorean fuzzy MCDM to determine the objective weights of the criteria which are essential in the evaluation of alternatives. Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] proposed a PFE relying on the axiomatic definition of Burillo and Bustince [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] of entropy for IFSs. Wan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] defined a PFE as inspired by the entropy definition of IFSs introduced by Szmidt and Kacprzyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Xue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] proposed a PFE grounded on the similarity and hesitancy parts where the similarity part and the hesitancy part reflect the fuzziness and uncertainty of PFSs, respectively. Yang and Hussain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] proposed new PFEs based on probability type, distance, Pythagorean index, and min–max operation. Gandotra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] proposed a new entropy measure for PFSs determined by the notion of Wang et al.

Thao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] developed a formula for calculating the correlation coefficient based on the variance and covariance of PFSs. Due to some flaws in these correlation coefficients, Singh and Ganie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] proposed novel correlation measures that avoid these flaws and applied these measures to pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, MCDM, and clustering analysis. Ejegwa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] proposed a tri-parametric correlation coefficient, a generalization of Garg’s correlation coefficient, for a better output in resolving MCDM problems in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Ejegwa and Jana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] improved Garg’s methods of computing weighted correlation coefficients for PFSs to be more reliable with better performance indices than the existing ones.</p><p id="Par27">The Pythagorean fuzzy inclusion measure also called the Pythagorean fuzzy subset hood measure indicates the degree to which one PFS is contained in another PFS. Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] constructed the axiomatic definitions of the Pythagorean fuzzy inclusion measure and presented the corresponding formulas. Mandal and Ranadive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] provided an inclusion measure for PFSs based on the theorems presented by Peng et al.

As a result, several drawbacks might arise in some cases which will influence the ranking values of the alternatives whenever PFSs are used to express the values of the criteria. The main aim of the study is to propose a new measure that can better discriminate PFSs and avoid generating counter-intuitive results while preserving their information structure to reduce information loss and retain more original information. This, in turn, will increase the validity and reliability of the obtained results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preliminaries</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Definition 1</title><p id="Par34">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

In group decision-making, it is almost impossible to have a homogeneous group of experts with similar attitudes, knowledge, and experience. The credibility of experts’ opinions and the effects of their opinion on the final decision should be considered. Ignoring the relative weights of the experts can lead to unreliable results. While studies on determining the weights of the criteria are numerous, studies on determining the weights of the experts are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].</p><p id="Par116">The experts’ weights are ordinarily determined subjectively. They are set by a supervisor or mutual evaluations of each other. This way of determining the experts’ weights has low credibility. Hence, objective methods that utilize quantitative techniques are employed to get the experts’ weight from a more objective perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p><p id="Par117">Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] proposed a method to determine the unknown weights of the experts based on the similarity of the individual expert’s opinion and the group’s opinion. The more the opinion of an expert is similar to the opinion of the group, the more important the expert is, and this expert should have a larger weight.</p><p id="Par118">This study proposes a simple method to determine the unknown experts’ weights based on their consensus on the ranking of the alternatives. The ranking of each expert is obtained using the weighted sum method (WSM). Then, the correlation between the rankings of each two experts is calculated using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. The total correlation of an expert is calculated by adding his/her correlation with other experts. Finally, the total correlation of each expert is divided by the sum of the experts’ total correlation.</p><p id="Par119">First, the judgments of each expert for an alternative for the evaluation criteria are aggregated using the Pythagorean fuzzy weighted averaging operator (<xref rid="Equ8" ref-type="disp-formula">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par120"><bold>Step 1</bold>: Form the decision vector of each expert.</p><p id="Par121">The ratings of the <italic>p</italic>th expert for the <italic>i</italic>th alternative are aggregated using (<xref rid="Equ8" ref-type="disp-formula">8</xref>)<disp-formula id="Equ28"><label>28</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ28_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mfenced close="]" open="["><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">v</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="["><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mo>⋮</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">nj</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ28_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In this section, the proposed MCGDM based on the differential measure is employed to handle two practical applications using Pythagorean fuzzy information. The first application is adapted from Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], the evaluation of solid-state drives (SSDs).

Solid-state drives (SSDs) are widely used as secondary memory in modern computing systems instead of magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs). The performance of HDDs became stagnant due to the limitations in the seek time of actuator arms and the rotational speed of magnetic platters. On the other hand, SSDs do not have complex mechanical parts. This lowers both latency and failure rates than HDDs. Moreover, SSDs offer superior bandwidth, lower power consumption, higher random I/O performance, higher shock resistance, and improved system reliability compared to HDDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p><p id="Par133">An enterprise wants to choose a type from five available types of solid-state drives (SSDs) denoted by <inline-formula id="IEq265"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq265_Math"><mml:mfenced close="}" open="{"><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq265_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Photovoltaic systems generate electric energy directly through the solar light drive producing zero pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. They also have several advantages, e.g., noiseless operation, low maintenance, and high reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In recent years, the development of emerging photovoltaic technologies has been subject to extensive research that focuses on increasing the efficiency and lifetime of these devices, combined with employing low-cost materials and processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. These substantial efforts are coupled with remarkable efforts to find the best option and alternative depending on the required needs, utilizing multi-criteria decision methods, that have been kept side by side with this constant search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].</p><p id="Par139">A photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electricity by a process called the photovoltaic effect which is a known physical and chemical phenomenon. Several types of PV cells are categorized by generation. The first generation is the traditional type made of monocrystalline silicon or polycrystalline silicon and is most commonly used; they dominate the current solar energy market (over 90%). Attempts were made to develop new materials with low-cost fabrication technology due to the high-cost manufacturing of crystalline silicon. The second generation is the thin-film cells that were fabricated by cheaper technologies. The most commonly used materials are amorphous silicon (a-Si), nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). Yet, their performance is not higher than the first-generation cells. The third generation was designed to achieve both high efficiency and low cost. They include a variety of thin-film technologies, some of them generate electricity using organic materials, and others use inorganic substances, e.g., dye-sensitized cells (DSSCs), quantum dot-sensitized cells (QDSSCs), organic solar cells, and hybrid perovskite cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p><p id="Par140">After the selection of the correct location to install a photovoltaic solar plant, it is required to select the kind of cell, from the various available PV cells, that optimizes the installation, e.g., increases production or efficiency, minimizes costs, and grants high maturity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>The selection of photovoltaic cells</title><p id="Par141">It is required to select the best photovoltaic cell from the following alternatives: crystalline silicon <inline-formula id="IEq408"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq408_Math"><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq408_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Biswas and Sarkar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] also proposed a method for MCGDM through similarity measures based on point operators. They utilized these similarity measures to develop two new aggregation operators, namely, the Pythagorean fuzzy-dependent averaging operator and the Pythagorean fuzzy-dependent geometric operator. These operators are employed to aggregate the experts’ evaluations. The results of the proposed method are compared with the ranking obtained using the method of Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and the method of Biswas and Sarkar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

Therefore, it can be concluded that it is consistent and stable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion and discussion</title><p id="Par170">This article proposed the concept of the DFM for the discrimination of PFSs. It is a preference relation between two PFSs by virtue of position in the attribute space and according to the closeness of their membership and non-membership degrees. The main objective of the DFM is to overcome the deficiencies that might arise in the existing measures. The drawbacks in the extant distance measures and similarity measures result from handling the membership (support) and non-membership degree (opposition) equally, although each direction has a different implication. A DFM treats the changes in the parameters of a Pythagorean fuzzy assessment differently. An increment in the support direction is considered a positive step, while an increment in the opposition direction is considered a negative step. Two PFSs are classified as identical, equivalent, superior, or inferior to one another giving the degree of superiority or inferiority. An MCGDM method is proposed based on the introduced DFM and a new technique for computing the weights of the experts is developed.</p><p id="Par171">Two practical problems were solved to illustrate the method. The results of the proposed method are compared with the results of some extant MCDM methods. The main aim of the comparison is to verify and demonstrate the applicability of the method. None of the MCDM methods can be considered better than the others; there is no worst or best technique. Different results can be obtained through distinct methods, even if the processed data and information are the same. We can find a method that is most relevant in a given particular situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The proposed method would be superior whenever the MCDM methods based on distance or similarity measures are affected by the defects previously mentioned leading to incorrect results.</p><p id="Par172">The first example is the evaluation of solid-state drives. The result of the proposed method is compared with the results of other decision-making methods, namely, the TOPSIS method proposed by Zhang and Xu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the TODIM approach developed by Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], the distance and similarity measures introduced by Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], the fuzzy weighted and ordered weighted aggregation operators introduced by Garg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], and the PF-MULTIMOORA proposed by Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The best option obtained by the applied methods is the same. The ranking list obtained by the proposed method coincides with the results of Zeng et al.’s method, with slight changes from other ranking lists.</p><p id="Par173">The second example is the selection of the best photovoltaic cell. The result of the proposed method is compared with the approach of Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and the method of Biswas and Sarkar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The three methods derived the same best alternative. The ranking list of the proposed method coincides with the ranking list of Biswas and Sarkar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and is almost similar to the ranking list of Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par174">A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed MCGDM method. Various MCDM methods have different stabilities. For example, the stability of the MULTIMOORA method is good; for the TOPSIS method, it is poor; for the VIKOR and the ELECTRE methods, it is medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The proposed method is examined using the test procedures of Wang and Triantaphyllou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The method successfully passed the three test procedures indicating its high stability and practicality.</p><p id="Par175">Finally, a new technique for determining the weights of the experts is developed based on Spearman’s correlation coefficient and applied to the photovoltaic cell problem. The obtained experts’ weights are slightly different from the weights obtained by Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Yet, the relative importance of the experts is the same, and when the problem is resolved using the proposed weights, the same solution is attained.</p><p id="Par176">Practically, the proposed DFM can be applied in different applications, e.g., image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, information retrieval, medical diagnosis, and decision-making. In the decision-making process, the proposed framework can eliminate the biases that may arise due to assigning subjective weights to the decision-makers that can lead to unreliable results in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The framework provides objective weights for the decision-makers to overcome the undesirable effect of subjective weights. Therefore, for managers, the proposed framework can lead to better decisions. It is expected that the developed method can be successfully applied in any GDM environment, such as industrial engineering, and business management.</p><p id="Par177">The proposed framework has the following limitations:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par178">PFSs are designed to address only two components of human perception independently, namely, preference and non-preference represented by the membership and non-membership degrees. The third component of human perception, hesitation, is handled as a dependent component. Actually, hesitation can be handled as an independent component with the previous two degrees. This is not covered by the frame of PFSs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par179">The proposed differential measure lacks symmetry, i.e., <inline-formula id="IEq633"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq633_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Diff</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>≠</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Diff</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq633_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
