using activated sludge as the inoculating microbial source and carbon cloth as the electrode. The simultaneous bioelectricity generation, desalination, degradation of organic compounds, and nitrogen removal in the AMDC having different electrode spacings (16, 12, and 8 cm) provided an insight into the microbial community. The experimental results showed that with a gradual decrease in the electrode spacing, electricity production and desalination performance first increased and then decreased. While AMDC1 with 16 cm electrode spacing became active faster than other cells and reached a peak voltage of 598 mV on the tenth day, AMDC2 with 12 cm electrode spacing showed the best start-up performance with a maximum output voltage of 645 mV, maximum power density of 214.7 mW/m<sup>3</sup>, and minimum resistance of 516.9 Ω. AMDC3 with 8 cm electrode spacing reached a peak voltage of 598 mV, which was between those of AMDC1 and AMDC2. The three AMDCs were run until the end of the cycle, and there was no significant difference in their ammonium removal rate and chemical oxygen demand. For AMDC1–3, the desalination rates were 84.86%, 87.71%, and 83.43%, and the Coulomb efficiencies were 17.29%, 18.60%, and 17.95%, respectively. Further, scanning electron microscopy showed that a large number of microorganisms could attach to the surface of the anode carbon cloth electrode; 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the typical electrogenic microbial communities were <italic>Bacillus</italic> (11.6%) and <italic>Arcobacter</italic> (9.6%). As the poor performance of the AMDC was primarily due to a lack of electrogenic microorganisms in the active function of the anode chamber, screening the functional microorganisms provided a reference for optimizing and amplifying the application of microbial desalination cells in practical research.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Air–cathode microbial

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Water is crucial for human survival, and water shortage and pollution problems have increased significantly worldwide in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The total volume of water on the Earth is ~ 1.386 billion cubic kilometers. However, freshwater accounts for only 2.53% of the total water reserves. Freshwater resources available for human use (including rivers, freshwater lakes, shallow groundwater, etc.) merely account for 0.3% of the total freshwater reserves. Therefore, desalination and wastewater treatment are effective ways to increase the amount of water resources. The nexus of energy, water, and environment is crucial for future seawater desalination sustainability, research in desalination methods contributing to reduce specific energy consumption and protect the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several seawater desalination technologies, such as reverse osmosis (RO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], multi-cascade evaporators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], multi-stage flashing (MSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], multi-effect distillation (MED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], seawater thermocline-driven MED (ST-MED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], multi-effect distillation, and an adsorption cycle (MED-AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], have been reported in the literature. The recent hybridization trend of different desalination technologies has been to overcome the individual technological limitations. The economics of desalination technologies has been improving continuously owing to the expansion of the desalination market. Consequently, high-efficiency and low-consumption methods of desalination and wastewater treatment, and improvements of the performance ratios of these technologies have become the focus of research and development in the field of environmental engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) are a new type of technology developed from microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for the first time at Tsinghua University for power production, desalination and wastewater treatment. The concept of operation of MDCs is similar to water electrodialysis, but the MDC is a device that uses bacteria as a catalyst to transform the chemical energy that exists in wastewater into electricity through electrochemical reactions. MDCs employ an additional chamber that contains salty water between the anode and cathode chambers of the MFCs. Ion exchange membranes separate the three chambers and permit the migration of salt ions to achieve desalination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. After the invention of MDCs by Cao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], researchers have developed recirculation microbial desalination cells (rMDCs) that avoid pH imbalance and accelerate bacterial respiration to increase the power of MDCs and achieve efficient desalination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Desalination and treatment of chromium-containing wastewater have been achieved using a new three-chamber MDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Stacked resin-packed microbial desalination cells (SR-MDCs) filled with mixed ion exchange resins have also been implemented for secondary desalination of domestic sewage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Microbial capacity desalination cells with the capacity to regenerate through exchange of the connection between the electrode and activated carbon cloth assemblies have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. MDCs show great potential in bioelectricity generation, wastewater purification, and desalination owing to their excellent stability. They have been widely studied because of advantageous attributes such as low cost, good stability, wastewater treatment capacity, and desalination ability. However, most studies have so far only been conducted with laboratory-scale designs, and there are no reports of their practical applications.</p><p id="Par4">Studies have shown that electrode spacing is an important parameter that can influence the performance of MFCs owing to its role in determining the internal resistance of the cell, electrode potential, power production, extent of organic removal, conductivity, etc. For further study on scale-up devices and broadening the practical application of MDCs, it is worth investigating their performance and efficiency with different electrode spacings.</p><p id="Par5">Based on the traditional MDCs, in this experiment, a three-chamber air–cathode microbial desalination cells (AMDC) was designed and initiated. The effect of different electrode spacings (16, 12, and 8 cm) on the performance of the AMDC was investigated by using carbon cloth as the electrode material. Meanwhile, salt, organics, and nitrogen removal efficiency of the AMDC were evaluated, and 16S rRNA sequence was used to assess the structure and function of microbial community. The long-term operation stability of the AMDC was also examined in terms of current output, power generation, columbic efficiency (CE), internal resistance, and polarization to further evaluate their performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental materials and AMDC construction</title><p id="Par6">The three chambers of the AMDC, namely anode, desalination, and cathode, were constructed using an acrylic cube cut into 6 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm pieces, respectively, and separated with ion exchange membranes. The three chambers had a total working volume of 3.6 L (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both the anion exchange membrane (AEM, AMI-Grion0011V; Lvhe Co., Ltd., China) and cation exchange membrane (CEM, CMI-Grion0011V; Lvhe Co., Ltd., China) exchange membranes had a cross-sectional area of 60 cm<sup>2</sup>. Both AEM and CEM were prepared as described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, the membranes were left in 5% NaCl solution for 48 h to allow hydration and expansion before installation. Both the anode and cathode were made from carbon cloths (6 cm × 12 cm, B1B, E-Tech, USA), and pre-treated with 15% v/v acetone solution for 24 h before use to remove the grease stain on the machined surface. The electrodes were immersed in distilled water, and before the experiment, rinsed with deionized water and then placed in an oven to dry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A closed-circuit was set up by connecting a titanium wire coupled with an external resistance (1000 Ω). Three groups of AMDCs with different electrode spacings (16, 12, and 8 cm) were designed as AMDC1, AMDC2, and AMDC3, respectively.

The ratio of aerobic sludge and nutrient solution was 1:1, and it was sealed and subjected to constant temperature (30 °C) oscillation in a water bath for a few days to obtain anaerobic sludge as an anode chamber inoculation of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To ensure an adequate electron donor, the anode chamber was fed with glucose nutrient medium as the fuel containing C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (0.56 g/L), KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (4.40 g/L), K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (3.40 g/L), and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (0.32 g/L). The anode chamber was stirred using a magnetic stirrer (40–50 rpm) to mix the components thoroughly. The cathode chamber was treated with sodium bicarbonate as the nutrient substance containing KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (4.40 g/L), K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (3.40 g/L), NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (0.32 g/L), and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (1.92 g/L). Continuous aeration was achieved by an aerating pump to increase dissolved oxygen (DO), and the cathodic DO concentration was controlled at greater than or equal to 6.0 mg/L by adjusting the flow aerator. Further, 12.5 g/L of trace metal and 5 g/L of vitamin solutions were separately added to both chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The desalination chamber was filled with artificial salt water containing 35 g/L of NaCl solution. After inoculation, the anolyte, catholyte, and salt solution were not changed until the voltage reached 100 mV. During the start-up and operational stages, the cathode chamber was refilled with new solution every 48 h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measurements and analysis</title><p id="Par8">To assess the performance of the AMDC, conventional water quality indicators such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, and nitrate nitrogen were determined and referenced to the standard methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Cell voltage was recorded every minute by an 8-channel data acquisition system (RTKINS Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) connected to a computer, and the averages were calculated every hour. The steady state reading was recorded at each resistance value. Power generation, current density (A/m<sup>3</sup>), and power density (mW/m<sup>3</sup>) were calculated and analyzed by the net total working volume. The polarization curves were obtained by varying the external resistance from 1000 to 50 Ω as described by Qu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The cell internal resistance was obtained from the polarization curve as described by Logan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Consequently, the inoculated microorganisms needed to adapt to the new environment and showed slow metabolism. As a result, the output voltage of the three AMDCs showed considerable fluctuations. As domesticated microorganisms gradually adapted to the new environment, constant absorption of the substrate nutrients accelerated their growth and metabolism led to a rapid increase in the voltage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The output voltages of the three AMDCs reached a peak on and around day 10, 12, and 12, respectively, and the microbial adhesion reached the highest level and remained stable. The reactor entered a stable period and continued to operate for 5 days. On day 17, owing to nutrient consumption and accumulation of metabolites in the reactor, microbial growth was restricted and the output voltage gradually decreased. On day 20, the initial period in the second cycle of substrate solution replacement was shorter than in the first cycle. A possible reason is that the metabolism of electricity-producing microorganisms accelerated and the substrate nutrition was consumed rapidly, which is consistent with the change in the COD.</p><p id="Par13">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the maximum voltages of AMDC1–3 were 598, 645, and 610 mV, respectively.

Furthermore, there was no significant effect on the COD degradation rate between the OCS and CCS on changing the electrode spacings. Voltage output under the closed-circuit system indicated that the anode microorganisms oxidized organic matter to produce electron transfer to the cathode, which constituted a closed loop. Under the action of an electric field, the salt ions in the desalination chamber were pushed to migrate to both ends, which significantly promoted the NaCl concentration change caused by single concentration differential dialysis in the open-circuit system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

The maximum power densities of the three AMDCs were 184.0, 214.7, and 206.9 mW/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, which was slightly lower than that of the conventional reactor.

In the CCS, when the electrode spacing was changed from 16 to 8 cm, the power density increased from 184.0 to 214.7 mW/m<sup>3</sup>, and then decreased to 206.9 mW/m<sup>3</sup>, and the internal resistance of the three AMDCs was 614.4, 516.9, and 522.7 Ω, respectively. The results showed that reducing the electrode spacing effectively reduced the resistance to ion migration in solution, which was beneficial to the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms, and sped up the mass transfer of organic matter and products, thus reducing the resistance of mass transfer in the reactor and increasing the output power of the reactor. In conclusion, the three-chamber AMDC had a good start.

When the pH is high, it exists in the free form, and vice versa as ammonium. During the operation of the AMDC, denitrifying ammonia oxidizers under hypoxia conditions, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was denitrified into N<sub>2</sub>, thereby reducing the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> content in the solution. Meanwhile, with the operation of the AMDC, the pH of the anode chamber decreased and free ammonia escaped as a gas, which is also one of the reasons for the decreasing concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the anode chamber. The ammonium removal rates of the anode substrate solutions of the three AMDCs were 73.78, 75.74, and 74.32%, respectively, with no significant difference (<italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.05), which was the same as COD degradation. The ammonium removal rates of the cathode chamber of the three AMDCs were higher than that of the anode chamber, which were 82.64, 84.03, and 85.16%, respectively. This was attributed to the aeration of the cathode chamber and conversion of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) into nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>–N) under aerobic conditions, which was consistent with the increase in nitrate nitrogen concentration in the cathode chamber. The results showed that the AMDC can degrade inorganic nitrogen pollutants effectively, and the change of electrode spacing had no significant effect on the degradation of inorganic nitrogen pollutants.</p><p id="Par20">The initial pH values of the AMDC anode and cathode electrolytes were 6.67 and 6.92, respectively. At the end of operation, pH values of the AMDC1–3 anode electrolytes had decreased, while those of the cathode electrolytes had increased; this variation was the most obvious for the AMDC2 reactor with an electrode spacing of 12 cm. During the operation of the AMDC, the pH decreased and increased for the anolyte and catholyte, respectively, probably because the organics in the anode chamber were degraded, H<sup>+</sup> were produced, and e<sup>−</sup> were released. The e<sup>−</sup> reached the cathode through the external circuit and combined with O<sub>2</sub> to produce H<sub>2</sub>O. The H<sup>+</sup> generated in the anode chamber and OH<sup>−</sup> generated in the cathode chamber accumulated continuously, leading to a change in the pH value. The extremely low and high pH values of the anolyte and catholyte, respectively, adversely affected the reactor performance. The pH change in the AMDC2 reactor was the most obvious. As mentioned above, with the reduction of electrode spacing, the internal resistance of the reactor decreased, which was conducive to the decomposition of anaerobic microorganisms. Therefore, the combined effect of pH change and electrode spacing had no significant effect on the degradation of organics in the reactor, which is consistent with the removal effect of COD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Analysis of desalination and energy recovery efficiency</title><p id="Par21">The three AMDCs were operated until the end of the cycle, and the desalination effect under diverse electrode spacing conditions was studied (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
