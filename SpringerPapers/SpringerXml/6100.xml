sustainable future. Unfortunately, these technologies often rely on materials that are considered critical because of their importance to the technology and their potential for supply disruptions, which often lead to drastic and unexpected price spikes. With many clean energy technologies still struggling to compete economically with incumbent technologies, it is uncertain if such material price changes could have a significant economic impact on overall clean energy technology costs. In this paper, we first estimate material intensity of critical materials for three case study clean energy technologies: proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets in direct drive wind turbines, and Li-ion batteries in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Using these data, as well as material price information, we analyze technology-level costs under potential material price spike scenarios. By benchmarking against target costs at which each technology is expected to become economically competitive relative to incumbent energy systems, we evaluate the impact of price spikes on marketplace competitiveness. For the three case studies, technological costs could increase by between 13 and 41% if recent historical price events were to recur at current material intensities. By analyzing the economic impact of material price changes on technology-level costs, we demonstrate the need for stakeholders to push for various supply risk reduction measures, which are also summarized in this paper.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Supply risk</kwd><kwd>Techno-economic analysis</kwd><kwd>Wind turbines</kwd><kwd>Li-ion

id="Sec1"><title>Critical materials in clean energy technologies</title><p id="Par2">Clean energy technologies are essential tools for reducing carbon emissions and providing for a sustainable future. As new advancements are made in this field, we see a greater complexity of materials in high-tech products, some of which are critical in terms of both their importance to the technologyâs function and their potential for supply disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Throughout this paper, we explore the concept of critical materials and how their price instabilities may affect the ability of these clean energy technologies to compete in a tight marketplace, filled with low-cost incumbent technologies.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Identifying critical materials and their importance for firms</title><p id="Par3">Critical materials are those that have both technological importance and some form of supply risk associated with their production and/or distribution. âTechnological importanceâ includes uses in clean energy, defense, electronic, or healthcare technologies, where the functionality provided by a material cannot be easily replaced with substitutes. Supply risks are characterized by low availability of a material from recycling streams, the material being mined majorly as a byproduct of other materials, a limited number of suppliers, or the positioning of those suppliers in geopolitically unstable countries. An article by Graedel and Nuss quantitatively scores the criticality of 62 elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and a review article by Jin et al. is helpful in summarizing the findings of such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While the methods of determining criticality vary between studies, and therefore elements are given differing quantitative or qualitative criticality âscoresâ, we do see common trends in materials such as rare earth elements, platinum group elements, and individual elements including indium, gallium, tellurium, and cobalt, consistently being identified as more critical than most other elements for clean energy technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some examples of more prolific metrics used to measure criticality include those that quantify material resource availability, the price of the material, and market concentration. The demand for many materials identified as critical is expected to grow in the future, alongside the growth in world population, electronic sales, and clean energy adoption. High demand, coupled with criticality, promotes the risk of extreme price spikes or even material unavailability in the event of a disruption in the supply chain.</p><p id="Par4">Many of these materials have extreme price inelasticity, which stems from the small quantities that are used in final products, allowing for the cost increase to be passed on by the intermediate purchaser to the final consumer. When a change in price does cause a change in demand, producers may be slow to change output due to the scale of operations, high capital requirements, long lead times for new projects, or the interconnected nature of mining (in which raw materials are not mined separately, but rather as byproducts and coproducts of one another) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These factors, when combined, can lead to significant price spikes. A classic example of such a price spike was cobalt in the 1970s. During that time, approximately 65% of cobalt production occurred in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, cobalt demand stemmed largely from samarium-cobalt permanent magnets and superalloys in jet engines. Around 1977, supply was disrupted due to an uprising in the region of production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The market saw price increases of over 500%, causing severe interruptions for the downstream cobalt users, such as General Electric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Still today, over 50% of cobalt comes from that same region, and although prices have long since recovered, such a concentrated supply in a provenly unstable region leaves concern over the potential for another major supply disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">It is in the interest of firms, consumers, and governments to reduce the risk of material supply disruptions and price spikes to maintain the competitiveness of clean energy technologies in the marketplace. While the motivations of these stakeholders may vary from simply being able to make a profit or purchase the technologies at a reasonable price to meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets at a national level, the goal of minimizing price increases remains the same. Therefore, this study examines the connection between material price instability, technology costs, and the potential solutions for minimizing the risk of material supply disruptions and price spikes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clean energy case studies</title><p id="Par6">While other studies have considered the effect of material prices on clean energy technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], this study is novel in its consideration of multiple technologies under the same methodology and the comparison to cost targets under various price spike scenarios. While varied in their implementation, similar economic modeling that extrapolates from price changes in material input prices to impact on product cost has been utilized in previous studies. For example, two studies consider indium and tellurium price changes and their impact on photovoltaic solar panel cost metrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A previous study has been conducted on Li-ion batteries by a private organization, and resultant data and findings are not publicly available to inform further research, technology design, or policy making. An article on this study by the Bloomberg New Energy Finance group, titled âLithium Price Spike Has Moderate Effect on Batteries,â suggests that the report considers the effect of material prices on Li-ion battery cost for at least one type of Li-ion battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This present work extends the analysis to seven Li-ion battery chemistries, as well as to proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets for wind turbines. We take the concepts of commodity vulnerability and translate them beyond their impact on an individual firm to overall technology adoption. This approach is essential to bridge critical material studies and climate change mitigation strategies that involve unprecedented deployment of clean energy technologies.</p><p id="Par7">Many studies consider material requirements on the basis of meeting various climate change mitigation targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These studies typically assess whether we have the quantity of materials necessary to manufacture clean energy technologies to the extent needed to mitigate climate change to various levels. For example, to deploy enough wind turbines and electric vehicles to keep atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at 450Â ppm, one study estimated that neodymium and dysprosium may experience an increase in demand of more than 700 and 2600%, respectively (from 2010 numbers), by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Another analysis identifies potential bottlenecks for critical materials in solar, wind turbines, fuel cells, batteries, electrolysis, hydrogen storage, electric vehicles, and efficient lighting through 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These authors identify silver followed by tellurium, indium, dysprosium, lanthanum, cobalt, platinum, and ruthenium, as potential bottlenecks that could render the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change renewable energy scenarios âpartly unrealistic from the perspective of critical metalsâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. When considering the quantity of materials that would be required to provide âall global energy with wind, water, and solar power,â the literature indicates that such a system would likely not be inhibited by the availability of base materials, but other materials, such as neodymium, platinum, and lithium, would need to be recycled, substituted out, or extracted from new deposits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In more specific cases such as that of tellurium in cadmiumâtellurium (CdTe) solar cells, the literature again indicates that the critical material (tellurium) may indeed dampen the adoption of the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For this particular case however, this is more likely to occur due to the byproduct nature of tellurium rather than its overall resource quantity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">While these studies provide a valuable perspective on material demand for clean energy adoption, the literature has yet to fully connect such estimates of material consumption with their attendant impacts on technology cost. Therefore, this study merges analysis of material intensity with scenarios capturing material price volatility to understand the ultimate impact on technology cost and adoption. If material supply is low, price increases will potentially lead to lower demand for, and adoption of, clean energy technologies. The three case study clean energy technologies analyzed are described below and shown conceptually in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. We use cost as the metric of comparison as it is commonly cited as a main inhibitor for clean energy technology adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Because each technology provides a unique functionality, it was necessary to normalize cost estimates consistently. Therefore, technology cost per functional output of the technology (in kWh energy stored or kW power generated) is used to compare clean energy technologies to their incumbent equivalent and determine their ability to compete economically in the energy market.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematics of the three case studies considered in this work.

Fuel cells convert fuel directly to electricity without combustion. They are considered a clean energy technology because they are highly efficient in terms of energy conversion, can reduce air pollution and point source emissions of combustion byproducts, and are capable of running on fuels produced from renewable resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. PEM fuel cells have a high power density, operate at relatively low temperatures compared to other fuel cell types, and start up quickly, making them ideal for vehicle applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Pure hydrogen is used as the fuel, and only H<sub>2</sub>O is emitted at the tailpipe. They rely on a platinum catalyst, which is a major downside to this technology, as platinum group elements are expensive and deposits concentrated enough for economic mining are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Researchers are looking into methods such as carbon nanotube supported platinum catalyst to reduce platinum use in PEM fuel cells, which would thereby reduce costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the fuel cell case study presented in this paper, we considered only PEM fuel cells for FCEVs, as other types such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) are primarily used in stationary applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Proton exchange membrane fuel cells use platinum as a catalyst because of its high catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, and its resistance to poisoning by impurities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These properties and others such as its high value and resistance to tarnishing suit it to a wide array of end uses in gasoline-vehicle catalytic converters (45%), jewelry (34%), and chemical and petroleum refining (9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The demand for platinum for fuel cell use is growing, and one report estimates that 7% of the worldâs platinum supply in 2030 could be required for fuel cells in the European Union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the material is also described in the literature as being a concern due to its high cost, concentrated supply, and scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. According to United States Geological Survey, platinum group elements are among the rarest elements on earth and are found in earth crust in concentrations of around 0.5 parts per billion. Adding to the criticality of platinum is the high concentration of production in South Africa, accounting for 72% in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on these combined supply and demand factors, platinum is therefore selected as the material to be analyzed for the PEM fuel cell case study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Permanent magnet generators in direct drive wind turbines</title><p id="Par11">Wind turbines can be classified into two major categories: geared and gearless (direct drive). Gearless direct drive turbines operate best at low speeds and have the advantages of better overall efficiency, lower weight, and fewer maintenance requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Geared turbines on the other hand will operate at higher speeds on smaller turbines (&lt;â5Â MW) and contain few or no rare earth elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In 2015, approximately 23% of the globally installed wind capacity relied on generators utilizing NdFeB permanent magnets (which can contain the rare earth elements neodymium, dysprosium, praseodymium, and terbium). The other 77% had electromagnetic generators utilizing steel and copper for their functionality, neither of which is considered critical materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The critical materials identified in the literature as potentially being present in these direct drive turbines are neodymium, dysprosium, nickel, molybdenum, praseodymium, and terbium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The molybdenum and nickel are found in the steel alloys of the turbines and are therefore not included in the permanent magnet generator (PMG) case study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Pavel et al. estimate that NdFeB permanent magnets could be dematerialized from 29 to 32% neodymium and praseodymium to 25% and from 3 to 6% dysprosium to less than 1% by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is possible to substitute small amounts of praseodymium for neodymium in NdFeB magnets to reduce cost and corrosivity; however, most literature combines any praseodymium material use with neodymium material content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Direct substitution for the rare earths doesnât currently appear feasible; however, efforts are focused on finding new magnet compositions and/or using different components that donât rely on rare-earth-containing permanent magnets at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Neodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are considered in more detail in this case study of permanent magnets in direct drive wind turbines. These three elements are all rare earth elements (REEs). REEs are critical, largely because of their high production concentration in China, where approximately 81% of which were produced in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Adding to REE criticality is the fact that currently less than 1% of REEs are recycled from the products they are used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In general, heavy REEs such as dysprosium and terbium are less abundant and therefore usually demand a higher value. According to the United States Geological Survey, âthe magnet sector is expected to become the leading user of REEs, based on mass, by 2020â [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Li-ion batteries in battery electric vehicles</title><p id="Par14">When comparing reusable batteries, factors such as safety, weight, efficiency, cycle life, and energy density should be taken into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Li-ion batteries are expected to lead the battery electric vehicle revolution, due primarily to their energy densities, which surpass those of other options, such as nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) or lead-acid batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While NiMH batteries are currently the dominant battery choice for hybrid electric vehicles, some expect numbers as high as 70% of hybrid electric, and 100% of plug-in and full BEVs to use Li-ion batteries by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Li-ion batteries have also been modeled as having lower environmental impacts than NiMH options when the technologies are compared on a âper-energy storage basisâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and an overall low contribution to the total BEV life cycle environmental impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Typically, Li-ion batteries contain a graphite anode and lithium-containing cathode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Common cathodes include LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP), Li[NiCoAl]O<sub>2</sub> (NCA), Li[MnNiCo]O<sub>2</sub> (NMC), LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LMO), and typically in non-vehicle uses, LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (LCO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Different cathode chemistries provide different properties, each with their own drawbacks in terms of weight, material use, and cost. LFP batteries have good safety and long lifespans but lack the specific energy that some of the other chemistries can provide and are therefore often used in specialty applications, such as replacing the lead-acid starter battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. NCA batteries provide high energy and power densities and have a moderate lifespan, making them good options for powertrains in electric vehicles; however, cost and safety are drawbacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. NMC batteries are a fast-growing category due to their very high specific energy and high specific power. The active materialsânickel, manganese, and cobaltâcan be blended at varying concentrations to give slightly different properties to suit either electric vehicles or energy storage applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this study we will consider NMC batteries with Ni:Mn:Co ratios of 1:1:1, 6:2:2, and 8:1:1. NMC batteries can also be used in combination with other battery types such as LMOs. LMO batteries are less often used alone, but can commonly be found in conjunction with NMC batteries to enhance the current required for acceleration, while the NMC portion of the battery gives the vehicle the sought after long range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Compared to the traditional LCO batteries, LMO batteries are cheaper, have a high electrochemical potential, and contain less potentially harmful materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. LCO batteries are used in electronics such as cell phones and laptops due to the very high specific energy, but the short lifespans, limited thermal stability, high price of cobalt, and low specific power make LCO less than ideal for electric vehicle applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Li-ion batteries have the potential to contain dysprosium, praseodymium, neodymium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, lithium, terbium, and vanadium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. We select to analyze in this Li-ion battery case study the four major critical cathode materials used in Li-ion batteries which are lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, recognizing that within these four materials, lithium and cobalt are identified as being the primary concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Lithium is considered a geochemically scarce metal, found in earthâs crust in concentrations of less than 0.01% by weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

With respect to ore mining, lithium is primarily produced from spodumene, in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Portugal, China, the USA, Canada, and Zimbabwe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The final method of lithium production is through secondary production, or recycling; however, this segment makes up less than 1% of production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Recycling remains limited due to low lithium prices, dispersive applications (such as glass, ceramics, and lubricants), and an industrial focus on recovering other materials, such as cobalt, copper and nickel, at battery end-of-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

Lithium is the lightest solid metal and has the highest electrochemical potential, making it ideal for battery applications as it can have a high energy density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

It is mined mainly as a byproduct of nickel production or a co-product of copper production, with only 6% being attributed to primary production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As mentioned previously, having such a high concentration of production in the historically unstable DRC has proved problematic and led to price spikes of over 500% as a combined result of institutional inefficiency and conflict in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In fact, cobalt exports from the DRC actually halted altogether briefly during the 1970s conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. China is also a large player in cobalt production, as they import partially refined cobalt from the DRC and complete much of the refining within their borders. In recent years, China has also been the worldâs largest user of cobalt as they rapidly grow their battery industry. Around 50% of current cobalt production goes into rechargeable batteries, including those in electronic devices, electric vehicles, and energy storage applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

This variation is associated with technology age, battery capacity, manufacturer differences, and the overall quality of literature data. Lithium has the least variation across chemistries, because the lithium atom content characterizes the maximum storage capacity of the battery. On the other hand, cobalt has the highest variation, ranging from zero (in LMO and LFP batteries which use other metals in the cathode) to an average of 959Â g/kWh in LCO batteries. Nickel and manganese are each found in four of the seven chemistries and have a large spread of intensities between those four in which they are found. An interesting trend that can be clearly seen is that of the increasing nickel intensity and decreasing manganese and cobalt intensity from NMC111 to NMC622 and finally to NMC 811 (where the numbers following âNMCâ represent the ratio of Ni:Mn:Co). It is important to understand that our results consider the overall change in material intensity in g/kWh; however, this change is affected by both dematerialization and efficiency improvements, which are not discernable with the single metric. This tradeoff of replacing manganese and cobalt quantities with greater nickel concentrations is sought after in the Li-ion battery industry largely due to the high cost and supply risks associated with cobalt use.

As previously mentioned, the 2008 price values are not adjusted for inflation, as we are presenting an estimation of impacts from this scenario. The differential between 2018 and 2008 was 216% lower Li prices, as well as 81% higher Co prices, 165% higher Mn prices, and 272% higher Ni prices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].

For all battery chemistries, with the exception of LFP and LMO, we observe that a price event similar to that which occurred in 2008 would increase the Li-ion battery costs, moving them away from the target that has been set for achieving their competitiveness with incumbent gasoline powered vehicles. In the case of LFP and LMO batteries, because lithium prices make up the majority of the cathode costs, and lithium prices have increased since 2008, the historical scenario actually led to decreases in battery costs as seen in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.</p><p id="Par33">While Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> demonstrates how the cathode materials all changing price at the same rate impacts the overall battery cost, the heat map in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> allows us to observe how price fluctuations in a single material will impact battery cost independently.

Even a 100% increase in the price of either manganese or nickel wonât cause a battery level cost increase of greater than 10% in any of the seven chemistries. For lithium a 100% price increase is most concerning for the LFP chemistry, which is expected due to the assumption that lithium makes up the entire cathode material cost (as we have identified that LFP batteries donât contain cobalt, manganese, or nickel). Lithium is, however, present in all seven chemistries and a 100% increase in the price of lithium would therefore lead to an increase in all seven types of Li-ion batteries in the range of 3.6â11.4%. For cobalt, it is important to note the large range in effects, as both LMO and LFP batteries contain no cobalt and are unaffected by the 100% increase in cobalt prices; however, LCO batteries, which have very high cobalt content, could experience battery level cost spikes of 27.2%. Within the three different NMC chemistries, we clearly see the lessening cobalt price impact from NMC 111 to NMC 622 and NMC 811, corresponding with the lessening cobalt intensities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Case study findings</title><p id="Par35">We find in analyzing these three case studies that the impact of material price spikes on these clean energy technology costs could potentially be disruptive to the technologyâs adoption.

For each case, we have analyzed the effect of increasing all of the selected material prices at the same rate, having 100% price spikes in individual materials, and the impact of the reoccurrence of real recent historical price events under current material intensities. Without assessing how likely each of these scenarios is, the best way to assess the severity of material price increases on these technologies is through the recent historical price event examples. For the PEM fuel cell, a 17% increase was observed under the historical scenario, and for the wind turbine PMG a 41% cost increase would have occurred. For Li-ion batteries using this method leads to a cost increase of 13% in NMC111 batteries, 14% in NMC622 batteries, 15% in NMC811 batteries, 19% in both LCO and NCA batteries, and a decrease in cost of 2% in LMO batteries and 8% in LFP batteries. It is difficult to determine exactly what level of cost increase would lead to disruption in technology adoption, as that entails many factors such as location, specific brand of FCEV, BEV, or wind turbine, and how much of the cost increase would be absorbed by the producer versus passed to the consumer. We speculate, however, that a large portion of these costs would be passed to the consumer and that the consumer will typically make a decision based on an expected return on investment period, which would be extended by these price increases. We therefore would suggest that these results indicate the potential for a moderate disruption in clean energy technology adoption from critical material price spikes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Implications</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par36">The future sustainability of clean energy technologies depends on environmental, social, and economic factors. This study has established that material price spikes can impact technology costs, shifting them further from the targets of cost parity with incumbent technologies. As technology costs decrease in the future, the material prices remain mostly incompressible and therefore the materials will contribute a greater portion of the overall cost, unless dematerialization can outpace this trend. Material price spikes therefore can be expected to become even more important in the future, as they could have a proportionally greater impact then they do now.</p><p id="Par37">One limitation of this method is the inability to distinguish if technology cost changes are due to material price variability, reduced material intensity (as a result of natural technological progress), or both factors acting simultaneously. Price as a metric captures a wide variety of mechanisms which may counteract one another or intensify movement in a given direction. The events that impact material price are extremely complex as they may include global political issues, physical resource scarcity, or other supply chain issues including production bottlenecks, long lead times, or improper stockpiling and hedging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Through a phenomenon known as the bullwhip effect price volatility and supply issues propagate through the supply chain and have worsening impacts at the manufacturers end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. However, price is a leading signal that firms receive and regard as important and therefore it is the metric weâve chosen to analyze. Other limitations include the assumptions taken into account in our modeling, including the calculation of our cost estimations without taking into account the time value of money and the assumption that all other component prices remain constant during critical material price events. In addition, while critical materials are by definition difficult to substitute for due to their unique properties, this work does not address the fact that if material prices were to rise high enough, some substitutions that are not currently viable may become reasonable options. It is important to note, however, that there is a long lead time for most substitution implementations, and therefore a lag time in material demand as well. For example, substitution of palladium for platinum may be possible for PEM fuel cells at certain platinum price points, as has been done in catalytic convertors that rely on platinum in the past when platinum prices rise dramatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. However, studies show that platinum is still provides a âhighâ level of concern for automotive applications due to low elasticity and long delays in response time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Future work could further explore the interplay between dematerialization and critical material price changes in an attempt to provide better predictions.</p><p id="Par38">In this study, we consider the economic sustainability issues associated with relying on critical materials, but there are in fact social and environmental issues associated with the production and distribution of these materials as well. Mining is inherently an environmentally detrimental process that only becomes less efficient as resources are depleted and ore grades worsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Some of the materials, such as cobalt, are produced in regions that are known to utilize mining profits to promote conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Recycling or secondary production of many of these critical materials is often done in developing countries under unsafe conditions, causing human health hazards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">In comparing our results to the previously mentioned Bloomberg New Energy Finance study, we find that our results show a lower impact of critical material costs on the technology but are comparable. Their results seem to show that for an NMC111 chemistry a 100% price increase in lithium prices would lead to approximately an 8% increase in battery costs where as our results show a 5.1% increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, for a 100% increase in cobalt prices they show a 20% battery cost increase while we show 11.7%, and for a 100% increase in nickel prices they show approximately a 3% battery cost increase while we show 2.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While these three metals in just one chemistry is only a small sample set of results that we are able to compare, it aids in supporting the methodology and results in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Reducing supply risk</title><p id="Par40">Given the potential for growing contributions of critical materials to clean energy technology performance and cost, future research is required to establish solutions that will reduce the underlying supply risks that may lead to price fluctuation. Factors that contribute to a materialâs supply risks may include difficulty of substitution due to unique properties, low recycling rates, the material being mined majorly as a byproduct of other materials, a limited number of suppliers, or the positioning of those suppliers in geopolitically unstable regions. Reducing a materialâs supply risk leads to a lower likelihood of price spikes, which as demonstrated throughout this study can impact the technology-level cost. Therefore, these methods of supply risk reduction are solutions, that if applied appropriately, may improve the ability of clean energy technologies to compete economically with incumbent technologies in the marketplace (although we recognize that factors other than material costs may have a greater impact). Methods of supply risk reduction include dematerialization, substitution, recycling/using secondary sources, development of primary mining (especially for materials currently mined mainly as byproducts), yield improvement, and increasing the lifespan of products containing these materials. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and often their use is intertwined.</p><p id="Par41">Supply risk reduction measures are implemented at either the level of firms and consumers or at the policymaker and governmental level. We assume that firms and consumers are most concerned with the overall technology costs, but donât have much control over the upstream mining and processing portion of the supply chain. Therefore, the methods best suited for firms would include dematerialization, substitution, recycling, and increasing product lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Increasing product lifespan may be the least intuitive method of supply risk reduction, but the concept is that if a product lasts longer, it will have to be replaced with a new critical-material-containing product less often, thereby reducing the demand for that material. We recognize, however, that most firms do not inherently have incentive to increase product lifespan, except possibly for customer satisfaction and brand recognition. While most of these are also outside of the reach of consumers, they should recognize that recycling (at the end of a productâs life) and increasing product lifespan (through regular maintenance and repair) are methods by which they can incrementally reduce supply risk (by reducing demand). Therefore, if performed on a global scale, customers could theoretically reduce the potential for cost increases in clean energy technologies.</p><p id="Par42">Dematerialization is the concept of using less of a given critical material in a specific technology per functional unit. Usually, improvements in existing technology must occur in order for dematerialization to be possible without losses to either efficiency or performance and therefore this will often happen naturally over the evolution of a product. For example, as discussed in â<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Case study 1: catalysts for PEM fuel cells in FCEVs</xref>â the mass of platinum in PEM fuel cells has decreased by 80% since 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Due to the current lower material intensities, a price event similar to that which occurred in 2008 would now lead to a 17% increase in fuel cell system costs, rather than the 30% cost increase that would have been experienced under 2008 material intensities. Often first-generation designs are created with emphasis on proof-of-concept and in later, more refined generations, we see a reduction in the use of overly expensive or risky materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Ultimately, though, firms can realize a dual benefit in dematerialization: using less material will not only reduce costs but will also reduce the impact of price spikes in the future.</p><p id="Par43">The strategy of substitution involves using a different, lower impact material to replace one that is currently used. Substitution may lead to efficiency losses, as the original materials are typically chosen for their unique chemical, electrical, or physical properties that are difficult to replace. Substitution is a viable solution only when a less critical material can be substituted for a more critical one, without significant tradeoffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. An example of this transition has been seen in the move from NMC111 battery chemistries to NMC622 and NMC811, one motivation for which is that manganese and nickel are typically considered less critical materials than cobalt, although they also have ultimately provided cost and performance benefits as well.</p><p id="Par44">Recycling, or using other secondary sources such as industrial byproducts and wastes, inherently reduces supply risk because there is reduced dependence on the primary suppliers and an increased number of suppliers overall. In addition, secondary sources are often more geographically distributed. While a âclosed loopâ material recovery system is optimistic, even âopen loopâ secondary sources can offset some of the primary mining that is necessary to meet demand. For firms in particular, âin-houseâ recycling of scrap is a realistic method of supply risk reduction. Recycling has been deemed essential to ensure the necessary availability of materials (including platinum, lithium, and neodymium) for the clean energy transformation that is predicted in coming years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">It is also the recognized that a strong policy role will be required to incentivize clean energy technology adoption at a rate that will mitigate climate change. Policies that will maintain or reduce clean energy technology costs may include common incentives such as tax credits and subsidies, or less obvious supply risk mitigation efforts which help avoid cost increases. The use of policy to ensure the consistent flow of critical materials is important for not only clean energy technologies but also for other significant applications such as healthcare and defense technologies, creating additional incentive for policymakers to consider these risk reduction measures. In this respect, all the previously listed methods of supply risk reduction may be of interest, but particularly, recycling and increasing product lifespan may prove most effective. Recycling, especially increasing the recycling capacity in countries that are currently very reliant on importing these critical materials, can help nations become less reliant on imports, and thereby less susceptible to imposed tariffs or export restrictions put in place by exporting countries. These risk reduction methods would help prevent price spikes such as the 2011 rare earth price spikes that we analyzed in the wind turbine permanent magnet case study from when China implemented their export restrictions, as the USA had no domestic mine production of REEs in 2017, and 78% of their imports were from China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Other methods that indirectly fall under the scope of policy, rather than firms and consumers, may include development of new strategic mines and improving yields in mining and processing operations. These methods could be indirectly influenced through policy-backed incentives. Developing new mines can reduce supply risk by increasing the number of domestic suppliers and diversifying the geographic source of the materials. This mitigation is especially pertinent for materials that are currently mined as byproducts or coproducts of other materials. For example, currently 87% of cobalt is produced as a byproduct of copper or nickel production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Therefore, an increase in demand for cobalt does not necessarily have the typical market effect of increased cobalt production. Developing primary mining for elements that are currently mined largely as byproducts or coproducts has huge economic barriers; however, it would enable market pulls and policy pushes to reduce supply risk. Yield improvement in mining or production processes would simply allow the production of greater quantities of the materials from the same ore, thereby increasing supply and lessening the materialâs criticality. The barriers to yield improvement are in both technological feasibility and, more often, economic feasibility, but in either case are often reduced by policy that establishes disposal bans or recycling targets for particular materials or products.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">Through the use of historical price spike data, combined with current material intensities, we have found the impact of critical material price spikes on technology component costs to be increases of 13â41% within the three case studies considered. Therefore, we conclude that there is potential for critical material price spikes to have a moderate impact on overall clean energy technology adoption. The use of these critical materials puts clean energy technologies at some degree of risk, where that risk is a function not only of impact, as measured by the potential technology cost increases, but also probability, which can be measured through various metrics describing degrees of material criticality. By understanding criticality from previous studies, in combination with the economic modeling in this work, we can better understand where stakeholders should focus the previously discussed risk mitigation efforts to avoid disruptions in clean energy technology adoption. By removing obstacles from the pathway of clean energy technology adoption we can have a better chance at a sustainable future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>National Science Foundation CBET-1254688.
