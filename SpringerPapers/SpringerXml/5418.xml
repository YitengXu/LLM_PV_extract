Here, a fully closed-loop recyclable crosslinked polyimide (RCPI) was fabricated via carboxyl ligand exchange between the CPI with pendent carboxyl groups and the cyclic Ti-oxo cluster (CTOC) with labile carboxyl ligands, which could be reconverted into reprocessable CPI and CTOC solution by pivalic acid. The RCPI-based embedded AgNWs@RCPI electrode shows comparable high conductivity, transparency and low roughness with ITO (indium tin oxide)/glass electrode, and meanwhile outstanding mechanical robustness. The related flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) provided a high efficiency of 14.78% and maintained ~97% of the initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles at a small bending radius of 1 mm. Moreover, the recyclability of the RCPI still retains after being manufactured into the FOSCs. This work provides a promising strategy for recyclable flexible optoelectronic devices.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Flexibility is one of the key characteristics in organic solar cells (OSCs), enabling them to be potentially applied into special fields, such as the internet of things, indoor photovoltaics, greenhouse, building integration, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nowadays, many studies focus on the bulk-heterojunction photoactive layers, in particular, with wide bandgap donor polymers and near-infrared electron acceptors, so that the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs on the rigid glass/ITO (indium tin oxide) have reached over 18%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. When these high-performance photoactive layers were applied into flexible OSCs (FOSCs), the PCEs could also be realized over 15%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In FOSCs, researchers have mainly been involved in optimizing flexible electrodes by using silver nanowires (AgNWs) or highly-conductive PEDOT:PSS to replace the brittle ITO in order to improve the optical, mechanical and electrical properties, while there have been very few studies about flexible substrates, such as innovation of chemical structures/materials, and recyclability as well, for most of the flexible substrates can only be discarded at the end-of-life usage, leading to severe waste of resources and environmental problems.</p><p id="Par3">Polymers are the optimal candidate as flexible substrates for FOSCs, such as transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyimides (PIs). Although PET has been widely used in FOSCs on the laboratory scale, its poor tolerant at high temperatures due to the low glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) and the high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) limits the application. The drawbacks of PET can be perfectly overcome by PIs with the merit of high <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>, low CTE and high light/thermal stability. Someya et al. demonstrated that the PI substrate could filter ultraviolet light and hence improve the stability of photoactive layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In this work, they used the precursor poly (amic acid) (PAA) solution to form thin films, following by a thermal imidization reaction at 270 °C to generate PI and then sputtering ITO as the electrode. Then, Zhou et al. developed semi-embedded AgNWs@PI electrodes by using a solution-processed PI (with unknown chemical structure) as substrate and AgNWs as conducting layers, in which the semi-embedded structure can effectively lower the surface roughness of AgNWs so as to prevent the leakage of photocurrent in solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">These two pioneered works inspire us to use semi-embedded AgNWs@PI to construct FOSCs. PIs can be obtained via thermal or chemical imidization. However, the high temperature of thermal imidization (usually above 300°C) will destroy the AgNWs electrodes. Therefore, in thermally imidized semi-embedded AgNWs@PI, special strategies via applying protective layers on AgNWs networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> or incomplete imidization at relatively low temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> must be utilized. Thus, chemical imidization is the optimal choice for semi-embedding AgNWs due to the low processing temperature to protect AgNWs. In another aspect, non-conjugated units are usually introduced into PIs in order to prevent the intra- and intermolecular charge transfer complexes and hence obtain high transparency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The non-conjugated designs make the PIs show good solubility in polar solvents, indicating that the PI substrate may be destroyed in the solution-processed layer-by-layer fabrication process. Therefore, the contradiction between transparency, solution-process and solvent-tolerance is the key issue that should be addressed to obtain embedded AgNWs@PI electrodes, and it is of great urgency to provide strategies on modifying the chemical structures of PIs.</p><p id="Par5">To address the above issues, constructing the crosslinked PIs could be an effective strategy. Researchers have reported various methods to fabricate crosslinked PIs, such as introducing heat or UV light crosslinkable reactive groups and compounds or nanoparticles with multiple amino groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, in most of the reported crosslinked PIs, yellowing is still serious and can not be used as optoelectronic device substrates with high transparency requirement. Besides, the reported crosslinked PIs is not compatible with the semi-embedding AgNWs strategy for the elevated temperature or UV light crosslinking of PIs will destroy the AgNWs electrodes. What’s more, the intrinsic insolubility and infusibility properties of permanently crosslinked PIs makes them unrecyclable. In this context, it is of great significance to fabricated crosslinked PIs that can both compatible with the semi-embedding AgNWs strategy and can be recycled by a simple and green method.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we constructed a robust recyclable crosslinked PI (RCPI) for application in high-performance FOSCs. The idea was initiated from the observation of ligand exchange of the cyclic Ti-oxo cluster (CTOC), in which the surface of CTOC has abundant -COOH labile ligands. These carboxyl ligands can be easily exchanged by other carboxylic compounds without adding extra reagents, which has also been used to design organic-inorganic hybrid electrolytes as cathode interlayers in OSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. With this strategy, we synthesized a linear and colorless PI (PI-COOH) with pendent carboxylic groups. The mixed solution of PI-COOH and CTOC in <italic>N</italic>, <italic>N</italic>-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) was found to form a gel within 20 min at 60 °C due to the crosslinking interactions. And surprisingly, the gel could be transformed back to the reprocessable PI-COOH and CTOC mixture solution if adding enough pivalic acid, showing a fully closed-loop recyclability. The crosslinked PI shows enhanced solvent resistance, mechanical properties and thermal dimensional stability compared with the PI-COOH. Moreover, the facial processing condition of the crosslinked PI make it possible to fabricate the embedded AgNWs@RCPI electrodes for FOSCs. The results demonstrated that AgNWs@RCPI electrodes with high mechanical robustness and low roughness could be obtained, providing a high PCE of 14.78% in FOSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication and characterization of the recyclable crosslinked PIs</title><p id="Par7">The design mechanism of the recyclable crosslinked PIs (denoted as RCPIs) is schematically illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Briefly, the carboxylic ligands at the periphery of CTOC (synthesis details of CTOC can be found in the “Methods”) can be exchanged with other carboxylic compounds, so that the intentionally designed PIs with pendent carboxyl groups (denoted as PI-COOH, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) could be crosslinked by CTOC. With adding of enough pivalic acid, the coordination crosslinking points can be gradually degraded via the carboxyl ligand exchange reactions, resulting in a reprocessable uniform mixture solution. PI-COOH was synthesized through a two-step process involving step growth polymerization and chemical imidization via using 2,2′ bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4′-diaminobiphenyl (TFMB) and 3,5-Diaminobenzoic acid (DABA) as diamine monomers (the molar ratio of TFMB/DABA is 2 to guarantee enough pendent -COOH groups), 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropene) diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) as dianhydride monomer and Ac<sub>2</sub>O/pyridine as dehydrating agents (Supplementary Scheme <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, preparation details of PI-COOH can be found in the “Methods”). The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of PI-COOH (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) clearly show that the broad peak corresponding to -OH and -NH stretching at around 3300 cm<sup>−1</sup> has completely vanished and characteristic peaks at 1787 cm<sup>−1</sup> (asymmetric C = O stretching), 1724 cm<sup>−1</sup> (symmetric C = O stretching) and 1364 cm<sup>−1</sup> (C-N stretching) appeared after chemical imidization, confirming the complete conversion of PAA to PI. The solution <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectrum of PI-COOH (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) clearly shows the specific signals of different polymer segments and the molar ratio of TFMB/DABA is about 2, which further justifies the successful preparation of the desired -COOH group containing PI-COOH. PI-COOH can be dissolved in DMAc and has a number-average molecular weight (<italic>M</italic><sub>n</sub>) of 94.0 kg mol<sup>−1</sup> as determined by gel-permeation chromatography (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Then the RCPIs were prepared via mixing the solutions of PI-COOH in DMAc and CTOC in chloroform to obtain PI-COOH/CTOC solution, which was heated at 60 °C for 10 min to obtain a pre-crosslinked PI solution and then coated onto a clean glass substrate to form the RCPI thin films (here the ratio of the exchangeable carboxyl groups between CTOC and PI-COOH was 1:1). It should be noted that the heating time must be controlled, otherwise the mixture solution would gelate and be difficult to be processed into thin films, though which could also convert to solution with the adding of pivalic acid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, after incorporating CTOC into PI-COOH, the sharp peak at 1538 cm<sup>−1</sup> attributed to pivalic acid/titanium ion coordination is blue-shifted to ~1529 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which is due to the newly formed coordination between titanium ion of CTOC and -COOH groups of PI-COOH. This can confirm the formation of the ligand exchange reactions between PI-COOH and CTOC. The diffraction of x-rays (XRD) test were conducted on the PI-COOH and RCPI films to further clarify the crosslinking mechanism. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>, the broad reflection patterns of the PI-COOH and RCPI demonstrate that these films are essentially amorphous. The d-spacing values corresponding to the interchain packing could be calculated from the diffraction peaks (2θ) located at about 24.5° and 22.5° to be 3.62 and 3.93 Å for the PI-COOH and RCPI films, respectively.

The recycling of the RCPI was realized by degrading the crosslinking structure in the DMAc/pivalic acid mixture via ligand exchange (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), and then the recycled solution was used to fabricate the recycled films. The reason for selection pivalic acid in recycling is that, since pivalic acid was used in the synthesis of CTOC, the use of pivalic acid could maintain the structure stability of CTOC in the recycling process. Besides, thanks to the relatively low boiling point of pivalic acid (~164 °C), it can be removed in the subsequent annealing process and thus the crosslinked structure could be restored. This procedure was repeated for two times to verify the feasibility of this recycling strategy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, both the 1<sup>st</sup> recycled and 2<sup>nd</sup> recycled films show a similar residue weight with the original films (both immersed in DMAc and CF), revealing that no evident degradation of the crosslinking structure occurred during the recycling procedure.

Since the RCPI has robust solvent resistance to CB, this process nearly did no damage on the RCPI substrates.

The inorganic CTOC contains -COOH ligands, which can be replaced by other R-COOH compounds, so that PI containing -COOH groups can react with CTOC to form crosslinked structures. Meanwhile, the process is also reversible if using excess pivalic acid, enabling the crosslinked PI to show recyclable properties. The PI-CTOC composite was then used to construct embedded AgNWs@RCPI electrodes, exhibiting good transparency, solvent tolerance and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, FOSCs based on the AgNWs@RCPI electrode provided a high PCE of 14.78% and maintained above 97% of the initial PCE after 5000 bending cycles at a small bending radius of 1 mm. Moreover, the RCPI still retains the recyclability even after being manufactured into the FOSCs. These results demonstrate that the recyclable crosslinked PIs through CTOC have great potential application in large-area devices, which is also in progress in our lab.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par17">4,4’-(Hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA), 2,2’-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzidine (TFMB), 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA), anhydrous <italic>N, N</italic>-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), acetic anhydride (Ac<sub>2</sub>O), pyridine, pivalic acid and tetrabutyl titanate were all purchased from J&amp;K scientific. 6FDA and TFMB were purified by sublimation before using.

At last, the AgNWs@RCPI electrode was obtained by peeling off from the glass substrate with the aid of water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Fabrication of the flexible organic solar cells</title><p id="Par26">The FOSCs was constructed with an inverted structure (AgNWs@RCPI/ZnO/PM6: BTPBO-4Cl/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag). Firstly, the AgNWs@RCPI electrodes were attached to the cleaned glass substrates by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as adhesive films. The PDMS films (SYLGARD 184, Dow Corning Inc.) were prepared by spin-coating the mixture of the polymeric base and curing agent (20/1, v/v) on the cleaned glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by curing at 100 °C for 3 min. Secondly, the AgNWs@RCPI electrodes were treated with plasma for 3 min to improve the surface wettability. Then ZnO sol-gel precursor solution was spin-coated on the electrodes at 3000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min to form the electron transporting layer (ETL). The ZnO sol-gel precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 ml ethanolamine in 0.937 ml 2-ME. Thirdly, the active layer solution of PM6:BTP-4Cl (w/w, 1:1.2, 22 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in total) in chlorobenzene with 0.4 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was spin-coated on the surfaces of the ETL at 2400 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermally annealing at 80 °C for 10 min. Finally, the molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>, 10 nm) and silver slug (Ag, 80 nm) were thermally deposited onto the active layer to form the hole transporting layer (HTL) and top electrode.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2212045, JQ21006), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21905158, 52073016, 21905018 and 21801213), Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2017YFA0204702 and 2018YFA0208504), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (buctrc201828 and XK1802-2), the Opening Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites of Beijing University of Chemical Technology (oic-202201006), and Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology (20203BBE53062).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Q.C. and W.L. developed the concept.
