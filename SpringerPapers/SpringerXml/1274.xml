A phenomenon called “sustained quenching” putatively provides photoprotection and enables their survival, but its precise molecular and physiological mechanisms are not understood. To unveil them, here we have analyzed seasonal adjustment of the photosynthetic machinery of Scots pine (<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>) trees by monitoring multi-year changes in weather, chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplast ultrastructure, and changes in pigment-protein composition. Analysis of Photosystem II and Photosystem I performance parameters indicate that highly dynamic structural and functional seasonal rearrangements of the photosynthetic apparatus occur. Although several mechanisms might contribute to ‘sustained quenching’ of winter/early spring pine needles, time-resolved fluorescence analysis shows that extreme down-regulation of photosystem II activity along with direct energy transfer from photosystem II to photosystem I play a major role. This mechanism is enabled by extensive thylakoid destacking allowing for the mixing of PSII with PSI complexes. These two linked phenomena play crucial roles in winter acclimation and protection.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Evergreen conifers rely on ‘sustained quenching’ to protect their photosynthetic machinery during long, cold winters.

is the basis for most life on earth, and the ability to sustain growth by harvesting sunlight confers such an enormous evolutionary advantage that photosynthetic organisms have developed numerous adaptations that enable them to photosynthesize in diverse environments. These include vast boreal forests, which cover ~70% of all coniferous forests of the world (mainly in the northern hemisphere)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which have lower species diversity than many other terrestrial ecosystems and are often dominated by evergreen conifers, like pine and spruce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Broadleaf deciduous trees and shrubs are also present, and sometimes deciduous conifers such as Larch (<italic>Larix</italic>) species, but there is no doubt that evergreen conifers are particularly well adapted to harsh boreal conditions, including short growing seasons and cold, snowy winters. Thus, evergreen conifers acclimations to boreal regions must presumably include regulatory processes that protect the photosynthetic apparatus in their needles during the harsh winter and early spring. Knowledge of photoprotective mechanisms in various kinds of photosynthetic organisms has increased considerably in recent decades. Several control systems have been identified that allow the photosynthesis machinery to harmlessly dissipate excess excitation energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In 2003, Öquist and Huner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> published a seminal review of photosynthesis in evergreen plants, which pointed out that overwintering conifer needles enter a state of ‘sustained quenching’ during winter. They found strong evidence for major alterations in the organization and composition of the photosystem II (PS II) antenna but also concluded that photosystem I (PS I) may play an important role, via nonphotochemical quenching of absorbed light or via quenching absorbed light photochemically through cyclic electron transport. Recently it was also shown that alternative electron transport might add up to this as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Up to date, there exists no clear mechanism rationalizing winter quenching in conifers although there are several proposed hypotheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Several protection mechanisms may also occur in parallel and (if so) they are likely activated largely well before the extreme stress occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. But the major conundrum arises in early spring, when temperatures are typically still low, so plants’ biochemical and metabolic activities are strongly limited, but solar radiation is already high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Once induced, the mechanisms need to be sustained, i.e., locked-in over the long winter season and protect the photosynthetic machinery. When conditions improve late in the spring, photosynthetic apparatus is restored and attains its active growth state in summer.</p><p id="Par4">In previous explorations of these phenomena, a marked drop in Photosystem II photochemistry (measured as Fv/Fm) has been recorded in several overwintering conifers, and some indications of the quenching mechanisms involved have been suggested. These reportedly include destacking of thylakoid membranes and associated changes in chloroplast ultrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, in accordance with the drop in PSII maximal fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In higher plants, thylakoid stacking and heterogeneity play crucial roles in the localizations of PSII and PSI in grana (tightly appressed thylakoid layers) and stroma lamellae, respectively. In conifers, although an extreme drop in maximal fluorescence (Fm) in winter/early spring has been observed, its mechanistic relationship to thylakoid structural changes has not been explained. It was recently shown that phosphorylation of PsbS and Lhcb1 might be a prerequisite for this phenomenon in spruce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, triple phosphorylation of Lhcb1 was linked with massive destacking of thylakoids but its physiological relevance was yet undefined. In the study reported here we monitored steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence, ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence, and chloroplast ultrastructure in Scots pine needles from autumn to summer in three successive years. Our data strongly indicate that chlorophyll fluorescence quenching and thylakoid destacking are strongly linked, mutually dependent and crucial for the survival of evergreen conifers in the extreme northern boreal winter and early spring, when temperatures are low but solar radiation levels may be high.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Seasonal changes in Photosystem II- and Photosystem I-related functional activities</title><p id="Par5">To monitor photosynthetic performance, we recorded several PSII and PSI parameters during three consecutive growth seasons (2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018) along with concomitant changes in daily air temperature and solar radiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>).

The component of NPQ that play a crucial role under fluctuating light conditions is the fast component (ΔpH-PsbS dependent-qE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> or zeaxanthin dependent-qZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>), which increased with increasing light intensities in all the seasons. In S and A, the fast component did not reach a stationary phase even at 1500 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> illumination, while in W and LS samples a stationary phase was reached at 500 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and in ES already at 300 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Most importantly, in ES inducible steady-state NPQ was much smaller and overall slower due to the smaller amplitude of the fast component (~50% less than in S) in ES (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). This is due to the fact that ES needles have already developed static NPQ. Instead, the quantum yield of non-regulated and/or constitutive loss (ΦNO) of energy was high during ES (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). This strongly suggests that this static NPQ is the fraction of absorbed light energy neither going to drive photochemistry (Φ<sub>PSII</sub>) nor thermally dissipated by rapid regulated NPQ processes (qE/qZ).</p><p id="Par8">To confirm that this static quenching is a manifestation of a “sustained mode of quenching” we artificially relaxed the ES needles (hereafter, ER) for 48 h in low light (80 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) with 18/6 h photoperiod. During this recovery, we observed no significant changes in Fv/Fm for 6–8 h (less than a 10% increase), a modest increase (30%) after 24 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>), and almost complete (95%) recovery to S levels after 48 h. Fo did not change significantly throughout the recovery period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>), but changes in Fm followed the same recovery dynamics as Fv/Fm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>), although maximal fluorescence (Fm) was much higher in S than in 48 h ER samples. ΦPSII did not change significantly until 12 h of recovery but recovered to 50% and 90% of S levels after 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>). qE/qZ-dependent fast NPQ kinetics followed similar patterns to ΦPSII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>). It should be noted that light-dependent induction of the fast component of NPQ (qE/qZ) was slower in the ER samples than in S samples, even after 48 h of recovery, which appears to be mainly due to photoinhibition.</p><p id="Par9">Seasonal changes in the partitioning of absorbed light energy within PSI showed that Y(I) was highest in S, declined in A and W, and reached minimal values in ES (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Although it decreased, Y(I) was much less affected than the PSII activity (ΦPSII) during the cold periods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). Y(NA) followed the same seasonal pattern, with minimum values registered in ES and a steady recovery until S (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). In contrast to Y(NA), Y(ND) considerably increased during the cold periods and peaked (at 69% higher than S values) in ES, then gradually declined to minimum values in S (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>). This suggests that during early spring most of the absorbed light energy is dissipated by oxidized P700 (P700<sup>+</sup>) to prevent photoinhibition caused by over reduction of the acceptor side as iron-sulfur clusters get damaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. During the first 3 h of the recovery period, ΦPSI did not significantly change, but it gradually returned to S levels over 48 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Y(NA) did not change much during recovery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Y(ND) increased slightly during the first 3 h, but then gradually decreased, and ER samples did not quite reach S values. Based on these results, we conclude that the restoration of PSI light use efficiency takes longer than 48 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Seasonal changes of PSI photochemistry in Scots pine needles.</title><p>Energy partitioning in PSI considering Y(I) + Y(ND) + Y(NA) = 1, where Y(I) (<bold>a</bold>), Y(NA) (<bold>b</bold>), Y(ND) (<bold>c</bold>) are the photochemical quantum yield of PSI (when P700 is reduced and A is oxidized), energy dissipation in PSI (a measure of acceptor side limitation, when P700 and A both are reduced) and energy dissipation in PSI (a measure of donor side limitation, when P700 and A both are oxidized), respectively.

In addition, a special chamber was designed to keep the rotational cuvette with the sample at −20 °C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). This chamber was used in order to maintain the “native” sustained quenched state in pine needles. Fluorescence decay traces were collected from pine needles in the same states as reported in the previous subsection: S, ES, ER: Summer needles (S) do not contain any “sustained quenching”, while E.spring needles (ES) contain the highest levels of “sustained quenching”. To resolve the mechanisms of this quenching, fluorescence decay traces of S needles in the original state (dark-adapted, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Summer dark) were compared to the needles collected in ES when sustained quenching was present (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Early spring) and after the quenching in the needles had been relaxed at room temperature (ER) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, E. spring recovered). To understand whether sustained quenching observed in ES occurs via a similar quenching mechanism to light-induced quenching, S needles exposed to HL for 30 min (SQ) were also measured (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Summer quenched). As shown by the direct comparison of the decay curves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), the fluorescence in SQ needles is much shorter-lived as compared to that of S needles. However, the fluorescence decays of ES needles are still pronouncedly shorter-lived than that of the SQ samples, thus characterizing the “sustained quenching” in the ES samples as the most pronounced quenching at all detection wavelengths and under all conditions.

Six decay-associated spectra (DAS) were required to fit the fluorescence kinetics in all four cases. Three DAS were tentatively assigned to PSI: 11–16 ps, 50–60 ps, 150–180 ps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).

The fastest component represents energy equilibration between Chl<sub>red</sub> and Chl<sub>blue</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The second DAS in S needles peaks around 685–690 nm with a broad emission in the 700–720 nm region. Therefore, it mainly represents PSI core decay in combination with the 710–720 Chls of Lhcas. The third DAS (185 ps) peaks at 680 nm with some contribution at 730 nm, and therefore, it should be primarily assigned to LHCII and some Chl<sub>red</sub> in PSI. In quenched states (SQ and ES, in particular) these two DAS have substantially higher contribution around 680 nm and, as a result, the reconstructed steady-state PSI spectra have higher emission around 680–685 nm as compared to the unquenched states (S and ER see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). It indicates that upon quenching PSII and/or LHCII kinetics also contribute to these PSI-related components. In S and ER states, the remaining three DAS peak at 682 nm and therefore, are assigned to PSII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Their lifetimes are 0.5–0.6 ns, 1.5–2.0 ns, and 4 ns, similar to what was resolved previously for PSII in the closed state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, in ES two considerably shorter-lived PSII-related DAS were observed with lifetimes of 0.3 ns and 0.8 ns. This demonstrates that PSII kinetics is indeed quenched strongly in ES needles. Additionally, we resolved a DAS with 8 ps lifetime in the ES sample. The “oscillations” in the spectra giving rise to the sharp bands are due to the mixing of the contributing components, representing excitation energy transfer (EET) from Chl a pools emitting at ~680 nm to those emitting at 690 nm and 700–730 nm, respectively. This suggests that there occurs efficient EET between PSII and/or LHCII and PSI in the ES needles. However, these processes could be unambiguously resolved only by target modeling.</p><p id="Par12">In a nutshell, global analysis results suggest that sustained quenching in the ES state involves both PSII/LHCII and PSI through a direct energy transfer. This mechanism provides much stronger quenching than the high-light-induced quenching in the summer needles (SQ).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Target modeling of the fluorescence kinetics of unquenched pine needles</title><p id="Par13">To resolve the mechanism(s) responsible for the “sustained quenching” in pine needles in detail we performed target analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> of all the kinetic data. In target analysis, a specific kinetic model is tested using a linear time-invariant compartmental model. Each compartment in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> is presented by a square box. Each box belongs to any of the three different components: PSI, PSII, LHCII quenched. Fluorescence emitting compartments are presented by colored boxes. The red flashes with numbers directing to that compartments represent the so-called excitation vector, providing the percentage of excitations directed to each compartment and should roughly illustrate the relative number of Chl <italic>a</italic> (i.e., relative Chl <italic>a</italic> antenna size) in it. Non-colored boxes represent non-emitting compartments, like radical pairs (RP) in RCs and CT states, which are contributing to the overall observable kinetics and thus have to be included. Target modeling is required to describe the real time-dependent concentrations of each compartment, rates between them (arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, ns<sup>−1</sup>), and spectra (species associated spectra (SAS)) of the interacting components. Note, that the global analysis, presented in the previous subsection, is equivalent to a number of noninteracting, parallelly decaying compartments and gives only the first indications of the processes involved. It is a mere mathematical analysis, not considering any physical description or information on the studied system. By testing kinetic models that had been validated previously on isolated subcomplexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> it was possible to separate the PSI from the PSII kinetics. Therefore, our assignment of PSI and PSII is based on a combination of the used kinetic model, resolved rates as well as SAS. The target model and the excitation vector presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> resulted in the best fitting quality (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). In S needles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Summer dark) the PSI kinetics was described with two emitting compartments (PSI red, Ant/core) and one non-emitting radical pair (RP, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The resolved rates and SAS are strongly reminiscent of the ones reported for the PSI-LHCI complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Kinetics from the PSII antenna/RC complex was described by one emitting compartment (Ant/core) and two non-emitting radical pairs (RP1 and RP2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. According to their SAS and rates, the emitting species represents the equilibrated excited state of the PSII-LHCII super-complex. In our analysis, to achieve a very good fit, two pools of PSII complexes with different decay rates were required (pool 1, pool 2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, see the detailed comparison of the residuals plots in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>) for the S sample. The two pools differ in the rate constants of charge separation in a manner that is typical for PSII particles with different antenna sizes (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> for discussion and explanation), which result in different average lifetimes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). In the S sample, PSI with its antenna accounts for 30% of the total absorption cross-section at the excitation wavelength (662 nm), while the two PSII pools account for 40% and 30% of the total absorption cross-section. No internal quenching related to any NPQ process of these PSII compartments was observed.</p><p id="Par14">The target model for the ER needles is rather similar to that of S needles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The main difference is that the smaller PSII pool (with a very small absorption cross-section of ca. 10%) shows an unusually small charge separation rate. The most likely explanation of this phenomenon is a small percentage of PSII RCs has been photoinhibited during the 48 h relaxation process from the sustained quenching state, which agrees with NPQ measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Direct energetic transfer between PSII and PSI is the dominating component of sustained quenching</title><p id="Par15">As for the S samples, also the description of the ES sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) required a three-compartmental target model for PSI and the presence of two PSII pools, each described by a three-compartmental model. The two PSII pools differ in the rate constants of charge separation in a similar manner as in S samples. The kinetics are also very similar to that of the S samples, however with a slightly increased charge separation rate. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the partial reduction in the physical antenna size. This goes in line with an increase in the Chl a/b ratio in ES as compared to S samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Resolved antenna SAS (Ant/Core compartment of PSI, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) of PSI in ES samples contains stronger emission in the 680 nm region, as compared to S needles. That is why we suggest that some LHCII strongly coupled to PSI contribute to it, like recently reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">The striking feature is the presence of a very strong contribution of a direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI.

This process has a transfer rate of 4.4 ns<sup>−1</sup>. A small compartment representing quenched and functionally detached LHCII was also needed for a satisfactory description of the ES samples (See more details on this component in the next section). Overall, the target analysis shows that direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI complexes provides the dominant quenching mechanism of PSII complexes in ES needles causing the pronounced “sustained quenching”.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Comparison of sustained quenching and light-induced quenching</title><p id="Par17">To model the fluorescence kinetics of SQ needles again three-compartmental models for PSI and PSII were required. However, unlike in previous cases, one single PSII pool was sufficient to describe the PSII kinetics.</p><p id="Par18">Besides PSII and PSI, one additional component was needed to satisfactorily describe the fluorescence kinetics in the SQ samples. The rates, spectra, and average lifetime (0.4 ns, Supplementary table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) of these compartments are strongly reminiscent of what was reported previously for highly quenched LHCII aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and the quenched LHCII complexes under NPQ conditions in wild type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants depleted of the reaction centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We, therefore, assign this highly quenched component to the quenched LHCII antenna energetically disconnected from both PSII and PSI. However, the addition of this quenched LHCII compartment was not sufficient to fully describe the fluorescence kinetics (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The species-associated spectra (SAS) and kinetics of PSII still contained a substantial amount of 690–700 and 730 nm emission, entirely uncharacteristic for PSII super-complexes, but characteristic of PSI complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, also the SAS of the PSI antenna/core complex contains a 680 nm emission, which is characteristic of PSII. This strongly suggests—as can be directly deduced from the spectral properties—the presence of direct energetic contact between PSI and PSII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Introducing such a connection in the target model indeed resulted in a considerably better fit (χ<sup>2</sup> decreased from 1.198 to 1.093, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Also, the PSII and PSI kinetics became well-separated in such a model. The resolved direct energy transfer rate from PSII to PSI is quite high (2.3 ns<sup>−1</sup>), implying that a part of energy absorbed by PSII is actually funneled to PSI. However, this rate of direct energy transfer in SQ needles is only about half of that in ES needles, suggesting that unlike in cold-induced sustained quenching, upon light illumination, spillover is not the major process. The contribution of the quenched antenna, on the other hand, plays a major role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Efficiency of direct energy transfer quenching in different conditions</title><p id="Par19">By evaluating the kinetic information provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> one can get a quantitative estimation of the degrees of light use efficiencies (for photosynthesis) on the one hand, and for photoprotection/quenching on the other hand, present in both PSII and PSI in the different situations (c.f. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). In S needles 70% of the total absorbed energy drives PSII charge separation and only 30% PSI charge separation. In the SQ needles the percentage of energy flowing into the PSII reaction center drops to 7.1%, while it increases to 67% for PSI. Upon strong light illumination, most of the PSII reaction centers will be closed, and a fraction of that total energy flowing through the RC can produce harmful reactive species like ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Since the percentage of energy flow into PSII decreases 10 times (70% in S and 7.1% in SQ) in SQ as compared to S, this means that the potential of oxidative damage is reduced by a factor of 10 by the quenching process. This factor is increased by a further factor of approx. 2 due to the large pool of functionally detached and quenched LHCII. So, in SQ needles the overall quenching provides a protection factor of 20 for PSII compared to S needles. In the sustained quenched ES samples this effect is much more extreme: Only 1.5% of the total absorbed energy in the system flows through the PSII reaction center potentially causing oxidative damage (assuming all other factors are equal). Thus, in total, “sustained quenching” in ES samples provides a protection factor of approx. 40 to PSII (double of SQ) compared to S needles. This huge protection factor explains well why “sustained quenching” is so effective enabling pine needles to survive the harsh winter and early spring conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Massive destacking of grana membranes in the winter</title><p id="Par20">In accordance with early reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, we observed strong seasonal changes in chloroplast ultrastructure, including loss of grana stacks during early spring (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Ultrastructural changes derived from morphometric analysis of electron micrographs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) indicate that average numbers of grana per chloroplast steadily decreased from autumn to winter and reached minimal values in early spring, corresponding to just 68% of S values (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).

In early spring, conifers harvest light energy but the use of the excitation energy for photosynthesis is severely restricted, resulting in potential photoinhibition. Hence, all overwintering conifers must develop highly efficient mechanisms for photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus. The major photoprotective mechanism for de-excitation of excess light energy in green plants and algae is the rapidly/ reversible ΔpH- dependent non-photochemical quenching (qE) that occurs in the pigment bed of LHCII proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

However, fast inducible qE was extremely low (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>) in ES samples and was not restored to S levels even after 48 h of recovery treatment. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>). This is not unexpected since, in contrast to the fast energy dissipation (qE) depending on ΔpH and PsbS-protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> the energy dissipation during winter (sustained quenching) occurs under strong down-regulation, even perhaps in the absence of ΔpH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, we can assign this relatively small qE contribution to quench to the small component (accounting for 4.7% of the absorption cross-section) of detached and quenched LHCII. This fraction was much smaller than in light-quenched samples (18%), and absent in both the dark-adapted S samples and recovered ES samples. Incidentally, a so-called “cold hard band” has been reported in low-temperature fluorescence spectra and kinetics of cold-acclimated evergreens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Features of this band are reminiscent of quenched LHCII aggregates at low temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, hence it is probably correlated with the fraction of detached and quenched LHCII observed in “sustained quenching” conditions. This led us to conclude that this quenching seen in conifers is not only “Sustained NPQ” but also has a different mechanism.</p><p id="Par27">Detailed quantitative energy partitioning analysis of total absorbed light energy by PSII demonstrates a strong increase (4 fold) of the fraction of constitutive thermal dissipation (ΦNO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). Usually, this thermal dissipation (ΦNO) contribution is not explained by any clear mechanisms. However, in the case of ES samples, it is strongly suggested by the data that the high levels of ΦNO do reflect the ΔpH-independent “sustained” energy quenching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our lifetime data provide an explanation for the origin of this component: A very high rate of direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI, provides this delta-pH independent (non-qE) quenching of PSII. Other photoprotective mechanisms proposed, such as, role of photo-inactivated PSII complexes may also effectively dissipate excess excitation energy as heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, and since the photoinhibitory quenching (qI), dependent on inactivation and/or degradation of D1, relaxes within hours (or longer), the process could also be considered a form of “sustained quenching”. Moreover, the involvement of RC quenching, based on enhanced S<sub>2</sub>Q<sub>A-</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>Q<sub>B-</sub> charge recombination, favoring non-radiative PSII RC dissipation of excess light has been suggested to supplement or even replace the fast component of non-photochemical quenching during winter, and thus play a significant role in overwintering conifers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, we found no indication of photoinhibited PSII centers in the unrelaxed ES samples that displayed sustained quenching. A component with these characteristics was not observed in the ES samples. However, even if it would be present it could not explain the strong quenching effect since this component has a longer average lifetime and higher fluorescence yield than the intact PSII units. In addition, we found no experimental evidence for PSII RC quenching either. All rate constants obtained from target modeling of the PSII antenna/RC pools in both unquenched and quenched states are quite normal. Thus, neither photoinhibition nor RC quenching alone could explain the strong “sustained quenching”. Moreover, changes in Y(I) suggest a lowered activity of PSI, even though PSI activity was less affected than PSII. In the absence of carbon fixation one would expect higher acceptor side limitation, but contrastingly we found Y(NA) less affected and donor side limitation [Y(ND)] was very high (compared to S). This makes sense if PSII directly transfers energy to PSI, making PSI an energy sink for PSII by reducing linear electron flow and in turn, causing PSI donor side limitation (oxidized P700) to increase.</p><p id="Par28">The detailed structural and functional data presented here enable inference of a coherent quenching/photoprotection mechanism involving structural rearrangements of the thylakoids. The model explains Scots pine’s acclimation to the combination of harsh freezing temperatures and high solar radiation that occurs during early spring in northern boreal forests (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Acclimation to early spring conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) results in massive loss of grana stacks (destacking) and formation of uniform membrane structures of stromal thylakoids and phosphorylation of Lhcb1 and/or PsbS, that has been identified in Norway spruce, could be a trigger for the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This allows for a redistribution and randomization of PSII and PSI. The reduction in the spatial distance between PSII and PSI complexes increases the probability of direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This protective mechanism severely restricts linear electron flow since it strongly quenches PSII activity.

In this situation, the excess energy is dissipated primarily through direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI, which appears in steady-state (PAM) fluorescence measurements as a non-regulated constitutive energy quenching. An additional, albeit smaller, amount of quenching and photoprotection is provided under sustained quenching conditions by the qE mechanism in functionally detached LHCII.
