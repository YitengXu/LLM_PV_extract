The electrolysis of water has attracted significant attention in this regard as water-ice may exist on both the Moon and Mars.

Herein we provide experimental data on the effects of gravitational fields on water electrolysis from 0.166 g (lunar gravity) to 8 g (eight times the Earth’s gravity) and show that electrolytic oxygen production is reduced by around 11% under lunar gravity with our system compared to operation at 1 g. Moreover, our results indicate that electrolytic data collected using less resource-intensive ground-based experiments at elevated gravity (&gt;1 g) may be extrapolated to gravitational levels below 1 g.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Oxygen production using electrolysis will be critical for life support and refueling on the Moon and Mars.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Electrolytic oxygen production (be this by the electrolysis of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, or by the electrolysis of regolith in molten salts or oxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) will be critical for sustainable habitation of the Moon and Mars. This subject may have seemed of only academic interest a few short years ago, but recent commitments by national agencies and commercial players to return astronauts to the lunar surface and to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon provide an urgent imperative to develop new approaches for supporting life on the Moon from resources found in-situ.</p><p id="Par4">The three-phase interfacial phenomena that determine the behavior of oxygen bubbles as they form at the electrode surface during electrolysis of water are strongly dependent on gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The average gravitational acceleration on Earth is 9.807 m/s<sup>2</sup> or 1 g; gravity on Mars and the Moon is approximately 1/3 and 1/6 of the gravity on Earth, respectively. As the bubble evolution behavior directly influences the electrochemical efficiency of oxygen production, the impact of gravity on electrolyzers operating on the Moon or Mars needs to be better understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. There are multiple examples of studies investigating electrolytic gas production under very low gravity (microgravity) conditions in drop towers (10<sup>–6</sup> g)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and during parabolic flight (10<sup>–2</sup> g)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, it is far from obvious as to whether such low gravity regimes can be extrapolated to the prevailing gravitational conditions on the Moon or Mars. Moreover, there has yet to be an experimental investigation of electrolytic oxygen production at lunar or Martian gravity. This knowledge-gap forms a considerable barrier to the design of electrochemical systems for oxygen generation on the Moon and Mars.</p><p id="Par5">Bubbles on an electrode surface typically evolve via four phases: nucleation, growth, coalescence, and detachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. A balance of various forces determines if a bubble remains attached to the electrode surface or departs into the electrolyte; the buoyant force acting on the bubble is proportional to the gravitational force and acts to drive the bubble off the electrode surface and upwards through the electrolyte against the direction of gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Under microgravity, where the buoyancy is negligible, the interfacial tension force that holds a bubble to a surface dominates, and as such, bubbles grow larger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A thick bubble froth layer around an electrode in microgravity has been shown to increase the overpotential for electrolysis by blocking the electrode surface, increasing ohmic resistance, and hindering the transfer of reactants to (and products away from) the electrode surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This process is visualized for a lower-gravity vs. a higher-gravity case in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The overpotential of an electrochemical half reaction (η) can be divided into the contribution from activation overpotential (η<sub>a</sub>), concentration overpotential (η<sub>conc</sub>), and ohmic overpotential (η<sub>ohm</sub>). Gas bubbles attached to an electrode surface act to increase η<sub>a</sub> due to a decrease in the effective electrocatalytic area, increase η<sub>ohm</sub> by limiting current flow to the surface and in the bubble diffusion zone, and decrease η<sub>conc</sub> by creating reservoirs for dissolved gas products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. As such, a clear relationship between gravity-induced changes in bubble behavior at electrodes and the overpotential of an electrochemical system has been established. Bubble behavior has also been shown to be heavily dependent on electrolyte composition and pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, as well as electrode surface properties and/or modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Influence of bubbles on overpotential in different gravity levels.</title><p>A comparison of a lower-gravity vs. a higher-gravity scenario where electrolytic production of oxygen via the electrolysis of water leads to the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of bubbles at the surface of the electrode. In the lower-gravity case, bubbles will adhere more to the surface, increasing ohmic resistance and increasing overpotential compared to the higher-gravity system, where bubbles will detach more rapidly from the electrode, reducing resistance in the system and lowering overpotential. The gravity-levels have been left arbitrary as this relationship applies to any comparison of different gravity environments. <italic>i</italic> = current flow; g = gravity; η = overpotential.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2022_28147_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">The same gravity-dependent interfacial phenomena that reduce electrolysis efficiency in microgravity have been shown to increase efficiency in hypergravity electrolysis (&gt;1 g). Hypergravity experimental conditions can be achieved by using a centrifuge to generate centripetal acceleration, giving g-levels equivalent to many times ambient gravitation. Under hypergravity conditions, the critical radius for bubble detachment is reduced, and greater buoyancy allows for rapid expulsion of gas from the electrode surface. This, in turn, exposes a greater effective electrode area, decreasing overpotential, and increasing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The primary focus of hypergravity work to date has been examination of process intensification with the application of very high rotational speeds; the large gravity ranges investigated (often &gt;100 g) make extrapolation below 1 g less reliable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, as quantitative assessment of the influence of gravity is highly dependent on the particular electrochemical system under test, inter-study comparison is challenging. The aim of the present study was therefore to use a simple aqueous electrochemical system to investigate the efficiency of oxygen-evolving electrolysis in lunar and Martian gravity conditions, and to provide experimental verification as to whether or not ground-based hypergravity research platforms could be used to estimate expected efficiency losses under reduced-gravity conditions, such as those found on the Moon or Mars. If such data can be collected without the need for parabolic flights, this would be a major advantage for research into electrolysis under reduced-gravity conditions as parabolic flights are expensive, not widely available and impose restrictions on what experimental conditions can be studied (e.g., the production of hydrogen must be strictly controlled, and the period of reduced-gravity is typically no more than 20 s at a time). Ground-based centrifuge experiments on the other hand can run for much longer durations, with more flexible operating requirements and such facilities are generally cheaper and more accessible than parabolic flights. To undertake this study, altered-gravity experiments were carried out between microgravity (~0.01 g) and 8 g. Investigation of the same electrochemical system across all gravity-levels was critical to allow comparison of the data collected above and below 1 g.</p><p id="Par7">We show herein that the same general trend in the efficiency of oxygen-evolving electrolysis exists above and below 1 g, whereby lower gravity conditions lead to lower electrolysis efficiencies relative to higher gravity conditions. A logarithmic trend similar to that which can be extrapolated from hypergravity data is observed in the region between 0.166 g and 1 g, suggesting that hypergravity research platforms can indeed provide data that can be used to predict the efficiency of electrochemical systems operating in reduced-gravity. Based on the data obtained, the electrochemical cell in the present study would produce 11% less oxygen if the increased overpotential requirement was not accounted for when operating potentiostatically, compared with a cell operating with equivalent parameters on Earth. Alternatively, the additional power required to produce the equivalent amount of oxygen by maintaining a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>–2</sup> would be modest, with approximately 1% additional power required under lunar conditions. This study highlights the relationship between power consumption, product yield, and gravity, and suggests that appropriately designed ground-based hypergravity systems can be used to determine the ideal operating conditions for a given system in low gravity, potentially negating the need for costly and complex parabolic flight experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypergravity oxygen-evolving electrolysis</title><p id="Par8">To compare with the data collected during parabolic flight, oxygen-evolving electrolysis experiments were carried out under hypergravity conditions from 1 to 8 g using a ground-based centrifuge (<italic>r</italic> = 25 cm). The average potential as a function of g-level is shown for all galvanostatic experiments in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. All the data follow a logarithmic trend, with a lower potential required to meet a fixed current at 8 g relative to 1 g. Comparison of the potentiostatic data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) shows that they follow a similar logarithmic trend, where the average current in a given experiment increases as gravity increases. These data represent the average of two data sets taken for all parameters, which followed an equivalent trend in all cases. Between 1 and 8 g, the change in required potential is 0.9–2% across all galvanostatic data sets, whereas the current at 8 g increases by ~17% relative to the current at 1 g. This demonstrates that a relatively small change in the anode overpotential can have a significant impact on the current when running this system potentiostatically.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Hypergravity gas-evolving electrolysis (1–8 g).</title><p>The average potential during galvanostatic experiments (<bold>a</bold>) and average current during potentiostatic experiments (<bold>b</bold>) with hypergravity conditions achieved using a centrifuge.

The same data sets were collected as in the hypergravity study; two galvanostatic data sets (50 and 100 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>) were also repeated in descending g-level order to account for any changes in the electrolyte over the course of a flight (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref> and Supplementary Notes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Data were collected at nine reduced-gravity levels, including lunar gravity (0.166 g) and Martian gravity (0.376 g). Examination of reduced-gravity levels below 0.166 g was attempted, however, the centrifugal acceleration in these experiments was not sufficient to reorient the electrolyte and overcome the surface tension between the electrolyte and the cell walls, resulting in electrolyte being partially on the roof of the cell at g-levels below 0.166 (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). This resulted in current loss via the pressure sensor ground connection, rendering data collected below 0.166 g unreliable. Some experiments between 0.166 and 0.5 g were also impacted by this issue and were therefore removed from subsequent analysis. Comparative microgravity data were collected with two stationary upright cells adjacent to the centrifuge (i.e. not undergoing rotation to impose a particular g-level).</p><p id="Par13">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the average potential as a function of gravity across all reduced-gravity galvanostatic data sets (a) and the average potential as a function of gravity for all potentiostatic data sets (b). The average of all cells operating in microgravity is also shown. While the electrochemical system was the same across all cells, every data set had a slightly different baseline, likely due to the custom-made electrodes and possible variation in reference electrodes. Additionally, each data set contained a different number of g-levels based on the quantity of data in a given set impacted by the aforementioned electrolyte reorientation issue at low g-levels. Consequently, taking a direct average at each g-level did not fairly represent the data. To assess the mean influence of gravity for each parameter, the percentage change relative to the 1 g data point was calculated for every individual data set. This percentage change was then averaged for each g-level and applied to the mean value obtained at 1 g to give the average potential/current as a function of gravity shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The reduced-gravity data appears to follow the same general logarithmic trend as predicted from the hypergravity results, where electrolysis becomes less efficient as gravity is reduced. However, the relationship with gravity is less pronounced and the larger error in all the parabolic flight data averages indicates that this result may require further validation in future experiments.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Reduced gravity gas-evolving electrolysis (0–1 g).</title><p>The average potential or current of all reduced-gravity electrolysis experiments under galvanostatic (<bold>a</bold>) and potentiostatic (<bold>b</bold>) control, respectively (data collected with centrifuge (filled) or stationary (unfilled) cells).

Hence, the average of 1 g data collected in cells on the centrifuge was used to provide a 1 g benchmark.

A close-up comparison of four frames from experiments at 0, 0.166, 0.376, and 1 g is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. The average size of the larger bubbles did not appear to change in an appreciable way between 0.166 and 1 g; however, an increase in small-diameter fizz can be seen between the larger bubbles at the lower g-levels. Compared with 1 g and partial-g, the maximum bubble size in microgravity does not appear to increase, but significantly more medium and small-sized bubbles appear to be attached to the electrode surface. The observation of increased froth layer at the electrode surface under microgravity conditions is consistent with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

However, the bubble froth coverage on the electrode in reduced-gravity was approximated by a comparative analysis of the color of each frame following conversion to grayscale. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the results of this analysis, where a y-axis value of 1 is equal to white and indicates more bubble froth, and a y-axis value of 0 is equal to black and indicates that more of the electrode is exposed. While larger bubbles would increase the coverage of the electrode surface, the dark interior of these bubbles would lower the froth coverage value as defined by pixel color. The observation that the size of the larger bubbles does not change significantly from 0.166 to 1 g indicates that pixel color is a fair approximation of electrode coverage. All reduced-gravity data sets were averaged; the fitted trend for each parameter is shown to follow the same logarithmic trend as that seen in the electrolysis data. The froth coverage is also shown for microgravity cells. In all cases, the greater froth coverage observed in the visual analysis of the footage translates to a higher normalized froth coverage value based on pixel color values. Bubble production is proportional to current flow, thus the pixel color averages would be expected to increase in the order 50 &lt; 75 &lt; 100 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>.

This is shown visually in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and is tabulated in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> for a representative sample set of bubbles of approximately equivalent size under 1 g and microgravity. As well as static attachment behavior, the attachment angle of similar sized bubbles highlights the difference in lifecycle, where a bubble that is stable in the growth phase at low gravity may be close to detachment in higher gravity (see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). In this case, the mean contact angle in microgravity was found to be approximately 18° smaller than in 1 g. The difference between the advancing and receding contact angles in 1 g increased as bubble size increased. When the maximum difference between the advancing and receding angle is reached as the bubble grows, the bubble can be expected to slide along the electrode surface, potentially coalescing with other bubbles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the absence of a strong gravitational force, this sliding motion of bubbles does not occur. The observed difference between average contact angles at different gravity levels is not in line with previous work, which found that the contact angles of oxygen bubbles in dilute sulfuric acid are relatively unchanged in microgravity compared with 1 g<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A possible reason for this difference is that the electrochemical cells used in the present study have an internal volume two orders of magnitude larger than in this previous study (based on the dimensions given by Matsushima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>). It follows that the influence of hydrostatic pressure on contact angle in our study would likely be much greater, as hydrostatic pressure is directly proportional to both gravity and the height of the fluid column<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

This relationship was found, empirically, to be logarithmic. This section aims to present briefly a physical and mathematical explanation as to why this nonlinear trend exists. Overpotential has been shown to have a linear dependence on increasing bubble volume on the electrode surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Given this relationship, the nonlinearity observed must stem from the bubble coverage.</p><p id="Par22">A bubble growing on the surface of an electrode has forces acting upon it, which can either favor or oppose bubble detachment. In the case of a vertical electrode, detachment can result in the bubble sliding or lifting-off (further addressed in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The most significant force pulling a bubble from a surface is buoyancy, which is directly proportional to gravity and the weight of the fluid displaced by the bubble (i.e., the volume of the bubble multiplied by electrolyte density). Regardless, the bubble will remain attached so long as the forces which oppose detachment are greater than the forces which favor detachment. The force that contributes most significantly to bubble attachment is the interfacial tension force, the force caused by the interfacial tension between the gas, liquid, and the solid electrode. The interfacial tension force (<italic>F</italic><sub>σ</sub>) is directly related to the contact diameter (<italic>d</italic><sub>c</sub>) and the bubble contact angle (θ) (Eq. <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>).

For example, a bubble of equivalent volume will experience half the buoyant force at 0.5 g as it does at 1 g. While the contact angle and contact diameter will also change based on gravity and its influence on how a bubble sits on a surface (e.g., Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), this change is comparative, meaning that the interfacial tension force will reduce less than the buoyancy force does. So, in the lower-g condition, interfacial tension becomes more significant than buoyancy. Consequently, as gravity decreases, bubbles are increasingly less likely to depart the surface and can, therefore, grow larger.</p><p id="Par24">While multiple dimensionless quantities have been considered (see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), it was determined that the limitations or specificities of each limit their value in the context of this work. The most relevant when characterizing bubble behavior across varying gravitational accelerations is the Bond number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which is the ratio of the buoyant force to surface-tension force and captures the two most fundamental competing influences observed in our experiments: surface tension effects (which dominate in low gravity) and buoyant effects (which dominate at higher gravity levels). However, there remain limitations to the Bond number’s relevance since it scales linearly with gravity and assumes that the gas bubbles are surrounded by the liquid. A more appropriate dimensionless number, not yet developed, would consider properties of the solid phase, such as surface roughness or surface energy.</p><p id="Par25">As a bubble grows, it can expand along the electrode surface. The maximum contact diameter occurs just before bubble detachment; under low gravity conditions, larger bubbles result in greater contact area and greater interfacial tension force, which can, in turn, offset the increase in buoyant force with increasing volume.

While the research described in this paper is purely based on experimental data and analysis, the authors recognize that there have been extensive efforts to model related physical phenomena. Modeling efforts typically make simplifying assumptions, such as focusing on a single bubble or assuming adiabatic conditions. Nonetheless, robust models have been developed, which agree with the general findings of this research. Modelers such as Kim, Dhruv, Burke and Di Bari have created fluid dynamic models of boiling heat exchangers and single bubble detachment from an orifice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

At lower gravity levels, an increased bubble froth layer at the electrode surface will increase ohmic resistance and the anode overpotential, and will thus decrease the efficiency of the system relative to an equivalent system operating in 1 g. While the specific influence of gravity will be highly dependent on the precise nature of the electrochemical system in question, assessing the impact of gravity on the system presented in this work highlights some important general considerations.</p><p id="Par29">The relationship between potential, current density, and gravity found experimentally is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, where galvanostatic data points extend horizontally across the graph and the potentiostatic data points extend vertically. As the g-level experienced by the system decreases from 8 g to 0.166 g, a corresponding increase in anode overpotential can be seen, which can be attributed to bubble retention increasing ohmic resistance. The impact of gravity appears to increase with increasing current density, which is consistent with previous work and logically follows from the idea that more bubbles in total would lead to a greater positive or negative influence resulting from their behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, this trend may only hold up to a certain current density. High bubble production rates in reduced-gravity conditions could work against the effect of reduced-gravity as rapid bubble growth can induce localized convective flow and bubble detachment can generate turbulence in the electrolyte, which in turn can decrease concentration gradients and aid in the detachment of other bubbles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> also found that the influence of hypergravity dominated up to a current density of 500 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>, after which the effect of increased bubble production started to counteract the energy saving effect of increased gravity.

Understanding the relationship between these factors will allow for mitigation and prioritization. Considering the axes of Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and the current density range studied for this system, it is evident that a small percentage change in the anode overpotential can generate a large percentage change in the current flow. Current is directly proportional to the charge passed; if it is assumed that there is an equivalent Faradaic efficiency at all g-levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the percentage reduction in current can be assumed to equate to the percentage reduction in oxygen generated by a given system.</p><p id="Par31">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides an example of the predicted impact of operating an identical cell with identical parameters on Mars, or the Moon, as compared to Earth. In this case, the impact on electrolysis power requirements would be ~1% when operating on the Moon galvanostatically if an equal product output was targeted. However, the impact of not considering the increased voltage requirement when running potentiostatically would result in 11% less oxygen produced in equivalent time in a system operating using identical parameters to Earth. The precise values given in this example are only relevant to the electrochemical cell used in this study and the chosen current density, but it demonstrates the possible impact of not accounting for the effect of gravity. The expected efficiency or product loss for a larger-scale system could be more pronounced.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Practical implication of low gravity electrolysis.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Control</p></th><th><p>Mars</p></th><th><p>Moon</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Galvanostatic</p></td><td><p>0.6% ↑ power</p><p>Equal product</p></td><td><p>1.1% ↑ power</p><p>Equal product</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Potentiostatic</p></td><td><p>6% ↓ power</p><p>6% ↓ product</p></td><td><p>11% ↓ power</p><p>11% ↓ product</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The impact on power (W) and production (% oxygen relative to production on Earth at 1 g) of oxygen-evolving electrolysis run with the system investigated in the present study, where the exact control parameter used on Earth is maintained on Mars or the Moon.

Using the oxygen-evolving FFC-Cambridge molten salt process as an example, potentiostatic control is often used to ensure that the potential remains below that which is required to decompose the CaCl<sub>2</sub> electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This could be critical if the level of impurities (such as chlorine) in the oxygen output of a lunar system had to be below a certain level for direct use or further purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Additionally, if incomplete reduction of an oxide (e.g., lunar regolith) was targeted as the most efficient reduction level for oxygen extraction, potentiostatic control may be more efficient in terms of time and current efficiency. Regardless of whether the system is operated using potentiostatic or galvanostatic control, it will be critical to account for the gravity-induced overpotential at the oxygen-evolving anode that will increase the energy consumption of the system relative to operation on Earth. If overpotential is not accounted for, and the same operating parameters are used, there is the potential to significantly decrease the product output of the system.</p><p id="Par33">The sensitivity of the anodic current density in response to a change in applied potential can inform as to how a given oxygen-evolving system may respond in reduced-gravity environments. The proportional impact of low gravity on product output and power consumption of a specific system can, in fact, be predicted without any altered-gravity experimentation. Looking at Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> as an example, if we consider the axis in terms of percentage change, the slope of the data obtained at 1 g is approximately 10, as in the current density increases at 10 times the rate of the potential. In turn, this is reflected in the impact on product output in potentiostatic mode being 10 times greater than the impact on power consumption in galvanostatic mode. Assessment of the gradient between potential and current density in any given system would allow for an approximation of the ratio between these efficiency losses in the appropriate current density range. The steeper the gradient is in a system operating in 1 g (i.e., large current change resulting from a small change in applied potential), the greater the possible influence gravity may have on the product output of a system if operated potentiostatically and overpotential is not accounted for. In galvanostatic operation, an increase in energy consumption due to a higher operating potential is inevitable and should be accounted for when designing an oxygen-evolving electrolyzer for the Moon or Mars. Previous studies have found that the overpotential of a gas-evolving electrochemical system was more sensitive to gravity, and comparable to the influence on current density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In such a system, the energy cost resulting from low gravity galvanostatic operation may be more significant. If the power allowance of a gas-evolving electrolysis system was particularly constrained and higher operating potentials were not possible, a lower product output in equivalent time may be preferred.</p><p id="Par34">Determining the exact efficiency losses expected for a system operating on the Moon or Mars would require understanding the expected shift in the polarization curve resulting from changing gravity (i.e., the separation between the lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This shift reflects the logarithmic slope of the trendlines identified in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and would most likely need to be determined experimentally as it is highly dependent on the electrolyte, electrode surface, spatial arrangement, and operating parameters. The present work confirms that hypergravity experimentation can be used to identify trends relevant to lunar and Martian gravity.</p><p id="Par35">In this work, the influence of gravity on an oxygen-evolving system was investigated from microgravity (10<sup>–2</sup> g), through reduced-gravity (including lunar and Martian gravity), to hypergravity (up to 8 g) to try to understand how oxygen-evolving electrolysis systems may behave on the Moon or Mars. Additionally, this study aimed to assess experimentally if hypergravity trends could be extrapolated to lunar gravity, to simplify future research into electrolyzer systems destined for the Moon or Mars.</p><p id="Par36">It was found that the influence of gravity on galvanostatic and potentiostatic electrolysis efficiency in an acidic electrolyte followed a logarithmic relationship across all studied g-levels. Gas bubbles departed the electrode surface more rapidly as the gravitational force, and consequently, the buoyancy increased. The impact of gravity on electrolysis appeared less pronounced in reduced-gravity compared with hypergravity and there was larger variation within data sets. However, in principle there appears to be no reason why logarithmic hypergravity trends could not be extrapolated to lunar gravity (i.e., no drastic change in behavior between 1 and 0.166 g was observed). This result suggests that hypergravity research platforms such as ground-based centrifuges can indeed be used to predict gas-evolving electrolysis efficiency at lunar and Martian gravity, provided that the influence of external factors such as vibration and centrifugal effects are taken into account.</p><p id="Par37">In the present electrochemical system studied between 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>, it was found that the increase in anodic overpotential in reduced-gravity would result in higher power consumption (up to 1.1%) or lower product yields (up to 11%) in a system operating on the Moon or Mars relative to Earth. In general, the effect that gravity had on electrolysis was found to become more pronounced as the current density was increased. The impact on product output in the studied system is more significant due to the relationship between overpotential and current density. This could be mitigated by increasing the operating potential according to the anticipated gravity-induced increase in overpotential, or possibly by introducing countermeasures such as structured electrodes or forced convection. Overall, higher power budgets will likely be needed for Martian and lunar multiphase gas-evolving electrolyzers and this work shows that the impact of gravity on a specific system can be assessed with ground-based hypergravity research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par38">Hyper-gravity experiments from 1 to 8 g were conducted in a laboratory setting using a short-arm centrifuge (radius = 25 cm); two cells on opposite arms were used to collect data.

Each set of frames was scaled and the rotation was adjusted using the known 1.25 cm electrode edge. A 1 cm<sup>2</sup> frame was cropped from the center of each electrode for comparison. Approximation of the bubble froth coverage and retention was achieved by converting each frame (excluding 0 and 20 s) to grayscale and calculating the average normalized pixel color across an experiment, with 0 being black and 1 being white. To remove the influence of different lighting baselines the average percentage change relative to the average of 1 g was calculated. To compare the change in bubble attachment angle between 1 g and microgravity, frames corresponding to 6 and 16 s were selected from the side camera footage of a stationary cell and unhindered bubbles (<italic>n</italic> = 16) were selected for analysis. Here, a gas bubble submerged in liquid is investigated and thus the outside angle is of interest. Images were analyzed using the ImageJ Contact Angle plug-in. The advancing and receding attachment angles were measured three times per bubble and the results were averaged. Additional information pertaining to this measurement can be found in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>B.A. Lomax thanks ESA, Metalysis Ltd, and the University of Glasgow for funding through the ESA Networking/Partnership Initiative (4000125409/18/NL/MH/mg), and also thanks the UK Space Agency for support.
