analysis by PLEX-ID assay was applied to an extreme maternity case where the false mother and the child have at least one allele shared at autosomal 46 STR loci, giving inclusion of maternity with maternity indices of 3.3E + 13.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex-100 and proteinase K protocol from blood samples of the child and the adopting woman. The quantity of recovered DNA was determined by a spectrophotometric method. 19 autosomal STR loci plus Amelogenin were amplified using the AmpFlSTR® SinofilerTM kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and PowerPlex®16 System (Promega, USA) following the manufacturers’ recommendations. An additional 27 autosomal STR loci plus Amelogenin were analyzed using two domestic kits AGCU 21 + 1 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.agcu.cn/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.agcu.cn/</ext-link>) and STRtyper-10 G (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.zhcodon.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.zhcodon.com/</ext-link>). Locus D19S433 was included in SinofilerTM kit and the domestic kit 21 + 1. Amplification reactions were carried out using the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Life Technologies). The amplified products were analyzed using 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). Genotyping data were determined by GeneMapper v3.2.1 software. Additional assay was carried out that genotypes 40 ideal forensic autosomal SNPs (heterozygosity is near 0.5) identified in Kenneth Kidd’s lab at Yale. Besides, mtDNA assay was applied that has 24 primer pairs in 8 triplex reactions for HVIand HVII.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The alleged mother and the boy shared at least one allele at all 46 tested autosomal STR loci which yielded a very high maternity index between them. But, according to the SNP profile data for 40 autosomal SNP markers, different homozygous genotypes between the alleged mother and son at five exclusionary loci (rs7229946, rs985492, rs9951171, rs214955, rs1109037) excluded maternity. Mitochondrial profiles also clearly exclude mother as a parent of the alleged son because the two persons have multiple differences(i.e. the base compositions are not the same at the fragments 16102-16224nt, 16130–16224 nt,16154-16268 nt,16231-16338 nt,16256-16366 nt,16318-16402 nt in HV-I and 83–187 nt,113-245 nt,204-330 nt,239-363 nt,239-363,262-390nt in HV-II.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Different kinds of genetic markers are needed to supplement the use of autosomal STR loci in case where the alleged parent is suspected to be related to the true parent. In the case herein, ESI-TOF-MS SNP and mtDNA analysis using the PLEX-ID platform is more discriminating than STR genotyping by CGE method.</p><p><bold>PP-002</bold></p><p><bold>The Retrospective Analysis of 15 Burned Cases Caused by Laser and Solarium(Tanning Booths) in Beauty-Medical Centers Evaluated Between 2006–2010 in Istanbul Council of Forensic Medicine 3rd Specialization Board</bold></p><p>Süheyla F.

With significant progress in technology, laser epilations and tanning booths etc. (radiation and UV rays) became helpful aesthetically, making an impact in a very shortest time. Nowadays in large-scaled beauty-medical centers nearly all kind of laser and tanning booths can be seen. Since these machines are medical, they need to be used by doctors or medical staff.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Between January 2006 and December 2010, the demographic data of 15 people analysed retrospectively in this study whose physical examination held in Council of Forensic Medicine 3rd Specialization Board, who applied to beauty-medical centers for laser epilation, to erase tattoo, get tan in solarium (tanning booth) and as a consequence burn scars arose and they brought a suit against those centers.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The average age is 32.13 ± 8.2 of the total 15 people, 12 (80 % ) of them is female. 10 of them brought suit for the bad consequences of laser epilation, 1 for needle electric epilation, 2 for erasing tattoo and 2 for getting burn in tanning booths. 7 (46.6 %) of 15 people were assessed in 2010. 2 people got burnt in tanning booth had 2nd degree of massive burnt; one of them died of burnt complications. 10 people who applied laser epilation had burnt scars and hiperpigmented lesions; 2 people who applied tattoo erasure by laser had burnt scars and cheloid tissue. 7 people stated they were not informed sufficiently, not any informed consent found in the dossier. In the reports of Council of Forensic Medicine; 9 (60 %) of 15 cases occurred by wrong medical application without any surveillance of experts.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The utilization of those devices increasing in a very short time by non-medical or uncertified people is forbidden. Within the frame of laser applications; different laser rays should vary according to the skin and hair colour, allergen texture, like many other factors. After the application of laser epilation; for 1–3 days hyperemia may occur as an expected complication; before the application informed consent must be taken from the person. Similar cases may diminish if the increasing application of laser in our country especially in recent years are made by experienced medical employees and if informed consent of the person is taken.</p><p><bold>PP-003</bold></p><p><bold>Self-ignition: a suicidal method between demonstrative gesture and psychopathological problems</bold></p><p><underline>Filippo Maria Cascino</underline>, Tommaso Savì, Massimo Grillo, Calogero Mazzola, Livio Milone</p><p>Department of Medical and Forensic Biopathology e Biotecnhology - University of Palermo – Section of Forensic Medicine - Policlinico “P. Giaccone”, Palermo</p><p>Suicide by self-ignition (burning), is a rather rare event, estimated roughly in the order of 1–1,5 % of Italian national statistics about suicides. It happens when one burns himself alive autonomously, by an action intense and concentrated over time, usually made (at least initially) with the aid of a liquid fuel spread on the body surface (oil, petrol, fuel, etc.), that guarantees rapid combustion and high temperatures, then maintained by the combustion of clothing worn by the victim.</p><p>In the literature, such events are rarely described, and usually happen in people suffering from personality disorder psychopathologies (relating to voluntary search to receive intense and cruel sufferings) or are carried out for demonstrative purposes ("ethical suicides" or "self-immolation") such as political or religious reasons (the so-called "bonzes" in historical reference to the suicide of Vietnamese Bonze Thich Quang Duc in 1965, and Jan Palach, anti-Soviet activist of the "Prague Spring" in 1969).</p><p>The purpose of this paper is sharing the experience of the authors, who had the opportunity to evaluate subjects died by self-ignition; the willingness to make a striking public protest gesture against their conditions of economic insecurity was clear in some cases, especially those concerning immigrants or subjects with socio-economic problems, professional troubles, people suffering from distance from the country of origin and their families.</p><p>In other cases, less frequent as observed by the authors, the self-ignition was not made as a gesture of protest, either directly connected to the main intent of ending their lives, but it was assessable in serious mental illness that afflicted victims.</p><p><bold>PP-004</bold></p><p><bold>Fire-Related Deaths in The Temporary Housing After the Earthquake in Van City of Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Yavuz Hekimoğlu</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Gökhan Dizdar<sup>1</sup>, Nergis Cantürk<sup>2</sup>, Ipek Esen Melez<sup>3</sup>, Gürol Cantürk<sup>4</sup>, Zehra Zerrin Erkol<sup>5</sup>, Osman Nuri Güler<sup>6</sup>, Recep Dursun<sup>7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Van Branch of the Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Van, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Criminalistics, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Ankara University; Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Ankara University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>5</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Abant İzzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>6</sup>Ministry of Justice Van Attorney General, Van, Turkey</p><p><sup>7</sup>Van Training Research Hospital, Van, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> An earthquake, which lasted for 25 seconds, occurred in Van city of Turkey on October 23, 2011 at 13:41. In that region, 9 temporary suburbs were built which consisted of 3030 tents and containers for 19130 individuals. Even though the earthquake occurred in autumn, the construction for the new permanent settlement could not be finished before the winter. Electric and wood-burning stoves used for heating, led to the accidental fires in tents. The aim of our study was to analyze the fire-related deaths in the temporary housing.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The fire-related deaths occurring in the temporary settlement region following the earthquake in Van city were evaluated retrospectively. The deaths were assessed based on the age, gender, the cause of death, the place of death and the time of the death. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using SPSS 16.0 Packet Program.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 10 deaths and 5 cases of injuries were reported in 16 fire incidents in Van and its vicinity. Only 5 cases of death were sent for autopsy, 2 of the cases were females and 3 were males. The age distribution was between 0–30 and the mean age was 14.2 years. Four of the cases were children. The cause of death was burn and burn-related complications in all of these cases. All of these incidents occurred in tents and in one event 3 cases were from the same family.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although the earthquake is a natural disaster, which can cause a wide range of death and destruction, human factor can also be a significant contributing cause due to the negligence in the temporary housing. The stoves and electrical equipment in the tents can be hazardous and children are the most vulnerable group in these incidents.</p><p><bold>PP-005</bold></p><p><bold>A case of spontaneous human combustion in Bulgaria – what and how is it happening?</bold></p><p>Ivan Stoyanov<sup>1</sup>, <underline>William Dokov</underline><sup>2</sup>, Plamen Dimitrov<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of forensic medicine, multiprofile hospital for active treatment Russe</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of general and clinical pathology, forensic medicine and deontology, Medical university of Varna</p><p>The scientifically documented cases of spontaneous human combustion, in the absence of a proved external source of heat are very rare. We present a case from the village of Piperkovo, the region of Russe, Bulgaria.</p><p>On 19th of February 2012 a combusted body was found on the floor in one of the rooms in a deserted house in a small village. There was no electricity and no other source of heat in the house. The body of an eighty year old woman who lived in the house, her upper and lower extremities were burned to ashes. The head, small parts of both arms and shanks and the clothes on them were not damaged by the process of burning. The medico-legal expertise of the case proved 35 % carbon monoxide in the preserved parts of the shanks.</p><p>All analysis during the investigation process failed to prove an external source of heat, which could explain the heavy bodily burns. A detailed photo-documentation of the case was made. The authors suggest to the participant in this scientific forum to provide their hypothesis explaining the damages in that case.</p><p><bold><underline>CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-006</bold></p><p><bold>Domestic physical and sexual child abuse by the father of the infant - Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>1</sup>, Eleni Zagelidou<sup>1</sup>, Polichronis Voultsos<sup>1</sup>, Roubini Leodari<sup>3</sup>, Orthodoxia Mastrogianni<sup>2</sup>, Nikolaos Raikos<sup>1</sup>, Charoula Florou<sup>1</sup>, Elani Kalyva<sup>1</sup>, Lazaros Papadopoulos<sup>2</sup>, Konstantinos Chalazas<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p><sup>2</sup>Laborator of Forensic Service, Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p><sup>3</sup>Laborator of Forensic Service, Larissa, Greece</p><p><bold>Introduction &amp; objectives:</bold> The incident referred to domestic abuse and thus to lethal physical and sexual child abuse by the father of the minor, a 24 years old Roma heroin abuser. The child’s mother is a heroin abuser as well.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> We present a lethal case of 1 and 1/2 year old Roma girl who found dead by the mother some hours later. The incidence took place in their home, in front of the three older children. The victim was hardly physically and sexually abused: Multiple bruises were found (head / upper abdomen / buttocks / arms / legs). Sexual abuse with swollen, bruised labia major, vaginal and anal penetration injuries was present. The child died from severe craniocerebral injury with cranial fractures and brain injury.</p><p><bold>Discussion &amp; conclusion:</bold> In this case, a multi infant abuse is concerned, in which: 1) the coexisting severe form of sexual abuse (by nature and unnatural intercourse) with severe physical abuse, 2) the victim is very vulnerable to abuse in early infancy, where it there is no involvement in the crime, 3) the death occurred because the of abuse of the victim (severe brain injury). 4) the offender is the father of the victim (domestic violence), 5) the victim belongs to a socially marginalized and low wages, low socio-economic status of Roma social group. It is argued that in Greece about 68 % of head injuries in children younger than two years old and most deaths in this age due to abuse by their parents. The actual figure is rather higher because of inadequate identification of cases. On criminal side the perpetrator is responsible for homicide with intent (since there was deception even possible), but we believe that the distinguished character of particularly heinous murder. We believe that a thorough study of such severity incidents of child abuse will greatly facilitate the proper organization of detection and prevention (in the first and second level) and to face the very important issue of child abuse.</p><p><bold>PP-007</bold></p><p><bold>Multi Child Abuse and Neglect (a case report)</bold></p><p>Eleni Zagelidou<sup>1</sup>, Roubini Leodari<sup>3</sup>, Christos Kravaritis<sup>3</sup>, Polichronis Voultsos<sup>2</sup>, Nikolaos Raikos<sup>2</sup>, Charoula Florou<sup>2</sup>, <underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Lab.

In civil law there is a significant breach of personality (Article 57CC) in terms of penal law there is influx of criminal acts committed by persistent, such as physical damage (Article 308 PC) rather dangerous (Article 309 PC), rape (Article 336 PC) in which there are at least accomplices (e.g. injuries) and associates (particularly directly). The underage of the victim is an aggravating factor for the perpetrators.

Stress induces cortisol secretion, and the hormone also affects the immune system. The development of immune function was different from age, especially, pre and post puberty. After chronic stress exposure, it was considered that time of initiation of the exposure was one of the important factor effected to immune system. Thus, we investigated the level of cytokines concerning immune system such as Interleukin (IL)-1a, 1b and 2 in serum between young and adult mouse after single and chronic stress exposure.</p><p><bold>Material and methods:</bold> 4-week-old (young) and 9-week-old (adult) mice were restricted as stress for an hour once daily for 2 weeks as chronic, or once at the last day of choric treatment as single. They were euthanized at 60 min after the last treatment. The blood was collected and centrifuged to obtain serum. No restricted mice were employed as control. The serum concentration of IL-1a, 1b and 2 was measured with MILLIPLEX MAP Kit.</p><p><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> The level of IL-1a in young mice significantly increased but decreased that in adult mice of single and chronic treatment compared with control groups. The level of IL-1b in young significantly increased in single but decreased to the level of control in chronic. That of adult significantly decreased in single and chronic. The expression of IL-2 in young was similar to that of IL-1b. The IL-2 level significantly decreased at single and chronic in adult. Our results suggested that single and chronic stress exposure decreased IL-1a, 1b, and 2 in adult as corticosterone increased due to stress and suppressed both cytokines. But, IL-1b, and 2 in young was increased in single, and IL-1a was increased in single and chronic, although stress also induced corticosterone secretion in young. Unfortunately, we could not fully explain the difference of the results between young and adult.</p><p><bold>Conclusion</bold> We showed that the increase of cytokines after stress differed by age. This result indicated that the pathophysiology of the response to stress might be different by age.</p><p><bold>PP-009</bold></p><p><bold>Ruthless with his own child: report of a serious and complex case of child abuse</bold></p><p>Shimi Maha, <underline>Allouche Mohammad</underline>, Bekir Olfa, Gloulou Fatma, Ben Khlil Mahdi, Banasr Ahmed, Hamdoun Moncef</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Child abuse, long neglected by both society and medicine is now a focus of public attention.</p><p>Child maltreatment is intentional harm or a threat of harm to a child by someone acting in the role of caretaker, for even a short time. Maltreatment is commonly divided into four categories: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Neglect is thought to be the most common of the four and probably the most life threatening.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> This is a case report about a serious case of child abuse that met the physical, psychological and sexual abuse in addition to neglect.</p><p>This case was a subject of expertise in Department of Forensic Medicine of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> It is a little girl of 9 years old who was brought by her neighbors to the emergency department. She reported being a victim of burns means of a heated knife and cigarette butts. She also reported being hit by punches and kicks as well as various blunt objects on different parts of her body.</p><p>Moreover, the child says he was sexually abused by anal and vaginal intercourse. Despite multiple fractures to his limbs and pelvis, she never consulted and has been forcibly confined by her parents in their home.</p><p>Examination at the medical report produced in our Department of forensic medicine confirmed the effects of burns and fractures in the pelvis and limbs. Examination of the genital organ showed signs of chronic sodomy and even vulvar lesions corresponding to genital herpes. Psychological effects were considered severe. Permanente partial disability was assessed at 67 %.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Child abuse is more than bruises and broken bones. While physical abuse might be the most visible sign, other types of abuse, such as emotional abuse or child neglect, also leave deep, long lasting scars. Physicians and others in the medical community play an important part in identifying possible victims of child abuse. Some cases raise profound questions about the relative rights of parents, children, and those charged with child abuse.</p><p><bold>PP-010</bold></p><p><bold>Descriptive evaluation of the alleged child sexual abuse cases in Kartal district in Istanbul</bold></p><p>Alev Yalçınkaya<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Mehmet Akif Inanici</underline><sup>2</sup>, Sinem Yıldız<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Health Sciences, Forensic Nursing MSc Program, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Medical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> It is important to understand the variables which are related to the abuser, the victim and the occurrence of the sexual abuse events to manage those cases both legally, psychologically and socially. In this study it is aimed to lay out the descriptive information of alleged child sexual abuse cases in specific region in Istanbul to design detailed prospective research and prevention techniques in the future.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> The medico-legal reports of Kartal Office of Forensic Medicine and verdict files of Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor Court concerning the alleged child sexual abuse cases which registered between years 2005–2010 are reviewed. One of the researchers visited the courts with the written permission of both Marmara University Ethical Committee and the Ministry of Justice. She investigated the related files and documented them in a classified manner. Statistical analysis is executed by SPSS 16.0.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The total number of reviewed cases is 479 and of those, 118 verdict files were reachable to the researchers. Results indicate that %82.3 (n = 394) of all cases consist of girls and the average ages of the genders are 14.5 (sd = 2.40) for girls and 11.0 (sd = 3.92) for boys.</p><p>It is found that in 65.3 % (n = 77) of the cases, the crime committed in a house; the allegation types are aggravated child sexual abuse (only) (46.6 %, n = 55), simple child sexual abuse (33 %, n = 39) and the rest is aggravated sexual abuse with another type of crime (divest of freedom i.e.). %44.9 (n = 53) of the cases are settled by the court and the verdict is imprisonment for 16 of these cases (30.2 %) and “not guilty” for 37 of the cases (69.8 %). The duration between the time when the crime committed and when the cases are settled is 14.9 (SD = 1.24) months.</p><p>The most cited probable sexual abusers are male friends (61.9 %, n = 73), strangers (15.3 %, n = 18) and brothers (8.5 %, n = 10) and the three most frequent age ranges of the abusers are 19–29 (44.1 %, n = 52), 16–18 (18.7 %, n = 22) and 30–39 (17 %, n = 20).</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Determination of child sexual abuse cases in local districts is essential to understand geographical area specific needs of interventions. The most prominent result related to this region is that, juvenile girls are under the risk of being abused by their male friends. So it is imperative that the prospective prevention program has emphasis on self borders in both romantic and social relationship with the opposite sex.</p><p><bold>PP-011</bold></p><p><bold>Algerian Law management of Sexual Child Abuse</bold></p><p><underline>Fatiha Amara Boulala</underline></p><p>Department of Legal Medicine C.H.A, Algiers, Algeria</p><p>The authors report here the case of an older little girl of 5 years misused sexually by knowledge of the father and that lasting more than two years during the absence of the parents.

So, it is thought that the most effective outcomes are obtained about protection and prevention of child abuse and neglect with this method. Primary prevention involves the programmes like giving health care services, identification and treatment of psychological problems, alcohol and drug abuse, family planning, detection of risky groups, educating parents about child behavior, discipline, safety and development, encouraging positive parenting, promotion of social institutions to support families such as nurseries and kindergartens. In this study, it is aimed to determine the awareness levels of health personals, who works in primary health care services and to confirm the effect of their awareness to primary prevention.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> For this study, ethics permission document and corporation permission from Istanbul Provincial Directorate of Health were taken. It was interviewed with health personals, who work in 15 Family Health Centers in Sariyer, county of Istanbul. They were asked to fill the questionnaires with the principles of voluntary participation. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS programme (version 14.0).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In this study, questionnaires supported by 64 people were evaluated. 20 males and 44 females, having the mean age 38.3 ± 8.9 years were studied. 58 (90.6 %) participants stated that child abuse and neglect is a medical problem in Turkey. 26 (43.4 %) participants remarked that they thought the frequency of this problem is more than 50 % in Turkey. 22 (34.4 %) people said that they received an education about this subject and 8 (12.7 %) participants signed that diagnosed the abuse. Only 5 (7.8 %) participants defined a prevention team for child abuse and neglect in their family health centers. 54 (84.4 %) participants indicated that they went to house calls and half of the participants said that the house calls were beneficial for determination of child abuse and neglect.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> For success on primary prevention about child abuse and neglect, it must be handled by all areas about children. One of these areas is health services. House calls, which are one of the primary health care, provide prevention. Because of this, increasing of the awareness of all staffs in primary health providers in child abuse and neglect, giving more importance to house calls - keeping in mind and evaluating the child abuse and neglect in house calls- must be developed a primary prevention strategy.</p><p><bold>PP-014</bold></p><p><bold>Review of 89 Autopsies of Child Deaths From Violence and Neglect in Suez Canal Area, Egypt</bold></p><p><underline>Azza H El Elemi</underline></p><p>Suez Canal University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology, Egypt.

The extent of child abuse in Arab countries is not well identified. In Egypt there is no true data about the incidence of fatal child deaths from violence and neglect. All available data are related to natural death and death from deferent types of diseases. The study aims to investigate child deaths associated with violence and neglect.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cases of suspected child deaths from 2000 to 2007 in Suez Canal area were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were collected from the data base of the Forensic Institution of Port-said. A medico-legal autopsy had been carried out for all cases. Suspicious child deaths under 18 years old or equal were reviewed. Variables assessed were age, gender, cause of death and perpetrators of the crime.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 89 cases, 56 were males and 33 were females. Results revealed that child death was 41.6 % in newborns less than one month, 29.2 % in age group between 15 and 18 years and 5.6 % in age group between 10 and 14 years old. The majority of perpetrators were unknown (44.95 %), followed by the victim’s colleagues and neighbors (22.47 %). Neglect with no outward signs represented the majority of child deaths (41.57 %). Blunt trauma in abusive manner during street arguments was the second cause of homicidal deaths (19.1 %). The highest rate of child deaths was in newborn and early youth.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> While the exact number of child deaths from violence and neglect is uncertain and unknown, child fatalities remain a serious problem in Egypt. There is need for further examination of child fatality profiles associated with abuse and neglect in this age group and increase community outreach efforts to prevent fatal child abuse in Egypt.</p><p><bold>PP-015</bold></p><p><bold>Does late and non - intensive intervention in children with autism spectrum disorders, considered medical negligence: an overview on child neglect</bold></p><p><underline>Metwally El Sayed Abdalla</underline></p><p>Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Child abuse and neglect are often considered in broad categories that include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect. Neglect is the most common, accounting for approximately half of the reports made to child welfare agencies. Child neglect is defined by omissions that prevent a child's basic needs from being met. Autism spectrum disorders include people with autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental disorder-Not Otherwise specified.</p><p>Autistic spectrum disorders, presents at 2–4 years with impaired social interaction, speech and language disorder and imposition of routines with ritualistic and repetitive behavior. And is usually managed by behavior modification using applied behavioral analysis. Recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics that all children be screened for autism at 18 months of age oblige the development of interventions that are appropriate for toddlers with ASD. According to the evidence based medicine, ABA could integrate 49 % of children with ASD into the mainstream primary school.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> it is beyond debate that the appropriate treatment is ABA or early intensive behavioral intervention. The concept of early and intensive intervention should be highlighted and notified to child's parents, aiming at giving children with ASD the chance they deserve to be integrated into the mainstream in primary school.</p><p><bold>PP-016</bold></p><p><bold>Sexual Abuse Identified After Suicide; Case Report</bold></p><p>Kenan Kaya<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Ahmet Hilal</underline><sup>1</sup>, Demet Meral<sup>2</sup>, Necmi Çekin<sup>1</sup>, Mete K Gülmen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Çukurova Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Adli Tıp Ana Bilim Dalı, Adana</p><p><sup>2</sup>Adli Tıp Kurumu Adana Grup Başkanlığı</p><p>Child abuse is the bad treatment of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caretaker, someone living in their home or someone who works with or around children. Abuse of a child is anything that causes injury or puts the child in danger of physical injury. Child abuse can be physical, sexual or emotional.</p><p>Sexual abuse reported as a largest part of suicide attempt causes among the childhood. The incidence of suicide between 1950–1993 among the causes of death for children under 15 years of age as increased 4-fold and suicides were 6th of causes of death between the ages of 5–14, in 1994.</p><p>The case; In 14 year-old girl's body external examination, we saw that the rigidity of the death body was continuing, dead spots were starting in the regions not compressed, as purple spots.

In the examination of the hymen we saw that the hymen was 2 cm wide and notched structure, and a partial tear at the level of 7 o'clock. Ecchymosis and bleeding was not observed around the anus and hymen. In the internal examination we found a fetus in the uterus as the product of pregnancy and the fetus was 2.5 cm sized. As a result of toxicological analyzes, there was no substance in the blood. Fetus in the uterus was detected 6–8 gestational weeks, death was consisted as a result of mechanical asphyxia due to hanging, the only male DNA profile type was detected from pregnancy material.</p><p>14-year-old girl's suicide and pregnant detected after the determination of the autopsy will be examined in the light of literature regarding for child abuse and pregnancy.</p><p><bold>PP-017</bold></p><p><bold>An Unusual Face of Sibling Jealousy; Intersibling Violence</bold></p><p>Aysun Balseven Odabaşı<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Gökhan Gitmiş</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ramazan Akçan<sup>1</sup>, Emre Karacaoğlu<sup>1</sup>, Kaya Yorgancı<sup>2</sup>, Türkan Yılmaz<sup>2</sup>, Ali Rıza Tümer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of General Surgery, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Burns, a common cause of pediatric injuries, are responsible for severe functional, social and psychological damage. Most burn-related injuries in childhood are encountered in home environment and originally can be accidental or due to child abuse or neglect. Caretakers and parents are generally responsible for child abuse related burns, while rarely siblings or peers might cause burn injuries on minors. Here we present a case of girl burned by her elder brother, in order to draw attention to the morbidity and mortality caused by sibling rivalry, jealousy and inter-sibling aggression.</p><p><bold>Case history:</bold> An 11 months-old girl allegedly burned by her 4 years-old elder brother was admitted to burn unit of our hospital. Second and third degree burn injuries covering face, scalp, trunk and bilateral upper extremities, a total of 70 % of total body surface area, were detected. Bilateral upper-extremity amputation through or above the wrist was performed because of necrosis due to extensive burns. In following 2.5 years-period, she was underwent a series of skin transplantation operations, which are still going on, in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department. Interviewing with the family members revealed that the elder brother was jealous of his sister since her birth. Elder brother was said to be frequently obsessively mention about burning his sister. At incident day, when mother left home for a short time period; he enflamed his sister’s blanket while she was sleeping in the cradle. Elder brother stated that he was jealous of his sister and had burned her, in the forensic psychiatric examination.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Inter-sibling aggression, sibling rivalry and jealousy, which might cause high morbidity and mortality, have been extensively studied in the literature. However, to our best knowledge, this is the first ever case of intersibling violence involving such extensive burn injuries caused by a four year-old elder brother due to lack of parental supervision. Intensified parental supervision, and education and rehabilitation of siblings will play an important role in tackling such cases.</p><p><bold>PP-018</bold></p><p><bold>Prevalence And Correlations Of School Violence Among Adolescents In Tokat-Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Ali Yıldırım</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Karataş<sup>1</sup>, Resul Yılmaz<sup>1</sup>, İlhan Çetin<sup>2</sup>, İbrahim Şenel<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Gaziosmanpasa University,Tokat Türkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Cumhuriyet University, Sivas-TURKEY</p><p><sup>3</sup>Tokat National Education Directorate,Tokat Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The aims of this cross-sectional study were to examine the prevalence of school violence and of physical and sexual abuse with an internationally accepted child abuse screening tool in schools. We also sought to determine the sociodemographic characteristics (relation between school violence and abuse with students’ sex, age (grade), parental education, family income, parental profession or job) of victimized adolescents in Turkey.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study is based on a sample of 5032 students in grade 6–8 in all schools of Tokat city in Turkey. The instrument used in the study was a Turkish translation of the International Child Abuse Screening Tool-children’s version (ICAST-C) developed by the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN). In addition, the questionnaire collected data on the sociodemographic characteristics of the students and their family structure.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Students were subjected to physical (57.0 %), psychological (59.8 %), and sexual (6.4 %) abuse with varying frequencies. A large majority (73.4 %) of students experienced one or more of the types of violence. All types of violent behaviors were more common among male than female students and were experienced significantly more frequently in urban areas than in villages or districts. Emotional violence was most common (63.6 %) in families with a single child, whereas it was relatively lower (55.4 %) among children with &gt; =5 siblings. On the other hand, the incidence of sexual violence was lowest (3.3 %) in families with a single child, whereas it was highest (7.8 %) among children with &gt; =5 siblings. Interestingly, children in families with higher incomes were more likely to experience physical, emotional, and sexual violence, whereas these were rarely encountered in families with lower incomes.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To address violence against students, we must first conduct nationwide studies to provide a more definitive picture of incidence and prevalence rates and to clarify relevant risk and protective factors. Second, to ensure the accuracy of the data, specific guidelines and questionnaires are needed, as was the case in our study. Third, the deleterious consequences of violence must be explained to achieve greater public awareness about victimization in schools. Fourth, the authorities must ensure and reinforce the safety and rights of children by enacting strict laws against violence and abuse.</p><p><bold>PP-019</bold></p><p><bold>Close abdominal blunt trauma in child abuse: images under the skin</bold></p><p>Anna Aprile<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Francesca Menegazzo</underline><sup>2</sup>, Melissa Rosa Rizzotto<sup>2</sup>, Cristina Ranzato<sup>2</sup>, Paola Facchin<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Legal Medicine Institute, Environmental &amp; Public Health Department, University of Padua, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Child Abuse &amp; Neglect Unit, Pediatrics Department, University of Padua, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Abdominal injuries are the second leading cause of mortality in child physical abuse and account for 6 % to 8 % of all physical abuse. Solid organs (liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen), hollow organs (hypopharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, small intestine, large intestine), blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves may be affected. Reported case fatalities are between 40 % and 50 %. Those injuries may be detected on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans if suspicion of their existence prompts investigation.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We report the case of a child fatality due to inflicted brain injury and abdominal blunt trauma.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The child was brought to the ER unconscious. At initial assessment, she was in cardiac arrest, asystolic, mydriatic. After resuscitation procedures, the cardiac activity reappeared, but the neurological picture did not change. (GCS = 3). The child underwent total body CT which showed: subdural hemorrhage with cerebral oedema, pneumoperitoneum. Cerebral injury was referred to shaken baby syndrome and did not require surgical intervention, while abdominal clinical picture needed a surgical look. The laparotomy showed jejunum burst injuries and bruising. Neurological picture continued to be critical and after 2 days brain death was declared. The caregiver denied having shaken the baby and admitted to have hit her, slapping her twice on the abdomen. The autopsy confirmed the Shaken Baby Syndrome diagnosis; the abdominal cavity presented foci of diffuse contusions of jejunum and a peculiar pattern lesion, with three parallel linear bruises 2 cm long, referred subsequently to rib mark. The cutaneous exam of the abdomen revealed no or minimal signs and no pattern bruising similar to the one observed on jejunum.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The burst injuries of jejunum in children are very rare and this finding is observed in road traffic accidents or in child abuse. In our case the burst injury was determined by a violent blunt trauma. The external signs were too few to suspect the severe injuries observed “under the skin”. In abdominal injury, the force applied to the abdominal wall is typically dissipated so that the skin is minimally involved while the underlying solid organ absorbs the force and ruptures. In case of child abuse suspect, the visceral injuries should always be considered and excluded due to their high rate of existing in fatal events.</p><p><bold>PP-020</bold></p><p><bold>Interviewing child sexual abuse victims: Police officers’ experiences about the phenomena</bold></p><p><underline>Dilek Celik</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ahsen Kaya<sup>2</sup>, Burak Gonultas<sup>3</sup>, Murat Kocak<sup>3</sup>, Gokhan Oral<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istanbul University, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Istanbul Police Department, Juvenile Justice Department, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alleged child sexual abuse cases are highly sensitive and complicated phenomena, since the testimony of the child is often the only evidence at hand and the quality of child’s testimony leads to prosecution process. Police officers are one of the main figures among professionals working in legal context since they are integral part of the investigation team about the allegations. The aim of the present study is to determine some of the characteristics of police officers, who interview child victims as well as some of the characteristics of alleged child sexual abuse cases and investigative interviewing process in Istanbul. In addition, police officers’ beliefs about the credibility of children and their self-evaluated competence as an interviewer are examined.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The participants were 51 police officers, working with children in various different regions of Istanbul. The survey was conducted during the seminar which is a part of a psychosocial support project for sexual abuse victims organized by Istanbul Special Provincial Administration. The survey was approved by the General Directorate of Security and the participation rests on a voluntary bases. The data was analyzed in SPSS 20.0 program.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 51 participants, 46 of them are males and 5 of them are females. The mean age of participants is 30.4. Mean of working period in Security Department is 6.9 years, while mean of working period as police officers in Child Department is 2.8 years. Forty-three percent of the participants involved in interview of child victims more than 20 times. Thirty-nine percent of them mentioned each interview, takes approximately 30–60 minutes. Sixty-one percent of them mentioned that it takes 12 to 24 hours to deliver the file to the prosecutor's office. Most of them (72.5 %) stated that they interview the victim more than once. It is found that the year of working as child police officer is positively correlated with believing in child victims’ credibility and self-evaluated investigation competence. However, year of working as child police officer is not related with self-evaluated communication skills with children.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> One of the most striking finding of the study is the difference between the length of interview process of the child victim and the length of the prosecutors’ office delivery process. Another point is that, the working period in Child Department did not facilitate the self-evaluated communication skills. It should be concluded that there is a need for communication skills support programs for police officers.</p><p><bold>PP-021</bold></p><p><bold>Stepsibling Incest Resulting In Pregnancy And Delivery: A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Muhammed Mehtar</underline><sup>1</sup>, Muhlis Yıldız<sup>2</sup>, Muhammet Demir<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, VI Board, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Although sibling incest is thought as the most common form of incest abuse and is predicted to occur almost 5 times more than father/stepfather incest, literature is inadequate regarding this subject (1,2,9,10). Our knowledge is restricted to father/stepfather and daughter/stepdaughter incest (11). Due to limited empirical research, sibling sexual abuse definition suffered certain inconsistencies: “sexual interaction beyond age appropriate exploration” (6), “sexual behavior between siblings that is not age appropriate, not transitory, and not motivated by developmentally appropriate curiosity” (7), or “when the older sibling is 5 or more years senior to the younger sibling or when force is used no matter what the age difference” (3). Some authors mentioned sibling incest to be less harmful than father/stepfather incest while others claimed that ≥5 years of age difference between siblings causes more harm (1,4,8). Sibling incest was also noted by some authors to be as harmful as father/stepfather incest (5). No information on stepsibling incest was found.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Girl (8 years 6 months old) started living with her mother, stepfather and stepbrother (9 years 7 months old) in a 2 bedroom flat and was sharing her bedroom with her stepbrother. After few months, explorative sexual contact with her stepbrother took place and continued for a course of 2 years beyond her mother and stepfather knowledge. When she reached 11 years 5 months of age, her stepbrother assaulted her and sexual penetration took place to later continue his abuse repeatedly by threatening her until she got pregnant with 7 months when her mother had knowledge of the abuse. Delivery took place when she was 13 years 5 months of age and her stepbrother was proved to be the father by DNA analysis. She was assessed thoroughly 3 days after delivery by a university psychiatric council and diagnosed with Major Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. Another evaluation was made at our Council of Forensic Medicine 3 years 6 months after delivery and she was diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Dysthymia and Borderline mental capacity according to DSM-IV criteria.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sibling incest, whether biological or non-biological, is an insidious problem that should be addressed thoroughly as major consequences might emerge. Age difference should not be considered a main factor in implying the impact of sibling incestuous relationships and age appropriate sexual interaction should carefully be monitored.</p><p><bold>PP-022</bold></p><p><bold>Infant neglect – a forensic and legal emergency</bold></p><p>Alexandra Enache<sup>1</sup>, Alexandra Mercescu<sup>2</sup>, Veronica Ciocan<sup>1</sup>, Bogdan Enache<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Medicine and Pharmacy Victor Babeş Timisoara, Romania</p><p><sup>2</sup>Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, PhD student</p><p><sup>3</sup>Aristotle University, Lab of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> to highlight the urgency of the forensic examination and of the legal procedures in case of intentional trauma inflicted upon an infant</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> casuistic analysis of the forensic examinations on the basis of the gravity of inflicted lesions criteria at the request of the police.</p><p><bold>Results and discussions:</bold> of the 173 forensic examinations requested by the police for minors, 12 were cases of young children between 0 and 5 years old (on a period of 3 years). The trauma was recent in 78 % of the cases and old or of different aging in 22 % of the cases. We have identified excoriations, ecchymosis, erosions, hematoma and fractures, thus the gravity of the lesions varies from minor to major lesions which required hospitalization and emergency treatment. A special case was of a 6 weeks old infant, admitted in the emergency room with the following diagnostic: acute cranio-cerebral traumatism, open fracture of the right humerus, thoracic traumatism, abdominal traumatism, suspect of human aggression, Silverman syndrome, long oblique punctiform open fracture 1/3 distal diaphysis right humerus, massive hematoma right arm, abdominal concussion, multiple ecchymosis (face, torso, abdomen), ocular concussion left eye. Legal inquiry was focused on the method of producing the trauma (direct injury or falling), the objects which could produce the fracture and the concussions, how many days of medical treatment were required, if the life of the minor was endangered. By corroborating the clinical, investigative and forensic data it has been noted that the lesions require 50 days of medical treatment and that they did not endanger the life of the victim. However, we are of the opinion that, in relation to the age and vulnerability of the victims, the legislation should further protect this category by applying more severe punishment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have established that the trauma inflicted upon the minors were of varied gravity and age and produced repeatedly. The aggressed minors represent medical, forensic and implicitly legal emergencies. These cases require complex documentations and investigations with careful conservation of the evidence.</p><p><bold>PP-023</bold></p><p><bold>Child’s Death from Physical Abuse: A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Veysi Asoğlu</underline>, Esra Özgün Ünal, Gözde Şirin, Bülent Şam</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine, Department of Morgue, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p>Medical records; medical history was taken from father. 1 year, 8 months girl, father brought her to hospital because of sudden developed cyanosis and pulmonary depression that happens while she was eating.

Majority of the victims is female; the act is mostly repetitive, affects all parts of the society and often kept secret by the victim. In this case, we report a complex case of child sexual abuse, where three girls, staying at a dormitory, with similar ages and having a history of previous sexual, physical and emotional abuse were involved in an atypical sexual abuse.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Three adolescent girls; one being the victim (17 years old) and the other two being the offenders (18 year-old), staying at a dormitory of the Social Services and Child Protection Service, was seen at the outpatient clinic to assess their mental health in a case of an atypical foreign object insertion (mascara) into the vagina by the offenders. 4 other girls staying at the same dormitory were also involved. Anamnesis revealed a prior sexual abuse in all 7 girls. After clinical interview, post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative experiences scales were applied to all actors. Mental capacity was determined by clinical evaluation and psychometric tests. The victim was identified to have mild mental retardation and post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas the offender had anti-social personality, normal mental capacity and a post-traumatic stress disorder due to the previous history of physical and sexual abuse.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The children with a prior history of sexual abuse have later the tendency to become victims or offenders. This case shows that girls may also exert antisocial behaviours that develop in parallel to previous physical and sexual abuse which is mostly observed in boys. Dormitories, by influencing interactions between previous victims and offenders, may also be contributing to the occurrence of sexual abuses. Close follow-up of the cases staying at dormitories with a prior history of physical and sexual abuse seems to be very important in prevention of cases such as the one presented in this report.</p><p><bold>PP-025</bold></p><p><bold>Sexually abused victims with intellectual disability</bold></p><p>Sefer Bilgi<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Nesime Yaycı</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Akif Inanici<sup>1</sup>, Emrullah Tolga Dagli<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Pediatric Surgery, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Children with any kinds of disability are more than twice as likely to be physically and almost twice as likely to be sexually abused as children without disabilities.

The work with abused children involves several courses of action between institutions, namely as to the starting procedures to follow reporting of suspicion, diagnosis and preservation of evidence for penal purposes, as well as to the protection of the victim(s), all of which still lack a clear procedure. Several institutes often take part simultaneously in these early procedures and it is crucial that their own personal intervention be articulated with one another’s. The mission of Children’s protection Unit of Department of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical School is to reduce the emotional trauma to child abuse victims by facilitating a multidisciplinary team approach, which supports the prevention of child abuse through community education and promotes the effective prosecution of those who perpetrate crimes against children. In this study, it is aimed to share experience of Cerrahpasa Medical School.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> It is observed that the explanation of the High Court and the Prosecutors and Judges High Council in Turkey since 2012 which tells examinations of child abuse and other kind of violence cases can be done in universities which have a mirrored room and multidisciplinary team.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Turkish Criminal Procedure Code, which has been changed, gives a chance to the different perspective of expert and expertise system. That change has brought new hope for the protection and reporting of abused children. The legal authorities’ decision reporting that they have been accepting the universities' Department of Forensics medicine as legal expertise institution and also giving priority considers a milestone decision. Because in these institutions including the investigation phase all the legal and medicolegal processes can be settled. After the text, the number of cases admitted to our department has increased surprisingly. This situation is a cornerstone for the beginning of the change for the universities which hasn't found their desired position in the expertise system.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The decision to verify child abuse allegations requires simultaneous consideration of a specified level of evidence of abuse, the severity of harm a child experienced, and in some jurisdictions, the risk of harm to a child. The decision making process is complex and the resultant recommendations multidisciplinary protection team make about services or court involvement may have significant implications for the immediate and long term functioning and safety of a family.</p><p><bold><underline>CLINICAL FORENSIC MEDICINE</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-027</bold></p><p><bold>Work-related disability among Egyptian workers</bold></p><p><underline>Amany Salah Mohammad</underline><sup>1</sup>, Hoda Abdel Megeid El Ghamry<sup>1</sup>, Dina Soliman Badran<sup>1</sup>, Mohammad El Hafez Nouri<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology Department, Faculty of Medicine – Cairo University</p><p><sup>2</sup>Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health, Sudan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Work-related injuries involve a great number of workers, especially young people at productive age all over the world.

In the court file, there is committee report that states the paranoid schizophrenia, arranged by the Commune State Hospital regarding the complainant. The complainant knows how to write a letter of application to the court as of form, considering the establishment that the complainant was retired. He typewrites the letters of applications. In 2010, throughout the year he submitted 16 petitions to the court of the case, and the petitions were initialized by the Chief Judge and put to the court file. In the filed petitions, it was seen that there is a lack of meaning unity between the sentences. It was also seen that, without being based on a specific norm, some word’s initial letter was capitalized and made dots on both ends of the word. Moreover, it was seen that the petitions were underlined by yellow, red, blue, purple, pink, orange and green lead pencils. As a conclusion, on the writing samples belonging to our case, racing thoughts mentioned in the previous studies and also that is seen on schizophrenia patients. Together with the absurd patterns of behavior, for the first time we have been encountered with an absurd pattern of reducing the word to a letter and making a dots on the right and especially left side of the word.

Homicide-suicide is more common among family members. The Murderers are men, while victims are usually women and firearm is most commonly used instrument. There are rare cases of homicide-suicide by drowning for both murderer and victim or victims.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> In this study, the mother who committed suicide by throwing herself into the water after murdering her two children by also throwing them into water is aimed to present.</p><p><bold>The case/cases:</bold> A 25 years old mother who had been married for six years, killed her two children ( one of them is 5-years-old and the other is six months old) by throwing them into the water, and she also committed suicide by jumping into the water. The event took place by the river that pass through the park in the city. Her husband couldn't receive any news from his wife since the morning of the event, and stated that he found a suicide letter in his wife's bag. Eyewitnesses told that a man, a woman and two children chatted for a long time, then man leaved the park, women and children wandered around the river for a while, then the corpse of a woman and two children were seen in the evening of the day of the event. Postmortem toxicological and histopathologic examination showed that the cause of deaths was mechanical asphyxia due to suffocation in all three cases.

Our purpose in this study is to determine injury types and the causes of injury and to evaluate the injury’s results in term of public health.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Mersin University Medical Faculty Forensic Medicine Department’s legal reports of year 2010 were evaluated for this descriptive study. Besides cases’ demographic features such as age, sexuality, home cities, some other features were obtained such as causes of injury, injury style, date and place of injury, injured body part, the hospitalization need due to injury, clinics where injured patients were hospitalized (if any), hospitalization duration. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation and in percentages.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There are 1042 reported legal injury cases in 2010. 67.7 % of them (n = 705) are male, 32.3 % are female, average age is 26.6 ± 16.8. Injuries occurred generally due to traffic accidents (%28.7), sharp objects (%15.3), assault (%14.5) and poisoning (%13.4). Injuries occurred mostly in streets (%30.9), and in or around house (%24.1). The most injured body parts were face (%30.5), arm (%16.2), head (%15.9) and leg (%15.3). 61.3 % of patients who applied to hospital (n = 639) were treated in emergency clinics and there were no need to hospitalize. When we evaluate injuries in terms of sexuality; the first place belongs to traffic accidents (both for males and females), second place belongs to poison for females and sharp objects for males. When we evaluate the reasons of injuries; the ranking is accidents, interpersonal violence and suicides respectively for women while the same ranking for accident, interpersonal violence and industrial accidents respectively for men. The evaluation in terms of age groups; accident is first ranked reason for every age group. Suicide was determined from the 10th age and seen most frequently between 15-19th years for females. Suicide was determined in females 5–8 times more than males in all of age groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Accidents and interpersonal violence were first two reasons of injury of males and females. The first protection method for injuries in traffic accidents was prevention from accidents. If it is not possible to prevent, injury’s prevention is other precaution. Public trainings must be organized in these topics. Besides, families must receive consultancy about girls’ tendency to self damages in especially adolescent era.</p><p><bold>PP-034</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Sciatic Nerve Injury Cases at the Department of Forensic Medicine Between 2002 to 2011</bold></p><p><underline>Mustafa Talip Sener</underline><sup>1</sup>, Muhammed Ziya Kir<sup>2</sup>, Sadik Sahingoz<sup>1</sup>, Yuksel Anci<sup>1</sup>, Ahmet Nezih Kok<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine of Medicine Faculty of University of Ataturk, Erzurum</p><p><sup>2</sup>Branch of Council of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body is composed of the peroneal and tibial branches.

Actually sharp force is a rare method of suicide constituting only 2–3 % of all suicides in various countries. In a case with multiple, deep, lethal stab wounds, it may be easy to define the mode of death, but in some other cases it may not be so easy. The classical criteria for discriminating self-inflicted fatal sharp force trauma from homicide are generally considered as follows: (1) several injuries are observed on the possible sites of self-infliction; (2) hesitation marks are present; (3) clothing injuries are present. In spite of these facts, there are many case reports showing unusual features in the literature.</p><p>Self-inflicted sharp force trauma may, in some other cases, be a part of a scenario aiming to deceive legal authorities.

Patients presented pathological antecedents in 76 cases (66 %). Patients joined emergencies by their own means in 81 cases, by emergency services 26 cases. The pre-hospitable resuscitation was undertaken for 10 patients. The intra-hospital resuscitation was tried for 94 patients.</p><p>The attitude of the family was acceptance in 51 cases, a usual crisis of mourning in 44 cases, a verbal aggression in 13 cases and a physical aggression in 1 case.</p><p>In 37.5 % case the autopsy was not required in spite of the obligation to sign on the medical certificate of death, the presence of a medico-legal obstacle to the burial. The main reasons are pathological antecedents of the victim, absence of traumatic injury on the body and advanced age.</p><p>The diagnostic concordance was perfect in all cases of traumatic deaths. In 15 % of the cases (12 victims), the diagnosis advanced by the emergency physician was different from the conclusions of the autopsy. These cases concerned young subjects without histories, died suddenly or patients with pathologies difficult to diagnose (myocarditis, aneurism of the abdominal aorta).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study shows that the autopsy diagnosis is of a big contribution for the knowledge of the causes of death in emergencies.

This eventuality, from an etiopathogenetic point of view, has been linked to the so-called “Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome”, already known and described in the cemented hip prosthesis implantation.</p><p>Nonetheless, the pathogenic mechanism of this serious complication, clinically characterized by hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, increase in the pulmonary resistance and cardiac arrest, is not yet sufficiently clarified. The predominant scientific approach pays great importance to pulmonary embolism (adipose, bone marrow, cement, bone spicules) but other studies have suggested also other hypothesis, such as the release of histamine or complement activation, with hypotensive effects, or the vasodilatation induced by endogenous cannabinoids, as well as the direct PMMA toxicity.</p><p>In our case, the patient was suffering from multiple vertebral collapse from L1 to L5, thus suggesting a multilevel approach. After the preoperative tests, the patient underwent surgery under local anaesthesia and mild sedation during the cement injection. Nonetheless, since a small intravenous cement diffusion at the level of L3 was produced, the procedure was immediately arrested but the patient presented immediate hypotension and bradycardia followed by irreversible cardiac arrest. At first medico-legal investigation was not ordered, but an autopsy was anyway performed to establish the cause of the death. The autopsy revealed a severe ischemic heart disease, but a later histological examination for medico-legal purpose showed diffuse pulmonary microembolization related to the surgical procedure.</p><p>The literature review and the study of the case point out the need for future clinical observations on the risks, even if statistically low, of major complications in percutaneous vertebroplasty, which should require a specific mention in the informed consent.</p><p><bold>PP-040</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of the delay in execution of the penalty of imprisonment because of diseases</bold></p><p><underline>Volkan Ünal</underline>, Sadi Çağdır, Yusuf Özer, Uğur Çom</p><p>Adli Tıp Kurumu, İstanbul,Turkey</p><p>In our country, delay in the execution of the penalty of imprisonment is defined in the article 16 of Law No 5275 on the execution of penalties and security measures.

The lungs are the most common sites of infection in children and the liver is the most common site affected in adults. Spontaneous rupture of the hydatid cyst into the peritoneum or pulmonary, which is accompanied by serious morbidity and mortality generally.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> A 48-year-old woman was admitted to State Hospital with the complaints of dyspnea. The The pulmonologist was receipted antibiotic and anti-inflammatory tablets and was sent to her to taken her chest graphies. On the same day after she had taken her drugs she was vomiting blood. Then she was taken to the hospital and died in emergency room. Autopsy were done by Director of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum. The post-mortem examination revealed a large cyst (10x5 × 4 cm) in the right lung and there was no daughter vesicle. The histopathological examination of the cyst and lung tissue samples confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hydatid disease is a serious health problem in endemic areas as well as in Turkey. The diagnosis and appropriate surgical therapy is usually delayed because most of the hydatid cysts remain asymptomatic until it is getting complicated. Treatment of dogs with antihelmintics is the main procedure to control the parasite. In rural areas of Turkey this treatment is not applied routinely. In the rural area, sheep are home-slaughtered routinely. Dogs can access to the infected viscera. Diagnosis of the hydatid cyst is mainly based on ultrasonography and computed tomography. The choice of treatment is still surgical approach in the management of pulmonary hydatid disease. In endemic regions, it is useful to consider hydatid cyst disease for patients with dyspnea admitted to the emergency room. Rupture of the hydatid cyst may be fatal.</p><p><bold>PP-042</bold></p><p><bold>A case of toxic shock due to clandestine medical abortion</bold></p><p>Natalia Minelli<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Francesca Cittadini</underline><sup>1</sup>, Letizia Caradonna<sup>1</sup>, Francesco Ausania<sup>1</sup>, Riccardo Rossi<sup>1</sup>, Giovanni Loyola<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Forensic Medicine, Catholic University, School of Medicine, Rome Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Sant’Eugenio Hospital, Rome Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Unsafe abortion is one of the least documented reproductive health problems and, not coincidentally, it's difficult to document.</p><p>Millions women worldwide still have an unsafe termination of pregnancy each year, resulting in estimated 66500 deaths in countries with restrictive abortion laws, largely among the most vulnerable women, such as the poor, the unmarried and the young women.</p><p>We encountered a case of septic shock due to misoprostol induction of labor at 9.2 weeks in a 42 year old white woman (gravida 10, para 10). She died 6 days after she ingested 12 tablets of 200 mg of oral misoprostol, illegally prescribed, without prophylactic antibiotics.</p><p>Her symptoms included uterine haemorrhage, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhoea on day 2 when she was hospitalized with anaemia (Hb 10.6 g/dl), pancitopenia (1,92 white cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 69 plaquetes/mm<sup>3</sup>), with lack of fever.

Lung findings were mononuclear cell infiltration, thick alveolar septae, intraalveolar haemorrhage. The other findings were congested pulmonary blood vessels, pulmonary oedema, cytomegaly, fibrin accumulation and formation of eosinophilic membrane.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Administration of mifepristone in combination with misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue, is currently the most widely used regimen for medical abortion approved by World Health Organization and it is a safe and efficient alternative to the surgical abortion method.</p><p>The risk of serious complication is exceptionally low compared with other medical interventions, and very few patients require emergency referral. After medical abortion, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered because of reports of serious infection.</p><p>Common practice is that women administer misoprostol themselves at home, handling the treatment and most stages of the termination process themselves.</p><p>The importance of this case concerns the question of real public access to information regarding abortion as a clinical procedure and the specific obligations related to the part of health care professionals. Although improvements in technology and changed perspectives on rights had an impact on the abortion debate, remain crucial the significant disparities and inequities in access even within health systems that provide basic health coverage for all.</p><p>In the meantime physicians providers of abortion care play an important role: prevent fatal injury through knowledge of the common clinical toxic shock after medical abortions and advanced postabortion care.</p><p><bold>PP-043</bold></p><p><bold>Domestic Violence Assault versus non-Domestic Violence Assault: a retrospective study of Criminal Law reports in the Centre of Portugal (2008–2010)</bold></p><p><underline>Daniel André Martins Henriques</underline>, César Santos, Gonçalo Castanheira, Rita Sanches, Graça Costa, Francisco Corte Real</p><p>Centre Branch of the Portuguese National Legal Medicine Institute</p><p>Domestic violence is contemplated in the Portuguese Criminal Law Code since 2000. According to the Portuguese Association for Victim Support (APAV), in Portugal, during the year of 2010, there were a total of 16972 domestic violence complaints, a number that increased in 2011 to 18470. It represents 31.7 % of all Criminal Law exams underwent in the Centre Branch of the Portuguese National Legal Medicine Institute (INML, I.P.), during a three year time lapse (2008–2010).</p><p>This study has the objective to compare the victims, instrument of assault, location of injuries and impairment period resulting from lesions in Domestic Violence Assaults versus non-Domestic Violence Assaults.</p><p>Data was analyzed according to age, gender, nature of lesions, the instrument of assault, location of injuries, and period to cure suffered lesions. Levene’s test for variance and Welch's t-test were utilized to compare both groups.</p><p>During the previously mentioned period a total of 3844 Criminal Law reports were analyzed. 1217 of these corresponded to Domestic Violence Assaults cases, 960 female and 257 male victims, ages varied from 1 to 97, with a mean value of 39 (38.5892 ± 15.02762) years. 942 resulted of blunt trauma. The period to cure suffered lesions had a mean value of 4 (3.7442 ± 3.50393) days, resulting in daily work impairment of a mean value of 3 (2.6927 ± 10.72988) days and in usual labor impairment of a mean value of 2 (1.7472 ± 6.76170) days.</p><p>2627 of these corresponded to non-Domestic Violence Assault cases, 1035 female and 1565 male victims, ages varied from 1 to 91, with a mean value of 39 (38.5454 ± 17.07986) years. 1983 cases resulted of blunt trauma. The period to cure suffered lesions had a mean value of 5 (4.2667 ± 12.07120) days, resulting in daily work impairment of a mean value of 6 (5.7118 ± 29.47528) days and in usual labor impairment of a mean value of 5 (4.3037 ± 24.69471) days. The authors also characterized the instrument of assault and location of injuries in both groups.</p><p>Most of the cases comprehend a female victims suffering blunt trauma. Comparing both groups, the authors conclude that the age in both populations is fairly the same and that domestic violence assault normally results in lesions that are faster to cure, originating fewer impairment days for general work and for usual labor, than non-domestic violence assault. The authors consider that domestic violence assaults’ physical component is only the tip of the iceberg of a continuous and complex form of violence.</p><p><bold>PP-044</bold></p><p><bold>Postural Dyslexia: a medico-legal evaluation</bold></p><p><underline>Daniel André Martins Henriques</underline>, António Mestre, Graça Costa, Francisco Corte Real</p><p>Centre Branch of the Portuguese National Legal Medicine Institute</p><p>According to Da Cunha (1979), Postural Deficiency Syndrome is a disorder in the central nervous system functioning, characterized by impairment in transmission and integration of information necessary for postural balance. Various symptoms can appear within the same subject, such as, musculoskeletal complaints, as well as perceptual and cognitive deficit symptoms. This Syndrome can occur at any time of life. In children, after the acquisition of upright posture and bipedal walking, impairment of spatial reference, for instance the decrease of referential vision will hinder the balanced development of the body’s posture. It is usually during school years that disorders such as dyslexia, hyperactivity, loss of interest, attention deficit disorder will appear. Later in adolescence these symptoms will manifest themselves through musculoskeletal disorders.</p><p>The authors were requested by Coimbra’s Court related to Family Law matters, to infer if an adolescent was bearer of Postural Deficiency Syndrome, in a child custody dispute. Clinical signs and symptoms of this syndrome were taken in consideration to evaluate if the patient suffered from the disorder in appraisal.

Psychological evaluation concluded that the patient presented an intellectual level within the average patterns, with personality characteristics that can lead him to be a stable person, with a good level of cognitive function and psychosocial adjustment. Neurologic evaluation didn’t show any abnormality of the neurologic functions or in the patients gait or posture, thus no neurologic cognitive, mnesic or intellectual deficit was found to justify the possibility of a lexical difficulty.</p><p>The authors had to go through a thorough investigation of all the signs and symptoms of Postural Deficiency Syndrome.

Some impairment in facial emotion recognition ability was detected in these patients that lead deficiency in communication, social withdrawn and development of delusions. In this study, the ability of facial emotion recognition in violent patients with schizophrenia was aimed to investigate. Forty one violent patients with schizophrenia and 35 non-violent patients with schizophrenia were included in the study. Sociodemographic inquiry including the characteristics of violent behavior, facial emotion recognition test, positive and negative symptom scale for schizophrenia were performed in both groups. Sociodemographic findings in violent patients with schizophrenia were in accordance with literature findings. There were no statistically significances among right responses of recognizing the emotions according to facial emotion recognition test. In both groups, the most right recognized facial emotion was happiness and the worst right was recognized facial emotion was fear. However, the dispersions of misattributions to facial emotions were significantly different between groups, although there was no difference according to right responses. Some significance according to symptom severity scores was observed between groups. In addition, there was a weak correlation between the right response to facial emotion and symptom severity in groups. The insignificance among right response to facial emotion recognition between groups supports the proposal that the ability of facial emotion recognition is a trait feature of the disorder. Nevertheless, the new studies indicate the importance of some strategic education programs in facial emotion perception and recognition to gain the patients with schizophrenia to community, to improve the interaction and functionalities of the patients. As the findings in facial emotion recognition ability of violent patients with schizophrenia increase, it might lead to develop some preventive interventions and preclude recidivism in patients with schizophrenia.</p><p><bold>PP-046</bold></p><p><bold>A case of death for recurrence of Giant Condylomata Acuminata Buschke-Lowestein’s tumor</bold></p><p><underline>David Forni</underline>, Valentina Bugelli, Luigi Papi</p><p>Department of Legal Medicine – University of Pisa</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A case of death for recurrence of Giant Condylomata Acuminata Buschke-Lowestein’s (GCBL) tumor after 20 years from the previous diagnosis is presented.</p><p>The victim was a 40 years old man with mental disorders found dead in his folding bed in the home where he lived with his old mother in very poor hygienic condition.

It enters the anterior region of the thigh by passing under, trough, or above the inguinal ligament and innervates the anterolateral part of the thigh. The highly varied regional anatomy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve may account for its susceptibility to local trauma by direct injury or compression.</p><p>Meralgia paresthetica is a mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve characterized by numbness, decreased sensation to pinprick, pain, tingling and burning of its skin innervation area. It is a relatively uncommon disease. In a recent case control study of a large cohort, in the primary care setting, the incidence rate of this condition was 4 per 10000 individuals. Medical history and neurological examination are essential in making the diagnosis. However sensory nerve conduction velocity studies are a useful additional diagnostic tool.</p><p>Meralgia paresthetica has many etiologies and can be subdivided into two main groups: post traumatic and spontaneous onset. The spontaneous type can be idiopathic, metabolic or mechanical (from increased intra abdominal pressure or external direct pressure). Even though this neurological condition can develop spontaneously at any age, it usually presents in the 30 to 40 year age group.</p><p>In the forensic setting it is important to acknowledge that traumatic events like seat belt injuries following motor vehicle accidents and injury during medical procedures with iliac crest bone harvesting can arouse this disease.</p><p>The authors present two cases of males subjected to forensic corporal damage evaluation at the Centre Branch of the Portuguese National Institute of Legal Medicine. One of them was a victim of a traffic collision and the other one was performed a diagnostic iliac bone biopsy. After these traumatic events both started a clinical syndrome of meralgia paresthetica. However taking in account the injury mechanism we only attributed causal nexus in one of the cases.</p><p>Regarding these two cases the authors discuss the relevance of different injury mechanisms for the differential diagnosis between spontaneous and post traumatic meralgia paresthetica.

This procedure has risk for developing some complications. Lethal outcome sepsis can be seen rarely. In the study, two amniocentesis cases were presented in which both fetus and mother have died due to sepsis and amniocentesis’ complications were reviewed.</p><p><bold>Case-1:</bold> Because 1/200 risk for Down Syndrome was detected on screening tests, amniocentesis procedure applied to the 29-year-old woman, who has 18,4 weeks pregnancy. Two days after, she came back to the hospital due to complaints of pain, nausea, vomiting, high fever. She was hospitalized with the diagnosis of “Chorioamnionitis and intrauterine exitus of fetus”. Her fever was 40°C, blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg, pulse: 96/min, leukocyte:10100, thrombocyte:172000. Blood control values were as follows: leukocyte:1980, thrombocyte:57000. She was transported to the another hospital for the treatment of sepsis. Unfortunately, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy developed at this hospital at the same day. Defibrillation applied two times for cardiac arrest.

She hospitalized by the diagnosis of “septic shock and multiple organ failure”. Fetus was taken out from uterus and the cavum was controlled by curettage. Mechanic ventilation support was began two days after because of respiratory insufficiency. In the following days, her theraphy was continued in intensive care unit. After 27 days from amniocentesis, cardiac arrest developed.

Statistical analysis were performed by using chi squared and One way-Anova tests.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Total 1317 cases had appealed to the emergency service and 20,6 % (n:271) of them were pediatric cases. Of the cases, 62.0 % (n:168) were male and the mean age was 10.51 ± 5.71. Most frequently seen age group and month were 15–18 and August respectively. Type of forensic events were motor vehicle crash (55.4 %) (47.2 % intra-vehicle and 8.2 % extra-vehicle), falls (15.9 %), stab injuries (11.4 %), intoxication (4.4 %), beating/blunt trauma (4.1 %), the others (8.1 %). Forensic incidents were reported to occur mostly during daytime (12:00–18:00). Arrival time to hospital was 74.68 ± 92.54 min. (between 10–555 min.) in average and staying time in emergency service was 1–4 hours (42.8 %). There wasn’t statistically meaningful difference between age groups and arrival time to hospital, and staying time in emergency service (respectively p = 0.149, p = 0.958). Head-neck (44.7 %), lower extremity (78.7 %), trunk (80.5) injuries were most frequently seen regions in traffic accidents whereas upper extremity injuries were most frequently seen in stab injuries (33.7 %). Head-neck region injuries were significantly high in 15–18 age group (p = 0.039). There wasn’t meaningful relationship between lower extremity (p = 0.116), upper extremity (p = 0.901), trunk (p = 0.337) injuries and age groups. Last diagnosis were soft tissue injury (52.8 %), epidermal-dermal incision (26.6 %), bone fracture (19.2 %), tendon incision (6.3 %), hemo- pneumothorax or intracranial hemorrhage (3.3 %). All of the cases, 16.2 % have been sent from another health center to the our service. Discharging rate from the emergency service was 65.7 % and hospitalization rate was 28.8 %. The remainder cases were sent to the other hospitals or died in the emergency service.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pediatric age group injuries mostly occurred as intra-vehicle traffic accident (47.2 %).

As a particularity, the murder is usually committed in the victim’s house.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In this paper the authors present a case of matricide committed by a mentally ill young man, alongside the review of relevant literature.</p><p>Following a contradictory discussion, X.Y., boy, 17 years old, killed his mother and grandmother by multiple stabbing and strangulation by hand. During the police investigation X.Y. underwent a medico-legal psychiatric examination which revealed many particular aspects of the case.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> X.Y. showed behavioral disturbances since he was 4 years old. Later he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10 and DSM IV-TR diagnostic criteria. The evolution of the disease was chronic with numerous admissions to the psychiatric hospital.

In some cases there are certain early warning signs, such as a recent disorganization of behavior or a significant degradation of a preexisting psychotic illness. According to the police investigation, X.Y. committed many previous assaults against the members of his family. He committed the double murder on the background of the loss of self control and impaired judgment, which played a major role in the outcome of events.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to the results of the medico-legal examination, we assume that this tragedy could have been predicted. An adequate family conduct and climate added to additional therapies might have prevented X.Y. criminal outburst.

They may result from criminal, accidental discharge or suicidal attempt. Firearm is fast becoming a major killing apparatus. The invention of firearm has come as a curse to this world; it has become the most dreaded killing tool used by human being to kill themselves. The frequency of firearm related deaths appear to be higher in nations where firearms are more readily available, either legally or illegally.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> A study was conducted on the firearm injured cases collected from medico legal files of the Medico legal Department, Ministry of Justice and comparing the incidence of its fatalities in different Upper Egypt Governorates and analyzing data from one of them according to different items.</p><p><bold>Material &amp; methods:</bold> Firearm injuries cases were selected from archive files of cases examined by Medico legal Departments, Ministry of Justice in Assiut and different Egyptian Governorates in Upper Egypt (Sohage, Qena and Aswan). The cases were analyzed for evaluation of seasonal variation and distribution among cities. The cases collected from medico legal files of the Medico legal Department, Ministry of Justice in Assiut Governorate were analyzed for age and sex of the victims, site and direction of injuries.

The goal is to provide the court information concerning the injuries resulting from the offense, the plausibility between the described trauma mechanism and the findings, as well as the consequences that arouse or are expected to arise from the offense. Of all the issues to be considered and discussed in the forensic expert’s report, one of the most complex may often be the compatibility between the victim’s description of trauma and the injuries observed during the medical examination, namely the differential diagnosis with self-inflicted injuries (generally with simulation purposes).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cases from the North Branch of the INMLCF were selected (n = 13), where the injuries presented were considered by the forensic medical doctor as self-inflicted or (highly) suggestive of such, between 2009 and 2011.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The cases studied represent 0.07 % of the total of alleged assaults in the same time period (n = 18586). In such cases, often the consistency between the victim’s information and the injuries observed lacks, not only because the trauma mechanism may not be the one described, but also because the injuries’ specific characteristics can lead to the hypothesis of self-infliction, commonly using some sort of a sharp object. The characteristics associated with self-inflicted injuries are well known in literature and include the following: lesions located in an accessible anatomical region, shallow lesions in the non-dominant side of the body, parallel lesions, among others. Also in common is a background of mental disorder or some perspective of gain (e.g. in one of the cases the victim had been robbed and some injuries were added to increase the visual impact).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Even though the diagnosis may be virtually immediate and intuitive on first looking at the victim, such perception is hardly of any use in a legal context, where a reasoned opinion is demanded. A structured argument has to be made and thus previous medical records and photographs of the lesions are of paramount importance to document and ground the observation before a Judge.

The development of cardiac vascular system diseases without any symptoms was accepted to accelerate in relation with the external factors like effort, stress by all scientific environments. In this point of view, in a person exposed to unwanted external factors, clinical statements resulted dramatically bounded with coronary artery disease without any symptoms, might be seen. This situation brings the necessity of ambidextrous evaluations for both victim and defendant. To establish the casualty relation between the traumatic influence and clinical statement is the most important stage. The time period of establishing the casualty relation between the traumatic influence and clinical statement, the character of trauma and clinical statement, symptoms determined by supportive diagnosis, whether the person before the case has coronary artery disease or other cardiac problems or not were evaluated all together and medical opinions were held as well.</p><p>Between 2006–2010, in 5 years time period, the cases which 2nd Forensic Medicine Specialization Board asked to submit their opinion about the people exposed to a traumatic deed and then after showed cardiac pathological symptoms analyzed retrospectively in this study.

Our case developed winged scapula caused by nerve injury during a fight, injured by cutlery from the left side of the neck and left back side of the chest wall and the case will be evaluated by becuase it is rarely encountered in forensic medicine.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> 38 years old male, taken to emergency service of the hospital after he was stab wounded during a fight; under the left scapula on 6th intercostal space, thorax preponderant cut, under the left earlap cuts caused skin-underskin muscle hematomas and cuts in mandible and slight cuts on right hand was described. Left pneumothorax observed in graphies, tube thoracostomy placed and the patient discharged from the hospital after lung expansion. One month later after the incident, the patient suffered from shoulder pain and diagnosed by scapula lata in the hospital. In his examination in our Board, 3 cm under the left earlap, under left scapula nearly on 6th intercostal space, on the left earlobe, on the left mandible, on the second finger proximal of right hand scars observed. Permanent neurologic deficit not detected in the neurologic examination.</p><p>Orthopedics examination revealed scapula lata on the left scapula, left shoulder abduction 80–85 degrees restricted, during abduction of left shoulder the inner and external rotations were limited. The most important symptom of the physical examination observed when the patient trying to push the wall with his two hands the scapula coming up at his back. Our Board diagnosed it as winged scapula and its casually connected with stab wound.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> “The life-threatening condition" was reported due to pneumothorax in juridicial report. “Winged scapula” constitutes the sequela of stab wound, established by us after the examination. In juridical reports, collateral damages and sequelas as a result of the crime, should also be evaluated beside the main damages. Furthermore, the juridical reports should be prepared after physical examination by experts rather than preparing reports by taking only dossier into consideration.</p><p><bold>PP-064</bold></p><p><bold>Dental damage in Penal Law.

Quality standards are assessed through regular internal audits to the forensic reports. This system allows monitoring reports’ quality, identifying weaknesses and strengths, to support NILMFC strategies in this area. The aim of this study is to analyse the relevance of reports’ audits regarding alleged sexual offenses (SO).</p><p><bold>Material and methods:</bold> An audit form was created for quality control of reports regarding sexual physical evaluation. It includes 9 items: (1) turnaround time (gap between the dates of exam and conclusion of the report) and data encompassed by the report: (2) history of case (3) documentation data; (4) personal and familial antecedents; (5) complaints; (6) physical examination; (7) ancillary exams; (8) discussion; (9) conclusions. Each of these items is classified according to the following score of points (pts): -1, 1, 2 and 3. These values were added and led to a final score which classifies the quality level of the forensic report (QL) as: very good - grade 3 (24 to 27 pts); relevant - grade 2 (18 to 23 pts); adequate - grade 1 (10 to 17 pts); inadequate - grade −1 (−9 to 9 pts). In the present study, 376 audit forms related to SO, performed between 2009 and 2011 at the 9 north departments of the NILMFC, were analyzed – 63.6 % of the reports (n = 591). Peer review of each report was performed by a four forensic experts’ team.</p><p><bold>Main results:</bold> The final scores achieved in the audits of forensic reports of alleged sexual offenses, allow an analysis in order to assess their progressive uniformity, harmonization and approaching to NILMFS standards. We can compare the evolution in this field, along 2009, 2010 and 2011, among the different forensic offices in the north of Portugal.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We believe this model of auditing reports of SO physical evaluation is a powerful tool, not only to improve the quality of medico-legal reports but also to promote the harmonization of this activity, leading to a best support to the court decisions. It may serve as a model for other Clinical Forensic Medicine Services, particularly those with residency training programs. Audit form criteria development could be a possible mean to improve Quality standards.</p><p><bold>PP-066</bold></p><p><bold>Characteristics of Geriatric Forensic Cases who Applied to the Emergency Service</bold></p><p><underline>Tanzer Korkmaz</underline><sup>1</sup>, Nurettin Kahramansoy<sup>2</sup>, Zerrin Erkol<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, Emergency Medicine Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, General Surgery Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Medicine Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the demographical properties and events’ characteristics of the geriatric forensic cases who applied to the emergency service.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> Data of 65-year-old or older forensic cases who applied to the Emergency Department of Abant Izzet Baysal University Research and Application Center between 01.01.2008-31.12.2009 were evaluated retrospectively from their medical documents and forensic reports.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of total 986 adult forensic cases, 75 (7.6 %) were geriatric. Among them 42.7 % were female, 57.3 % were male. The ages were between 65–94. Average age was 72.4 ± 6.4 whereas 75 ± 7.4 in females and 70.2 ± 4.4 in males. Incidents were most frequently occurred in June and in the summer. Type of the forensic events were motor vehicle crash in 40.0 % (33.3 % intra-vehicle and 6.7 % extra-vehicle), falls in 32.0 %, others in 18.0 % (stab injuries in 5 cases, intoxication in 4 cases, pounding in 3 cases, burns in 3 cases whereas firearm injuries, occupational accident, kicking by an animal in 1 case each other. The case was brought to the hospital in 79.6 ± 92.8 min. (between 10–360 min.) in average and by ambulance (77.3 %). The most often staying time in the emergency service was 4 hours (53.3 %). Events mostly occurred between 12:00–18:00 o’clock, however most often discharging time is between 18:00–24:00. There wasn’t meaningful difference between the type of the event and staying time in the emergency service for along four hours or more (p = 0.285). The cases of motor vehicle crash were arrived to the hospital (43.3 ± 40.3 min.) earlier than the cases taking place in the group of others (132.9 ± 143.9 min.) (p = 0.024). Head-neck (56.7 %) (p = 0.094), lower extremity ((20.7 %), trunk ((46.7 %)(p = 0.005) were most frequently seen injured regions in motor vehicle crash, but there wasn’t meaningful relationship between them and type of the event. Upper extremity injuries were most frequently seen (55.6 %) in the cases taking place in the group of others (p = 0.0001). The majority of the injuries were soft tissue injuries (40.0 %), bone fractures (30.7 %). Soft tissue injuries were more seen in motor vehicle crash than the other type of incidents (p = 0.0001). Orthopedic consultation was required for 48.0 % of the cases and 14.7 % of them hospitalized in the Orthopedic Department. The discharge rate from the emergency service was 46.7 %.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Precautions to prevent the geriatric people from traumas especially from traffic and home accidents, giving information about using drugs and intoxications may be useful for reducing risks of such events to occur.</p><p><bold>PP-067</bold></p><p><bold>Non-fatal occupational accidents in the Lisbon Area: victims and circumstances</bold></p><p><underline>Jorge Costa Santos</underline>, Ana Cabrita</p><p>National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal, South Branch, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon, Portugal, Cencifor, Centre of Forensic Sciences, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Occupational accidents have an enormous impact on the national economy and health of the workers. In Portugal, more than 240,000 employees are injured or killed in workplace accidents each year, with more than 7,000,000 days off, according to the official statistics. The Law nº 98/2009 defines occupational accident as a sudden and unexpected event suffered by an individual at the workplace or during working hours, performing work related tasks and/or during work related transportation. The aim of this study is to characterize a population of victims of occupational accidents occurred in the Lisbon jurisdiction in the first semester of 2010.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The data was collected from 484 medico-legal files of the South Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, where, under the Portuguese law, the vast majority of the survival victims of this kind of accidents are examined by specialists in Legal Medicine. The data include either medico-legal examination reports, all the information related to accident circumstances and subsequent medical intervention (treatment and rehabilitation). The information was reviewed for general socio-demographic characteristics as well as accident temporary and permanent consequences to the victims.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> About 59 % of those were males and more than a half of the total was between 21 and 50 years old. The majority of the injured people were related to employees in the tertiary sector of activities (61 %) who had been victims of accidental falls (35 %). The main injuries were related to fractures and sprains of the limbs (65 %). The time average of treatment was 301 days (from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 1621 days, with a SD = 216). Among those who had suffered a permanent damage, the vast majority of this (89 %) was related to the locomotion apparatus. Impairment of the victims to their work was differentially evaluated by insurance experts and the official ones (average: 4.41 vs 7.37).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As expected, the majority of the injured people were related to the tertiary sector of activities, however most of these accidents were related to failure to comply with the safety rules in work which are fixed by law. These findings claim for a better regulatory framework of the work conditions with a stricter monitoring by legal authorities and more severe penalties for the employers. Otherwise, official medico-legal evaluation of damage shows to be more fare for victims’ compensation than the evaluation done for insurance companies.</p><p><bold>PP-068</bold></p><p><bold>Elder abuse.

The cases reported to the clinical forensic services, which are physically evaluated, represent only a few of the real number, but their analysis can bring us important knowledge about this problem.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Since there are few studies in Portugal concerning this issue, the general aim of the present study is to contribute to a better characterization of elder abuse in this country. This will allow an early detection and diagnosis of this kind of abuse, namely by the health care professionals, as well as a better orientation for the implementation of prevention strategies</p><p><bold>Material and methods:</bold> This study included alleged victims of intra-familial abuse, more than 64 years old, observed at the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine in 2010 (n = 272).

The alleged offenders were mostly males (78.3 %) with an average of 53.7 years. In 21 % of the cases the abuse was recurrent and in 10.3 % occurred for more than 35 years. Most of the reported cases were related with physical abuse (93.4 %) and consisted in kicking, slapping, punching and pushing (68 %). The limbs (23.9 %) and the head/face/neck (23.2 %) were the main locations of aggression. Only half attended the health services (57 %) and there was need to suture the skin in 8.8 %. In 30.2 % of the cases there were no injuries; in the other cases, mostly were mild injuries and only in one case a bone fracture was diagnosed. The elapsed time since the last abuse and the forensic evaluation was superior to 8 days in 12.9 % of the cases.</p><p><bold>Discussion and conclusions:</bold> Even without any serious physical injuries, this kind of violence can represent a relevant physical and mental health problem with socio-familial and financial consequences, which must be considered in future studies.</p><p><bold>PP-069</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Some Cephalometric Parameters in 4- to 11-Year-Old Boys of Kurmanj Ethnic Origin (North Khorasan, Iran)</bold></p><p><underline>Mahdi Esmaeilzadeh</underline>, Zahra Ganj Bakhsh</p><p>Department of Basic Science, University of Bojnourd</p><p>Statement of problem: Anthropometry is applied in medical profession such as forensic medicine, maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, bioengineering and non-medical branches such as like respiratory equipment and eye-glasses industries.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> The aim of this study was to determine cephalo-facial anthropometric ratios and assessment of cephalo-facial development in 4- to 11-year-old boys of Iranian Kurmanj population.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> This cross sectional analytical study was conducted randomly on 564 boys from North Khorasan (Shirvan), with normal face patterns. Cephalo-facial ratios were estimated and compared. The regression line and the growth coefficient was determined for each Parameter. Finally, the mean values of these parameters were determined. Data were analyzed by SPSS software. Pared t-test were used for statistic analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Anthropometric results obtained from 4 to 11-year-old Kurmanj boys residing in the city of Shirvan show that there is a special discipline in growth of different parts of face and skull. We reached formulas that may have a wide range of applications such as prediction of facial situation of an individual before or after his/her present situation. Such predictions can be helpful in forensic medicine, for instance in finding the lost kids.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We have proposed a craniofacial development model that takes into account both psychophysical evidences on how humans perceive age progression in faces and anthropometric evidences on facial growth Based on our findings and by using artificial intelligence technology, computer programs can be designed to reconstruct facial forms of the individuals from a specific ethnicity at different ages.</p><p><bold>PP-070</bold></p><p><bold>Pseudoaneurysm and A-V Fistula Case Associated with Firearm Injury</bold></p><p>Ayşe Gül Bilen<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Necmi Çekin</underline><sup>2</sup>, Ali Eren<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Science, Adana Group Administration, Adana, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Science Department, Adana, Turkey</p><p>Complications related to peripheral blood vessels are seen frequently in firearm injuries of extremities.

We prospectively followed patients admitted to ICU between January 1th, 2012 and March 31th, 2012, collecting age, sex, admission typology, comorbidities (Charlson Index), severity on admission (APACHE II score), sepsis severity, ICU length of stay (LOS), ICU mortality. In order to identify the independent predictors of ICU LOS a stepwise analysis was performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 57 patients evaluated, 26 (45.6 %) patients were already infected on ICU admission, 8 by a community-acquired infection (6 severe pneumonia, 2 urinary-tract infections) and 18 by a total of 24 hospital-acquired infections (9 pneumonia, 1 bacterial meningitis, 5 abdominal, 3 skin-soft tissue, 2 urinary tract, 1 catheter-related bloodstream, and 3 primary bloodstream infections). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with nosocomial infections on admission were: median age 71.5 (IQR 62–81) years, Charlson Index 3.8 ± 3, APACHE II 22 (IQR 18–28), major surgery 9 patients (50 %), steroid therapy 3 patients (16.6 %), septic shock 13 patients (72.2), pre-ICU admission hospital stay 13.5 days (5–25), ICU LOS 19 days (5–31), ICU mortality 9 patients (50 %). In 10 patients ICU LOS was shorter than 3 days, and therefore, a total of 47 patients were evaluated during ICU stay. Twenty (42.5 %) patients acquired a total of 26 NIs, with an incidence rate of 34.9/1000 patient-days, distributed as follows: 10 ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), 6 urinary-tract infections (UTIs), 6 catheter-related (CR) bloodstream infections (BSI), 4 primary BSI. Incidence rates of VAP, CRBSI and UTIs were 15/1000 ventilator-days, 4.4/1000 intra-vascular lines-days, and 8.06/1000 urinary catheter-days, respectively. The onset time of NIs was of 16 ± 8 days from ICU admission. Clinical characteristics and outcome of NI and control groups are reported in the table. In the stepwise analysis, ICU-acquired NI was the only independent predictor of ICU LOS (p = 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> When patients develop NIs there are important implications in terms of quality of care, mortality and increase of length of stay and costs.</p><p>Strategically, implementing quality assurance and quality control measures to the health care sectors and evidence-based management are effective techniques of controlling NIs, and it seems the most feasible approach.</p><p><bold>PP-072</bold></p><p><bold>Relationship between Chronobiology and Delinquent Behaviors in Euthymic Bipolar Disorders</bold></p><p><underline>Murat Emül</underline><sup>1</sup>, Husrev Demirel<sup>2</sup>, Tevfik Kalelioglu<sup>3</sup>, Abdullah Akpınar<sup>3</sup>, Akif Taspinar<sup>3</sup>, Ismail Ozver<sup>3</sup>, Sedat Demirbuga<sup>2</sup>, Suheyla Aliustaoglu<sup>2</sup>, Eyup Kandemir<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Psychiatry, Medical School of Cerrahpasa, İstanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Forensic Medicine, Forensic Institute, Ministery of Justice, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Bakırkoy Mental Health, Research and Education Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Aims:</bold> Dysfunction of circadian rhythms is thought to have roles in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Besides, the types of circadian types are thought to relate with aggressive and delinquent behaviors. Thus, we aimed to compare the chronobiologic aspects in euthymic bipolar patients with or without delinquent behaviors.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty six euthymic bipolar patients with delinquent behaviors and 71 bipolar patients without delinquent behaviors were included in the study after giving consent. They were asked to full fill Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire of Horne and Östberg which assesses the chronotype and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of delinquent bipolar patients was 36.04 ± 9.43 and 36.92 ± 11.12 in non-delinquent group (p = 0.721). The mean duration of illness was 10.38 ± 8.35 years in delinquent group and 12.60 ± 7.82 years (p = 0.224). There were 6 eveningness type, 13 neither type, and 7 morningness type patients in delinquent group while these numbers were 9, 43 and 19 in non-delinquent group, respectively. There were no significant differences according to the types of chronobiology among groups (X2 = 1.69 and p = 0.428). Mean impulsivity scores were 59.38 ± 11.33 in delinquent group and 55.97 ± 13.84 points in non-delinquent group. There was no significance between groups among impulsivity scores (p = 0.265).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Previous studies regarding the personality of chronotype suggest that morningness-types have a healthier lifestyle, have a stronger internal locus of control, are more conscientious, and show higher self-esteem than eveningness types. In a recent study, impulsivity was significantly higher in eveningness type than other chronotypes in depressive patients. Also, being male and eveningness type was significantly correlated with higher impulsivity scores in a study of healthy university students. However, contrast to our hypothesis, we could not find any significant differences according to chronotypes or impulsivity between euthymic bipolar affective patients with delinquent or without delinquent behaviors.</p><p><bold>PP-073</bold></p><p><bold>Two cases of dural sinus thrombosis and review of the literature</bold></p><p><underline>Sema Demirçin</underline>, Mehmet Atılgan, Yaşar Mustafa Karagöz</p><p>Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Medicine Department, Antalya, Turkish Republic</p><p>Dural sinus thrombosis (DST) may occur due to infection, surgery, hypercoagulability or compression of the sinuses by tumors.

The most common variation is hypoplasia of one or both posterior communicating arteries and is found in 34 % of the individuals.</p><p>The aim of this study is to discuss the coincidental presence of the arterial variations of the Willis Polygon in the autopsies, and to compare the findings with the literature.</p><p>This case, a 54 year-old male body, was found in the water and the reason of death was drowning based on the autopsy. The variation of Willis Polygon was the aplasia of the right A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery and therefore the absence of the anterior communicating artery. On the other hand, the left A1 segment, which was larger than usual, was branching out of the frontal interhemispheric region and continued its normal path as the A2 segment of the right and the left anterior cerebral arteries.</p><p>The forensic medicine is in close relation with all other scientific fields and can serve as a bridge between the scientific fields that appear to be unrelated to each other. Although the primary purpose of an autopsy is to explain the cause of death and help the law enforcement, it also can uncover some findings that can be helpful for other scientific disciplines.</p><p><bold>PP-075</bold></p><p><bold>Characteristics of the hospitalized forensic cases: A retrospective study</bold></p><p>Arzu Ilçe<sup>1</sup>, Hacer Alpteker<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Zerrin Erkol</underline><sup>2</sup>, Semra Bulut<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu Health School, Department of Surgical Diseases Nursing, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Medicine Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu Health School, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The study was planned for the purpose of investigation of the forensic cases’ characteristics who applied to the emergency service and hospitalized.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Medical documents of the forensic cases who had appealed to the emergency service and hospitalized in Bolu State Hospital and Bolu Gynecology and Child Hospital in Bolu City (Turkey) between 01.01.2007-31.12.2007 were investigated retrospectively.

Of the cases, 62.7 % (n:229) were male and 37,3 % (n:136) were female. The average age was 36,7 ± 18 between 1–88. The analysis of the age groups as follows; 49 cases (13, 4 %) were under 18-year-old, whilst 59 cases (16,2 %) were in 18–24, 80 cases (21,9 %) were in 25–34, 64 cases (17,5 %) were in 35–44, 46 cases (12,6 %) were in 45–54, 29 cases (7,9 %) were in 55–64 and 38 cases (10,4 %) were in 65-year-old or older age group. Most frequently seen event was motor vehicle accidents with 184 (50,4 %) cases and 166 cases (%90,2) of them were occured as intra-vehicle accident and the remain cases (n:18–9,8 %) were occured as extra-vehicle cases. Motor vehicle accidents were followed by intoxications (n:79–21,7 %) (62 cases were suicidal drug intoxications), falls (n:45–12,3 %), stab injuries (n:19–5,2 %), occupational accidents (n:17–4,7 %), firearm injuries (n:10–2,7 %), hitting cases (n:10–2,7 %), burn (n:1, 0,3 %). There was a meaningful relationship between the gender and type of the forensic case and between the age groups and type of the forensic case (p:0,00). Motor vehicle accidents, falls and occupational accidents in males and suicidal intoxications in females were mostly seen type of events. Motor vehicle accidents were mostly happened in under 18-year-old and 25–34 age groups whereas suicidal intoxications were mostly occured in 18–24 age group.

In such conditions older people suffering from early dementia are mostly anticipated to be capable of performing cognitive skills yet they might need to be supported. Because of deteriorated cognitive functions, in severe dementia a guardianship should be initiated for civil-law administration of these individuals. However, evaluating civil and financial capacity in older adults is still controversial, in moderate dementia in particular. Here we aim to discuss the evaluation of civil capacity of moderate dementia cases by presenting a case through its clinical features and treatment approaches.</p><p><bold>Case history:</bold> Civil capacity of an 83 years old female was asked to be evaluated, by a local Civil Court. The case needed to be evaluated only based on medical records as she died two years ago. In 2006, she was admitted to a university hospital complaining of amnesia. She was given medications and continuously followed-up with control examinations. Besides used medications and medical follow-up her clinical conditions deteriorated, thereby she was recommended to live in a nursing home. In February 2008, one of her inheritors got a capacity report, from a local health center, stating that she had full cognitive and decision-making capacity; however, she was on medications and her mini-mental test points (14/30) were dramatically low in that period. Two weeks after obtaining the capacity report, her inheritor (niece) possessed her house by selling agreement. In 2010, after her death, other inheritors (nieces) filed a lawsuit against the one possessed house to cancel the selling agreement.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, the presented case was decided to have diminished civil and financial capacity in the period of selling process because of decreased mini-mental tests’ points, need for increasing dose of medications, antipsychotic medication use because of behavioral disorders indicating further grade of dementia.</p><p>In conditions requiring evaluation of civil capacity in moderate dementia cases, by using only medical records; all medical records, particularly those related the capacity-questioned period, should carefully be examined. In addition to the detailed examination of patients suffering from moderate dementia, carefully recorded clinical findings, appropriate evaluation methods will play an important role in evaluating the civil capacity.</p><p><bold>PP-078</bold></p><p><bold>The Characteristics Of Sexual Abuse Victims Referred For Forensic Psychiatric Examination</bold></p><p>Serap Erdoğan Teycan, <underline>Ali Yıldırım</underline>, Feryal Çelikel, Erdal Özer</p><p>Gaziosmanpaşa University,Tokat Türkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Population data on clinical and demographic characteristics of sexual abuse victims in Turkey is limited. This paper aims to investigate the demographic and abuse characteristics of sexually abused children, adolescents and adults who were referred for psychiatric examination to our psychiatry outpatient clinic from the forensic medicine department. The preliminary results of an ongoing research will be discussed in this presentation.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Fifty-one sexual abuse victims, examined on request by the legal offices between September 2010 and July 2012 at our outpatient psychiatry clinic, were included in the study. The collected data on the features of all cases were analyzed retrospectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-two per cent of all cases were women and 8 % were men. The mean age of the total group was 19.03 ± 6.68. Sixty-five per cent were under the age of 18. Seventy-six per cent were single, 16 % married, 4 % divorced and 4 % widow. Most of the victims were in a low-middle socioeconomical level. The perpetrator’s familiarity information was missing for 3 cases. In 10 % of cases, the perpetrator was a family member, in 6 % a relative, in 41 % a familiar person, either a friend or a neighbor, in 18 % a boy friend and in 20 % a stranger. The mean duration between the psychiatric examination and the sexual assault was 146.45 ± 146.97 months. As much as 35 % experienced fondling and 35 % vaginal penetration, while 18 % experienced physical violence, as well. Of all cases, 20 % were diagnosed as acute stress disorder, 18 % as post-traumatic stress disorder, and 24 % as adjustment disorder.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sexual violence occurs worldwide and affects up to one third of women over a life-time. Although both men and women can be sexually assaulted, women are at greatest risk. Most sexual assaults are committed by someone known to the survivor. Some groups are more vulnerable, including adolescents, survivors of childhood sexual or physical abuse, persons who are disabled, persons with substance abuse problems, sex workers, persons who are poor or homeless, and persons living in prisons and institutions. Sexual assault may result in long-term mental and physical health problems. Psychiatric examination is crucial not only for the healing of the traumatised individual but also for its impact on the legal processes.</p><p><bold>PP-079</bold></p><p><bold>An unusual non-fatal case of impaling injury</bold></p><p><underline>Fabio De Giorgio</underline><sup>1</sup>, Massimo Miscusi<sup>2</sup>, Luca De Martino<sup>2</sup>, Piero Cascone<sup>2</sup>, Vincenzo M.

When they do occur, are typically produced by falls and traffic accidents. Occasionally, individuals fall on an object that they are carrying. More commonly, individuals fall or jump from a structure onto a pointed object such as a fence.</p><p>We present the case of a 35 years-old man. He was stealing into an apartment when the owners came back home. He tried to escape jumping from the second floor. He fell five meters and had a high energy penetrating transorbital head injury by a metal rod fence. Firefighters cut the fence and he was taken to the emergency department with the foreign body still in his head. At him arrival, GCS score was 6. A CT scan revealed a complex fracture of right orbit floor and roof, zygoma and both frontal sinuses, with an injury of both frontal lobes. Surprisingly right ocular globe was intact, being rod fence passed through the orbit just above it. The patient was immediately operated through a bifrontal craniotomy to repair cranial and facial defects. Rust was found intradurally and wound was carefully debrided. A cranialisation of frontal sinuses by a large galeal flap and a meticolous duroplasty was performed. Orbital and zygoma were repaired by mobilization of bone fragments and plated by microscrews.</p><p>In the following weeks, the patient presented a progressive neurological improvement. A postoperative CT scan showed the good reconstruction of cranial and facial defects, with a chronic evolution of frontal lobes injury. Fourty-five days after injury, patient was discharged with a GCS15, with a diplopia due to a paresis of right superior rectus muscle.</p><p>Penetrating intracranial injuries caused by metallic foreign bodies are very rare among the civilian population.

This incidence grows up according to age, affecting 70 % of mans and women who have more than 70 years-old. The lower limb varicose veins are related to human aging and degenerative aspects. Long periods in the orthostatic position with little muscular activity predisposes to venous ingurgitation and vascular dilatation, contributing to the formation of varicosities. Due to the high prevalence, it is common the association between varicose veins and the labor activity. If proved this relationship, the workers would file an occupational lawsuit against the employer. However, some workers are searching for secondary gains.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Male, 41 years-old, gas station attendant. He had an 8-hour work journey, eventually exceeded, and said that after 34 months in this job, he started to feel legs and feet pains, but he did not asked for medical help. In this condition he continued in his profession for 5 months, when he was dismissed. He had no occupational medical follow up. Currently, he claims that the pain persists and remains without medical help until the day of the forensic-medical expertise. In the physical examination was verified a superficial venous plexus of the legs and feet with vessels slightly dilated, easily visible bluish-blackish in color. However, it had not been verified protrusions or dilatations of superficial veins of the lower limbs. It had been noted a tattoo mimetizing varicosities aspects at the medial face of right foot. With the present case, it is intended to warn the existence and similarity of the exogenous skin pigmentation, tattoo, with lower limb varicose veins.

The human hand has an important evolutionary characteristic relative to other primates and animals, which is an opposite finger to the remaining ones - the "thumb". Therefore, any damage to the human hand, compromises one of the primary characteristics of human evolution. For the human it is essential to perform any work, and statistics show that trauma is the leading cause of disability. Hand injuries have unique characteristics that differentiate them from other lesions. The traumas of the hand present no threat to the lives of individuals, but carry a high functional risk with serious socioeconomic consequences for himself, his family and the whole society.</p><p><bold>Objective and methods:</bold> To analyze 64 cases of medical-legal evaluation concerning occupational accidents resulting with damage in the human hand, drawing an epidemiological profile, conducted by Dr. Leandro Duarte de Carvalho between the years 2007 to 2010.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> We analyzed 64 cases of individuals between 17 and 59 years, among whom 86 % were male and 14 % female. Lesions analyzed, 39 % occurred in the right hand (4 also reached portions of the upper limb) and 61 % in the left hand (7 also affected portions of the upper limb). Among those analyzed, 78 % received social security benefits. Traumatic injuries of the hand is a very serious problem for the victim, victim´s family, company and security-social institution, since the injuries of the hand lead to both physical and psychological changes. The lesions studied include finger amputation, crushing, fractures and cuts in the distal portion of the upper limbs. The accident at work remains a serious problem and often results in personal injuries or functional disorders leading to permanent or temporary reduction of working capacity.</p><p><bold>PP-082</bold></p><p><bold>Case-report: chromium poisoning and damage to upper respiratory tract</bold></p><p><underline>Leandro Duarte De Carvalho</underline>, Ana Vitória Ribeiro Pereccine, Isaac Pêgo Santos, João Pedro Rodrigues Pereira, Ricardo Abreu Vilela, Eduardo Machado Rossi Monteiro</p><p>Medical Sciences Faculty of Minas Gerais</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Chromium is a metal used especially in metallurgy, in processes called electrodeposition. Its excess can cause dermatitis, ulcers, kidney and liver. In this case report we present LSB, 40, who worked as painter. He bears nasal septum perforation and chronic vasomotor (ICD-10 T56.2 - Chromium and its compounds) for probable exposure to chemicals and should stay away from professional activities that expose these products (mainly chromium). Chronic rhinitis ulcer may occur through local action of aerosol irritant, producing a chronic inflammatory process characterized clinically by bloody rhinorrhea, burning and pain in the nostrils.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> To report the case of litigation forensic labor of a professional labor victim of chromium poisoning, showing damage to the upper respiratory tract.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> The diagnosis of chronic ulcerated rhinitis is essentially rhinoscopy. Edema, ulceration, crusting and eventually bleeding may also be observed. Ulcers may progress to necrosis and perforation of the nasal septum, situation very well known among workers exposed to chromium. It is relatively difficult to establish criteria for evaluating disability caused by the condition, but it is important to note that the person may develop parosmia (abnormal smell) or anosmia residual, which may cause significant impact on workers, both in their defense mechanisms (odor substances toxic chemicals or dangerous), and on their ability to work, depending on their job. The disordered breathing by nasal stenosis also constitutes an important injury to the patient's life. In exposed workers, excluding other underlying causes, chronic rhinitis must be classified in Group I of Schilling Classification. In other words, diseases where the "work" or "occupation" are necessary causes. Without them, it is unlikely that workers develop the disease, with clinical features described. It is often described in workers exposed to chromium.</p><p><bold>PP-083</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of the Sexual Assault Cases</bold></p><p><underline>Ramazan Karanfil</underline><sup>1</sup>, M.

Objective of this study was to present the cases of four siblings who killed themselves by hanging at the same time and to compare the case with the literature.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Four siblings were found hung by the person who was working for their father in a vineyard house. The house was a duplex apartment surrounded by a wall and wire fence. The balcony and rooms of the house were seen to be untidy with hulls, rubbish and broken pieces of glass everywhere. Four siblings were found hung with the same thick rope just at the entrance of the ground balcony, next to the entrance door, next to the toilet wall separate from the house and in the garden shed. The corpses was belonging to the siblings aged 26, 27, 30 and 31. Two of them were female and the others were male. At the autopsy all the siblings were defined to be dead from mechanical asphyxia due to hanging. Alcohol was found in the blood of three siblings and in the liquid in the pet bottles on the ground. No alcohol was detected in the blood of one sibling. All siblings were found to commit suicide at the same period of time and three of them to take alcohol before the suicide.</p><p>When familial structure and social characteristics of the siblings were examined; it was found that the children had a poor relationship with their father and grown too dependent on their mother. They had difficulty to adaptation to the environment, had few friends and unemployed. It was stated that they had got depressed after the death of their mother, said to the persons in their environment “they could not live without their mother” and had committed suicide.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study, we presented the case of four siblings who committed suicide at the same time which has not been previously reported in the literature.

In this study we aimed to investigate the forensic reports prepared by emergency services in light of the legislations.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> In this study, general forensic examination reports and hospital records of 100 patients admitted to Emergency Department of Ankara Atatürk Training and Research Hospital were examined.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of the patients was 36; 78 of the cases were male and 22 female. On medical evaluation of the patients; a great majority of cases (68 %) had no consultation and most common consultations were demanded from orthopedics and traumatology clinic. On examination of the cases according to the causes of forensic reporting, the most common presentation was found to be due to traffic accidents with 43 cases. On examination of the cases in terms of whether alcohol abuses and injuries were resolved with basic medical interventions, 72 of them had not been analyzed for alcohol use and 27 had examined for alcohol. In 87 of the cases, issue of whether the damage occurred can be resolved with basic medical interventions had not been stated at the report, while injuries could be resolved with basic medical interventions in 8 cases and could not resolved in 5 cases. Out of all reports, 79 were preliminary forensic reports, 9 were final reports and 12 had no statement regarding to be preliminary or final.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Forensic case notifications and forensic reporting are medical tasks as well as legal responsibility of a physician.

Socio-demographic data of cases were investigated. For the analysis of data, descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-square test were used.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 245 patients included in the study, 66 (26.9 %) were male and 179 (73.1 %) were female with a mean age of 28.1 ± 9.9. On analysis of educational status; 49 (20 %) were primary, 93 (26.5 %) high school and 65 (26.5 %) were college graduates. Of the patients, 139 (56.7 %) were single.</p><p>The most frequent cause of the suicide attempt was marital discord (n:72; 29.4 %) followed by the problems with spouse (n:55; 22.4 %) and psychiatric disorders (n:45; 18.4 %). Economical factors among the causes of suicide in males were found to be significantly higher than in females (P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>On interrogation of previous suicidal attempts, 56 (22.8 %) cases stated that they had attempted suicide one or more times. Thirty-eight (15.5 %) of the cases stated that their relatives also had attempted suicide. The most frequently used method of suicide was medical drug intake (n:220; 90.2 %). Percentage of the men who attempt suicide with a sharp and pointed objects was significantly higher than in women (P &lt; 0.001). Fifty-one (20.8 %) of the cases had diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder before the suicide attempt.</p><p>Of the cases, 35 (14.2 %) stated that they was on psicotic medication in the period of suicide. Sixty-six (26.9 %) of the patients were consulted in psychiatry department. However, only 26 of the cases (10.6 %) presented to the psychiatry clinic later.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Being female, young aged, single, existence of previous suicidal attempt, marital discord and psychiatric disorder were found to be suicidal risk factors, in this study. In this context, patients with psychiatric disorders should carefully followed-up since these disorders are among the etiology of suicidal attempts.</p><p><bold>PP-089</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of presidential amnesty cases in Forensic Medicine practice</bold></p><p><underline>Volkan Ünal</underline>, Sadi Çağdır, Yusuf Özer, Fatih Özner, Esra Ünal, Cengiz Haluk İnce</p><p>Adli Tıp Kurumu, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p>According to article 104/2-b of our valid constitution, president of republic has the authority of diminishing or canceling the penalty of convicts due to continual disease, disability or senescence.In reference to the current regulations, convict should attend to Presidency personally. After that, authorized prosecutors offices want health committees of hospitals to examine and report the situation of convict, then this report sent to Council of Forensic Medicine through the prosecutors’ offices to arrange a report.

One is to make known their concerns about their health care experiences because complaints might suggest unsafe systems and providers. The complaints could be used more effectively in health care and be regarded as important evidence when working with quality improvement. To systematically use patient stories as a reflective tool in education and supervision could be one way to improve communication and bring new understanding about the patient’s perspective in health care. Besides, complaints from patients were the most common reason for doctors seeking medicolegal advice. We conclude that patient complaints can be an important force for promoting safety for both medical staff and patient.</p><p><bold>PP-093</bold></p><p><bold>Hand Tendon Injuries</bold></p><p><underline>Yıldıray Zeyfeoğlu</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Sunay Yavuz<sup>1</sup>, Mahmut Aşırdizer<sup>1</sup>, Ertuğrul Tatlısumak<sup>2</sup>, Yeşim Tujyi<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Anatomy, Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Anaesthesiology, Celal Bayar University, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Our hands is the most active organ which we use in daily life.

The foreign bodies penetrate into the skin may be carbon particules, gun powder, soil and asphalt. These tattoos can be appeared by variable reasons as: traffic accidents, falls from height, firearm and fireworks explosions and puncture of pencil or pen. The most common places are face, hands and eyes. Best and effective way of preventing penetrating injuries to transform to a traumatic tattoo is an effective treatment in earlier period. The main objective of this study is to provide a better recognition of traumatic tattoo that result a permanent mark on face.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> 20-year-old woman admitted to an hospital after a motor vehicle accident. Deep laceration from lateral side of the lower right eyelid reaching to the glabella and abrasions on the upper and lower right eyelid were observed in the first examination. After 1,5 year peirod of time, 4 cm long wide stigma was determined on the right lower eyelid starting from inner side of nasal radix to the connection border of lower eyelid to the cheek dermis, 4 cm long greenish irregular stigma below the right eyelid and a greenish stigma on the subciliar right eyelid. All these findings are diagnosed as traumatic tattoos caused by the traffic accident.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the countries’ laws, penalty imposed to an injuring crime is judged according to the degree of the damage which affects an individual’s life. A permanent mark on face gives damage to an individual by affecting his/her psychology and social life. So causing a permanent mark on face should be punished more. Doctors examining the patient for forensic purpose have to know the mechanism involved in wound formation and wound healing. They have to recognize and differantiate different types of wounds such as traumatic tattoos, together with earlier skin lesions occured naturally, traumatically or by a disease.</p><p><bold>PP-097</bold></p><p><bold>Changes Appeared On The Hanwrittings Of Schizophrenic Patients After The Treatment</bold></p><p><underline>Ilhami Kömür</underline><sup>1</sup>, Selçuk Gürler<sup>1</sup>, Nabi Kantarcı<sup>1</sup>, Eyüp Kandemir<sup>1</sup>, Murat Emül<sup>2</sup>, Bülent Üner<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Psychiatry, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>This study has been conducted to see the changes appeared on the handwritings of schizophrenic patients after the treatment they got.</p><p>In the study, 102 handwritngs samples of 29 schizophrenic patients written on A4 papers were analyzed.

In this study it is aimed to research the contribution of cognitive functions to judicial review process in elderly patients admitted to emergency service and have forensic characteristic.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study data were obtained with the reassesment of cases composed forensic report who is included in a theses entitled “the evaluation of mental status change with six-item screening test in elderly patients who applied to the emergency service and the comparison of the relationship between complaints of the applicant and final diagnosis in these patients”.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The cases over 65 years old who applied to the GATA Emergency Department between 2009–2011 years were included in this study. Six-item screening test (Six Item Screener) was used in assesment of cognitive functions. It was observed that the forensic report was composed in 26 of 755 cases (3.4 %) who included in theses study. The defect was detected in cognitive function in 6 of (23.07 %) above mentioned 26 cases in analysis of forensic report composedcases. Similarly, the cognitive function failure was detected in 198 of other cases included in study but without forensic.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The patient’s statement is preferential in information about how the event takes place, presenting symptoms, anamnesis and taking history. But, mental functions deteriorate depending on physiopathological changes caused by aging; and the statements of persons can appear a confounding factor in clarification of forensic events in some cases.

Certain CYP2D6 mutations impair or abolish enzyme activity, resulting in reduced metabolism of risperidone and high plasma risperidone concentration even at low doses. CYP2D6 genotyping has been proposed as a clinical laboratory method for predicting plasma concentration of risperidone and other antipsychotics or antidepressant medication.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> The aim of the study was to determine the CYP2D6*3 and *4 genotyping of psychotic patients and also to determine the risperidon and paliperidon levels in blood.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> Subjects were 17 patients recruited from the psychiatric inpatient units of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University. All patients provided written informed consent. Blood risperidone and paliperidone concentrations were measured by Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry method. CYP2D6*3 and *4 alleles were determined by Real-Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Only one patient was found as poor metabolizer for CYP2D6*4 (*4/*4), three patients were found intermediate metabolizers (*4/wt) and other 13 were found extensive metabolizers (wt/wt). Retention times of risperidon and paliperidon were found 1,841 min and 1,767 min respectively. Calibrations of risperidon and paliperidon were linear within the selected range of 0,5-100 ng/mL in blood (r &gt; 0,999), Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantification were found 0,006 and 0,18 ng/mL respectively for risperidone; 0,019 and 0,063 ng/mL for paliperidone. Recoveries were found from 100,8 % to 105.5 % in different concentrations with minimum six replicates of each point. According to the genotyping and drug monitoring results; RSP/PLP ratios of poor and intermediated metabolizers were higher than extensive metabolizers.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Subjects carrying alleles encoding impaired CYP2D6 enzyme had significantly greater Risperidone concentrations in blood. Results demonstrate that CYP2D6 genotyping can be used to predict blood risperidone concentration despite advanced patients.</p><p><bold>PP-100</bold></p><p><bold>Predicting aggression with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test</bold></p><p><underline>Cemal Onur Noyan</underline>, Seyma Sipahioglu Ortac</p><p>Department of psychiatry service, gumussuyu military hospital, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Theory of Mind(ToM) also referred as mind reading, mentalising or social intelligence is the ability of identifying mental state of others. Deficits in this process can lead to maladjusted social behavior and aggressive or criminal behavior. There have been suggestions that ToM is disrupted among individuals with psychopathy mainly characterized with lack of empathy and inability to identify of feelings and needs of others as well as behavioral elements such as antisocial and criminal behavior. The “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test(RMET)” is one of the most widely used tasks for examining the ToM. The aim of this study is examining the relationship between ToM disabilities, psychopathy and agression.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 40 male subjects with diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder(APD), without any comorbid neurologic conditions, assessed by a semi-structured questionnaire form, SCID-II, Psychopathy Checklist-Revised(PCL-R), Aggression Questionnaire(AQ) and the Turkish version of the RMET. Subjects with APD diagnosis divided into two groups as ‘psychopathic’ and ‘nonpsychopathic’ group by using PCL-R scores. 30 point was used as cut point for psychopathy diagnosis regarding previous studies</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Psychopathic group(n = 15) showed significantly worse performance(p &lt; 0,001) on the RMET than the nonpsychopathic group(n = 25).

Causes of violence are the result of complex interactions between genetic/biological factors and social/environmental factors. Differentiation of violent offences from non-violent offences may help us to understand the aetiologies of violence and to develop strategies to cope with violence. The purpose of this study was to compare violent offenders with non-violent offenders on demographic and criminal variables.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 100 male subjects who admitted to the general out-patients unit of the Department of Psychiatry and forensic patient diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder according to DSM-IV without any comorbid neurologic diseases included the study. All the patients assessed by semi-structured questionnaire including data on onset age of delinquent behavior, age of first conviction, number of prior convictions, and frequency of delinquency in the past. Aggression Questionnaire(AQ) and Psychopathy Checklist-Revised(PCL-R) data were collected. Subjects divided into two group as ‘violent offender group’ and ‘non-violent offender group’according to interview with subjects and data obtained from legal documents and previous records of offences committed by the subjects. Offences including especially murder, rape and assault defined as violent, other offences including robbery, burglary defined as less or non-violent.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Violent offender group(n = 55) significantly differed from non-violent offender group(n = 45) whith lower education level(p = 0,006), unemployment status(p = 0,023), lower residential status(p = 0,038) experiencing criminality at earlier age(p = 0,000), higher number of prior convictions(0,000), history of parental mental health problems(p = 0,035), higher rates and frequencies of previous self injuries behavior(p = 0,000), higher rates of substance abuse(p = 0,009) higher AQ scores(p = 0,003) and PCL-R scores(p = 0,000)</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This results showed us that violent offender group has under the greater risk with lower residential and education level, unemployment status, experiencing criminality, substance and self injuries behavior at earlier age. To establish crime prevention and rehabilitation programs we should use these results as risk factors to be improved and should target rehabilitating specifically the young offenders.</p><p><bold><underline>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-102</bold></p><p><bold>Poverty and domestic violence in the Transkei region of South Africa: Case Reports</bold></p><p><underline>Banwari Lal Meel</underline></p><p>Banwari L.

Vinci, MD</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In 2007, the Statistics Institute of the Italian Government (ISTAT) conducted an investigation of a vast sample of women representative of the female universe, demonstrating that violence, both physical and psychological, perpetrated against the woman is a common phenomenon, even if it tends to be kept dark. Approximately 31.9 % of women suffer at least one episode of physical, sexual or psychological violence during the course of their lives.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Despite the heavy implications of this high figure, the Istat data suggest that only a small percentage (18 %) of the women interviewed seemed to regard the violence they suffered as a true crime. In fact, only a very small number of cases of rape or violence (6.7 %) are reported to the Police and, moreover, physical and sexual violence very rarely come to the attention of the Health Authorities. Women tend to keep quiet about such attacks made on them, and prefer not to mention them to anyone, either the family or the authorities.</p><p>Of all episodes of violence, about 14 % are perpetrated by the partner. Violent attacks of this nature are frequently repetitive (in 67.1 % of the entire sample). In such cases there is a long history of quarrels, violence, separations and subsequent attempts to make peace. The final epilogue is sometimes dramatic, involving very grave violence and even murder.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Often it is jealousy that triggers the attack against the woman; this jealousy is often borderline pathological but almost never due to a delusional disorder. It is likely, therefore, that social and cultural factors contribute to the manifestations of violence within the couple (these commonly occur in large urban conglomerations; they may involve the victim’s work setting and profession; the victim’s level of education).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These factors underline that a change is currently occurring in the traditional male/female relationship, and a growing independance of women. In this sense, some aspects of the Italian phenomenon differ from the situation in the USA (Caetano et al, 2008; Jewkes, 2002). It cannot be excluded, in any case, that old sterotypes may still hold fast in some social milieux in our nation. These may induce the woman to accept a certain degree of violence in order to “keep the family together”; meanwhile the man is being obliged to adopt a new model within the family, quite unlike the previous dominant role, and that he may have great difficulty in accepting.</p><p><bold>PP-106</bold></p><p><bold>Spousal homicide: about a case</bold></p><p><underline>Salim Boumeslout</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mokhtaria Souag<sup>1</sup>, Nawel Ayadi<sup>1</sup>, Abdelmadjid Aboubeker<sup>2</sup>, Ahmed Reda Hakem<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Departement of Legale Medicine, C.H.U.Oran Algeria</p><p><sup>2</sup>Departement of Legal Medicine, E.H.U.Oran Algeira</p><p>In a relationship marked by domestic violence, homicide risk is minor as the victim submits to the aggressor and as the control of power is maintained, that is to say, as the cycle of violence rotates.</p><p>The risk of homicide increases when the victim decides not to obey the partner anymore, to keep distance and to end the relationship.</p><p>Generally speaking, the spousal homicide is often a premeditated murder; it is often the result of a long relationship violence, domination and control.

As this vulnerable population grows, so does the number of violent occurrences against it. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the main characteristics of this violence in Brazil and to alert health professionals about the identifiable physical signs that identify these victims and their abusers.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The Southeast region represents 42 % of the overall population and, along with the South, it accounts for 8.1 % of the total number of people over 65 years old. We analyzed 201 filed complaints between May 2006–2010, 79 % were of female victims. Neglect was the most frequent type of isolated aggression followed by physical assault. The most common cause was the combination of neglect and physical abuse. The frequent aggressor being the son or the daughter. Of the aggressions committed by daughters, the neglect was of 59 % and physical aggression was 39 %. In turn, of the aggressions committed by sons, the neglect was (53 %) and physical violence was (41 %). The perpetrator’s chemical dependency was determined to be an important associated factor. In Brazil between 2006–2010 there were 425 reported deaths resulting from elderly mistreatment, 79 % were male, 45 % white and 78 % were as a result of physical violence. In the same period 2.5 % of those admitted for abuse were elderly. In the medico-legal expertise field it is important to consider the following characteristics that suggest abuse: physical injuries: a) wounds at different stages of healing or bruises (purple, brown-green, yellow and lastly brownish yellow), lesions that denote an instrument, restraint injuries on wrists, ankles and heels, traumatic alopecia, scalp edema, broken teeth, nose and x-ray images showing ancient misaligned fractures and burns; b) injuries indicative of sexual violence are: itching, anal or vaginal bleeding, pain, sexually transmitted diseases, spotting or bleeding in the underwear. Most battered body areas: face, side region of the right arm and back.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The majority of the abuse suffered by the elderly occurs in the form of neglect and physical abuse. Many deaths were not identified as violent by lack of diagnostic elements, especially because of the omission of violence by family members who are usually the aggressors. This is a fundamental reason for the coroner to pay close attention to possible external aggression signs in his victims in order to assist victims and the justice system to accurately determine the cause of death.</p><p><bold>PP-108</bold></p><p><bold>Profile of assault and battery victims aged 70+</bold></p><p><underline>Bertrand Becour</underline>, Zakia Médiouni, Ahmed Hammache, Jean Louis Pourriat</p><p>Assistance publique - hôpitaux de paris</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Every other day, one of the victims examined at the Paris UMJ (medico-judicial emergency unit) is over 70 years old. This study aims to differentiate the various types of violence and determine the epidemiological characteristics of these elderly assault and battery victims.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective study reviewed the medical files of 189 patients, aged 70 years or more, who were examined at the Paris UMJ unit between January 1st and December 31st 2011.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The oldest victim was 95 years old and 66.5 % of the study population were women. Cases were distributed into three categories according to the type of violence: extrafamilial assaults (137), intrafamilial assaults (35) or accidents (17). In 68 % of cases, the victims did not know their attacker. The most frequently injured body parts were the head (44 %) and the upper limbs (39 %). Average TTD (temporary total disability) duration was 9 days. Cases leading to legal proceedings mainly involved robbery with assault and battery: 60 % of extrafamilial assaults involved robbery, mainly bag-snatching. In average, TTD lasted 10 days after extrafamilial aggressions. Intrafamilial violence victims were essentially women (82 %). Taking into account the presence of several perpetrators in certain cases, 67 % of intrafamilial assaults consisted in parent abuse and 38 % in conjugal violence. Intrafamilial violence most often resulted in benign injuries, with an average TTD duration of 5 days. The most serious injuries were found in the “accidental violence” category, where average TTD duration was 16 days and where fractures were present in 19 % of cases. These mainly concerned the upper limbs (63 %), predominantly the shoulder (19 % of all fractures). Average TTD duration increased to 30 days in cases involving a fracture.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although extrafamilial assaults are the most frequently reported type of violence, our hypothesis is that numerous intrafamilial assaults remain unreported. The most severe injuries result from “accidental violence”. In terms of wound severity, this is followed by extrafamilial assaults with intrafamilial violence coming last. Because they are particularly fragile, elderly victims usually suffer quite lengthy post-injury TTD, notably in case of accident. In order to improve our understanding of victimization phenomena and identify which factors influence the risk for 70+ victims of becoming bedridden, we need to explore and analyse the factors connected with physical and psychological vulnerability.</p><p><bold>PP-109</bold></p><p><bold>Knives and Cultures</bold></p><p><underline>Ahmet Nezih Kök</underline><sup>1</sup>, Münevver İrem Kök<sup>2</sup>, Ömer Melih Kök<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Atatürk University Medical Faculty, Erzurum,Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Uludağ University Medical Faculty,Bursa, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Aydin University Law Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Knives are known as one of the oldest human tools. It is estimated that first human used sharp stones as knives. With the invention of metal, as civilization advanced, various types of metals used in making knives (through the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age) emerged. All advances in technology make knives more sharper and more violent. Although, a knife has been accepted as a symbol of bravery through all era, sometimes it is identified with dirty trick.</p><p>The meaning of a knife is different for each culture. For a Japanese, a knife is a tool for commiting hara-kiri. For an American, Rambo-knife is a symbol of heroism.

This folk dance is a mark of courage and manhood.</p><p>In this study we aim to point out the relationship between knives and culture.</p><p>The type of social life doubtlessly determines the values, and these values consequently determine the behaviour of individual. On this basis, violence with knives are commonly seen in Erzurum. In 2011, 7.6 % of the judicial cases applying to Department of Forensic Medicine of Atatürk University Research Hospital to get a judicial report were suffering from stabbing. Our study doesn’t include the cases having stab wounds on head region. 92.3 % of them were male. It is a natural result because of the knife is a symbol of manhood.</p><p><bold>PP-110</bold></p><p><bold>Concurrent Diyadic Death Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Deniz Oguzhan Melez</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bünyamin Baspinar<sup>1</sup>, Abdullah Avsar<sup>1</sup>, Ipek Esen Melez<sup>1</sup>, Fatih Sahin<sup>1</sup>, Taskin Ozdes<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> If one commits suicide after a murder, this incident is defined as “suicide after homicide”.

The multiple deaths are subject to various classifications in many ways. The multiple deaths can be sorted as dyadic death (dual death), triple etc. based on the number of victims. The diadic deaths can be divided into two categories according to the timing of the incidents.</p><p>1.

This circumstance is defined as ‘murder-suicide’, ‘homicide-suicide’, ‘homicide followed by suicide’, ‘murder followed by suicide’ or ‘dyadic death’ in the literature. However, there is no agreement on the definitive terms in literature.</p><p>A through search of the literature reveals that the perpetrators are males aged between 19–86 years (most between 40–59) in most cases. The perpetrators determine the pattern of the incident, which show variations based on the society and the gender. The victims are usually the individuals in close relation to the perpetrator. This type of incident is quite remarkable since it usually occurs with an unusual manner, by an unexpected person and can causes indignation in the society and sometimes an “innocent” third individual’s death. However, the law enforcement does not always pay enough attention to these incidents and the court can refuse the prosecution and the investigation can be closed due to the death of the murderer.</p><p>The aim of this study is to define the terms properly, investigate the incident pattern, possible motivations and the profiles of the involved individuals emphasizing the infrequency of female perpetrators.</p><p><bold>Case report:</bold> The suspected perpetrator was a 33-year-old female, who was sleep-deprived, losing weight and treated for anxiety disorder with introverted personality. She committed suicide after having murdered her 33-year-old husband and 7-year-old daughter with a 9-mm pistol. According to the crime scene report and pictures, they had a fight in the bedroom prior to the incident. The body of the male, who was the actual target, was found in the bedroom. The girl was possibly murdered by accident with her body found curled up between the bed and opposite wall of the entrance of the bedroom having showed an apparent effort to hide.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The perpetrators in multiple death cases are typically a males and the murder incident is followed by a suicide act. In our case, a female perpetrator who was in need of psychiatric treatment murdered her husband and her daughter following a discussion which was interpreted due to the mess in the house and the locations of the bodies.

A diver is breathing gas at increased pressure after descending, which often leads to tissue gas supersaturating. When the ambient pressure decreases quickly following ascent to the surface, excessive formation of gas bubbles, which can enter into circulation, occurred in supersaturated tissues.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We present two cases of diving fatalities due to arterial air embolism and discussed with a review of literature.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Case 1: A 32 year-old male with unknown significant medical history who was a recreational diver. He was found floating prone position on the bottom of sea in a depth of 33 m. He had been carried to the surface in a controlled ascent. There were no signs of life when he arrived the hospital. Despite resuscitation attempts, he did not revive.</p><p>Case 2: This was a 39 year-old male who was experienced dive instructor in a diving school. There was no problem in the initial stage of diving. Following an uneventful duration of dive, he was found unconscious with a floating supine position in a depth of 30 m and there was no sign of life.</p><p>In both cases; post-mortem external examinations showed hemorrhagic foams around the mouth and nostrils. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the extremities detected by palpation of skin. X-ray images, performed before autopsy, supported subcutaneous emphysema and showed extensive gas bubbles in the great vessels. Performed autopsy and diffuse gas bubbles like beads were seen in the coronary arteries and in ventricles, basilar artery and all of the cerebral arteries. No toxic substances were found in the toxicological analysis of the blood and urine.</p><p>The pathologic cause of death was given as gas embolism and drowning for each case.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Air embolus, another form of decompression illness and arterial gas embolization is the second most common cause of death to divers, with squeal dependent on the final destination of the emboli with mortality rate from 7 to 14 %. In scuba diving, these gas bubbles most commonly occur in uncontrolled ascents with decreasing partial ambient pressure which results in gas coming out of supersaturated tissues into the intra-vascular space. Air embolism, associated with decompression sickness or pulmonary barotrauma during diving, can lead to various tissue and vital organ damages and may result in undesirable consequences if it enters cerebral or coronary circulation.</p><p><bold>PP-114</bold></p><p><bold>Inundation in Genoa: cases report of six deaths</bold></p><p><underline>Sara Candosin</underline>, Francesca Fossati, Luca Vallega Bernucci, Federica Portunato, Francesco Ventura</p><p>Department of Legal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Frequent and abundant rains, especially if lasting for several days, can pose significant problems in urban areas and emergency management is often difficult.</p><p>Additional risks arise in cases of careless town planning and maintenance of riverbeds.</p><p><bold>Case report:</bold> Due to abundant rainfalls the city of Genoa was flooded on November 4th, 2011.

The first step in the autopsy room to the diagnosis of drowning is the detailed analysis of postmortem macropathologic changes. The aim of study is to analyze the pathological data in cases of drowning and if there are significant differences between saltwater and freshwater drowning. We studied 140 cases (132 males and 8 females) of drowning (107 saltwater drowning and 33 freshwater drowning) selected from medico-legal autopsies performed in the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Cadiz (southern Spain). The mean age of the subjects was 47.1 years (SD 18.6; range 2–87 years), while the mean post-mortem interval was 27.5 h (SD 19.8; range 3–96 h). We evaluate macropathologic changes with particular attention to the presence of a external foam, a frothy exudate in the airway, the presence of a pleural effusion, water into the stomach &gt;500 ml and lung weight. The presence of these pathological changes were 36.4 %, 46.4 %, 14.3 %, 52.1 %, respectively. Mean of lung right weight was 691.9 g and lung left weight 633.5 g. We found statistical significant differences between saltwater drowning and freshwater drowning in the presence of external foam (41.1 % vs 21.2 %; P = 0.028), pleural effusion (16.8 % vs 6.1 %; P = 0.04), lung right weight (738.5 g vs 537.5 g; P &lt; 0.0001) and lung left weight (669 g vs 516 g; P &lt; 0.0001). Macromorphologic pathologic findings no allow a definite diagnosis of drowning and there are differences in the presence of these signs between saltwater and freshwater drowning.</p><p><bold>PP-116</bold></p><p><bold>Drowing: autopsy and laboratory findings in 197 cases in the Attica region</bold></p><p>Dimitrios Vlachodimitropoulos, <underline>Emmanouil Sakelliadis</underline>, Nikolaos Goutas, Sotirios Athanaselis, Stavroula Papaodima, Chara Spiliopoulou</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, National &amp; Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The purpose of this report is to describe the main autopsy and laboratory findings from a large number of drowning victims in Greece.

In the summer temperatures, and has flooded large areas, favoring evaporation. The tropical rains (six months per year) are more constant, always accompanied by lightning. Human losses by cosmic electricity are rare. REPORT: E.F.S., 38 year-old man was in a landing boat during a storm and protect himself, sought shelter under a tree (Jatobá). Supported the right hand on the trunk and instantly fell an electric shock on the crown, hitting the victim, who died instantly.</p><p><bold>Autopsy:</bold> The body was completely wet and smelled a strong odor of burnt hair. The clothes were partially torn. We find second-degree burns with the presence of hair and hair scorched and brittle, and blistering routes in the path of the passage of electricity through the body. Regions: the right axillary, anterior chest, peri-umbilical, groin, scrotum, and left leg, had burned by blistering and small routes, also present in the gluteal region.</p><p><bold>Signs of choking:</bold> small areas of bleeding and intra-ocular congestion and cyanosis of the face, lips, tongue, oral mucosa and neck regions. At the autopsy itself, we find in the cranial cavity, small areas of parenchymal hemorrhages involving regions of the nervous centers. The lungs were slightly enlarged with various regions of visceral bruising and a small tear in the right upper lobe, through which flowed a small amount of dark liquid blood, the blood had pericardial cavity (hemopericardium), liquid and well-looking dark. The heart had a laceration of about 3.5 cm long, located in the lobby, through which flowed too small amount of blood drained into the pericardial cavity. As part of the heart muscle still showed fasciculations, probably due to the action of electricity in parts of the cardiac walls.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> the atria have thinner walls, especially the auricle, with a maximum of 2 mm thick and therefore more easily break. (information taken from an interview with the cardiologist Nivaldo Cortella). Apud França (2011): "The site survey is essential. Death is due to pulmonary tetanization of respiratory muscles (diaphragm and intercostals) and vasomotor phenomena. The stop breathing before the cardiac arrest".</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> the victim's death was caused by asphyxia, acute respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, atrial wall rupture and hemopericardium with cardiac tamponade, cerebral edema and hemorrhage by the action of natural electricity or cosmic - fulmination.</p><p><bold>PP-118</bold></p><p><bold>Two fatal cases of high-voltage electrocution during theft of copper wires from the same abandoned warehouse</bold></p><p><underline>Alessandro Bonsignore</underline>, Camilla Tettamanti, Anna Smith, Francesco Ventura</p><p>Department of Legal Medicine, University of Genova, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Electrocution while trying to steal copper wire that is carrying a live current is an uncommon cause of death seen in our Department and around the world. Death is related to abnormal electrical rhythms in the heart and brain, and production of internal and external electrical burns. Particularly, high-voltage electrical injuries result in high mortality and morbidity. Theft of copper, mainly from electrical wires, is becoming a more frequent crime as the value of this metal rises and it is easily re-salable. Thieves are generally young and socially disadvantaged.</p><p><bold>Case report:</bold> In the last year our Department of Legal Medicine examined firstly a 22 year-old men found lifeless inside a high-voltage central electric unit of an abandoned warehouse. 8 months later, another guy (19-year-old) of the same ethnic group died in the same place, which was still restricted for the previous case, and circumstances. Scene investigations in both cases showed the bodies close to bits of copper wires, and the presence of cutters and other electrical tools. Forensic autopsies were performed in order to define the cause of death. Gross and internal examinations revealed electrical burns all over the body showing central erythema with charring of skin and loss of tissue.</p><p>Toxicological analysis of urine samples resulted as negative for the first decedent, while the second one was intoxicated with tetrahydrocannabinol. Carboxyhemoglobin analysis revealed a value of 8,2 % and 8,9 % respectively. Evaluation of the circumstances surrounding death made it reasonably clear that in both cases the decedents underwent electrocution while trying to steal copper wires from the electrical substation (15000 V).</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Despite the fact that numerous fatal accidents caused by copper theft are reported by the media, the number of thieves does not appear to be diminishing, and the incidence of electrocution due to the theft of copper wires will likely continue to be a problem as long as copper prices remain high and thieves believe they know how to identify inactive electric substations.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our report clearly shows that theft of copper-related electrical injury is becoming more frequent in the community and should be added as a “new” risk factor for electrocution. According to that, forensic pathologists need to consider these circumstances as possible cause of electrical deaths. To keep copper theft to a minimum and consequently prevent copper-related life-threatening events, metal recyclers should be subject to tighter regulations and monitored more frequently.</p><p><bold>PP-119</bold></p><p><bold>A retrospective descriptive study of electrocution deaths in Northern Tunisia: 2007–2011</bold></p><p><underline>Fatma Gloulou</underline>, Olfa Bekir, Maha Shimi, Mohamed Allouche, Mehdi Ben Khelil, Anis Benzarti, Ahmed Banasr, Mongi Zhioua, Moncef Hamdoun</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Charles Nicolle University Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia</p><p>Electrical injuries are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality all over the world.

All cases were reviewed from a demographic and pathology-of-trauma point of view.</p><p>Victims were most frequently males (131) with a male to female ratio of 6.5:1. Victims were aged 2 to 81 years old with a mean age of 32.37 years. The majority of deaths occurred in the 21–30 year age group (49 cases, 32.45 %), during the summer (54 cases, 35.7 %) and autumn (44 cases, 29 %) with the lowest number of deaths occurring in winter (25 cases, 16.5 %). There was no electrical contact mark present in 18 cases (12 %). One hundred and sixteen cases (76.8 %) were dead on arrival at hospital.</p><p>Electrocution was most frequently accidental, on the workplace (65 cases, 43 %), at home (50 cases, 33 %) and in common public areas (32 cases, 21 %). Two cases were classified suicides and the victims were both men with psychiatric illness who electrocuted themselves in public areas. Only one case was classified homicide in which a 52-year old man was electrocuted by his wife and her lover.</p><p>This study shows a high number of electrocution-related fatality cases in Northern Tunisia as compared with the rest of the world. It also shows a significantly higher rate of electrocution deaths among males, a high proportion of high-voltage-electrocution deaths and a lack of safety on the workplace.</p><p>It also serves to highlight the need for more active workplace and domestic safety campaigns.</p><p><bold>PP-120</bold></p><p><bold>Medicolegal Approach to Electric Cataract: A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Ertuğrul Gök</underline><sup>1</sup>, Recep Fedakar<sup>1</sup>, Naile Esra Saka<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, Uludağ University, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Bursa Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Electrical current injuries are still in effect today. Besides high paced industrialization, carelessness is also a cause of these incidents. In fact, cataract caused by electricity injuries are quite rare.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Following the examination of the individual who was sent to our branch management for forensic examination report, by DA’s office, we have reviewed the medical and forensics investigation document of the case and literature about this incident.

The dentate gyrus is a part of the hippocampal formation. It is thought to contribute to the formation of new memories as well as possessing other functional roles. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of electrical injury in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer.</p><p>Fifteen Wistar rats were diveded into three groups: 1st Group, control group; 2nd Group, the points of electrical contact were on the dorsal skin in this group; 3rd Group, the points of electrical contact were on the temporal region in this group. The current was the usual city current (110 V, 50 Hz, 100A AC). On the 3rd day, rats were decapitated; brains were removed, sectioned and stained with H&amp;E. The total granule neuron number in the granule cell layer of the rat dentate gyrus was estimated using by optical fractionator method, an unbiased stereological method.</p><p>The total neuron number (mean ± SEM) of the dentate gyrus was 248155 ± 3940, 196094 ± 6526 and 173752 ± 5219 in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd groups, respectively. The total neuron number was significantly decreased in the 2nd and 3rd groups compared to 1th group (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the 2nd and 3rd groups (p &gt; 0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, electrocution leads to granule neuron loss in the dentate gyrus in rats.

The man was found sitting on a stool on the shore of the lake, presenting symptoms of cardiac arrest. Medical Air Rescue arrived at the place and started CPR procedures but without success and the patient was pronounced dead. Near the body a fishing rod was found. The prosecutor ordered the autopsy examination of the cadaver.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The autopsy with toxicological and microscopic examinations were performed. The external inspection of the body revealed the presence of electrical burns on the palmar surface of the right hand, right thumb, forefinger and middle finger and the same type of lesions on the left toe and on the posterior surface of the right thigh. The internal examination showed enlargement of the heart and coronary atherosclerosis. The toxicological examination revealed the presence of ethyl alcohol in the blood (1,2 ‰) and in the urine (1,6 ‰). In the microscopic examination of the electrical burns the epidermis showed a ‘Swiss cheese appearance’. The autopsy findings proved that the cause of death of the 56-year-old male was electrocution.</p><p>During the inspection of the place of death the Police noticed that above the stool of the angler was a high-voltage line (15000 V). The height from the ground to the high-voltage line reached 8,5 meters. The length of the fishing rod lying near the body was 8 meters and the rod was made of carbon fibre. Carbon fibre is a very good conductor of electric current. The stool which the angler was sitting on was made of metal.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> The Police investigation and the autopsy results explained the manner and mechanism of death of the angler. During angling the man was holding the fishing rod in the right hand and he was sitting on the stool. Accidentally he must have touched the high-voltage line above him by the end of the long fishing rod. That caused the electrocution and location of the electrical burns on the body fits the sitting position of the angler in the moment of electrical injury. The point of entry of current was in the right palm and fingers and the point of exit was situated on the posterior surface of the right thigh and on the left toe. The victim didn’t preserve appropriate caution during angling and didn’t notice the high-voltage line above him.</p><p><bold>PP-123</bold></p><p><bold>Lightning associated deaths: a case report</bold></p><p><underline>Mustafa Balkay</underline><sup>1</sup>, Safa Celik<sup>1</sup>, Cem Uysal<sup>2</sup>, Taşkın Özdeş<sup>3</sup>, Ibrahim Üzün<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Dicle Universty, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Diyarbakır, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal Universty, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Bolu, Turkey</p><p>Lightning shock (LS) related deaths shows the regional and seasonal changes. Lightning shock related injuries are parallel with the number of the lightning and frequently seen in June, July, August and September. The victims are people who often exist or work outdoors such as farmers, campers, hikers, construction workers, golfers and hunters. Inside the home the victims are especially telephone or other household appliances users. Lightning shock related deaths usually exist with a high-voltage current. Death occurs as a result of cardiac and respiratory arrest or electrothermal injuries. In this poster presentation, a lightning shock death case is discussed and evaluated with literature.</p><p>In our case, while 3 shepherd grazing their sheeps, the lightning fell on two of them.

The typical lightning shock related skin lesions, edema and hyperemia of internal organs and fumigated areas on the hair were detected at autopsy. The criminal investigation file and autopsy report were sent to the Council of Forensic Medicine First Specialization Board and asked the cause of death by the prosecutor's office. After evaluation of death scene investigation report and autopsy findings Council of Forensic Medicine First Specialization Board was decided that the cause of was originated from lightning shock.</p><p>Lightning shock related deaths generally occur at the open field. This type of deaths are rarely seen. For this reason death scene investigation and performing autopsy should be done.

In this study, it was aimed to determine that whether age discrimination exists for hospitalized patients.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> Our study was conducted on 298 hospitalized patients. The questionnaire consists of 8 questions trying to determine patients’ socio-demographic attributes and 22 items prepared by the authors for the purpose of determining age discrimination through the physical properties of the hospital and the behaviors of the staff. While frequency and mean ± standard deviation were used in summarizing the data, chi-square and t-test were utilized for comparing the groups.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> It was determined that 54.9 % of the patients included in the study were male, 72.8 % of them were married, 79.5 % were subject to the social security institution and 16.8 % had green card security. The average of age of the patients was 53.1 ± 17.4. It was determined that, as the ages of the patients get older they have more difficulty in finding the rooms for examination and staying at the hospital, the operation the patients will undergo are most of the time explained to their relatives, that older patients are given priority during examination in comparison with younger patients, that health personnel tend to shout more to older patients and spend less time with them in comparison with younger patients, and that they show signs of exasperation when dealing with older patients (p &lt; 0.05). As the patients’ ages get older they showed less consent in giving their beds to younger patients (p &lt; 0.001). Health personnel tend to address female patients (58.6 %), patients with primary school or lower education (53.3 %) and patients with green card (66.0 %) as aunt or uncle (p &lt; 0.05). It was also determined that 53.7 % of the patients prefer to be addressed with their names.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It was determined in our study that, older patients are negatively affected from the physical characteristics of the hospital and are uncomfortable with some negative attitudes of the health staff. In order to ensure that the patients benefit from health services equally the determined negativities have to be rectified and positive aspects have to be strengthened. Raising the patients’ awareness on their rights and increasing the sensitivity of health personnel will negate the existing discriminations based on age.</p><p><bold>PP-128</bold></p><p><bold>Post Partum Abortion as an extreme expression of the Bioethical views that are dangerous to human life</bold></p><p>Polichronis Voultsos<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>1</sup>, Alexandra Enache<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Lab of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Greece</p><p><sup>2</sup>University of Medicine and Pharmacy Victor Babeş Timisoara, Romania</p><p>A significant deviation from the principles of ontological personalism and self-determination has been noted in the trends of modern bioethics, which entail a risk to human life. To this end it is considered that there is no “person” when certain brain functions are missing (self-realisation, communication, emotion, minimum moral conscience, etc) or where there is no conscious interest in life, a vital prospect and the assessment by its agency. The threat to human life becomes even more apparent in the marginal phases of the end (cortical death, patients in PVS, dementia etc) and its commencement: minimal protection for the in vitro embryo, wide acceptance of premature (passive) euthanasia, the extension of eugenic abortion until the end of the pregnancy, abortion permitted during childbirth and during the neonatal period (post partum), i.e. permissible infanticide! It is a fact that during the modern age of the technical sciences in medical biology, the neural sciences and genomics, the fundamental bioethical concepts are redefined in terms of their content and hierarchical position through a multilevel cultural interaction. Some concepts need to have an absolute force despite the pluralistic nature of bioethics in order to avoid absolute and dangerous relativism and legal positivism. This is the concept of the “person”, where the meaning and limits cannot be defined by anthropological or socio-cultural criteria. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the view in favour of the admissibility of infanticide is an extreme form of the dangerous approach to the bioethics of the person and to investigate whether the deviation from ontological personalism to less severe forms of personalism is in line with the excellent protection of human life.</p><p><bold>PP-129</bold></p><p><bold>Organ donation for transplantation: a survey among medical students</bold></p><p><underline>Harald Jung</underline>, Imre Egyed Zsigmond, Klara Brînzaniuc</p><p>Univer Med &amp; Pharm Tg-Mures</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> organ transplantation is a synonym with modernism in nowadays medicine. Tissue donation has become recently a preoccupation of forensic pathologists as well. Organ and tissue shortage is a consequence of donation refusal by the family members in some cases. Investigation of medical students’ opinions may provide evidence for educational strategies to be used in the medical universities in order to improve people’s perception of the donation act.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> we performed a cross-sectional study by interviewing 140 second and third year medical students from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Tîrgu Mureş, Romania. The questionnaire contained 22 items and included questions concerning legislative knowledge about autopsy and organ donation and for exploration of the reasons not to donate organs or tissues from a deceased person (family member).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We interviewed 140 students (mean age of 20.5 years), 42 (30 %) and 98 females (70 %). Most of the respondents lived in urban areas (78.6 %). 89 students (63.6) declared they already talked within their families about organ donation. Overall 81.4 % agreed to donate their own organs after death (no significant gender-difference) while only 61.4 % expressed their willingness to donate a close relative’s organs in the eventuality of brain-death. Desire of beloved body integrity preservation for emotional reasons was the most indicated answer when asking about reasoning, the second argument being “respect towards the deceased person”. Religious motives have been indicated only three times. Church attendance was irrelevant in relation to the willingness to donate.</p><p><bold>Discussions:</bold> the Eurobarometer survey (2010) concerning organ donation in Europe revealed that 31 % of the Europeans unwilling to donate are unable to give a reason for their decision while only 7 % indicated religious reasons. Within our group the distrust in the health system and fear of improper body manipulation were less significant than in the European survey, possible due to the specificity of our group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> reluctance to donate a close relative’s organs after death is more increased compared to that to donate own organs after deaths. Social and religious affiliation do not seem to influence, instead emotional and moral factors are most frequently invoked by medical students in our survey group as justification of indecision or refusal of organ donation.</p><p><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This paper is partly supported by the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD), financed from the European Social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the contract number POSDRU 60782.</p><p><bold>PP-130</bold></p><p><bold>Ethical decision making in neonatal resuscitation, a case report</bold></p><p>Cécile Manaouil, Maxime Gignon, <underline>George Adrian Patru</underline>, Olivier Jarde</p><p>University hospital Amiens, Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p>On 2 June 2009, the Nîmes administrative court condemned the Hospital of Orange (France) for unreasonable obstinacy after neonatal resuscitation.</p><p>On 14 December 2002, an apparently stillborn child was resuscitated after approximately 30 minutes of foetal distress.

Different views of autonomy might influence the decision if a donor’s offer is ethically acceptable. Acceptability of a prospective donor might be influenced by cultural, legal and social situations in different countries. Evaluation of the capacity to donate is in Romania the task of a joint forensic medicine and psychiatric commission.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> we analyze the case of a young man with mild mental retardation who was willing to donate a kidney to distant relative and in whom a rejection decision was finally made by the ethics commission based on a forensic expert opinion. We investigated elements of mental status examination, the process of understanding the recipient’s illness and transplantation outcomes, aspects of psychosocial stability, affective relationship with the recipient, education, social and familial insertion.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> based on our case analysis and review of the literature we aimed to elaborate a semi-structured interview as tool of assessment of living donors consent and capacity to donate an organ for transplantation. We propose the following items: understanding of the recipient’s illness, understanding of the transplantation process (including risks), decision to donate development, knowledge of post-donation health risks, right to reconsider. Each item contains a range of questions and finally a scoring from one to three is established by the interviewer. Moreover, a context of psychiatric history, personality style and mental status examination should complete the interview.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> the donor’s autonomous and voluntary decision is a necessary prerequisite for allowing a physician to hurt one person in order to help another.

However, it is still forbidden in Brazil to interrupt the pregnancy of an anencephalic fetus. The present study objective is to analyze the medical, legal and ethical challenges imposed by the debate of use of organs from anencephalic neonates for transplantation from the point of view of bioethics in Brazil. The path chosen to achieve this goal was a descriptive and exploratory method through the use of literature search conducted from books, magazines, papers, journals. Anencephaly is a severe defect of the embryonic central nervous system and has been the subject of heated debates in various sectors of Brazilian society and several questions can be brought up: 1. Should babies with anencephaly be considered as persons? 2. Are they potential organ donors? 3. If so, under which circumstances? 4. Can the definition of death or brain death be changed? 5. Should we practice intensive support of life for neonates with anencephaly in anticipation of brain death? 6. How should priorities be determined in neonatal units with limited resources? The present project has as its main goal to contribute to the debate about the anencephalic as organ donor and to the legal and ethical issues surrounding the topic. The current Brazilian law prevents the use of anencephalic as a donor, while holding signs of life with spontaneous breathing and crying, because they are positive signs of activity in the brainstem and not full characterization of brain death. Therefore, it is evident that there is no consensus about the procedures that should be employed to the neonate anencephalic, in that its death is merely a matter of time. The fact is that, pending meeting the criteria for brainstem death, you cannot get organs that are viable for transplant. Even with intensive therapy, the typical repeated apneas and bradycardia will cause hypoxic and ischemic lesions in the organs before death, becoming limited to the anencephalic organ donation. The stillborn fetus with anencephaly is a potential organ donor, if this is the will of the pregnant woman to do so.</p><p><bold>PP-133</bold></p><p><bold>Medicolegal Evaluation of Informed Consent Forms Used in A Cardiology Clinic in A Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul</bold></p><p><underline>Berna Aybek</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ahsen Kaya<sup>2</sup>, Coskun Yorulmaz<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istanbul University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Postgraduate Student of Health Care Management, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Informed consent originates from the legal and ethical rights of the patients. Patients have to know what will happen or what will be done to their body and make decision about their own body. Physicians’ one of the ethical duties is to give their patients information about their health. In this study, it is aimed to analyze the informed consent forms in medico legal aspect and to determine if they are accordance with Turkish Laws or not and if there is any need for revision of forms or not. In this context, it is wanted to emphasize that why the informed consent is necessary, how the informed consents should be taken, what the physician's legal responsibility about informed consent.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> For this study, ethics permission document and corporation permission from Istanbul Provincial Directorate of Health were taken. Records of patients, who were hospitalized in a cardiology clinic in a Training and Research Hospital between 01 January 2011 and 30 June 2011, were analyzed retrospectively. 189 patients’ records were randomly selected from among 1807 hospitalized patients’ records. Data about informed consents were statistically analyzed using SPSS programme (version 14.0).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In this study, 189 patients’ informed consent forms were analyzed. 127 males and 62 females, having the age range 16 to 92 years, were studied. It was detected that 99 patients (52.3 %) had signed the informed consent forms themselves. There wasn’t any signature on 3 (1.5 %) of 189. There were 186 (98.4 %) informed consents for hospitalization. Also, there were informed consents forms for 75.5 % (n = 73) of patients with stent, 84.1 % (n = 117) of patients applied angiography, 86.7 % (n = 13) of patients applied transesophageal echocardiography and 50 % of the patients with pacemaker.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients must be enough and voluntary to make decision and also understand the application about themselves. These are mandatory for informed consent in medical ethics. Informed consent is a very important medicolegal risk management tool. With this tool, physicians can minimize their juridical and criminal risks. An informed consent includes the nature of the decision/procedure, reasonable alternatives to the proposed intervention, the relevant risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to each alternative, assessment of patient understanding, the acceptance of the intervention by the patient. Success in informed consent increases parallel with the communication skills. There are some deficiencies about using forms in Turkey. For both patients and physicians goodness, knowledge about informed consents must be increased.</p><p><bold>PP-134</bold></p><p><bold>The responsibilities of a health volunteer rescuer: ethical and medical-legal considerations</bold></p><p><underline>Marco Chiaravalli</underline><sup>1</sup>, Laura Guzzetti<sup>2</sup>, Giuliano Zocchi<sup>3</sup>, Jutta Maria Birkhoff<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dipartimento di Biotecnologie e Scienze della Vita, Università degli Studi dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Dipartimento di Specialità Chirurgiche, Scienze Radiologiche e Medico Forensi, Università degli Studi di Brescia, Brescia, Italy</p><p><sup>3</sup>Azienda Ospedaliera Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi, Unità Operativa di Anestesia e Rianimazione B, Varese, Italy</p><p>In Italy, the organization of health services of external hospital emergency and urgency calls is based on skilled rescue teams (made up of a doctor, a nurse and technical staff) and rescue teams of volunteers coming from rescue associations.

Although the use of tobacco is a global problem the parties to the agreement, whilst their commitment on the subject of protection of public health is indisputable, have indicated their worries; on the international public consumption of tobacco products and exposure to smoke and the consequences of this on the global population in economic, social and environmental terms. Also, in the new amendment applied to Act no 4207 in 2008, that it inarguably complies with the Tobacco Control Framework Agreement on the subjects of, the ban of use of tobacco products in indoor premises and smoke free air space applications and the tobacco control and the prevention of damages. The restrictions and bans imposed for “The control of tobacco products and prevention harm“in order to ensure and protect the right to health of the individual and society is not only in compliance with the constitution and the Tobacco Control Framework Agreement but is also a scientific and contemporary necessity from the perspective of protecting human health and future generations.In this study, we aim to discuss the smoking ban in Turkey through different ethical arguments.</p><p><bold>PP-136</bold></p><p><bold>Legal and regulatory issues about a study protocol comparing 2 strategies for management of body packers carrying ingested drug packets</bold></p><p><underline>Bertrand Becour</underline>, Zakia Médiouni, Ahmed Hammache, Jean Louis Pourriat</p><p>Assistance publique-hôpitaux de paris</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> About one hundred individuals are apprehended each year in Paris for transporting internally concealed narcotic substances or body packing.

Legally speaking, this study comes under the label of “usual care” studies.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> One of its specificities is that it is conducted on detainees. The French legislation is attentive to the rights of detainees participating to biomedical research projects. The validity of their consent to participate to the study is scrutinized, regarding possible language-barrier issues or the intelligibility of the information provided. Three administrative authorities have to be approached based on the following legal fundamentals. The protection of persons in health-related matters comes under book 1 of the French Public Health Code (Livre 1 du Code de la Santé Publique).

So the crying one was the first patient, and the other who came to him for helping was the first physician. Early on, this relationship was formed with the unquestionable hegemony of the physician. In other words, the destiny of the patient was in a way resigned to the physician’s paternalistic attitude. This term which was firstly introduced legislation in the United States of America, was entitled as ‘informed consent’. When referred meaning of this term is considered, it is being translated in Turkish as ‘Aydınlatılmış Onam’ or ‘Bilgilendirilmiş Rıza’.</p><p>In this study, the results of physicians’ informing patients and patient relatives or not, have been tried to be evaluated with depth interview technique. With this aim, 3 groups (patients, physicians and patient relatives), each of them consisting of 10 individuals have been taken to be interviewed with the technique of depth interview in order to analyze their sociodemographic features, their first meeting with ‘informed consent’, attitudes they experienced and their opinions about what should be done.</p><p>With this study, the fact that education, social environment and experiences are one to one related with being conscious about one’s own personality rights has been understood. Thus, it can be concluded that all social problems about rights and responsibilities, including the ones related with informed consent, may be solved in a more reliable way with making up the deficiencies in education.</p><p><bold>PP-138</bold></p><p><bold>Mandatory Reporting Law: Problems and Solutions in Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Çiğdem Adar</underline><sup>1</sup>, Rahime Erbaş<sup>1</sup>, Ahsen Kaya<sup>2</sup>, Adem Sözüer<sup>1</sup>, Coşkun Yorulmaz<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Law, İstanbul University,İstanbul,Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Cerrahpaşa Medical School, İstanbul University, İstanbul,Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Knowledge of mandatory reporting laws has become integral to the practice of medical care because many reportable conditions are regularly encountered in medical departments. Mandatory reporting laws impose requirements on physicians to report certain conditions or suspected conditions to local legal authorities for further action. These laws, which govern various conditions from infectious diseases as a HIV infection to situations of abuse, are contentious. Although debates surrounding these laws are condition specific, in general, they pit concerns of patient and community safety against desires to maintain patient-physician confidentiality and arguments that mandatory re porting laws may be ineffective at promoting safety. This study discusses Turkish Criminal law and subsequently examines the rationale for and against mandatory reporting laws as they apply to medical conditions.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In this process, the important issue of mandatory reporting law, which takes place in Turkey, was examined and discussed closely. Unsatisfied with it, the mandatory reporting problems that the other countries have been facing were analyzed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As a general result of negligence on Medical Ethics and jurisprudence, there is a big discrepancy between these two important instruments. In many countries, lots of applications of the mandatory reporting system have been observed and it was realized that there was no uniformity in these different applications even the different states of the one country. Owing to various approach suggestions of different groups such as Chamber of Physicians in Turkey and law society, mandatory reporting system hasn’t been implemented equally and homogeneously among physicians.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Medicine, as a profession, is quite a hard commitment, with the aim of taking care of patients. Physicians assume professional accountability not only to their patients and relatives but also to legal authorities. In case of insufficiency in exercising this multi-dimensional accountability, they may confront legal and ethical issues. In an attempt to remove this situation; legislator have to empathize with the physicians. Additively, the unacceptable disparity shows that each concrete case needs different obligation. Ultimately pre- and post-graduate forensic medicine education must be considered highly important, and periodic on-the- job training must be organized, creating a better awareness among doctors regarding their legal responsibilities.</p><p><bold>PP-139</bold></p><p><bold>Assessment of the Deaths in Nursing Homes and Hospices in Istanbul</bold></p><p><underline>Deniz Oguzhan Melez</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bahadır Kumral<sup>1</sup>, Ipek Esen Melez<sup>1</sup>, Muhammed Feyzi Sahin<sup>1</sup>, Yalcin Buyuk<sup>1</sup>, Umit Naci Gundogmus<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Aging starts with birth and is an inevitable process, which is difficult to accept. The definition and borders of the care in this period is important also for expert witness viewpoint.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study assessing the death cases that were sent to the Council of Forensic Medicine Morgue Department for autopsy between 2005 and mid 2011. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The retrospective evaluation determined 29 death cases in the hospices and nursing homes. The mean age was 73.41 + 14.10 years (range: 35 to 101). There were 17 males (58.62 %), and 12 females (41.48 %). Natural causes of death were more frequent (n = 17, 58.62 %) and non-natural causes of death were accident (n = 8, 27.59 %) and suicide (n = 4, 13.79 %). The pathological deaths were as follows: cardiovascular system diseases (n = 12, 41.37 %), gastrointestinal system diseases (n = 3, 10.34 %), respiratory diseases (n = 1, 3.45 %), and central nervous system diseases (n = 1, 3.45 %). Accidental deaths were as follows: 3 (10.34 %) secondary to falling from a height, 3 (10.34 %) due to falling on a flat surface and 2 (6.90 %) due to traffic accidents. Two (6.90 %) of the suicidal deaths were due to hanging and two (6.90 %) were due to jumping from a height. Histopathologic assessment with H&amp;E staining revealed findings that would explain the cause of death in 21 cases of 29 (72.41 %), while in 8 (27.58 %) no such findings were found. In these 8 cases, the origins of deaths were as follows: accident in 4, suicide in 2 and in the rest of the 2, autopsies could not identify any etiology other than possible unidentified disease. The toxicological screening was also performed.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study demonstrates that the most frequent cause of death was related to the health problems associated with the advanced age. With evaluating suicides and accidents and the reason of autopsy in natural deaths, a dilemma of how broad an elderly person’s autonomy and freedom should be kept in hospices and nursing homes by the personnel, can be discussed to decide if they are juristically negligent to the elderly individuals or not according to the level of close-follow up they are obliged to perform on elderly individuals. In this consideration, all evidences, autopsy reports and other scientific - ethic viewpoints on elderly rights should be synthesized by the the expert witness.</p><p><bold>PP-140</bold></p><p><bold>The Use of Animals in Forensic Sciences</bold></p><p><underline>Antonella Rendinelli</underline>, Daniele Gibelli, Cristina Cattaneo</p><p>Sezione di Medicina Legale - Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana e Scienze Biomediche, Università degli Studi, Milano, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Hundreds of millions of animals are used every year in laboratories all over the world, and 11 million in the European Union, among which less than one million in Italy. With time the need for fast scientific improvements has caused the pandemic diffusion of such a practice in every field of science. However, if in clinical research the sacrifice of an animal and the consequent ethical aspects may be considered secondary to the therapeutic advantages which may derive from its application, in forensic sciences the use of animal models may be questionable. Nonetheless literature includes several experimental protocols which envisage, for example, verifying the effects of hanging, electrocution, trauma, drowning in mice, rabbits, cats and dogs.</p><p>This presentation has as its main goal a brief review of the existing literature concerning experimental protocols on animals in forensic sciences in order to shed light on this sensitive, ethical and often ignored aspect in legal medicine.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A meta analysis of scientific articles published in the last decade in the field of forensic sciences in major scientific journals and concerning animal experimentation was performed. The species involved, the types of lesions, the types of sedation and methods of performing euthanasia according to local laws and ethical committee approval, type of results, their applicability to the human species and frequency of citations were taken into account.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> over 100 articles were evaluated, concerning experimental projects involving animal models in vivo; in a significant proportion application to human situations could seem questionable and citation of the articles was low or inexistent. Rats and mice were most frequently used, but pigs, dogs and rabbits are still commonly encountered in the forensic scenario. In some cases animals were not anaesthetised during all procedures.

Most of the potential problems in that field usually result from the lack of knowledge about ethics and medicolegal principle. Ethics is an essential dimension of obstetric and gynecologic practice. In this study, we present an ethical and medicolegal framework for clinical judgment and decision-making in the obstetrician-gynecologist–patient relationship. The presentation emphasizes a preventive ethics approach, which appreciates the potential for ethical and legal conflict and adopts ethically justified strategies to prevent those conflicts from occurring.</p><p><bold>Material method:</bold> The most important medicolegal problems in Obstetrics and Gynecology in private practice were analyzed and separately discussed in terms of Turkish Criminal Code.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> Management of child sexual abuse and sexual assault cases in private hospital were the most anxious situation with fertilization problems. On the other hand failure/delayed diagnosis, failure/delayed treatment, failure to recognize complication, failed sterilization, failure to obtain consent and inappropriate treatment had been very often complained by the patients and relatives.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Health administration ethics is an important (but often overlooked) subject. Unethical conduct on the part of healthcare administrators can result in legal and reputation costs to the hospital where they work, meaning that ethical behavior is ultimately in the hospital's best interests. Preventive medicolegal risk management helps to build and sustain a strong physician–patient relationship in the especially private practice of obstetrics and gynecology. We examine ethical issues in responsible resource management, emphasizing the virtues of the physician as a professional. Finally, we provide suggestion for critically appraising the literature of ethics and medicolegal issues in obstetrics and gynecology. In critical condition, medicolegal consultation is necessary for safe practice. Like Cerrahpasa Medical School, Department of Forensic Medicine which provides medicolegal consultation is critical importance. Identification of specific characteristics of medicolegal problems in private hospitals can be the dual quality of the patient’s self perception that appears in parallel with finance model and the problems’ appearing on the implications of physician practice and the solution may be hidden in good physician practices.</p><p><bold>PP-142</bold></p><p><bold>A lethal case due to septicaemia after massive burning injuries as a result of patient’s refusal to treatment: ethical and legal aspects</bold></p><p>Anna Mavroforou, <underline>Katerina Kanaki</underline>, Manolis Michalodimitrakis</p><p>Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Crete - Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece</p><p>A fatal case of a 46-year old man, who died after massive burning injuries, is presented. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a university hospital, where a diagnosis of 1st to 3rd degree burns affecting more than 30 % of his total body surface was made. The event was accidental in nature. First aid care was provided and the patient was subjected to the appropriate blood tests and investigations. Admission was suggested as necessary from the caring physicians who provided him all the information justifying their decision. However, the patient refused it and he left the hospital being conscious and having signed on his medical records that this was his own decision. The man was discovered dead by his neighbours at his home 12 days later. Septicemia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was confirmed as the cause of death.</p><p>The aim of the presentation of this case is to highlight the ethical and legal issues related to an adult patient’s refusal to medical life-saving treatment.

A patient who was subjected to aortocoronary by-pass, at the end of the operation presented ventricular fibrillation. The surgeon immediately injected adrenaline by puncturing the aortic root using a syringe with a small needle (length 1.6 cm). The small needle after the injection was left in place for air evacuation from the circulation while the surgeon started cardiac massage with subsequent cardiac defibrillation. The two other surgeon-assistants who were doing other parts of the operation were unaware of the fact that the small needle was left embedded in the aortic root. Thus after the patient’s heart function recovery they proceeded to wound closure without removing the small needle. Postoperatively he developed pericardial effusion and he was admitted to another hospital in which he was subjected to a chest magnetic resonance tomography, as a consequence of which the needle migrated. A year later the patient was subjected to a chest x-ray for persisting coughing and fatiqueness and on this occasion the small needle was discovered inside his chest. The patient lived for 8 years after the operation but during this period he developed psychological problems as he could not accept to live having a foreign body inside his chest. The presence of the needle in the chest was confirmed also on an x-ray done within the context of post-mortem investigation and it was found to be well incorporated by fibrous tissue in the pericardial space. On post-mortem investigation it was also confirmed an acute myocardial infarction along with findings suggesting old ones, while no injury of the aorta or the heart as a result of the presence of the needle was noticed.</p><p>The aim of the presentation of this case is to highlight the legal and ethical issues related to an inadvertedly left instrument inside the patient’s body after the operation and to investigate the edges on which medical negligence can be founded.</p><p><bold>PP-144</bold></p><p><bold>The Assessment of Consent Form’s Readability And Understandability In Turkish Language</bold></p><p><underline>Erhan Buken</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bora Buken<sup>5</sup>, Nermin Yazıcı<sup>4</sup>, Faik Sarıalioğlu<sup>2</sup>, Haldun Müderrisoğlu<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p><sup>2</sup>Baskent UniversityFaculty of Medicine Department of Pediatry</p><p><sup>3</sup>Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Department Of Cardiology</p><p><sup>4</sup>Baskent University Faculty of Education</p><p><sup>5</sup>Düzce University Faculty of Medicine Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> It is an ethical and legal obligation for consent forms to be understandable to the patient.

Prison health care should be equivalent to health care in the community. Despite these important points, generally, training programs of medical faculties does not cover enough time and content for prison medicine. In this study, we aim to identify the educational status and their perception of prison doctors and their educational needs related to prison health service.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The study was designed as a cross sectional survey and it was carried out in 2009–2010. We got permission to carry out for our survey from General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Houses. In the first step, we reached all doctors(64) by phone and invited to participate in the study.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> 59(92 %) prison doctors participated our study. 84 % of doctors had no any experiences about offenders as a patient in their undergraduate education period. All of them expressed that they had not received training program related to prison health problem and services. 84 % of doctors stated that they had difficulty to adapt to working conditions in prison. 93 % of our participants thought that physician patient relationship obviously is different in prison than daily community health service practice. 50 % of participants believed that their medical ability and proficiency is enough to work out patients’ health problems in prison. 74 % doctors think that special education is a necessity working in prison. They expressed that education program should include psychiatric management of patients (64 %), management in prison &amp; autonomy of medical professional (56 %), emergency practice in prison condition (49 %), patient-physician relationship and communication skills for prison condition (40 %). They think that additional education for doctors should be organized by medical faculty (49.2), ministry of health (45.8) or Turkish Medical Association (33.9). Interestingly, we found that 61 % of prison doctors had poor knowledge about national and international regulation about prison physician practice and 20 % of doctors had any knowledge related to regulations about their daily practice.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In light of our results, we can say that undergraduate and postgraduate education focused on prison health problem efforts are poorly in Turkey. In prison daily life, because of this lack of medical education, it leads to human rights problems. We suggest that medical faculty undergraduate program should cover prison health topics and this program should put into practice with collaboration of different academic areas which are public health, forensic pathology and medical ethics.</p><p><bold>PP-146</bold></p><p><bold>The Evaluation of Verbal Information During The Process of Informed Consent</bold></p><p><underline>Erhan Buken</underline><sup>1</sup>, Alp Aydınalp<sup>2</sup>, Bora Büken<sup>2</sup>, I.

It was understood that the patient neither enlightened by the doctor nor asked if she was virgin or not in anamnesis before the examination. As a consequence of hyper perforation, the patient brought a complaint about the doctor who examined her. In vaginal examination by Forensic Science Department by the permission of Prosecution Office, it was informed that there was a laceration at 9 o’clock side which its exremity is hyperemic and recently arised (1–2 days), the patient was not virgin anymore, the incident happened by penetrating limb or an object into the body.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The clauses editing sexual crimes, comprise the penalties due to the effects of the incident on the person.

SOO promoted this meeting due to the evident differences of methods applied all over Spain in this forensic practice and also due to the complaints of different national and international committees about the way our country had been facing this issue. Neither methods applied nor professionals responsible of this medical evaluations were until then the same in different Spanish communities and no methodology was uniquely considered the gold standard. After this session, another meeting was promoted by SOO with members of Spanish Ministry of Justice, Public Prosecutors and Judges to discuss the legal implications of implementing an unique National Protocol about FAE. The conclusions of these two sessions settled the basis of a Spanish National Protocol about FAE in living minors. The protocol was published in the SOO website as an open access ebook and in one of the Spanish Forensic Medicine journals, Revista Española de Medicina Legal (REML), as two papers: conclusions of the sessions and Better Practice Manual on FAE in living foreigner unaccompained minors. This protocol was agreed by all LMI and Spanish Public Prosecutor Office made a final decision about sending all cases of minors unaccompained of an unknown age only to LMI were examinations and tests must be performed since then under a forensic physician supervision. The aim of the Better Practice Manual is to standardise and harmonise the minimum technical requirements of expert reports, and how the standard deviation due to normal distribution as well as how the variability in individual physical development should be handled. The proposals include making these examinations only by experienced and supervised staff of Forensic Institutions, following informed consent of the presumed minor. Evaluation must consist of an interview, with a physical examination, radiological examination of the wrist, and dental pantomography. Radiological or computerized tomography of the proximal epiphysis of the collar bone might be done in particular cases. It is also recommended that the Courts, not forensic physicians,should make the final decision on whether the person is a minor or not due to the important legal implications of such a decision.</p><p><bold>PP-150</bold></p><p><bold>Protocol for collection of Biological samples for Examination Autopsy: Practical Method to avoid unnecessary exhumations</bold></p><p><underline>Manoel Campos Neto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Vidal Haddad Júnior<sup>2</sup>, Alessandra Paiva Puertas Alves<sup>3</sup>, Ana Cristina Lepinsk Romio<sup>3</sup>, Ivo Antonio Vieira<sup>4</sup>, Caroline A.

After the release of the body if the identification for the first release of the body is not true, either by communication of error by the family or by finding that the name written on the death certificate corresponds to a live person or by Police Authority in investigating cases of fraud, there must be an exhumation and autopsy for the collection of material for laboratory identification.

In addition to conventional anthropological methods, a simple, objective and precise method to estimate the age of unidentified cadavers to assist personal identification is necessary. The degree of sagittal closure is one of such age estimation methods. However it depends on subjective evaluation, leaving it open to error.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In this study, we have examined whether measuring impedance value (z-value) of the sagittal suture of the skull could be utilized to estimate age in men and women of various ages.</p><p>In a second experiment, importantly, a comparison was made between the z-values from short postmortem time and remoistened rat bone.</p><p>A third experiment compared age estimation through the conventional visual method and the proposed bone impedance measurement technique.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As results of first experiment showed that bone impedance values increased with aging in males. Meanwhile, in females, it increased with age and the decreased after the age of 71. As results of second experiment, the bone impedance values found from remoistened rat skulls were very similar to those found in short postmortem time conditions (R2 = 0.74). Therefore, this technique may be able to use for decomposed body and skeletonized body.</p><p>The results of using conventional visual method did not necessarily correspond to the results of proposed bone impedance measurement technique.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It was found that bone impedance values increase with age. Through experiments on rats it is believed that impedance values may not change significantly with time or changes in moisture. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that the bone impedance measuring technique is an effective objective method of estimating age superior to the subjective traditional visual method. That is to say, it is suggested that the bone impedance measuring technique can, with further research, be of value to forensic science as a method of age estimation.</p><p><bold>PP-153</bold></p><p><bold>Anthropological and pathological analysis of medieval skeletal remains: identification of monks from historical records</bold></p><p><underline>Nikola Velickovic</underline>, Tamara Pavlovic, Milos Dakic, Stefan Velickovic, Ksenija Djukic, Danijela Djonic</p><p>Laboratory for Anthropology, Institute of Anatomy, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade,</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> During 2006 excavations on Crkviste site, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, skeletal remains of four individuals were found.

This is an important step in bone identification because skeletal parts of a wide variety of animals are often submitted to departments of forensic medicine as supposedly human. The identification in such cases depends on the preservation and size of the sample and ranges from macroscopical to histological and molecular analysis of the bone. In some cases, radiological examination adds important details to the interpretation of the material.</p><p><bold>Aims:</bold> We present a particular case where a forensic anthropologist and radiologist were requested to identify the mummified remains of animals curated in the Archeological Museum in Zagreb, Croatia. The main purpose of the analysis was to identify the taxon and attest the stage of preservation of the delicate remains. The specialists were requested also to analyze two mummified hands in order to attest whether they come from humans or primates.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of seven remains were analyzed in the study: five remains of unidentified animals and two mummified hands. The remains were examined by radiologic analysis at the University Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia and included x-ray and MSCT imaging.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> Mummification of animals was a common practice in ancient Egypt performed as a funerary rite for pets and worshiped animals or simply as an offering to gods. Although the animals were usually mummified in manner to conserve their external appearance, this was not the case in our study. Paleoradiologic examination helped to overcome this issue and allowed a noninvasive study of the remains. We were able to identify two animal species (a cat and the remains of crocodile hatchlings) while the third could not be identified with certainty. Another mummy that had no natural structure preserved was classified as an imitation of an ibis. The two hands were identified as being human, one belonging to an adult and the other to a two-year old child.</p><p>In addition, the poster will present the history of animal mummification practice in ancient Egypt, describe the main steps undertaken in examining the radiological finds, point out the main differences between primate and human hand anatomy and discuss the difficulties encountered during the radiological interpretation of mummified material.</p><p><bold>PP-155</bold></p><p><bold>Sacral Measurements as a Prediction Tool to Stature &amp; Gender in North-West Indian subjects</bold></p><p><underline>Dalbir Singh</underline></p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine,Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,Chandigarh,India</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Identification is the most crucial parameter in a forensic investigation and also becomes most difficult task in cases of highly disfigured and dismembered bodies. With the ever increasing frequency of mass disasters (both man-made and natural), homicides, road and train accidents, airplane crashes, tsunami, there is utmost need of studies which can lend a helping hand in identifying the unknown from the dismembered and fragmentary remains. In such cases, skeletal examination may help since bones resist decomposition for a long time. However, in most of the cases recovery of intact bones is not possible, therefore bones which remain intact long after death such as vertebral column especially its sacral vertebrae may prove useful in giving a conclusive opinion on identity of the deceased and can give approximation of stature.</p><p>Although various vertebrae column measurements were significantly used for these estimation but possibility of estimating only from sacral vertebrae which invariably found intact has been explored comparatively in fewer studies that too on limited study material in the Western population. Literature on the subject from India in general and from north-west India in particular is very scanty. Keeping in view the above facts present study is an attempt to estimate the gender and stature of an individual from various measurements of sacral vertebrae as applicable to North-West Indian population.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> With a valid consent of the legal heirs of the deceased, body length and after debridement,cleaning &amp; properly exposing,various other anthropometric measurements of the sacrum were taken according to the landmark and procedures described by Giraux et al in 717 adults subjects (549 males and 168 females) at the time of medico-legal postmortems.</p><p><bold>Results &amp; conclusion:</bold> Mean length of sacrum was more in males (11.095 ± 0.891cms) where as its width was more in females particularly at the level of first &amp; second sacral vertebrae (10.595 ± 0.665cms, 8.954 ± 0.616 cms respectively). There was a highly significant correlation ship between the body height and sacrum length, width of 1st to 3rd sacral vertebrae (p &lt; 0.001) in both the sexes. From regression equations stature of an individual can be predicted with a Standard Error of the Estimate of 6.014, 5.142 &amp;7.171cms. in males, females and combined materials respectively. Mean value of sacral vertebral index which was higher in females (103.865 ± 9.370) statistically plays a significant role in determination of gender of an individual</p><p><bold>PP-156</bold></p><p><bold>Identification Using MATLAB Software: a New Idea</bold></p><p><underline>Arash Ghodousi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Elham Zamani Pozveh<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Nursing and Midwifery, Khorasgan (Isfahan) Branch, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, IRAN</p><p><sup>2</sup>School of Dentistry, Khorasgan (Isfahan) Branch, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, IRAN</p><p><bold>Introduction &amp; aim:</bold> Identification using photographs is one of the forensic procedures in which a comparison between before and after photographs of missing person is made.

Men’s clothing and an ID card, allegedly belonging to the victim, were found too. All the remains were collected and analyzed: the skeletal remains included animal bones, belonging to a bat and to a canine specimen, and human remains from a single subject. Both patellas, a thoracic vertebra and 9 teeth were not found.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The cause of death was determined in a single head gunshot, while ribs, vertebrae and left scapula fractures were made post mortem, probably as a consequence of the 20 meters fall of the corpse at the bottom of the cistern were the remains were found. Time since death was assessed based on the degree of skeletonization and on chemical test. Race and gender were assessed based on both morphological and metric evaluation of cranial and skeletal indices. The subject age at the time of death was determined by evaluating dentition, ossification centers and cranial sutures closure; stature was estimated by anthropometric analysis of femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, radius and ulna. All data were matched with data reported on the ID card; DNA results were not conclusive, due to the poor preservation of skeletal remains. Then was performed a 3D skull-face superimposition technique. A 3D parameterized avatar of the skull was created with a photogrammetric technique and photos of the missing person were selected and acquired. The 3D skull was then carefully spatially oriented, in the same position as in the photos, and snapshots were taken. In the metric image analysis step, a quantitative comparison between the image of the missing person face and the snapshot obtained was carried out. Objective landmarks, as exocanthions, glabella and subspinal point were marked both on the 3D skull and on the missing person face.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The absolute and relative distances between the marked points, the perimeters and the areas of the triangles, obtained by connecting the points, and the compactness indices were automatically calculated with a suitable program.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The correlation coefficients of this values, higher than 0.997, allowed to confirm the identification hypothesis.</p><p><bold>PP-159</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Combined Use of Frontal Sinus and Nasal Septum Patterns for Identification in an Iranian Samples</bold></p><p><underline>Arash Ghodousi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Roshanak Ghafari<sup>2</sup>, Elham Zamani Pozveh<sup>3</sup>, Nima Rahim Zadeh<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Nursing and Midwifery, Khorasgan (Isfahan) Branch, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, IRAN</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Khorasgan (Isfahan) Branch, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, IRAN</p><p><sup>3</sup>School of Dentistry, Khorasgan (Isfahan) Branch, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, IRAN</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> Frontal sinuses are valuable for human identification.

A specialized team of forensic scientists is required. This consists of a medical examiner, an anthropologist and an odontologist. Primarily, macroscopic examination of the skull and teeth are needed. Next, the assessment of age is gathered from the skull based on the anthropological findings. However, more accurate results of age estimation can be determined using dental morphology. The sex characteristics can be precisely ascertained through DNA dental analysis. Then, a complete X-ray study of the skeleton and an image-guided virtual autopsy using multislice computed tomography (MSCT) must match the radiologic images, anthropologic data and macroscopic findings.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> The goal of this presentation is to elucidate the team’s investigation of the skeletal remains of “Felice” Martyr, patron saint of Sennori, from the province of Sassari, who has been preserved in a reliquary. The aim was to find out the sex, age, height and the cause of death. The team included a medical examiner, an anthropologist and an odontologist. A DNA test, complete X-ray and multislice computed tomography examinations were performed. A radiocarbon test was performed to date the remains.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusions:</bold> The investigation team was able to identify the age, sex and height of patron saint “Felice,” as well as the perimortem traumatic lesion.

The study material composed from 5 graves of a small population where had been lived in Istanbul dated to Late Byzantine period. Age and sex were determined and dentally distinguish features were analyzed specific to population. The population is consists of 5 children and 15 adults. 85 permanent and 14 deciduous teeth of 20 individuals were evaluated in terms of sex, age, growth and health. The size of the sample seemed to be smaller than the compared the others. Hypoplasia was detected in all canins and premolars. A rare case of pink teeth was found only in one tooth. Generally pink teeth occur as a result of sudden increasing pressure in tooth pulp and frequently seen in asphyxia cases.</p><p>It is assumed that this population located near by the Marmara Sea had survived an urban life.

In living subjects, age estimation may be used to establish an individual’s status as a minor in cases involving adoption, criminal responsibility, child pornography, and those seeking asylum, especially where adequate identification documents are lacking. The Authors report a case about age assessment of a girl born in Mbujimayi (Congo) and later adopted in Italy. The birth certificate issued after finding the child in a state of abandonment (in December 2007), bore date of 12.12.2004, but this was in contrast with the year of birth – 2003 – stated on the certification available to the center that had provided accommodation to the girl in Africa. Her adoptive parents reported that the child had been diagnosed with precocious puberty and was thus under treatment. She weighed 32.5 kg and was 132.5 cm tall. Basing on height and weight, body mass index (BMI) corresponded to the range between 9.5 and 14 years of age. The assessment of maturity indicators (sexual characteristics) placed the child at the lower limits of Stage II of Tanner’s classification (sparse growth of long, slightly darkened, downy straight pubic hair; elevation of the breast and nipple as a small mound with increased diameter of the areolae). The skeletal age was determined by taking X-Rays of the hand and wrist using Fels, TW2 and Greulich and Pyle methods. Dental growth was assessed through orthopantomogram using Demirjian’s technique. The methods applied were adjusted considering the studies on African population found in the literature, and a skeletal and dental age of 10 years was established. Afterwards, the wrist X-Rays performed at the Children’s Hospital of Bari, 7 months before our investigation, revealed a skeletal age of 7 years. This evidence showed that, despite the treatment the child had promptly initiated, early puberty had influenced the skeletal growth with an acceleration of about 2 years. Therefore, the age we detected (10 years) was the result of precocious puberty. Then, we backdated the girl’s birth (by about 2 years, based on current studies), stating that she was about 8 at the time of our investigation.</p><p>This case is significant both for the racial differences that need to be considered in age assessment, and for the importance of any pathology (growth disorders) that may affect physiological development and make the applied methods poorly reliable.</p><p><bold>PP-166</bold></p><p><bold>Morphological Analysis of Sharp Force Trauma Patterns Using High Resolution Casts</bold></p><p>Samantha Donnellan<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>2</sup>, Elena Kranioti<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Forensic Anthropology, School of History, Classics and Archaeology, University of Edinburgh, UK</p><p><sup>2</sup>Lab. of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Sharp implements are the predominant weapons used in homicidal attacks in the United Kingdom. There is a paucity of literature on sharp force trauma and studies into weapon identification are limited. Moreover the few studies that exist are often based on experimental procedures using semi-fleshed and de-fleshed bones. For the legal authorities investigating violent crimes and homicides, the identification of the weapon employed is of paramount importance.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Five fully fleshed domestic pig (Sus Scrofa) heads were stabbed by male subjects, using five commercially available sharp implements. The subjects were selected to fit the UK average weight, height and age of offending males, and were asked to stab each head twice, exerting the greatest possible force. Each individual was assigned a weapon and told which side of the head to stab, aiming for the frontal bones. The side of the head to stab was chosen according to the handedness of the subject. Subsequently, each head was macerated using hot water with dissolved biological washing powder and high resolution casts were created of the cut marks and the weapon tips for comparative purposes. The positive casts of the weapons and the skull cut marks were studied macroscopically and microscopically using an Olympus B2 metallurgical microscope. Microscopic analysis provided a magnified visual depiction of the surfaces of the weapon tips and the cut floor and walls of the bone. Macroscopic analysis employed digital sliding calipers to measure the length and breadth of the cut marks and weapon tips.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Various analytical methods were utilized to compare and contrast the results When combining macroscopic and microscopic analysis for each cast weapon tip and cut mark, a ‘match’ was based on the level of correlation. In some instances, macroscopic analysis was adequate to match the weapon type (class) to the cut mark, based on the shape alone, however this was not detailed enough to match an individual weapon of the recognised type.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The combination of both microscopic and macroscopic examination results in a match between the casts of the weapon tips and the cut marks leading to the identification of the weapon class. Further analysis using SEM is expected to enhance the possibilities of identification of the individual weapon.</p><p><bold>PP-167</bold></p><p><bold>Search Engines</bold></p><p><underline>Alexey Abramov</underline></p><p>Department of Call Experts, State Bureau of Forensic Medicine, Moscow, Russia</p><p>This review is dedicated to the issue of creating search engines capable of performing independent face image analysis and database search.</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Computerization nowadays invades various aspects of our life.

This allowed producing the software which can do an automatic search on a large database of facial images (portrait search).</p><p>2. A computer modification of the photo superimposition (craniofacial identification) method is based upon the use of the software system “TADD SM” (developed by Abramov S., Boldyrev N., Bannikov A.) There are some configurations of this system including those which use 3D skull models. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to achieve rather positive results in automatic searching on the database with the images of missing people.</p><p>3. Utterly new possibilities are given by the method of producing 3D models of people’s injuries when identifying a living person or examining a corpse. It provides a special way of capturing the objects that drastically differs from making a photo or a video.</p><p><bold>PP-170</bold></p><p><bold>Mitochondrial DNA and 17 Y-STR Loci Analysis from Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Emine Kaleintzi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kuaybe Yücebilgili<sup>2</sup>, Cihat Güner<sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Fatih Abasıyanık<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Fatih University</p><p><sup>2</sup>İstanbul Medeniyet University</p><p>Mitochondrial control regions of 112 unrelated individuals from different geographical regions of Turkey were analyzed.

The body height and both feet length of 112 Tunisian adult males (age-range from 18 to 89 years) were measured during autopsies performed in the department of Forensic Medicine of the University Hospital “Fattouma Bourguiba” of Monastir (Tunisia). The correlation regression coefficient “r” between the measures items was evaluated.</p><p><bold>Main results:</bold> The correlation regression coefficient “r” between the right and the left foot length and the body height was respectively 0.457 and 0.452. These values show a medium positive correlation between these measures.

If characteristic features of blunt and gunshot lesions on fresh bone are well-known, in cases of charred remains the challenge of a pathologist becomes tougher. Hence, can trauma features be reliable even in case of charred remains? And what kind of alterations do they undergo?</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Two kinds of lesions were created in two groups of bovine skeletonized ribs: nine samples were hit with a hammer creating blunt force lesions, while each of the other eleven samples underwent a shooting test creating a gunshot wound. Then, in order to simulate severe combustion, a charring cycle in an oven led to the complete calcination of the samples. Patterns and metric parameters of every bone fracture were recorded and compared before and after carbonization, in order to evaluate the effect of heat, such as the appearance of new fractures (heat-fractures) or significant modifications of pre-existing fractures.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> First of all, Student’s t-test and ANOVA tests clearly demonstrated how heat can effectively affect fracture features and new fracture formation on bone in both groups; in the case of blunt force fractures heat affected the dimensions of fractures in an unpredictable manner, whereas in the case of gunshot lesions heat definitely caused an increase in the length of radial fractures. Secondly, in the shot samples the number of new fractures (heat-related) is significantly higher, most of which radiating from the entry wound but some also longitudinal and transverse.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The highest number and type of fractures in shot samples could be due to the weakness of the bone, in the sense that the full-thickness of the gunshot wound makes the bone weaker than in the case of blunt force lesions, where the lesion is only depressed. In case of gunshot wounds heat can reliably yield an increase in the fracture length, while this cannot be surely stated with blunt force fractures. Thus, morphological and metric alterations of fractures related to trauma and the appearance of new heat-related fractures must be taken in serious consideration when a pathologist has to deal with charred remains.</p><p><bold>PP-173</bold></p><p><bold>Radiographic and morphological study to estimate the adult individual age in the clavicle</bold></p><p><underline>María Benito Sánchez</underline>, José Antonio Sánchez Sánchez, María Del Mar Robledo Acinas, Raquel Dominguez López</p><p>Legal medicine school of madrid, complutense university of madrid, spain</p><p>Currently, the estimation of the age is one of the most important issues to identify human remains in the forensic anthropology area. However, it can be difficult in some forensic cases because the methods don't have a very good correlation between chronological and biological ages in adult individuals. For this reason, it is important to develop other studies in this area, in order to improve the actual tecnhiques. The aim of the present study has been the creation of patterns of morphological variability to relate them to the age. To start, 280 standardized clavicles radiographic images have been done using the known sex and age bones from "The School of Legal Medicine of Madrid" collection. On them, some morphological patterns have been created using the anterior and posterior clavicle cortical thickness and density, and the medular cavity, and esternal and acromial extremities trabecular system. The results show a high descent in the anterior and posterior cortical thickness, and the trabecular system density, according to the age increase. In addiction, some trabecular diameter growth patterns have been related with the age advance. In conclusion, the morphological parameters studied are some useful tools to create some new techniques to improve the adult age estimation in forensic cases.</p><p><bold>PP-174</bold></p><p><bold>Here’s looking at you, Fordisc®…</bold></p><p><underline>Mikolas Jurda</underline>, Miroslav Dvorak, Petra Urbanova</p><p>Department of Anthropology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In the framework of forensic anthropology, osteometric characteristics are often preferred in estimating the biological profile of unknown skeletal remains, in particular assessments of sex and ancestry. Fordisc® was developed to facilitate sex, ancestry and stature estimation of skeletal remains using Howells database and FDB as reference samples. The authors have pointed out repeatedly that an acceptable rate of reliability can be achieved when two basic rules are followed – an assessment must be based on the maximum number of measurements and an unknown specimen must belong to one of the reference samples. In practice, however, there are many cases when a fulfilment of these two conditions is difficult and thus a very unsatisfactory rate of reliability is to be expected.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The main goal of our study was to assess the reliability of discriminant functions generated using Fordisc® 3.1 software when applied on human crania, which have no relevance to Fordisc reference populations.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> Sex and ancestry determination of 914 crania of known sex from six different skeletal collections (Athens, Coimbra, Lisbon, Săo Paulo and two collections from Prague) was carried out. Crania were analyzed using 13 cranial measures computed from 3D Cartesian coordinates of landmarks. Computation of measurements is being used with an increasing frequency in anthropological examination due to expansion of modern data acquisition methods. Discriminate functions derived from both Howells and FDB database were used to assess sex and ancestry.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The accuracy of sex determination varied between 65 % and 90 % depending on specified ancestry. The crania were assigned to their historically or geographically related reference population at a rate exceeding their odds but not with the widely accepted reliability of 95 %. Even with a limited number of variables Fordisc 3 was able to correctly classify some of the crania from independent samples. Still, a large number of specimens are clearly misclassified and the software provided no clue to reveal these cases. Our results support the assumptions that the reliability of Fordisc® 3.1 is limited when the complete set of measurements is not available for the analysis and specimen doesn´t belong to the reference population. Therefore, true serviceability of Fordisc® 3.1 in the European and non-European context and its true merit for the anthropologists has to be further discussed.</p><p><bold>PP-175</bold></p><p><bold>Anthropological, histological and genetic features of three Neolithic skeletal remains from an Apulian town (Italy)</bold></p><p><underline>Marilidia Piglionica</underline><sup>1</sup>, Francesca Radina<sup>2</sup>, Stefania Lonero Baldassarra<sup>1</sup>, Vito Scattarella<sup>3</sup>, Gianfranco Favia<sup>1</sup>, Alessandro Dell' Erba<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Superintendence for Archaeological Heritage in Bari, Italy</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Biology, University of Bari, Italy</p><p>In 1997, a monumental burial was discovered in Rutigliano, a little Apulian town (Italy), dating back to Final Neolithic Age (4th millennium B.C., Diana culture).

Patients with known age, sex, weight and stature were evaluated to test the relationship morphometric correlation between real weight ant body mass estimated from stature and bi-iliac (maximum pelvic) breadth and femoral head breadth. Maximum pelvic breadth, anteroposterior femoral head breadth and adipose tissue thickness at the abdomen were measured directly from appropriate CT scan slices for each individual. Body mass index was establish for each individual. For the stature/bi-iliac technique, a revised equation was used (Ruff at al., 2005). Three equations based on femoral head breadth were used (Ruff et al., 1991, McHenry, 1992 and Grine et al., 1995).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Body mass prediction methods based on bi-iliac breadth with known stature and the femoral head breadth show strong correspondence. The results of body mass estimation using different methods were in high correlation with normal (healthy weight) BMI.

The accuracy of body mass prediction of underweight and obesity cases (BMI extremes ) showed significant inaccuracy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The equations for estimating body mass from stature and bi-iliac breadth, seem to do quite well in predicting body mass in modern Polish population. In forensic investigations involving unidentified skeletal remains, when bi-iliac breadth can be measured and stature estimated, the stature/bi-iliac technique should be use first of all.</p><p><bold>PP-179</bold></p><p><bold>New Methodologies and Protocols of Forensic Identification by Craniofacial Superimposition</bold></p><p>Sónia Codinha<sup>1</sup>, Sérgio Damas<sup>3</sup>, <underline>Eugénia Cunha</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CENCIFOR- Forensic Sciences Centre, South Delegation of the National Legal Medicine Institute, Lisbon, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Portugal; CENCIFOR-Forensic Sciences Centre, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>European Centre for Soft Computing, Mieres, Spain</p><p>One of the most important objectives of forensic anthropology is the determination of a victim’s identity, a process that always requires a suspect in order to compare ante and post mortem data. Unfortunately, often ante mortem records are unavailable and DNA may be impossible in circumstances where, for example, there aren’t known relatives of the supposed victim. Moreover, there are situations where many individuals share the same biological profile (mass disasters; mass graves) a condition that clearly complicates the identification process. In these situations the Craniofacial Superimposition technique (a forensic identification process where photographs of a suspected victim are superimposed over an unidentified skull in order to establish whether they belong to the same person) has been successfully applied to exclude or establish identity. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that instead of following a uniform methodology, forensic experts tend to apply their own approach to the problem based on the available technology and their knowledge and expertise. Having this in mind, in order to establish specific forensic protocols for the application of CS to different scenarios the new methodologies and protocols of forensic identification by craniofacial superimposition (MEPROCS) project aims to propose a common EU framework to allow the extensive application of the CS technique in practical forensic identification scenarios commonly tackled by the European scientific police units and promote the validation and exchange of CS protocols and methodologies among different European organisations (EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR SOFT COMPUTING - Spain; CONSORZIO DI RICERCA SISTEMI AD AGENTI - Italy; EUROPEAN COUNCIL OF LEGAL MEDICINE - Germany; UNIVERSITY OF GRANADA- Spain; MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY- ISRAEL; FORENSIC SCIENCES CENTRE- UNIVERSITY OF COIMBRA-PORTUGAL; MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR- Spain).</p><p>The objectives of this project concern the 1) definition of standard protocols for the application of CS to different forensic scenarios; the2) Specification of objective and automatic validation techniques for the CS identification results; the 3) Simplification of the defined CS processes to promote their extensive application; and 4) the dissemination of the results. The MEPROCS project aims to propose a EU framework and methodology for forensic science to provide an objective evaluation of the forensic identification results achieved by CS.</p><p><bold>PP-180</bold></p><p><bold>Clavicle Superimposition for Human Identification: Quantification of Perspective-Effects Induced by a 'Point' Source of X-Rays</bold></p><p>Carl Stephan, <underline>Pierre Guyomarch</underline></p><p>Joint Pow/Mia Accounting Command, Central Identification Laboratory, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, USA</p><p>In forensic anthropology, the comparison of ante- and postmortem (AM &amp; PM) radiographs is routine for human identification. The clavicle lends itself to these comparisons because: it is routinely captured on chest radiographs (= the most frequently recorded clinical x-ray); resists field degradation; and possesses large variance in shape. Radiographic comparison of the clavicles is, however, complicated by perspective of the osseous element relative to a single (and fixed) ‘point’ source of x-rays. Source-to-image-receptor distance (SID), bone-to-image-receptor distance (BID) and position of the osseous element on the image receptor all potentially influence the shape of the clavicle that is recorded on the radiograph. This study aims to quantify the change in clavicle shape that occurs with manipulation of each of these variables, and to evaluate their impact on the superimposition process.</p><p>Twenty right clavicles were radiographed with three different SIDs, three different BIDs, and four different clavicle positions on the image receptor. A total of 36 images were thus obtained for each clavicle. Geometric morphometric methods were used to record the outline shapes of the clavicles using four type II and ninety-six type III (equidistant) landmarks, and deformation grids were computed between the mean shapes using thin-plate-splines (TPS). Linear distances on the radiographs were also recorded and superimpositions of the radiographs conducted.</p><p>The deformation grids reveal significant variations in shape of the clavicles between the different conditions evaluated. Shorter SIDs and larger BIDs increased the size of the osseous shadow, as recorded on the radiograph, and movement of the clavicle - from the center of the image receptor to its lateral edge - decreased the visibility of the conoid tubercle and exaggerated the clavicle’s sigmoid bend. Linear measurements of the radiographs mirrored these changes.</p><p>Superimpositions of ante- and postmortem radiographs of the exact same clavicle are not possible if the perspective of the bone relative to the x-ray source on the AM image is not replicated at PM radiography. An understanding of perspective-induced shape change is crucial for superimposition techniques if the AM morphology is to be quickly and efficiently replicated at PM radiography. Quantified modeling of these shape changes may prove useful for automated searching of AM chest radiograph libraries using 3D laser scans of clavicles.</p><p><bold>PP-181</bold></p><p><bold>Quantifying Thermal Damage on Bone with the Aid of Novel FTIR Absorption Peaks</bold></p><p><underline>Sarah Ellingham</underline>, Tim Thompson, Meez Islam, Gillian Taylor</p><p>School of Science and Engineering, Teesside University, Middlesbrough, England</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> To a forensic anthropologist, bone has the potential to reveal insightful information about an individual’s life and death. Professionals of multiple disciplines have an interest in comprehending the changes undergone by bone subjected to thermal damage; be it archaeologists wishing to understand ancient burial practises or forensic professionals tasked with the reconstruction of an accident or crime scene. Conventionally, the Crystallinity Index (CI), which is defined by the splitting of the two absorption peaks at 605 and 565 cm-1 when using spectroscopy as a means of analysis, has been utilized to gain an understanding of the degree of heat exposure undergone by the bone; bone which has been heated exhibits larger hydroxyl apatite crystals, forming a more ordered structure. This present study is investigating the use of new absorption peaks in order to determine the burning time and temperature of bones more accurately. These ratios are CO/P with FTIR absorption peaks ratio of A1650/A1035, C/P = A1415/1035, CO/CO3 = A1650/A1415, CO3/P = A900/A1035 and the Phosphate High Temperature (PHT) which is calculated A625/A610.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Research was carried out using long bones from domestic sheep (ovis aries) which were experimentally burned in a furnace for 45 minutes at temperatures between 100°C and 1100°C in 100°C increments. Samples of the periosteal surface of the diaphysis of each bone were collected and analysed using the Nicolet 5700 FTIR-ATR, which exhibits the optical range of 30 000 cm-1 to 200 cm-1. The spectra are used to calculate the CI as well as the new ratios: C/P, CO/CO3, CO/P, CO/CO3, CO3/P and the PHT as well as the line width, which is defined as the full width at half the maximum of the phosphate peak at 1035 cm-1.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Analysis of variance, principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were carried out on the data; blind tests utilizing these new absorption peak ratios found the rate of accurate temperature prediction using a combination of the newly calculated indexes to be 96.3 %.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Research at Teesside University has shown that the indexes mentioned above can predict burning temperatures accurately in over 95 % of the experimentally burned samples, which is a significant increase in accuracy compared to the 66.7 % obtained when only the CI was used.

The age of the victim has a crucial role for ascertaining the crime of juvenile pornography, but methods of aging which use the assessment of sexual characteristics have proven to be too subjective and deceiving for age estimation. The application of facial landmarks may bring about relevant advantages for the analysis of 2D images by measuring the distances and extracting quantitative indices. This study aims at evaluating the modification of facial indices with age on pictures.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The experimental project includes two phases: during the first one 2046 photos in frontal view and 2043 in lateral view were taken from Caucasoid subjects aged between 3 and 32 years without relevant pathologies and facial deformities. The photos underwent analysis with Mathworks Matlab, via the collocation of 22 landmarks on faces taken in the frontal view and 11 in the lateral view. The inter- and intra-observer error in definition of each landmark was also evaluated. In the second phase 18 anthropometrical indices for the frontal view and 5 for the lateral view were calculated by distances between different landmarks; the correlation with age was evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Both in the frontal and lateral view the landmarks which showed less dispersion were the pupil (pu), cheilion (ch), endocanthion (en) and stomion (st); the landmarks with the highest dispersion were gonion (go), zygion (zy), frontotemporale (fr), tragion (t) and selion (se). In the lateral view the landmarks with the least dispersion were selion (se), pronasale (prn), subnasale (sn) and stomion (st), whereas landmarks with the highest dispersion were gnathion (gn), pogonion (pg) and tragion (t). Indices showing a possible correlation with age were ch-ch/ex-ex, ch-ch/pu-pu, ch-ch/ft-ft, en-en/ch-ch and se-sto/ex-ex in the frontal view, se-prn/se-sn, se-prn/se-sto and se-sn/se-sto in the lateral view. As concerns correlation of the indices with age, though with some error, ch-ch/ex-ex, ch-ch/pu-pu and se-sto/ex-ex do seem to relate with age even on photographs.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> results show that anthropometric studies on 2D images must be preceded by the assessment of the reliability of the positioning of facial landmarks in order to avoid gross errors.

While dealing with skeletal remains, forensic anthropologists frequently examine evidence that is fractured, deformed or otherwise altered by a variety of peri mortem or post mortem factors. Consequently, it is often required to restore the original bone integrity to a degree that would allow a proper anthropological examination, personal identification included. Traditionally, a layer of synthetic material (glue or resin) is applied between fragments in order to assemble bones permanently or temporarily. Virtual 3D reconstitutions offer a helpful assistance for the task as they are non-invasive, contactless and allow creating as many possible scenarios of a given situation as wished.</p><p>As it is up to professionals to balance advanced, but costly and time-consuming techniques with traditional ones, they must be aware of all benefits and costs. The contribution will present a critical review of the virtual 3D restoration approach based on a forensic case involving 3 victims found in a deep mass grave in a poor state of preservation with heavily fragmented skulls. The presumed peri mortem cranial injuries had been altered by a severe post mortem destruction and decomposition. As the traditional restoration approach was impossible to carry out 3D virtual approach was employed in order to state the cause of death and its mechanisms. In the process, all fragments were scanned with a laser scanner, assembled using 3D modeling programs and further adjusted with a virtual clay tool modeling program. The final virtual 3D reconstituted skulls enabled to identify gunshot injuries on all three victims and distinguish mechanisms of observed damage.</p><p><bold>PP-184</bold></p><p><bold>Age estimation by rib-phase analysis in Indian females</bold></p><p><underline>Prashantha Bhagavath</underline><sup>1</sup>, Francis Np Monteiro<sup>2</sup>, Pradeep G Kumar<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, India</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, AJ Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalore, India</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Currently there are different parameters available to determine the age of a person like study of teeth, ossification of bones and other ancillary data, but the reliability of these measures is only limited to a particular age group i.e. less than 25 years. The Iscan’s phase method for the estimation of adult age at death from the sternal extremity of the fourth rib was introduced in 1985. Over the years, numerous tests have confirmed the reliability of this technique on varied samples in different age groups.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To determine the age of the individual at time of death using rib phase analysis in Indian male population.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> 205 samples of sternal ends of the right fourth ribs belonging to Indian female population with known age at the time of death.

Variation as measured by the standard deviation increased from phase 5. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the rib phase standards can be accurately applied to Indian females. Investigations of this nature are vital because one cannot assume that a method developed from one group is applicable to a distant population, especially in medico-legal proceedings.</p><p><bold>PP-185</bold></p><p><bold>A forensic anthropology study of a mass grave belonging to world war one</bold></p><p>Daniel Gaudio<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Matteo Morelli</underline><sup>3</sup>, Andrea Betto<sup>4</sup>, Andrea Galassi<sup>2</sup>, Agostino Rizzi<sup>5</sup>, Cristina Cattaneo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Labanof, Laboratorio di Antropologia e Odontologia Forense Sezione di Medicina Legale e delle Assicurazioni DMU – Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana e Scienze Biomediche.

Although the finding of skeletal remains belonging to World War One is not such a rare phenomenon on the mountainous areas which had been involved in the First Conflict, it is rather exceptional, on these mountains, to find a mass grave with soldiers in primary burials.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The skeletons were recovered using archaeological methods. Moreover the grave was scanned with a 3D Laser Scanner. The biological profile was defined by sexing, aging, stature and ancestry determination according to standard anthropological methods. Pathologies and stress markers were evaluated; an extensive study was conducted on skeletal trauma in order to establish the type of trauma and ammunition involved.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Except for one case the skeletal remains were in anatomical connection and in primary burials. Four soldiers lied prone, two subjects were lying on their side. Only two soldiers had personal effects: one had a badge concerning military vaccinations, the other had religious medals. By the remains of the uniforms it was deduced that all individuals belonged to the Italian army. The anthropological study revealed the presence of seven male subjects, of ages included between 18 and 35 years. The soldiers showed diseases of a degenerative type, occupational stress (enthesopathies) and, in one case, metabolic stress (cribra orbitalia and cribra cranii). The study of injuries revealed a surprising variety of types of lesions, mostly lethal: a few subjects were struck by a Shrapnell grenade, one soldier was certainly torn apart by a grenade explosion. Two soldiers showed handgun shots (9 mm) to the skull. On the basis of the location of entry and exit wounds and the direction/angle of the shots it is plausible that these were executions. Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive Xray Spectrometry allowed us to detect metal residues related to Shrapnell and grenades.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The study carried out on this rare case of a mass grave belonging to World War One, allowed for the recovery of a piece of buried History; from a forensic point of view it allowed for the observation of several kinds of perimortem injuries caused by different WWI weapons.</p><p><bold>PP-186</bold></p><p><bold>Estimation of Stature From Hand And Handprint Measurements in Anatolian Girls: A Preliminary Study</bold></p><p><underline>Erhan Buken</underline><sup>1</sup>, Can Pelin<sup>1</sup>, Bora Buken<sup>2</sup>, Ayla Kürkçüoğlu<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Baskent University</p><p><sup>2</sup>Düzce University</p><p>Estimation of adult height from long bones plays an important role in forensic examinations. In modern forensic anthropology the investigator not only interests in skeletal remains. Percutaneous body measurements are also known to give reliable results.</p><p>In the present study the relationship between various dimensions of hands and body height were evaluated for the Anatolian population. Besides the measurements from hands and handprints were also evaluated related with stature since hand prints were easily left in crime scene. The purpose of this study was to analyze anthropometric relationships between dimensions of the hand, handprint and body height. In this preliminary study the correlation of stature and various measurements of hands have shown along with the multiplication factors used to estimate the stature from these relationships between specific measurements and stature.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> The study consists of a sample of 85 female university students from several parts of Turkey, but living in Ankara at the time of the study. The mean age of the sample was 21.40 ± 3.22. The images of the right and left hands were acquired by using a flat bed scanner. The seven measurements on each hand were acquired with a sliding caliper respectively. Correlation analysis and linear, multiple regression equations for stature estimation were calculated using the aforementioned variables and multiplication factors were computed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean stature and mean length of the left and right were 1634.83 (S.D. 57,21) mm, 174.65 (S.D. 7.35) mm, 174.40 (S.D. 7.47) mm. Correlation coefficients between stature and all the measurements were found to be positive and statistically significant. The highest correlation was observed between right hand length and stature (0,607; p &lt; 0.01). Prediction of stature was found to be most accurate by linear regression analysis.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This finding indicates that the hand length provides the moderate reliability and accuracy in estimating stature of an unknown female. In forensic field measurements from hand could also be used for the estimation of stature. It may consider differences between populations to apply such functions to other populations. The comparisons made with other population could contribute to understanding of the relative status of our population in the context of the anthropometric variations around the world.</p><p><bold>PP-187</bold></p><p><bold>Facial Reconstructions on Two Historical Skulls</bold></p><p><underline>Ahmet Sadi Çağdır</underline><sup>1</sup>, Fatma Nur Konukman<sup>2</sup>, Hüseyin Afşin<sup>1</sup>, Sevim Başer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ministry of the Interior, Ankara</p><p>Facial reconstruction is not only used for forensic cases, it is also useful at some historical cases. There have been many studies on the historical skulls. These studies have been practiced on famous people’s skulls or unidentified people’s skulls. Similar studies were practiced in Forensic Medicine Institution Laboratory. The two cases which will be presented here are unusual because of their reconstruction being done at the excavation site.</p><p><bold>Cases:</bold> Metropolis is an ancient city which was built on today’s Smyrna’s Torbalı county 5000 years ago. There has been an excavation since 1992. Since then, many human bones have been retrieved from the excavation site. Dr Çağdır carried out investigations on the human bones and performed two facial reconstructions at the excavation site in the summer months of 2008 and 2009. In 2008, a facial reconstruction was performed on a 30–35 years old Roman’s shattered skull. Also in 2009, a 20–25 years old woman’s skull had a facial reconstruction whose body was retrieved from a grave. Thanks to the fact that woman’s whole skeleton was retrieved, all of her bones could be studied. Busts which were built on these two different skulls were prepared to be presented.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the field of Forensic Sciences, multi-disciplinary working has an important value. It is important to determine the age of the studied bones which are retrieved from the excavations. This is the reason why it is important for Forensic Medicine experts to gain experience on the excavation sites. Facial Reconstruction is an application which helps to the identification of missing people.

Some species are characterized by reaching the corpses in initial stages of decomposition (primary colonizers); others, by contrast, have a great interest as component of the faunal succession in corpses in advanced stage of decomposition. Despite the undeniable interest of these insects, very little is known of their biology. In this work, we analyze the occurrence of this genus during judiciary autopsies performed in Granada (SE Iberian Peninsula) in order to assess their interest as forensic indicators.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Autopsies were performed according to the guidelines of the European legislation and the sampling of entomological evidences was fitted to the standards of the European Association for Forensic Entomology (EAFE). Those immature stages that could not be identified through larval morphology were reared under controlled conditions in a breeding chamber at constant temperature and humidity with liver of pig ad libitum. Only adult males were identified directly after dissection of their genitalia, one of the most important morphological features when it´s necessary to discriminate species in this family. Some females, which retained larvae in the abdomen, were fed up to larviposition and, from the resulting adult males after breeding, an indirect identification could be performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> in all forensic cases that occurred in the period 2010–2011, Sarcophaga genus have been sampled in 45 % of the cases where some kind of entomological evidence was recovered. Sarcophaga (Bercaea) africa (Wiedemann, 1824) and Sarcophaga (Liopygia) argyrostoma (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830) were the two most common species. The first was sampled in 32 % of the cases, the second in 43 %. The remaining 25 % was distributed equally among S. (Sarcophaga) carnaria (Linnaeus, 1758), S. (Liosarcophaga) jacobsoni, S. (Sarcophaga) subvicina Rohdendorf, 1937 and cases where we couldn´t manage a satisfactory identification of Sarcophaga larvae or pupae, given the lack of bibliography about preimaginal instars of this family and difficult conditions of rearing. On the corpse, we could only find larvae of S. africa, S. argyrostoma and S. jacobsoni.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> the proven occurrence of the genus Sarcophaga shows that certain species of little-known biology may occur in cases of legal interest. The need of answers to their finding in a human corpse implies the obligation of carrying out more research on the genus Sarcophaga and, in particular, on these species.</p><p><bold>PP-193</bold></p><p><bold>Successional patterns of sarcosaprophagous insects on pig carcasses in Granada (Southeast Iberian Peninsula)</bold></p><p><underline>Alejandro González Medina</underline>, José De La Higuera Hidalgo, Gilberto Jiménez Ríos</p><p>Instituto de Medicina Legal de Granada, Granada (Spain)</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Forensic entomology is the scientific discipline that uses knowledge about the life cycles and the dynamics of arthropod populations to clarify circumstances related to cases which will be considered in a Court of Law. The two main strategies used to deal with the problem are the study of larval development (for corpses in the early stages of decomposition) and the comparison of fauna found in the body with typical patterns of faunal succession of the habitat where the corpse has been found (for more advanced stages of decomposition). In this study, we describe the successional models for the seasons in which Forensic Entomology cases are more usual in Andalusia (Southern Iberian Peninsula): summer and fall.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The study was conducted during summer 2011 (1 August - 26 August) and autumn 2011 (29 September – 24 October) in two agricultural biotopes consisting of vacant lots without any vegetal cover, arid soil and enclosed with a fence. Two domestic piglets, Sus domesticus L., of of 19 to 22 Kg weight were killed per season by penetrative captive bolt and disposed in the sampling sites within the next 2 hours. In order to avoid incomplete and biased successional inventories, we used a cubical trap based in the same functional principle of Schoenly, with a lower removable sandbox with pitfall traps to ensure the sampling of “walking scavengers”. Statistically, we only included in our model indicator species according to the IndVal method (IndVal index &gt; 25).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 11507 individuals of the order Diptera, belonging to 17 families, were sampled. Coleoptera were represented by a total abundance of 1092 specimens agrupated in 12 families. Many families were discarded in the statistical analysis. Significant differences in the faunal composition between both seasons have been observed. Species found in both sampling periods showed differential behavior in their appareance and residence periods, perhaps because of the drop in temperatures in the fall.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These differences allow us to conclude that successional studies covering the entire annual climate spectra are necessary to avoid incorrect inferences. Similarly, a larger number of biogeographical regions within our peninsula must be covered with these studies with the aim of knowing the variations due to local fauna.</p><p><bold>PP-194</bold></p><p><bold>Edaphic fauna and buried corpses: arthropods found in coffins during exhumations in Granada (Spain)</bold></p><p><underline>Alejandro González Medina</underline><sup>1</sup>, Lucas González Herrera<sup>2</sup>, Gilberto Jiménez Ríos<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Instituto de Medicina Legal de Granada, Granada (Spain)</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Toxicology and Physical Anthropology; Faculty of Medicine of Granada (Spain)</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Mateo Orfila and Pierre Mégnin were the first researchers that exploited exhumations to summarize the fauna associated with corpses. While Orfila simply enumerated the species he found, Mégnin laid the cornerstone for the forensic entomology when he grouped species in eight waves called "workers of the death". Since then, many studies were performed but very few dealt again with the problem of buried corpses and the information that exhumations can provide. In October 2008, a series of restoration works began at the San José graveyard (Granada, Spain). In order to move to an ossuary those corpses which were not claimed within a period of one year, 20 non-judiciary exhumations were performed. We focused our sampling on mites (Acari: Oribatida, Prostigmata and Mesostigmata) and Collembola. We wanted to test if there were differences among the faunistic composition of burials with different Post-burial Intervals (PBI).</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Sampling of mites and collembola was conducted in three stages. First of all, we took dust samples with a manual vacuum above and below the body, taking special care on the bottom and corners of the coffins. Second, we removed manually pieces of soil that penetrated through the chinks of wood. Finally, we inspected again the corpses and coffins once removed the corpse and running arthropods were captured with the help of a brush soaked in saline solution. Dust collected by manual vacuuming was processed by a flotation method in a sodium chloride saturated solution (Arlian method modified by Solarz). Soil found in the tombs were sampled with the help of Tullgren funnels using ethylene glycol as preservative liquid.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In a preliminary analysis, we grouped the fauna of each group (oribatid, mesostigmatid, prostigmatid mites and collembola) in 17 morphotypes, without identification purposes at first. Subsequently, we were able to observe an association between the occurrence of certain species and PBI, given the significative differences observed in the faunistic diversity of each group of exhumations. The biggest differences could be appreciated in the range of 5–10 years PBI, while certain stability was found in the first 1–5 years.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Given that we have observed significantive differences among groups, we can assert that the edaphic fauna can be used apart from the classic forensic markers (Diptera and Coleoptera) in the assesment of the postmortem interval, when burial is close to the time of the death.</p><p><bold>PP-195</bold></p><p><bold>A Mistake In Entomological Investigations Into Drowning Case In Water A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Hülya Aksoy Aydınlı</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mesut Eryürük<sup>2</sup>, Hakan Toka<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Osmangazi University, Science Faculty, Department of Biology, Eskişehir</p><p><sup>2</sup>Osmangazi University, Department of Forensic Medicine, Eskişehir</p><p><bold>Purpose:</bold> An investigation of structures like white insect eggs found on a drowning case in water, determination of whether they have got an entomological value.</p><p>In forensic science, the field refers to Forensic Entomological, which examines of information obtained from entomological evidence in solving of case.

The corpse was taken into the Osmangazi University forensic medicine institute. The experts observed white foreign matters locating around eyes and in nose, ear and mouth. These white foreign matters were like to insect eggs packets and were asked to make an entomological assessment. Since the season was winter and the temperature was below zero, the data which were thought to be entomological were supposed very amazing and important because insects don’t bring their eggs in winter. In addition, it is important to reach data about how the case occurred owing to find terrestrial insect eggs on a corpse taken out water. But it was understood that white matters mass was not insect eggs but styropor particle in consequence of making entomological analyses.</p><p><bold>Discussion and conclusion:</bold> Insects provide important biological data to enlighten forensic case. In this case, the entomological data which was found on corpse being take out water gave rise to thought that the person was killed before to throw, then waited a little time and then thrown to water. As a result of making investigation by entomologist, it was seen that the data did not have an entomological value. Forensic entomology institute was a field to improve in Turkey.

By using this apparatus, we collected approximately one gram house dust by vacuuming from the bedroom and surrounding of each house on two meters square surface at least five minutes. Saturated saltwater was added on dusts in beakers as it would not pour forth dusts, mixed and floated. House dust mixture obtained from the surface of beaker by using lamella were analyzed under microscope; after description and types of mites found out were determined, they were collected into eppendorph tubes including ethyl alcohol by means of sterilized needle tip.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> Mites were determined in 59 of 60 house researched as a result of analysis of house dusts. Determined mites were 3 kinds, 6 families, 5 races and 2 types which different from each other taxonomically. In 53 of house dusts in which mites were determined, at least of one of kind, family, race and type of mites were fixed. Dermatophagoides mites were found as the most dominating group in house dusts.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> In criminological sciences, it is remarkable biological evidence that microscopic HDMs feeding on human skin epithelial is available almost in every house. We are of the opinion that it would not be wrong to say that it shall become important with researches to be performed if these microscopic mites carry human evidences by analyzing in detail.</p><p><bold>PP-199</bold></p><p><bold>Microscopy at the crime scene: the benefit of new digital devices applied on forensic entomology</bold></p><p><underline>Karl Heinz Schiwy Bochat</underline>, Kristina Baumjohann, Markus Rothschild</p><p>Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Cologne, Germany</p><p>The knowledge of which fly settles on a corpse and under which condition (outdoor vs. indoor, soiled vs. unsoiled) can give early important hints in forensic investigations. Forensic entomology mostly deals with larvae of calliphorid flies which prefer to deposit their eggs on corpses and, in Europe, colonize the body first. However, another group of flies (family Muscidae) is often present on the corpse yet often overlooked. Muscid flies are usually coprophiles, i.e. they are attracted by feces, urine and associated bacteria. Muscid flies are, therefore, an indicator for unsanitary conditions, including severely stained clothing and shoes, and for neglect. On corpses, they are usually found in later stages of decay. Muscid larvae can also infest wounds in living humans or animals, which means they may be observed in myiasis cases.</p><p>The muscid genus Hydrotaea is not thoroughly researched and described in forensic entomological literature. Hydrotaea flies are often overlooked because of their size. Their second and third instar larvae predate larvae of flies of other species, some are carnivorous in all developmental stages.

For example, muscid and fanniid flies, in contrast to calliphorids, lack hypopleural bristles.</p><p>Three case studies show the importance of early identification of the flies and the benefit of a digital microscopy for early identification. For its large depth of field the zoom lens provides a “natural” view and the high quality images can directly be stored on the integrated hard-disk-drive.

Although insects are terrestrial animals as a rule, there are lots of species that adapted all bio types; corpses are important food sources for insects. Insects play an important role in solving legal cases in addition to their ecological importance.</p><p>Insects feed, live or breed in and on bodies, depending on the stage of decomposition.</p><p>Over the death of days, weeks or even months after the time of the death of a corpse, insects are often the most important indicator in determining time of death. One of method for determining time of death by using insects is determination the age and development phase of maggots that come to bodies after death. Another method is based on analysis of succession of arthropods on, in or around bodies.</p><p>To use all this information, the biology of insects must be known very well. Our goal is to contribute the time of death for the suspicious deaths by using entomological evidences.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> The study includes 113 forensic autopsy cases referred to our institution for determination of cause of death and the postmortem interval between the years 2006 and 2011.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Insects were belong to Diptera and Coleoptera; most common species of flies fed on bodies were Calliphora vicina, Calliphora vomitoria, and Chrysomya albiceps. Among these cases we managed to calculate the time of death in about 85 %, but not in about 15 % (due to improper sample collection, transfer and storage, and deficiencies and/or inaccuracies information).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study, we discussed the methodology for using the insects for determining time of death; in order to contribute to determination of the exact PMI and we also focused the need of standardization in the procedures of this discipline in Turkey.</p><p><bold><underline>FORENSIC IMAGING</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-201</bold></p><p><bold>Case report: Observation of altering intra-abdominal hemorrhage through CT imagining with time</bold></p><p><underline>Hiroshi Ikegaya</underline>, Noboru Ishikawa, Stuart Mclean, Daisuke Miyamori</p><p>Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recently, Computed Tomography (CT) is often reported as an effective tool for postmortem diagnosis. However, reports of the utilization of postmortem images to establish postmortem changes are limited.</p><p><bold>Case presentation:</bold> A drunk 66 year old male was ran over by a taxi at 01:28 after falling asleep on the road. While being immediately transferred to hospital the man lost consciousness and fell into a cardiopulmonary arrest. Despite resuscitation he died. CT images were taken at 02:30. Following this, CT images were re-taken 54 hours after death before a medicolegal autopsy.</p><p><bold>Result &amp; discussion:</bold> In this case, small amounts of intra-abdominal hemorrhaging was visible in the immediatatly taken CT images. However, the extent of intra-abdominal bleeding observed through CT images 54 hours later was greatly increased. During the autopsy, 1700 mL of intra-abdominal hemorrhage was observed. In addition, mesentery, liver and pancreas injuries were observed. Futher injuries were found during the autopsy included, multiple rib fractures, skin abrasions and lacerations of the head, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pelvic fracture, and right humerus fracture. The deceased's postmortem blood alcohol level was 2.4 mg/mL. A hemorrhagic shock due to the systemic injuries was determined as the cause of death.</p><p>The amount of intra-abdominal bleeding found during autopsies may differ from that found at the time of death. As a result, the criteria for the diagnosis of the cause of death in autopsies should be carefully reconsidered, because if autopsies are performed immediately after death, bleeing sufficient to diagnose exsanguination may not be present. Alternatively, the commonly believed extent of bleeding necessary to cause death by exsanguination may need to be revised.</p><p>In addition, it is recommended that cause of death is not exclusively determined through CT images and where this is the case CT images are taken over a period of time.</p><p><bold>PP-202</bold></p><p><bold>Camera Identification for collections of images and video with Photo Response Non Uniformity</bold></p><p><underline>Zeno J Geradts</underline>, Wiger Van Houten</p><p>Netherlands Forensic Institute</p><p>A digital (video-) camera consists of many electronic components. After the image has been formed on the image sensor, the image information will pass through all of the components before the final data file is written to flash memory. Each step in this process may add random noise to the image. Even during the image formation process itself, a noise-like pattern from the sensor may be introduced in the image. This noise-like pattern is a small but measurable systematic contribution to the signal, and is called the Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU) pattern. The visibility of this signal is limited and may be a small difference depending on the intensity of the signal. In practice, this means that well illuminated images will result in a better extraction of this signal compared to when the image is dark.</p><p>The PRNU pattern itself can be determined from the image and it preferably is done with images with no discernible textures (flat field image, for example from a grey surface). The examining of the PRNU pattern for forensic use is well researched by Jessica Fridrich and others.</p><p>In practice, it is not always possible to have the camera for casework; however, it is possible to determine if a set of images have been made with the same camera or different cameras based on the PRNU pattern. By comparing the pattern from a questioned image with the pattern from a set of reference images made with a suspect camera, it can be determined whether the questioned image was produced with the suspect camera or not. This works when the image is authentic, but fails when the image underwent any spatial transformations (e.g., rotation, shearing, resizing) because the “fingerprint” is desynchronized, unless the same transformations are applied to the reference material. It is also possible to alter the image such that the PRNU pattern is filtered out, although this is complicated and time consuming.</p><p>The use of large image or video databases, such as child pornography and other databases of relevant images will require significant processing power. For a good comparison, it is important to have the most original images, or to know exactly what kind of operations have been conducted on the image. Since in casework the ground truth may not be known, conclusions in Bayesian framwork.</p><p><bold>PP-203</bold></p><p><bold>Brain death confirmation by Cerebral Perfusion Scintigraphy.

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of this imaging technique in skeletal trauma, comparing CT findings with autopsy results.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Reports of the autopsies made in the unit in 2011 were reviewed (n = 339). A post-mortem CT was made previous to 39 autopsies involving polytraumas. Among them, 29 skeletal traumas were objectivated. In each case, a parallel was made between radiological and autopsy data, paying particular attention to the description of osteoarticular lesions, that were classified according to the topography of skeletal damage (skull, larynx, thorax, rachis, pelvis, upper and lower limbs).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Selected cases included 22 males and 7 females. The mean age at death was 36 and the time elapsed between death and CT could range from a few hours to 5 days. Deaths resulted from road traffic accidents (n = 17), precipitations (n = 8), assault and battery (n = 2) and other causes (n = 2). CT allowed a better description of skull fractures (especially the ones concerning basilar region and calvarial bones) and it was more performant than autopsy in identifying mandibular (10 versus 5) and sinal fractures (17 versus 1). Nevertheless, CT objectivated only one laryngeal fracture whereas 7 were seen at the autopsy (3 interesting the lingual bone and 4 the thyroid cartilage). CT was also more efficient than autopsy in highlightening cervical dislocations (5 versus 1), but both were equivalent in finding cervical fractures, whereas half of fractures of dorsal vertebrae were missed at the autopsy (11/22). CT objectivated more fractures of vertebral processes (102 versus 8) and non-comminuted scapular fractures, and it better described sacroiliac fractures. Moreover, fractures of the extremities of long bones and of hands and feet were better visualised using this imaging technique. Even if there were many differences between both techniques in the description of fractures of the rib cage, the ones interesting the costal posterior arch were better seen at the autopsy.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study demonstrates the usefulness of the post-mortem CT to assess skeletal damage, notably because of its ability to describe more precisely than autopsy craniofacial, rachis, pelvis and long-bone extremities fractures. However, laryngeal and costal posterior arch fractures are better described at the autopsy. Thus the use of the post-mortem CT in skeletal trauma is a precious complementary exam to the autopsy in forensic practice.</p><p><bold>PP-210</bold></p><p><bold>Airplane C-130 J crash in Pisa (Italy), November 23, 2009.

The images were post-processed by 3D and multiplanar reconstruction with Voxar software. Second look after autopsy was performed. MRI could be usefull in identification of oedema associated with bone lesions. In this traumatic scenario, it was not performed because of the absence of survival after crash.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> the MSCT has been usefull to detect the presence of comminuted fractures – that are not viewable at a simple macroscopic examination- and other fractures at sites that are not commonly inspected during autopsy. In one case the MSCT did not detect the presence of a fracture of the orbital rime of the frontal bone in the anterior cranial fossa. In another case, MSCT did not recognize some rib fractures. Second look of the images after autopsy confirmed inability of radiological technique to detect these specific bone fractures.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In light of these results, virtopsy cannot be considered an alternative method to autopsy, that still remain the gold standard in post-mortem examination. As a matter of fact this investigation shows that MSCT has diagnostic limits because it didn’t detect several bone fractures. This restriction can be explained by the fact that TC spatial resolution could not be sufficient to visualize excessively thin fracture lines.</p><p>As far as we are concerned, MSCT is a complementary tool able to offer modern imaging technology to optimize classical autopsy documentation.

Statistics show that child abuse and neglect is rising at an alarming rate. Due to an increase in the number of such cases, the Italian Minister of Health has defined the phenomenon of abuse and violence against minors as a health problem, and not only a social or, safety issue. Such events are complex in nature and require the expertise of various disciplines.</p><p>In order to ascertain if abuse was indeed perpetrated on a minor, careful verification of the facts is required, as well as an objective “legal-medical” examination. The only suitable means for tackling this task is teamwork. One very important resource to consider is the registered nurse, who is often the first health care worker to come into contact with the presumed victim. By spending time with these young patients, it is easier for a forensic nurse to take on the role of “confidant” while at the same time looking out for unusual behaviors, or any signs of physical abuse such as lesions or burns.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The aim of this poster is to examine the contributions of forensic nursing in the evaluation of child abuse and neglect.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Notwithstanding recent institutional laws and regulations put into place that redefine the job descriptions of healthcare providers, nurses in Italy do not have complete decisional autonomy. A nurse’s image is still closely connected to that of the physician. This goes against current Italian ethical and penal code, which lays out the specific roles of healthcare workers with regarding juveniles who are presumed victims of abuse.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Forensic nursing specialized in the verification of child abuse and neglect is well established and considered to be very important in countries such as the United States.

This tissue can be affected by degradation when submitted to thermal, electrical and mechanical insult. However, up to date it is unclear the rate of DNA degradation in teeth along time. The aim of this work was to determine the amount of DNA that could be obtained from teeth stored at different intervals of time under the same environmental conditions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed 60 human teeth stored at room temperature for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 y 18 months.

For the children age assessment, methods based on dental mineralization are widely used and appeared to be more reliable than methods based on other skeletal indicators.</p><p>The aim of this study was to test the validity of three dental age estimation methods.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> The sample comprised 743 children (386 girls and 357 boys) aged between 4 and 15 years (mean age 11.01 ± 2.81 years), and examined between 2004 and 2010 in the South West of France. Dental age was assessed by three different methods (Demirjian and Goldstein 1976; Willems et al. 2010 and Moorrees et al. 1963) based on the evaluation of crown and root mineralization using the seven left mandibular teeth (31 to 37) for the first two methods. The last method uses only isolated teeth (for our study we used the first and second mandibular molars 36 and 37). Dental age was compared to chronological age of the individuals.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using all methods, the dental age are underestimated in the last age category. Demirjian and Goldstein (1976) method provided an overestimation of dental age (mean difference +0.51 ± 0.91 years), whereas Willems et al. (2010) gave a more accurate estimation (mean difference 0.00 ± 0.96 years). For the Moorrees et al. (1963) method, the utilisation of the second mandibular molar (37) was more accurate and reliable than the utilisation of the first mandibular molar (36); however, age assessment were worse than with Demirjian and Goldstein (1976) and Willems et al. (2010) methods. It seems that differences observed in dental age estimation may be explained by the secular changes in recent populations.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Willems et al. (2010) method is reliable and accurate and appears to be suitable for dental age estimation in contemporary French children population. Its main advantage is to be non-gender specific, and its main drawback, as for the Demirjian and Goldstein (1976) method, is the necessity of scoring the seven left mandibular teeth. Moorrees et al. (1963) method is usefull in forensic anthropology and in bioarchaeology, when some teeth are missing. In this case we recommend the use of the second mandibular molar.</p><p><bold>PP-219</bold></p><p><bold>Sexual dimorphism in forensic anthropology: using IMECRAN to improve skull measurements´ precision</bold></p><p><underline>Maria Gabriela Biazevic</underline><sup>1</sup>, Edgard Michel Crosato<sup>1</sup>, Luiz Saavedra Paiva<sup>2</sup>, Thaís Torralbo Lopez<sup>1</sup>, Roberto Bonuzzi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil</p><p><sup>2</sup>Guarulhos´ Forensic Investigations Office, Guarulhos, Brazil</p><p>Sexual dimorphism is observed in human skeletons and its importance for medical and legal purposes is already well established. The skull is one of these parts that can present much information at this regard. In this context, IMECRAN is an invent recently published that was created to improve the precision of anthropometric measures of skulls, allowing that the Frankfurt plane be parallel to the floor, even when the skull is rotated in order to perform other analysis. The objective of the study was to use IMECRAN to carry out 41 anthropometric measures in 63 Brazilian skulls and to verify the sex dimorphism. All the skulls had registrations of sex and they are part of the Guarulhos´ Forensic Investigations collection; human remains that are not asked by their families after 3 years of death become part of the collection. The examiner didn´t have access to the registers. The skulls were put into IMECRAN and, after adequate concordance (kappa), the measurements were performed. T test was used, at 5 % of level of significance. STATA 10.0 was the statistical program used. We studied 33 male and 30 female skulls. Some variables were associated to sex dimorphism: frontal´s length and angle (both p = 0.00), frontal eminences (p = 0.02), supraorbital ridges (p = 0.01), orbit´s areas (p = 0.04, right, and p = 0.05, left), piriform aperture (p = 0.00), all mastoid´s measurements (p = 0.00), occipital´s length and height (p = 0.01, p = 0.04), occipital condyles´ length (p = 0.01, right, p = 0.03, left), foramen magnun´s height and width (both p = 0.00).

It relies on the detailed knowledge of teeth and jaws. Thus, forensic odontology is an interdisciplinary subject that covers dental anatomy, interpretation of radiograms, dental materials, developmental anomalies and others. Although the forensic odontologist as a professional is well known, there is nothing like a specialty in Forensic Odontology in Poland and the most of European countries. Typically, the professionals are DMD or DDS graduates and postgraduates educated and certified in the area of forensic odontology.

The purpose of this study is to apply the Kvaal technique to digital panoramic radiographs (DPRs) and to help assess the potential disagreement mentioned above among earlier researchers. DPRs are collected from patients who visited the Health Ministry, Istanbul Hospital, Osmaniye Dental Unit for therapy on January-June 2009. Digital measurements are taken from a total of 50 males and 50 females at an age range of 15 to 60 years. Indices (P, R and T) reported by Kvaal coworkers which give the length reduction of the pulp of these only P showed statistically significant negative correlation with age (only lateral incisor). All variables (A, B and C) which give the breadth reduction of the pulp also showed statistically significant negative correlation with age for all teeth. These results show that the breadth reduction in the pulp cavity seems more efficient for age estimation in adults. In conclusion, three variables, which give the breadth reduction of the pulp in the Kvaal technique, maybe used for age estimation in adult Turks, only if DPRs have sufficient image quality and taken at the right angle.</p><p><bold>PP-225</bold></p><p><bold>Radiological Age Estimation: Based on Third Molar Mineralization and Eruption in Turkish Children and Young Adults</bold></p><p><underline>Beytullah Karadayi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ahsen Kaya<sup>1</sup>, Melek Ozlem Kolusayın<sup>1</sup>, Sükriye Karadayi<sup>2</sup>, Abdi Ozaslan<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Forensic Medicine Department, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Refik Saydam National Health Agency, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Radiographic evaluation of mineralization and eruption stages of third molars using dental panoramic radiographies can be an efficient tool for chronological age estimation in both forensic sciences and legal medicine. The third molar tooth is utilized for dental age estimation about the age span of 15–23 years because it represents the only tooth still in development. The aim of this study is to obtain and analyze data regarding third molar development and eruption in Turkish population for dental age estimation. A total of 744 dental panoramic radiographies of 394 female and 350 male subjects aged between 8 and 22 years were examined. Third molar development was determined according to Nolla classification system and eruption was assessed relative to the alveolar bone level. Mandibular and maxillary third molars were generally found at similar stages of development on both sides. Nolla stage 6 (completed crown calcification) was reached at around the age of 15 in both maxillary and mandibular third molars in both sexes. Alveolar emergence was at around the age of 16 in males and around age of 17 in females.

The most commonly used techniques for sex determination are based on the assessment of the morphological characteristics of the pelvis and skull. When these elements are recovered in a fragmentary state, teeth can be used as an additional tool for sex determination as they are very durable in comparison with skeletal tissues. Most studies of sexual dimorphism in tooth size are based on the measurement of the mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters. However, these dimensions may be affected by caries, attrition or dental restorations and this does not allow certain measurements to be taken. As a result, alternative dental measurements were developed, that are not affected by these problems, such as root length which is the focus of this study.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> A total of 586 permanent single-rooted teeth in 102 individuals (58 males and 44 females) from the Athens collection were examined.

For crown diameters canines were the most dimorphic teeth followed by first premolars and maxillary second premolar. For root length both maxillary and mandibular second incisors, canines and second premolars as well as the first mandibular premolar present a great degree of sexual dimorphism with the maxillary second incisor to be the most dimorphic tooth followed by the maxillary second premolar and mandibular canine. Among the dimensions studied, root length was the most dimorphic with the measurements of the mesial side to present the higher percentage of sexual dimorphism (%SD: 4.10 %-15.75 %). The least dimorphic dimension was MD diameter (% SD: 1.43 %-6.52 %).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results of the present study suggest that root length is a more reliable and useful tooth dimension than crown diameters and appears to be a promising new method for sex determination.

The present study deals with the analysis and the elaboration of a proposal to modificate the current traffic scale in the bucco-dental field. It pays special attention to the after-effects of the TMD (Temporomandibular Disorder). The carried out study bears witness to the insuffiency of the scale of the current traffic in order to evaluate the dental-stomatological damage and, specially, in order to evaluate the temporomandibular joint. The traffic scale, which is currently valid, does not consider the protrusion, lateral and retrusion movements of the osteoarticular system of the face. Our proposal is to include the protrusion, lateral and retrusionmovements, that we consider as necessary from a functional viewpoint. We give a wye between the points between 1 and 10. We do not find reasonable to assign the same valoration to different dental pieces bearing its different physiological function in mind. Therefore, we consider that the punctuation assigned to canines should be 1.5 punts for incisors; 1 point for molars and 0,5 for premolars.</p><p><bold><underline>FORENSIC PATHOLOGY</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-229</bold></p><p><bold>Dismemberment and mutilation: report of three cases</bold></p><p><underline>Maria Victoria Perez</underline></p><p>Maria Victoria Perez Medico forense y antropologo</p><p><bold>Definicion:</bold> Dismemberment is the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing, the limbs of a living thing</p><p>The literature shows the biggest number of cases in Hamburgo medical examiner office with 31 cases of mutilation and criminal dismemberment.

Postmortem predation by animals is one of the most confounding factors between these changes. Sometimes animal predation can produce postmortem damages that mimic antemortem lesions. Other times they completely distort real antemortem lesions turning them imposible to analyze precisely in the cadaver.</p><p>In the medicolegal literature different animals have been considered postmortal predators: domestic cats and dogs but also some wild big mammals and sea animals. Insects can be predators on the cadaver but also can interfere with other species of cadaveric fauna. Ants are an unusual case between insects as their predation action can start little after death and even many time before putrefaction starts. They also use to avoid other insects to attack dead bodies until they have finished their predation.</p><p>Ants use to bite the skin of the cadaver. The lesions they produce after death can be wide, without vitality signs and with a typical morphology. Injuries have a dry appearance and are usually brown coloured. Sometimes lesions in the skin can be misinterpreted as chemical lesions or abrasions. Bleeding is not exceptional in case of lesion in lower anatomical areas due to hyposthasis. Typical location of lesions are lips, eyelids and knuckles. In case of eyelids injuries, typically eyelashes are also absent.</p><p>We present an unusual case of a massive skin attack of a dead adult male who was attacked after death by a colony of domestics ants.

In recent years, time-dependent degradation of RNA has been gradually applied for determination of PMI with real time PCR universally used in the molecular biology experiments. However, the use of mRNAs were limited resulting from their own shortages, meanwhile, temperature as key factor impacts RNA decay was not profoundly explored ever. Micro RNAs are belong to a family of small non-coding RNAs, which depress and silence mRNAs translating into proteins. Contrary to the traditional mRNAs, the hundreds of them found only have 18-24 bp, thereby they could be more stable; inconsistent primers and aspecific amplification can be also eliminated.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We re-examined and evaluated the degradation of 18 S rRNA, GAPDHmRNA, β-actinmRNA and microRNAs (miRNA-9 of brain, miRNA-21 of kidney and miRNA-203 of skin ) extracted out of three tissues(brain, kidney, skin) of SD mice from 0 to 120 h in three temperature groups(4°C, 15°C and 35°C).

We could find four kinds of histological changes in the heart tissues obtained from hypothermia and coldwater immersion death, that is, 1) The cardiac cells remarkably closed adherence to each other, 2). The number of red or orange colored cardiac cells by HE or Azan stain, respectively, was frequent than that of control. 3). The cardiac cells with severe vacuolar, colliquative myocytolysis, were identified in the papillary and left ventricle muscles. 4) The contraction bands in the cardiac cells were recognized in all section from the septum of the hearts obtained from hypothermic and coldwater immersion death. Although the red or orange colored cardiac cells, vacuolar cardiac cells and contraction band of the cardiac cells were observed in the heart from individuals with other cause of death, the frequency and intensity of the finding was remarkable in hypothermic death, and closely adhered cardiac cells were detected only in the myocardium from hypothermic or coldwater immersion death. To detection these findings Azan staining may be useful than HE stain.

So the aim of this study was to detect postmortem interval by evaluating the distribution of sex steroid receptors (androgen and estrogen) in rat brain and testis by immunohistochemical study. For this purpose 40 male rats were used in this study and were classified into 4 groups each of 10 rats. Groups were examined at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours after death respectively. Regarding brain, the results of the study revealed that Androgen Receptors (AR) immunoreactivity were widely distributed throughout all layers of the cerebral cortex, but the highest numbers of them were found in the large pyramidal cell layer. Cells showing Estrogen Receptors (ER) immunoreactivity were widely distributed throughout all layers of the cerebral cortex, but the highest numbers of them were found in the polemorphic cell layer.</p><p>Both AR and ER immunoreactivity showed marked changes in relation to time interval, the intensity of the immunostaining was reduced noticeably, and the positive cells were decreased in number gradually with time. As regards testis, AR immunoreactivity was very weak immediately and 6 hours after death, and there was no expression in the remaining time intervals.

However, pregnancy-related maternal deaths continue to be a major health concern in developing countries. In the year 2005, an estimated 536,000 women died of maternal causes worldwide of which 86 % occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and less than 1 % in more developed countries. The large regional differences in maternal deaths demonstrate that most of these deaths are preventable. It is nevertheless important to monitor patterns of pregnancy-related mortality and serious morbidity and to be sensitive to what observed patterns or changes may tell us in order to continue to safeguard women during this critical period and the monitoring process must begin with ascertainment of the accuracy of routine reporting of deaths associated with pregnancy and childbirth. We examine the pregnancy-related maternal deaths with a forensic view point.</p><p><bold>PP-247</bold></p><p><bold>Liver cirrhosis as a possible risk factor of injury death: Evaluation of forensic autopsy cases using postmortem biochemistry</bold></p><p><underline>Hitoshi Maeda</underline><sup>1</sup>, Tomomi Michiue<sup>1</sup>, Takaki Ishikawa<sup>1</sup>, Osamu Kawamoto<sup>1</sup>, Jian Hua Chen<sup>1</sup>, Qi Wang<sup>1</sup>, Bao Li Zhu<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Legal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, 545–8585 Osaka, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Pathology, China Medical University School of Forensic Medicine, Shenyang 110001, P.R. China</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Liver cirrhosis can be a risk factor of injury death, predisposing patients to hemorrhage, tissue edema and other organ dysfunction; however, it is difficult to interpret the contribution to the death process based on pathological evidence. The present study investigated forensic autopsy cases of injury death with regard to the influence of preexisting liver cirrhosis on hepatic dysfunction after injury and the survival time using biochemical markers.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Serum albumin (Alb), cholesterol, bilirubin and choline esterase (ChE) in bilateral cardiac blood were measured in forensic autopsy cases of injury death without evident decomposition (n = 361, within 72 h postmortem). Cases included fatalities from sharp instrument injury (n = 61), non-head blunt injury (n = 123), and blunt head injury (n = 177), with/without the complication of liver cirrhosis (n = 85/276). Each injury group was subdivided into subgroups of survival time of &lt;0.5 h, 0.5–12 h, 12 h–2 days and 2–30 days, and cases with and without medical treatment in hospital in each survival time subgroup.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Liver cirrhosis was less frequently involved in fatalities with survival time of &lt;0.5 h (11.7 %) than in longer survival cases (28.8 %). In cases without medical care, serum Alb, cholesterol and ChE levels were slightly lower in those with than without liver cirrhosis in sharp instrument and blunt head injuries; however, non-head blunt injury cases without liver cirrhosis showed a tendency toward a survival time-dependent decrease in serum Alb, cholesterol and ChE. In deaths despite medical care in hospital, these serum markers were usually lower than in cases without medical care in subgroups with survival time of &gt;0.5 h, and were higher in blunt head injury than in other injuries in cases without liver cirrhosis. In non-head blunt injury cases, serum Alb, cholesterol and ChE levels were higher in those with than without liver cirrhosis in deaths with survival time of 0.5–12 h and 2–30 days, but were lower in deaths with survival time of 12 h–2 days. Such findings were not detected in blunt head injury cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These observations suggest that liver cirrhosis can be a risk factor of injury death in subjects who survived the acute phase under medical care in hospital. In non-head blunt injury deaths under intensive medical care in hospital, liver cirrhosis can be a predisposition aggravating hepatic dysfunction during a survival period of 12 h–2 days; however, such influences of liver cirrhosis were different in other cases.</p><p><bold>PP-248</bold></p><p><bold>Postmortem investigation of amino acids in heart blood and pericardial fluid and the Fischer ratio as markers of hepatic dysfunction</bold></p><p><underline>Hitoshi Maeda</underline><sup>1</sup>, Tomomi Michiue<sup>1</sup>, Takaki Ishikawa<sup>1</sup>, Osamu Kawamoto<sup>1</sup>, Jian Hua Chen<sup>1</sup>, Qi Wang<sup>1</sup>, Bao Li Zhu<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Legal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, 545–8585 Osaka, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Pathology, China Medical University School of Forensic Medicine, Shenyang 110001, P.R. China</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Postmortem biochemistry has become a potent ancillary procedure in the forensic investigation of death. Serum free amino acids and the Fischer ratio are clinical markers of metabolic disorders due to inborn errors, inadequate nutrition and liver disease; liver pathology does not always correlate with the function. These markers may also be applied to evaluate hepatic damage as part of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) resulting from severe traumas and diseases. The present study investigated the Fischer ratio of free amino acids in bilateral cardiac blood and pericardial fluid (PCF) in medicolegal autopsy cases, compared with other serum markers of liver function.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Free amino acids in bilateral heart blood and pericardial fluid (PCF) were measured in medicolegal autopsy cases without evident decomposition (n = 184, within 60 h postmortem), and the Fischer ratios of amino acids were estimated. These were compared with serum reference markers, including albumin (Alb), cholesterol, bilirubin and choline esterase (ChE). Cases were classified into: a) advanced liver disease (fatality from liver disease, n = 15), b) other natural deaths with survival time within 2 days (acute illness, n = 18) and c) over 2 days (prolonged illness, n = 21), and d) traumatic deaths with survival time within 2 days (early traumatic death, n = 90), and e) those with survival time over 2 days (delayed traumatic death, n = 40).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were good site-to-site correlations of free tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe), the Fischer ratio and reference markers, although a slight postmortem time-dependent increase was partly detected. Postmortem serum and PCF levels of free Tyr and Phe were markedly higher than clinical reference ranges and were especially high in fatality from advanced liver disease. The Fischer ratio approximated the clinical serum value and was lower in cases of fatality from advanced liver disease, other prolonged illness and delayed traumatic death. Most of these subjects also had low serum Alb, cholesterol and ChE levels, and increased serum bilirubin in some cases; however, low serum Alb, cholesterol and ChE levels were also detected in other cases. In addition, isolated low serum ChE was detected in a case of organic phosphate pesticide intoxication.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These observations suggest that the postmortem serum and PCF Fischer ratio can be used as markers for biochemical evaluation of the severity of hepatic dysfunction due to liver disease, prolonged illness or trauma as the cause of death or contributory disorder, combined with other reference biomarkers, in consideration of hepatic pathology.</p><p><bold>PP-249</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of postmortem serum gamma glutamyl transferase as a marker of hepatobiliary disorder</bold></p><p><underline>Hitoshi Maeda</underline><sup>1</sup>, Tomomi Michiue<sup>1</sup>, Takaki Ishikawa<sup>1</sup>, Osamu Kawamoto<sup>1</sup>, Jian Hua Chen<sup>1</sup>, Qi Wang<sup>1</sup>, Bao Li Zhu<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Legal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, 545–8585 Osaka, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Pathology, China Medical University School of Forensic Medicine, Shenyang 110001, P.R. China</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Postmortem biochemistry has become a potent ancillary procedure in the forensic investigation of death. Serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a routine clinical marker for investigating hepatobiliary disorders and chronic alcohol abuse. Previous studies suggested its application in postmortem diagnosis of alcohol abuse but also an increase due to systemic deterioration following critical traumas and diseases. The present study investigated serum GGT in bilateral cardiac blood in medicolegal autopsy cases, compared with other serum markers of liver function.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Postmortem serum GGT levels in bilateral cardiac blood were measured in medicolegal autopsy cases without evident decomposition (n = 184, within 60 h postmortem), and were compared with serum reference markers, including albumin (Alb), cholesterol, bilirubin and choline esterase (ChE). Cases were classified into: a) advanced liver disease (fatality from liver disease, n = 15), b) other natural deaths with survival time within 2 days (acute illness, n = 18) and c) over 2 days (prolonged illness, n = 21), and d) traumatic deaths with survival time within 2 days (early traumatic death, n = 90), and e) those with survival time over 2 days (delayed traumatic death, n = 40).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were good correlations between bilateral cardiac blood serum levels of GGT and reference markers, although left cardiac serum GGT showed a slight postmortem time-dependent increase. Serum GGT did not show any significant correlation with other markers, and increased GGT level (&gt;300 U/L) was mostly detected in cases of liver cirrhosis/tumor, independent of the cause of death groups, as well as in fatal alcohol abuse. Cases of liver disease had significantly higher right/left cardiac serum GGT than other cases (p &lt; 0.001/p &lt; 0.05); however, lower GGT with hyperbilirubinemia was detected in fatality from advanced liver disease. For reference markers, Alb, cholesterol and ChE were significantly lower but direct and indirect bilirubin were significantly higher in subjects with than without liver disease (p &lt; 0.001–0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Serum GGT was independent of other markers of liver function, showing an increase in cases of liver cirrhosis/tumor and in fatal alcohol abuse, but lower serum GGT with hyperbilirubinemia in fatality from advanced liver disease, suggesting end-stage hepatic failure, as seen in clinical patients. These observations suggest that postmortem serum GGT can be used as a marker for biochemical evaluation of the severity of liver disease as the cause of death or contributory disorder, and of fatal alcohol abuse, combined with other biomarkers of liver function, in consideration of hepatic pathology.</p><p><bold>PP-250</bold></p><p><bold>Suicide by cutting the electrical cable of left ventricular assist device (A case report)</bold></p><p>Eleni Zagelidou<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>2</sup>, Alexandra Enache<sup>3</sup>, Roubini Leodari<sup>4</sup>, Techn:lazaros Papadopoulos<sup>1</sup>, Techn:konstantinos Chalazas<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Lab of Forensic Service, Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p><sup>3</sup>University of Medicine and Pharmacy Victor Babes, Timisoara, Romania</p><p><sup>4</sup>Lab of Forensic Service, Larissa, Greece</p><p>Left ventricular assist device is used as a permanent therapy in patients with severe heart failure that are not candidates for organ replacement.

Mortality is very rare.</p><p><bold>Case report:</bold> We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who died during thoracoscopy. She was admitted to hospital because of a severe thoracic pain. Her medical history revealed obesity and high blood pressure. Apart from anti-hypertensive therapy she was not under any medication. She presented also with dyspnea and fatigue. ECG was negative.</p><p>The day after fever set in with a right-inferior thoracic hypophonesis. A thorax X-ray was performed which showed pleural effusion. TC confirmed abundant pleural effusion with collapse of the nearby lung. To identify the problem a thoracoscopy was attempted.

Only two out of nine retrospective studies reported fatalities with one case each.</p><p>The present case is peculiar because death took place in a few minutes and because the lesions of the lung parenchyma, though iatrogenic in their nature, cannot be the only cause of death. A complex and faster mechanism should be suspected. In vivo experiments reported that mechanical stimulation of the pleura may induce an immediate decrease in both phrenic discharge and arterial blood pressure. Hence in this case, a vasovagal reflex combined with bleeding from the pulmonary perforations might be involved in causing death.</p><p><bold>PP-253</bold></p><p><bold>Fatal non-traumatic intra-peritoneal haemorrhage in portal hypertension: a very rare autopsy diagnosis to be reached with caution</bold></p><p><underline>Christopher Paul Johnson</underline>, Jonathan Medcalf, Mathew Lyall</p><p>Forensic Pathology Unit, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK</p><p>The identification of a large volume fatal haemoperitoneum at medico-legal autopsy, which is unexpected by history, demands a detailed and careful exploration of the abdominal cavity to establish the cause of bleeding. The likely source will depend to a certain extent on the nature of the pathologist's practice. In the hospital setting, post-procedural induced vascular damage or ruptured ectopic pregnancy or tumour, may for example be responsible. In community deaths, or were a history is lacking, it is particularly important to exclude accidental or homicidal trauma to the abdominal contents: tearing to the liver, spleen or mesentery, with or without, surface and soft tissue injury being the key pathology to look for. However, unusual non-traumatic natural causes do occur. Bleeding from intra-abdominal varices have been very rarely well documented at autopsy, and the exact bleeding site is usually not identified. Clinical examples are better defined because the active bleeding guides the surgeon to the source and some patients survive if the haemorrhaging can be dealt with surgically. Varices around the kidney and colon, as well as in the mesentery, retroperitoneum and peri-umbilcal tissues, have been considered to be responsible.</p><p>We present two autopsy cases of unexpected fatal haemoperitoneum in subjects with advanced liver disease and associated portal hypertension, which we ascribe to bleeding from intra-abdominal varices. Both cases demonstrated cirrhosis, splenomegaly, non-bleeding oesophageal varices, focal dilated vascular elements in the mesentery and retroperitoneum, along with large and obvious dilated venous channels in the para - umbilical fat. A non traumatic aetiology was only reached after a thorough police investigation into the circumstances leading up to death and following a meticulous autopsy which failed to reveal any evidence of trauma to the body, including the abdominal wall and contents.</p><p>We recommend that fatal haemoperitoneum due to intra-abdominal (ectopic)varices should be diagnosed rarely and only after the approach described above. Satisfactorily excluding trauma is particularly difficult in alcoholics who form the vast majority of subjects with portal hypertension in medico-legal practice in Europe. These individuals bruise easily, fall and not uncommonly become involved in physical altercations.</p><p>A systematic autopsy protocol including photographic and histological confirmation of all key positive and negative findings is therefore clearly advised.</p><p><bold>PP-254</bold></p><p><bold>Multiple Stabbing In Sex-Related Homicides</bold></p><p><underline>Nemanja Radojevic</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bojana Bjelogrlic<sup>2</sup>, Stojan Petkovic<sup>3</sup>, Miljen Maletin<sup>3</sup>, Ivana Curovic<sup>1</sup>, Dragana Cukic<sup>1</sup>, Miodrag Soc<sup>1</sup>, Slobodan Savic<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Clinical Centre of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Forensic Medicine "Milovan Milovanovic", School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Sexually driven homicides may be a consequence of sexual deviations, but more often the the main cause is the emotional component in a non-paraphilic person.

Changing the criteria for multiple stabbing (&gt; = 4, 5,. or 25 stab wounds), the percentages of sex-related homicides rise in every group. The correlation coefficients between multiple stabbing and sex-related homicides regarding gender are all near 0.9.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies regarding the potential role of BM analysis in understanding the pathophysiological changes in response to systemic stimuli (stress, infections, allergy). The importance of such tissue in clinical practice is well known and routinely used in diagnosing several blood disorders. Other studies have strongly suggested that inflammatory cells originating from the BM contribute to sustain pathophysiological processes, e.g. allergy, sepsis, healing wounds. The authors analysed BM samples for evaluating their cytomorphological and histopathological features in several causes of death.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> BM samples were collected from 70 autopsies performed in the Institute of Legal Medicine of Bari (Italy) and in Charitè University of Berlin (Germany). The causes of death were both natural and traumatic. BM samples were collected from the sternum by needle aspiration and osteomedullary biopsy. Aspirate films were stained with a May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain. Biopsy were decalcified, fixed, and stained with Haematoxylin Eosin staining.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> It was observed that hematopoietic tissue gradually decreased with aging, both in aspirate and biopsy. Few autolytic changes of the BM tissue were found if compared to other organs, even if the cellularity decreased with the increase of post-mortem interval (time elapsing from the death to the sampling). In some cases, the cytomorphological evaluation of BM allowed identifying the presence of activated mast cells and eosinophils, where anaphylaxis was not suspected as primary cause of death; these findings were compared with serum tryptase levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> It is assumed that in the forensic setting the BM sampling of sternum is more suitable than iliac sampling, because sternum is more accessible in routine autopsies without compromising the integrity of corpses. Moreover, the present study shows that the post-mortem analysis of BM can help the forensics in diagnosis of causes of death such as sepsis or anaphylaxis, because that inflammatory cells originating from the BM contribute to sustain these pathophysiological processes, suggesting an involvement of this primary lymphoid organ in several systemic illness.</p><p><bold>PP-260</bold></p><p><bold>Death due to Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia: a case report</bold></p><p>Okan Akan<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Selçuk Çetin</underline><sup>2</sup>, Bülent Eren<sup>1</sup>, Dilek Durak<sup>2</sup>, Nursel Türkmen<sup>2</sup>, Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Bursa Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, Turkey.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Uludag University Medical School, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a myocardial disease that predominantly affects the right ventricle (RV) and one of the important causes of sudden death in the young and athletes. ARVD is characterized morphologically by diffuse or segmental lack of myocardium in the RV free wall, which is replaced by fatty or fibrofatty tissue, and also histologically by fibrofatty degeneration of cardiomyocytes, which leads to electrical instability and contractility abnormalities. The replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by fibrofatty tissue is progressive, starting from the epicardium or midmyocardium and then extending to become transmural process. Although several theories have been proposed and different genetic variants have been described, the accurate aetiopathogenesis of ARVD is still unknown.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We described an autopsy case who was middle-aged man with sudden death due to ARVD.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A 28-year-old man with no significant medical history, applied to emergency department with feeling ill himself. The electrocardiography (ECG) showed ventricular extrasystoles as well as ventricular arrhythmia. After his initial examinations recommended him to apply the cardiology polyclinics for detailed investigation. The next day he was sickened, when had gone to hospital and he was death when arrived the hospital. White foams around the mouth and nostrils, injection marks on the inguinal and antecubital regions and the dorsal part of left hand, signs of defibrillation paddles on the anterior wall of the chest were detected during external examination. The autopsy showed the heart weight was 560 g and it had a dilated appearance. Dissection of right ventricular wall revealed yellowish fat tissue.</p><p>Histologic examination of heart samples, which were obtained from RV and LV, revealed the massive replacement of myocardium by fibrous and mature adipose tissue in right ventericle.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ARVD is a disease of unknown cause, characterized by fibrofatty replacement of the RV myocardium. The diagnosis of ARVD is based on major and minor criteria which include roughly structural, histological, electrocardiographic, arrhythmic and familial features of the disease. ARVD occurs in both sporadic and familial forms. A family history of ARVD is present in 30 % to 50 % of cases. The most common pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, although an autosomal recessive pattern has been reported. ARVD is associated with highly variable clinical presentation such as ventricular tachycardia, syncope, RV dysfunction, sudden death etc. In this case there were no symptoms, family and medical history and its clinical presentation was as unexpected sudden death.</p><p><bold>PP-261</bold></p><p><bold>Transsexual Homicides in Ankara, Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Birol Demirel</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>2</sup>, Taner Akar<sup>1</sup>, Hanife Alkurt Alkan<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara Group Chairmanship, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Backround:</bold> Transsexuality is a disorder characterized by the development of a gender identity opposed to phenotypic sex.

The crime turn into hate crime when the perpetrator have a hostility against transsexuals and transsexuality is the only reason for homicide. The main objective of the perpetrator is threaten and obsess of all transsexuals. The perpetrator generally create numerous wounds on hate crime victims body. In ten years period included this study, only seven transsexual homicide were committed. Evaluation this rare cases and compare with other cases on this subject is the aim of this study.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Between 2001–2010 years, seven transsexual homicides in Ankara were determined from police records. Then victims autopsy reports were obtained from Council of Forensic Medicine Ankara Group Chairmanship archieves and reviewed them retrospectively in terms of age, findings of external examination, features of wounds, causes of death, results of toxicological and biological analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Seven transsexual homicide victims were choosen for study. Two of them went under sex change operation. Five of them had female view with long and dyed hair, polished fingernails and female breasts. They had circumcised penis. Causes of death were stabbing (two), strangulation (one), blunt head injury (one), blunt head and chest injury (one) and shotgun injury (one). Two stabbing cases had thirty three and twenty nine stab wounds. Ethanol was found in only two cases blood samples. Other toxicological and biological analysis showed no findings. Two perpetrators were arrested while five perpetrators remained unknown.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Transsexual individuals are exposed to dense discrimination and social exclusion in our country. Also they are most common victims for hate crimes. Our study reflects only a small sample of these victims. Comprehensive investigations are needed for understanding the extensiveness of crimes intended for transsexual individuals.</p><p><bold>PP-262</bold></p><p><bold>Prevalence of Blood-borne Viruses Amongst Postmortem Cases in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</bold></p><p><underline>Khairul Anuar Zainun</underline><sup>1</sup>, Rohayu Shahar Adnan<sup>2</sup>, Siew Sheue Feng<sup>1</sup>, Khoo Lay See<sup>1</sup>, Hilmi Saidin<sup>1</sup>, Nurliza Abdullah<sup>1</sup>, Mohd Shah Mahmood<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Kuala Lumpur Hospital, Malaysia.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Sultan Ismail Hospital, Johor, Malaysia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Blood-borne viral infections in dead bodies represent a significant occupational hazard during postmortem procedure. Infection status of cases is often not known despite detailed scrutiny of available medical history and associated risk factors. With higher seroprevalence of hepatitis virus and increasing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic worldwide including Malaysia, this is certainly an important safety issue amongst pathologists and mortuary personnel performing postmortem examination. Therefore it is crucial to determine their prevalence so that appopriate risk reduction strategies can be employed accordingly during the procedure.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Blood from ninty two sudden death cases were analysed prior to postmortem for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C using both rapid commercial kit tests and confirmatory laboratory method. These sudden death cases were presented to Department of Forensic Medicine, Kuala Lumpur Hospital during a three-month study period and were later determined to have died from various cause and manner of death.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> Out of ninty cases sampled, five cases were positive for HIV, nine cases were positve for hepatitis B and two cases were positive for hepatitis C. The corresponding postmortem prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were calculated to be 5.4 %, 9.8 % and 2.2 % respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study highlights the existence of significant prevalence of blood-borne viral infections amongst postmortem cases in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Therefore there is a clear need to establish their status prior to postmortem examination. We recommend, at a minimum, to have blood screening test for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C using rapid commercial kits prior to postmortem of every case as part of overall infection-reduction strategies to be employed by those performimg the procedure.</p><p><bold>PP-263</bold></p><p><bold>Cerebral Damages in Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</bold></p><p><underline>Hamid Mohabbati</underline><sup>1</sup>, Amin Ranjbar<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Mashhad Azad University, Medical Faculty, Mashhad, Iran</p><p><sup>2</sup>Forensic Medicine Organization, Mashhad, Iran</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> Carbon monoxide (CO) is a tasteless, odorless, non-irritating but highly toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. The present study aimed to investigate the both macroscopic and microscopic changes in brain tissue of corpses which CO toxicity was their cause of death.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study was held on eighty seven victims of CO poisoning over a period of two years (2010–2011). The cases were divided into two groups. Group A contains sixty victims who died before any medical treatments or hospitalization and group B which includes twenty seven patients who died during their initial hospitalization because of the CO toxicity side effects. The autopsies were performed and both microscopic and macroscopic changes were studied. Data analysis was done via SPSS version 11.5.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The investigation included fifty six men (40 cases in group A and 16 cases in group B) and thirty one women (20 cases in group A and 11 cases in group B) with a total average age of 40.1 ± 12.3 years. The mean age was higher in group A than in group B (P value = 0.04). Brain edema was confirmed in forty six (52.8 %) victims (35 cases in group A and 11 cases in group B). The two types of cell death occurred in the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. Infarction of the globus pallidus and axonal destruction in white matter was detected in sixteen and nine cases respectively. Cerebral hemorrhagic infarction was noticed in five cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Brain damage is one of the most serious and lethal side effects of CO poisoning. We found a relationship between early death occurrence and brain damage severity and age. Hypoxia is the main cause of cerebral damages in CO toxicity. Brain edema was the most frequent finding. The cerebral lesions occur commonly in the basal ganglia, and central gray and white matters. Necrosis of globus pallidus and necrosis or demyelination and axonal destruction in the cerebral or cerebellar white matter were the most common histopathologic changes.</p><p><bold>PP-264</bold></p><p><bold>Identification of internal organs injuries in blunt trauma</bold></p><p><underline>Oleg Innokentievich Hvan</underline>, Baltabay Allaniyazovich Eshmuratov</p><p>Bureau of forensic medical examination of Tashkent City</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> To identify the frequency of lesions of the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space, and methods of their diagnosis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Materials for the study included 160 case histories of persons injured in 2008–2010, studied at the bases of National Center for emergency medical assistance. The greatest number of all cases of damage to abdominal organs and kidneys were in the age group 20 to 40 years (77 %). On admission, in hospitals, for the diagnosis of lesions of internal organs were used traditional survey methods, which include, along with clinical and laboratory, non-invasive diagnostic methods (ultrasound, X-ray and CT) and diagnostic laparoscopy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The analysis of case histories showed that the frequency of injury of internal organs among men is much higher than (62.5 %) cases than among women (47.5 %). The most frequently associated damage to internal organs in the form of tears the kidneys, liver, colon, pancreas and spleen occurred in the fall from height (12 %). Isolated damage to the liver in the form of the gap observed in 2 cases, bruised kidneys - in 2 cases, kidney rupture - in 7 cases, a ruptured spleen - in 5 cases, rupture of the colon - in one case, three cases have been established retroperitoneal hematoma. When the automobile injury combined injuries of the abdomen and kidneys were observed (4 %). Isolated damage to the liver in the form of the gap observed in one case, the kidney injury - in 10 cases, kidney rupture - in 2 cases, a ruptured spleen - in 2 cases, 1 case of retroperitoneal hematoma is installed. When beating combined injuries of the abdomen and kidneys were not observed. Isolated damage to the liver in the form of the gap observed in one case, a ruptured spleen - in one case, in 11cases were diagnosed contusions of the kidneys</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Combined injuries of the head, chest, internal organs with fractures of the limbs are observed in most cases, the automobile injury. Combined injuries of the abdomen and kidneys are more often observed in the case of a fall from a height, whereas the isolated damage to internal organs are more frequently observed in the automobile injury and beatings.

Radiological diagnostics using a contrast medium revealed a combined vascular anomaly (right-sided aortic arch). Circa 10 hours later the infant developed an acute abdomen with ileus symptoms. Emergency surgery showed infarction of the entire small intestine, due to anti-clockwise 180°-volvulus, with death occurring after 24 h. Further examination showed a malrotation as anomaly. Apparently, the volvulus had been caused by extensive use of a contrast medium (dosage +100 %) resulting in increased intestinal mobility.- (2) A 9-year-old girl (premature, 25th week) suffered from severe disability, amaurosis and epilepsy. She was admitted to hospital due to general agitation and a bloated abdomen without peristaltic sounds, but died a few hours later. Autopsy revealed a volvulus of 2/3 of the small intestine, based on congenital malrotation with additional clamping of the intestine underneath a formation of adhesions (previous appendectomy). The abdominal cavity showed beginning peritonitis with a septic spleen what defined the cause of death. Peritonitis had been due to disruption of the intestinal circulation on the basis of congenital malrotation and intra-abdominal adhesions.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The complications and forensic medical implications including the anatomical basics are reported and discussed.</p><p><bold>PP-266</bold></p><p><bold>About the diagnostic relevance of intra-alveolar haemosiderin-deposits in SIDS</bold></p><p>Gerhard Kernbach Wighton, Younis Albalooshi, <underline>Burkhard Madea</underline></p><p>Institute of Legal Medicine, The University of Bonn, Stiftsplatz 12, D – 53111 Bonn, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Repeatedly, the presence of intra – alveolar haemosiderin deposits has been discussed regarding its diagnostic relevance.

Classical methods are often inapplicable in disintegrated and petrifying corpses, indicating a need for additional approaches to the problem. Available literature suggests a strong linear association between age and different aortic dimensions such as diameter, surface above the aortic valve and circumference of thoracic aorta at different anatomical levels. In the present study we aim to identify the strength of the association between age and inner circumference of thoracic aorta at the level of the diaphragm and to develop an equation for determining age based on the circumference of the aorta.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 729 autopsy cases of deceased from the community – 549 men and 180 women. The age at death ranged from 1 to 93 years with an average for both sexes of 55,4 years. Circumference of thoracic aorta was measured at the level of the diaphragm. The association between age and aorta circumference was assessed through Pearson correlation, and the predictions for age, based on aortic circumference were developed with linear regression analysis. The level of significance was set at α = 0,05.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There is a strong statistically significant correlation between age and thoracic aorta circumference in both sexes. The coefficient of correlation is 0,841 for men (p &lt; 0,0001) and 0,829 for women (p &lt; 0,0001). Aorta circumference is increasing gradually in every 5 year age group which allows for the development of an equation for predicting age based on the aorta circumference.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Defining the circumference of the aorta might be a suitable secondary method for determining age of unidentified corpses or in some specific situations.</p><p><bold>PP-269</bold></p><p><bold>Suicide during detention time</bold></p><p>Magda Petcu<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Fotios Chatzinikolaou</underline><sup>2</sup>, Vera Luta<sup>3</sup>, Polichonis Voultsos<sup>2</sup>, Eleni Zagelidou<sup>2</sup>, Alexandra Enache<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Legal Medicine Timisoara, Romania</p><p><sup>2</sup>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Lab of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Greece</p><p><sup>3</sup>University of Medicine and Pharmacy Victor Babeş Timisoara, Romania</p><p>The purpose of this study is to identify the suicidal risk of the persons during detention</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study is based on the cases of suicide during detention, examined at Institute of Forensic Medicine Timisoara</p><p><bold>Results and discussions:</bold> Detention has an adverse outcome for the detainees, aggravating pre-existent conditions at the detainees with previous mental problems with emergence of the suicidal risk.</p><p>The literature mention that the suicidal risk is higher in the detention environment compared to the on-detention environment.</p><p><bold>The article 114 CP says:</bold> When the detainee has a mental condition or is a drug addict, and represents a danger for the society, he/she shall be admitted in a medical institution until improving of the medical condition.</p><p><bold>Case presentation:</bold></p><p>1.

Methodologies based in the biochemistry of the vitreous humour offers the best results for this determination, correlating the value of potassium (K) and hypoxanthine (Hx) with postmortem interval. However, vitreous humours have a viscous nature, and it is necessary that they be liquefied prior to analysis. The aim of this study was to compare different preanalytical treatments (centrifugation, sonication, enzymatic digestion and heat treatment), and their influence in the value of Hx by LC-MSMS determination.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> 30 vitreous humours of different sources were analyzed. All samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was divided into four aliquots of 200 μL. Each aliquot was submitted to one of the different studied pretreament methods. After that, 150 μL of these liquefied aliquots were extracted by solid-phase extraction by OASIS MAX cartridges (Waters, Mildford, USA). Chromatographic separation was performed using an Atlantis T3 (2.1x100mm, 3 μM) analytical column, working in gradient mode, with acetonitrile and ammonium acetate 10 mM (pH = 4.5) as mobile phase. A Quattro Micro tandem mass spectrometer (Waters) was employed for the detection, working in electrospray positive mode (ESI +). Guanine, xanthine and uric acid were monitored also with this analytical method.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Centrifugation was the easiest and fastest pretreament method. Moreover, centrifugation and sonication results showed only small differences between them. However, 15 minutes were necessary to perform the sonication method, while no additional time was required in the centrifugation process. With enzymatic digestion treatment, concentrations decreased slightly, but with heat treatment higher and lower values, depending on the vitreous humour, were found.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Variations in Hx measurement can alter the correct determination of postmortem interval, with important legal consequences. This study demonstrates how different types of pretreament methods affect the Hx determination. Centrifugation seems to be the method of choice because of its simplicity and good results.</p><p><bold>PP-272</bold></p><p><bold>Carbon monoxide poisonings and deaths in house fires in Estonia in 2006 – 2011</bold></p><p>Delia Lepik<sup>1</sup>, Jana Tuusov<sup>2</sup>, Mailis Tõnisson<sup>2</sup>, Marika Väli<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Heldi Kase</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Pathological Anatomy and Forensic Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia</p><p><sup>2</sup>Estonian Forensic Science Institute, Tallinn, Estonia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> House fires are frequent subject of everyday practice for a forensic pathologist due to cold and wet weather conditions in Estonia. It is frequent finding ethanol in addition to carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in blood sample of dead body.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In this study, we analysed fire fatalities in Estonia in the years 2006 – 2011.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 2006 168, in 2007 124, in 2008 101, in 2009 73, in 2010 96 and in 2011 92 deaths caused by carbon monoxide and exposure to uncontrolled fire in building or structure were registered. The mean rate of fatalities per 100,000 person-years decreased from 12.50 (in 2006) to 5.45 (in 2009) and then increased a little to 6.87 (in 2011).</p><p>Totally during these years 537 carbon monoxide poisoning were registered. 412 (76.7 %) of them were male and 125 (23.3 %) female fatalities. Most of the deceased were in age between 41 and 70 years. In 378 (70.8 %) cases ethanol was found in blood samples (blood alcohol concentration – BAC, 0.5 mg/g or higher) and 43.1 % of them had BAC in high level (2.51 mg/g or higher).</p><p>The cause of death was not determined due to post-mortem thermal damage of the body in 70 cases, of them 56 (80.0 %) were male and 14 (20.0 %) female. Most of deceased were aged between 51 and 70 years. Slightly over half of the deceased 37 (52.9 %) were intoxicated with alcohol and in 30.0 % cases the alcohol level was high (BAC over 2.51 mg/g).</p><p>Another cause of death in fire incidents was burns, where the death occurred in most cases later in the hospital. In 2006 – 2011 there were 47 burn victims, 27 of them were male and 20 female. Comparing these cases with carbon monoxide poisonings, burn victims were mostly older persons (51 – 90 years). Alcohol was detected in blood in 18 (38.3 %) cases and 21.3 % of them had BAC in high level.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Since July the 1st 2009 in living rooms of private houses (apartments) automatic fire alarm system (smoke alarm) is obligatory, so the deaths due to carbon monoxide poisonings decreased to 54 in 2009. The extremely cold weather in December 2009 and January 2010 increased the number of deaths due to house fires.

Usually every specialist works separately from the others focusing on the analysis of its field. Our experience wants to bring forward an early cooperation, starting from the first approach to the victims.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In particular, in a case of fireworks explosion, the crime scene examination, the evidence collection, the autopsy, the examination of clothes and the histological and toxicological exams were performed, when possible, at the presence of all the specialists in charge, while, in the other cases a rapid and exhaustive exchange of information was provided to all in order to create “the big picture” of the event. We approached the case combining the different methods of the single specialist: the forensic pathologist ability to read the lesions, the forensic chemical knowledge of explosives, the forensic histologist and toxicologist capabilities. For example the lesions observed during the autopsy and the little fragments found in and on the corpse resulted in an important hint during a later search of evidence on the crime scene and actually had a great role in reconstructing the dynamics of the explosion.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Having a great amount of information about all the different elements involved in the event, resulted in an easier interpretation of the found lesions: in particular the subarachnoid hemorrhage the thoracic fractures and the cavitation of the right lung and of the liver. The fragments of the explosive device, not only justified the aspect of most of the external lesions, but also provided evidences to identify the fireworks that caused the event. Other interesting results came out from the histological and toxicological examination.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The positive results of our experience of cooperation with different specialists approaching the complexity of a case of explosion and the great achievements in terms of new knowledge that came for each one of us, encourage us, not only, to apply this multidisciplinary approach to any other case of explosion further to come, but also to any case characterized by similar complexity.

A key issue in the investigation was the amount of accelerant and the time of combustion needed to produce the observed pattern of thermal damages. We carried out an exhaustive library search without finding any published result giving a contribution to the case. Therefore we decided to carry out some experiments using an animal carcass with the aim of highlighting the conditions necessary to produce the observed thermal damages.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The experiments were carried out in a quarry using a pig carcass, petrol and an electrical remote ignition system. Six tests have been performed, using different fuel quantities on different regions of the carcass, in some tests the skin was covered with a cotton cloth. Authors used healthy appendages in some experiments and husked ones in the last part of the study, because the response of the human body is expected to be in between the two tested situation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The six tests carried out showed that the flame action and the time frame necessary to reproduce an injury, similar to our case, on an animal carcass is influenced by many variables including the different anatomical substrates (e.g. the body fat) and the different quantity of petrol. In five out of six tests the flames extinguished before forty minutes.</p><p>The time before the flames extinguish does not depend on the quantity of petrol but it depends mainly on the depth of the pool of flammable liquid (approximately 2–3 mm/min). The studies performed enabled us to describe the deepness of the damages that in the last test, conducted with ten liters of petrol, reached six centimeters similarly to the victim’s lesions.</p><p>Only the third test, involving the abdominal area, showed a very long duration of flame due to the artificial exposition of the abdominal adipose tissue caused by the sagittal cut of the animal.

India has the largest number (14 million) of TB sufferers in the world. There are over 67,000 homeless in Delhi, of whom 15 percent are women and 10 percent children. Delhi’s total population is 16753235 according to 2011 census and Central Delhi is having 578,671 populations.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> This is a 5 year retrospective study based on the autopsy records of department of Forensic Medicine in Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, which is responsible for post-mortem examination of all medico-legal deaths in Central district of New Delhi. Almost all deaths among homeless people are regarded as suspicious and they were registered as medico-legal case and brought by police for autopsy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> During this study we tried to find out the load of mortality due to tuberculosis in homeless population of central district of New Delhi (capital of India), where those unclaimed dead bodies were brought for postmortem examination, all unknown and unclaimed deaths were considered suspicion. During this 5 year period total 2773 autopsies were conducted in the morgue of LHMC, New Delhi, out of that, 749 cases (27.01 %) were homeless unclaimed people. 122 deaths (16.28 %) were due to pulmonary tuberculosis in homeless. The maximum 40 cases (32.78 %) were in age group of more than 50 years individuals, and minimum in age group of 11 – 20 years; 3 cases (2.45 %). Further, males were predominantly contributed with 116 cases (95.08 %) and remaining 6 cases (4.91 %) were females. Maximum deaths were occurred in month of July; 21 cases (17.21 %).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We need to do a much better job in preventing tuberculosis from spreading in this homeless vulnerable population, and in providing timely, effective primary and specialized clinical care for those who are affected by this vulnerable disease.

This answer is rather complex when the body was found in water and decomposition processes are already present. The evaluation of PMSI can be an useful instrument for understanding time of death and/or time of disappearance, for personal identification of bodies found in an aquatic environment.</p><p>Our study of forensic literature of the last three centuries highlights that in the past years, forensic pathologists had estimated time of submergence using personal observations of the decomposing degree of a few cases. Maceration was the most studied decomposing process in contrast with putrefaction in water, for which there were almost total disagreement between pathologists about chronological aspects.</p><p>PMSI estimation is the result of the combined assessment of taphonomic factors, thanatological factors and entomological/biological factors (i.e. the studies of sessile invertebrate). Furthermore, the main variable that can influence aquatic decomposition is the temperature of the water. More recently some pathologists have suggested a standardized method for the evaluation of decomposing timing, using an entomological parameter (ADD). They used a scoring system for the objective evaluation of the decomposition and found a relationship between decomposition and ADD, in order to find the PMI or the PMSI: Megyesi studied the relationship between ADD and air decomposition and Heaton analysed the relationship between ADD and freshwater decomposition.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Until now, no study has analysed the reliability of this method on decomposition in seawater. The aim of our research was to study the reliability of these principles in a marine environment, identify a statistically valid method for the estimation of PMSI starting from the decomposing stage and ADD of a body found in Southern Adriatic Sea, identify a combined method for the evaluation of PMSI, using thanatological, taphonomic and biological factors.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> Our research confirms the studies that have found a relationship between ADD and decomposition for the estimation of PMSI. In particular, our study represents the first research on decomposition in seawater, characterized by an equation of regression with high statistical importance (R2 0,9023). So our thanatological results, the evaluation of taphonomic factors and the study of biological elements (study of life cycle of a species of Barnacles: Lepas anatifera) can give useful indications for estimation of time of death for the decomposing corpses discovered in Southern Adriatic Sea.</p><p><bold>PP-278</bold></p><p><bold>CSI: special skills to access and inspect the site</bold></p><p>Maricla Marrone, Bruno Morgese, <underline>Francesca Tarantino</underline>, Eloisa Maselli, Francesco Vinci</p><p>Section of Legal Medicine, Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The Crime Scene Investigation usually require multidisciplinary competences of qualified technical staff and law enforcement agencies, to analyze, collect and interpret all the elements near the cadaver. However the inaccessibility of the environment, may require special skills and equipment to access the site. So the forensic pathologist can find himself in evident difficulty to reach impervious, submerged or under-ground zones.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The cases here presented highlight some criticalities which can be overcome only with the assistance of further techniques, competences and equipment, which lie often beyond the forensic doctor’s proper.</p><p>Case n. 1- In a quarry, there found the corpse of a fallen down man; because of his location on a stone slope not accessible, it was required a very high escalator to reach the cadaver. In this case, the cooperation of the Firemen was crucial.</p><p>Case n.2- The collapse of a building in Foggia, which caused the death of 63 persons, required to perform a helicopter aerial survey to obtain an overview image of the site; this allowed to make a correct descriptive report of the area, useful to reconstruct the exact position of the victims under the rubble and to correlate their injuries to the modalities of the collapse.</p><p>Case n.3- A peasant attending to a grape press machine was the victim of a fatal accident. At the crime scene investigation, the cadaver was still imprisoned in the machine, so that it was necessary to ask for the support of specialized workers who carried out the emptying and the dismantlement of the device for the preliminary examinations on the corpse.</p><p>Case n.4- In an electrical cabinet, was found the cadaver of a man. The subject was trying steal electric material when, due to a dispersion of electric current, was electrocuted by an electrical discharge of thousands volts. It was impossible to interrupt the electric current supply, so the CSI could be performed in safety conditions only with the support of skilled technical staff who forbade the use of electronic devices which could cause voltaic arcs.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusions:</bold> The illustrated cases prove the need, in Forensic Medical field, of the competence of technical figures apparently distant from those which usually work in the judicial field, yet whose contribution allows to operate with safety and improve the qualitative standard of the investigations.</p><p><bold>PP-279</bold></p><p><bold>Foolish deadly games: please don’t play with the police!</bold></p><p>Francesco Introna, <underline>Liliana Innamorato</underline>, Maricla Marrone, Francesco Vinci</p><p>Section of Legal Medicine, Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> It is not uncommon in literature the description of decease cases due to “badly ended games” but there is scarce documentary evidence associating those deceases to the intervention of the law enforcement agencies, even though a 2008 study by NVDRS assessed that an impressive 26,4 % of the deceases due to “violence-related injuries” derived from police intervention for over-defense or killing by mistake.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The authors report the case of a tragic joke ended with the death of a young boy from a gunshot fired by a policeman.</p><p>On a summer night, a patrol car with two policemen was running along a country road where a lonely mugger had many times assaulted couples in their cars. The policemen stopped the car as the carriageway was blocked by stones; suddenly, a man with covered face and head, appeared from a dry stone wall, waving a gun with both hands. One of the policemen fired two shots, fatally wounding the boy.</p><p>At the gunshots, some friends of the victim reached the policemen, referring that the boy, emulating the aggression methodology of the mugger, was trying a joke to a couple of his friends he knew that were surely passing there.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The autopsy showed the presence of a straight-trough wound channel, affecting all three lobes of the right lung with a resulting hemorrhagic pouring in the pleural cavity. The crime scene investigation allowed the retrieval of a bullet by the roadside.</p><p>At the examination of the police car was detected a deformed bullet in the front pillar of the driver-side car door, and a superficial defect of the rigid plastic border of same pillar.</p><p>Laboratory tests proved that the bullet found during the crime scene investigation had been shot by one of the two patrolling agents’ service gun. The two cartridge cases found in the car were fired by the same gun.</p><p>The examination of the bullet showed also that its tip presented a deformation typical of the impact on a crystal; that was also related to the presence of residual silica powder adherent to the bullet’s tip.</p><p>A three-dimensional reconstruction of the several stages of the event was made.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> It is stressed the usefulness of the multidisciplinary contribution of the forensic-medical and ballistic competence in the reconstruction of events with firearm-related fatalities.</p><p><bold>PP-280</bold></p><p><bold>Cable ties are rarely, but easily used for completion of self-strangulation by ligature</bold></p><p><underline>Sang Han Lee</underline><sup>1</sup>, Hyun Jung Kim<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea</p><p><sup>2</sup>Tongyeong Coast Guard Station, South Regional Headquarters, Korea Coast Guard, Tongyeong, Korea</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Self-strangulation by ligature is very uncommon. A cable tie is useful for binding or organizing several electronic cables and wire, but warning for accidental strangulation should be stressed in children. Recently several cases of intentional self-strangulation by cable tie have been reported in the forensic literatures, and newspapers in England and the United States.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Authors have paid attention of self-strangulation by cable tie since 2008 in Korea.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Five cases were collected through the personal communications with death investigators of the Province Police Agencies during 4 years. All cases were male. One case was suicide-homicide case (father-son). Only one case was autopsied. Two cases of suicidal attempts and one case of suicidal strangulation by cable tie were found in the newspapers through the internet searching. One case of suicidal strangulation was suicide-homicide (father-son &amp; daughter).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Legal regulation for merchandizing cable ties, especially for the industrial cable ties, may be needed for preventing suicide. Reporting of self-strangulation by cable tie in the news media should be prohibited for preventing a suicide fad, especially in the country of high suicide rate such as Korea.</p><p><bold>PP-281</bold></p><p><bold>Coronal Clefts in infants – differential diagnosis of child abuse related traumatic injuries of vertebral bodies</bold></p><p>Elke Doberentz<sup>1</sup>, Annette M.

Affected vertebral bodies typically present compression fractures due to forced hyperflexion and hypertension. Radiographic examinations of the vertebral column, especially in infants in the 1st year of life can also reveal coronal clefts – a radiolucent band running through a vertebral body, visualized in the lateral spinal radiograph. They are discussed as a physiological variation of the fetal vertebral ossification pattern. The number of 10 aborted fetuses was studied radiologically concerning the incidence and appearance of coronal clefts. Coronal clefts were mainly localized in the lumbar spine. No cervical or singular sacral clefts were detected. Histologically coronal clefts showed missing ossification at the centre of the vertebral body, remnants of the notochord could be excluded. Obviously coronal clefts result from a retarded ossification of vertebral bodies in fetal development. They are a physiological variant and have to be known as differential diagnosis to peadiatrics, radiologists and forensic pathologists investigating child abuse.</p><p><bold>PP-282</bold></p><p><bold>Sudden Death of a Patient with Duchenne Musculer Dystrophy and Malpraxis Claim: a Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>İsmail Çoban</underline>, Gozde Sirin, Mehtap Tugasaygi, Umut Altunkaynak, Bedirhan Sezer Oner</p><p>Adli Tip Kurumu Baskanligi, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Duchenne-type muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive inherited disease affecting mainly the skeletal and cardiac muscles. The most common cause of death is cardiac diysfunction as a manifestation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our case was 16 years old boy diagnosed and followed up as DMD who is died at the hospital with aboundant hemorrhage from traceostomia canule started while taking lung X-ray graphy at his bed in the service room. The autopsy revealed that the atrophy of the neck muscles lead carotid artery lied parallel to trachea and neighbouring it. The hemorrhage was a result of decubital fistulisation between trakea and carotid artery, caused by the trakeostomia canula. For there was mal praxis claim about the medical staff, the case was evaluated by the 1st Specialisation Board, the Council of Forensic Medicine. The aim of submitting our case is that, DMD is not a frequent forensic autopsy subject, but gained forensic qualification because of the claim of malpractice leading to uncommon cause of death by the developping complications.</p><p><bold>PP-283</bold></p><p><bold>Marks of the neck during a crime scene investigation: don't judge the book by its cover!</bold></p><p><underline>Ilaria Scafetta</underline>, Francesca Longo, Antonio Marcelli, Letizia Caradonna, Francesco Ausania, Antonio Oliva, Massimo Senati</p><p>Institute of Legal Medicine, Catholic University, Rome</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Whatever the time scale, the general order of putrefactive changes is similar, though the degree of advancement may vary between different areas of even the same corpse. Usually the first external naked-eye sign is discoloration of the lower abdominal wall, most often in the right iliac fossa where the bacteria-laden caecum lies fairly superficially.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> A young woman was found dead inside her apartment; the body was lying on the bed, half-naked, supine, lying with the head on the pillow and the neck in hyperextension; some greenish spots with irregular margins were documented in the subhyoid region and in the sternocleidomastoid region. The inspection of the apartment revealed a disordered setting. The set of data collected at the time of the crime scene investigation led the suspicion of a violent death. In detail, at the autopsy, the dissection of the neck pointed out the lack of tissues hemorrhagic infiltration and detected only a marked swelling of the jugular veins bilaterally, in conjunction with ipercromia of surrounding soft tissues. By opening the chest a copious effusion of blood within the pericardial cavity and blood was observed to ooze through two laceration of cardiac wall. A narrowing of the ascending aorta just below the isthmus compatibly with a diagnosis of aortic coarctation was observed. Death was attributed to a cardiac tamponade following rupture of the heart.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The greenish areas visible on the neck skin of the woman were interpreted as a putrefactive artifact, that was the result of post-mortem changes took place in a region of stagnant blood. As blood is an excellent medium for the growth of the orgamism, the sequence of green patches spread is probably governed by distribution of blood in the various parts of the body at the particular time. In our case the greenish discolouration of the neck is an epiphenomenon of dilatation of the jugular veins that occurs in the context of the clinical syndrome that accompanies a cardiac tamponade. The interest of this case is to demonstrate how some marks observed during a crime scene investigation and misunderstood as external signs of manual strangulation, can be correctly interpreted as the epiphenomenon of a natural death during the autopsy.</p><p><bold>PP-284</bold></p><p><bold>Art and Forensic Science: analysis of the Panthocrator of Saint Catherine (first painting of Jesus of Nazaret) showing sequels of the Passion and crucifixion</bold></p><p><underline>Miguel Lorente</underline></p><p>University of Granada.

We analyzed the elements of the Shroud of Turin and found some evidence of vitality and some other signs that are not compatible with the death of the person wrapped by the cloth. Continuing with the studies we found that the first known painting of Jesus of Nazareth is the Panthocrator of Saint Catherine, painted between IV-VI Century.</p><p>It shows some signs compatibles with the injuries produced during the Passion and crucifixion. The Forensic analysis prove that the painting of Panthocrator of St. Catherine shows some injuries that correspond with sequels of the initial wounds of these moments (Passion and crucifixion) and can help to understand the circumstances and perceptions around the death of Jesus of Nazareth from a rational point of view.</p><p>This is not incompatible with another level of evaluation, as it can be the beliefs.</p><p>The meaning of art is never neutral, as prove new disciplines like Neuroesthetic, and show how the art acquires its real meaning in the social and cultural context. Under this perspective, the art can be a very valuable evidence for forensic science to approach the meaning and circumstances of the past.</p><p>The first known painting of Jesus of Nazareth is the Panthocrator of St. Catherine, found in Sinai (Egypt). The forensic value is very important because it represent a number of sequels that correspond to the injuries produced during the Passion and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth, most of them can be observed in the Shroud of Turin.</p><p>The main findings in the painting of the Panthocrator are:</p><p>- Scars in the face and neck due to the wounds produced by the whip, some of them are specific of the Flagrum taxilatum, a special whip used by the Romans in the first century.</p><p>- Deformity in the right zygomatic region due to a traumatism with possible bone fracture produced during the Sanhedrin Trial.</p><p>- Absence of nail’s injuries in the palm of the hands.

In drowning, non-specific signs as oedema of the lungs and subsequently froth in the air passages, overinflation of the lungs and intrathoracic fluid are observed, while in strangulation petechial hemorrhages are helpful. Hemorrhage and congestion in the mastoid bones are also used as a tool in suggesting the cause of death in those victims. According to literature, dramatic vascular congestion is observed in strangulation victims whereas drowning victims showed more mastoid hemorrhage and less vascular congestion.</p><p>We compared the histology of mastoid bones in 54 victims, who were categorised on the suggested cause of death as follows: asphyxia-drowning related (AD, n = 10), asphyxia-strangulation related (AS, n = 32) and a control group (C, n = 12).

The spontaneous and idiopathic rupture of the urinary bladder is a rare occurrence, with an incidence of about 1:126.000. The acute intoxication with ethanol is a risk factor due to the fibrilar distension and the ascension of the urinary bladder dom above the protective retrosymphisar space. The ethanol intoxication and the subsequent alteration of the consciousness make difficult the diagnosis of the spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder determining an increase of mortality up to 47 %.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In this paper the authors present a case of death due to the spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder.</p><p>According to the data provided by the Police, R.D., women, 67 years old, died a few hours after drinking a big quantity of alcohol.

The autopsy was performed 24 post-mortem, and samples for toxicologic and microscopic examination were collected.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> No traumatic injuries were discoveded during the external examination of the corpse. The internal examination of the abdomen revealed about 1000 ml of bloody liquid mixed with blood clots in the peritoneal cavity. On the posterior wall of the intraperitoneal urinary bladder we discovered a transversal rupture of about 4 cm length and 3 cm width at maximum traction, with irregular and blood infiltrated margins. Inside the urinary bladder there were about 700 ml of blood clots. The toxicologic examination revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 2,05 gr%o. The macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed no signs of a pathological condition or traumatic injury of the urinarry bladder.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The possibility of a spontaneous, idiopathic rupture of the urinary bladder should be considered in patients with a history of unspecific abdominal pain, especially when a history of a recent alcohol intake is known. When no pathological lession of the urinary bladder (tumor, inflamation, infiltrative diseases etc.) are discovered, the traumatic cause should be considered; further if no traumatic injuries are discovered during the external and internal examination of the body and there is no history of a recent trauma against the victim, the rupture can be considered spontaneous and idiopathic.</p><p><bold>PP-293</bold></p><p><bold>Will to die without bothering: special devices used by suicides</bold></p><p><underline>Maria Carolina Romanelli</underline><sup>1</sup>, Marrone Maricla<sup>1</sup>, Tarantino Francesca<sup>1</sup>, Carabellese Felice<sup>2</sup>, Vinci Francesco<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Section of Legal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Section of Forensic Psychiatry, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> suicide is one of the most important public health issues in Italy. Suicide rates for this country average approximately 4,7 per 100.000 populations and the most common method of suicide is the use of firearm. This presentation will impact the forensic community illustrating how social and psychological aspects play a key role in people who commit suicide. We show two unusual cases of suicide in which victims paid attention to preserve the environment without blood spatter on the surrounding surfaces. This was an act of respect for their relatives: the will to die, derived from terminal diseases and psychological suffering, was accompanied by the desire of reducing the painful impact in loved ones.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> one case is that of a 65-year-old man, an art professor at high school. The day he committed suicide he had dinner with his wife. Once she fell asleep, he reached a separate part of the house were he had planned to commit suicide. He covered a coach with clothes and plastic bags; he sat and fired himself with a.357 magnum revolver pointing the barrel at his right mastoid bone. After firing, all blood traces were absorbed by the covering material. No reason was found to justify the suicide and only later it was discovered that his boss had fired him because he walked naked in protest in school. There was no evidence of prior suicide attempts.</p><p>The second case was that of a 57-year-old man with a history of severe terminal form of gastric tumor. Once alone in the house, the man prepared the scenario on the balcony outside the house because he did not want to soil his apartment. He wrapped a blanket around the railing of the balcony, he laid on a plastic sheet and he shot in the chest using a.12 caliber shotgun. A suicide note was found on the scene.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> the external examination reveled in the first case one mastoid penetrating gunshot wound with gunpowder residue; the path of the pellet came to rest in the left parietal bone. In the second case, a wide entrance wound entered the chest and no exit wound was found.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> these two cases of suicides are unusual because both victims desired to die without “bothering”. Infact they used special devices in order to reduce the impact of the crime scene and to avoid further shock and pain in their relatives.</p><p><bold>PP-294</bold></p><p><bold>Suicide by insulin overdose</bold></p><p>Letizia Caradonna, <underline>Natalia Minelli</underline>, Ilaria Scafetta, Francesco Ausania, Antonio Oliva, Riccardo Rossi, Massimo Senati</p><p>Institute of Legal Medicine, Catholic University, Rome</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In the literature many case reports about the occurrence of accidental insulin-induced hypoglycaemia can be found but deliberate overdose with insulin is rarely reported. We encountered a case of fatal hypoglycaemia caused by insulin overdose. A 53 year old man with insulin-dependent diabetes, was found dead in his room. Close to the body and in the kitchen there were two syringes of insulin aspart, a syringe of insulin detemir, a box of lorazepam and packets of other drugs. He had attempted suicide once in the previous months, so he was receiving a psychiatric treatment. A farewell message addressed to his wife was found on his phone cell.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Autopsy, toxicological analysis and histological examination were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> It was proved that the man died from acute cardio-respiratory failure leading to a state of hypoglycaemic coma. Autoptic and histological findings were indicative of a direct cerebral damage (interstitial oedema, neuronal cells swelling with pale and fringed cytoplasm, capillaries micro-thrombi) with pulmonary oedema (oedema, alveolar desquamation, congestion and thick alveolar septae). Injection marks were not observed. Toxicological analyses showed therapeutic dosages of benzodiazepines.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Circumstantial data, autoptic, histological and toxicological findings led us to establish it was a case of deliberate self-poisoning with insulin.</p><p>As a matter of fact brain depends on constant delivery of glucose and oxygen by the blood. In this case state of coma was caused by the hypoglycaemia induced by insulin assumption. Hypoglycaemic brain damage can be considered a cerebral excitotoxic neuropathology, where neurons are selectively killed by an extracellular overflow of excitatory amino-acids produced by the brain itself. Pulmonary oedema is a complication of insulin overdose too, and it’s linked to the alveolar epithelium and pulmonary capillary endothelium dependence on glucose metabolism. Benzodiazepines can have an indirect influence on the mechanism of death. They occasionally reinforce the hypoglycaemia caused by insulin.</p><p>The importance of this case concerns the need of paying attention to circumstantial information and anamnestic data, that have to be integrated with autoptic and histological findings in order to make the right post-mortem diagnosis, especially when there is lack of external signs (fine injection needles can produce marks that are extremely hard to identify). In our case histological findings played a very important role too, as we could recognize a typical hypoglycaemic neuronal damage (neuronal cells swelling with pale and fringed cytoplasm). Finally it’s important to exclude other competitive fatal mechanism (diagnosis “per exclusionem”).</p><p><bold>PP-295</bold></p><p><bold>Demostrative suicides by fire in economic crisis time.

Only the 22 % were unemployed still looking for first occupation.</p><p>Nowadays with the spread out of the financial crisis, in Italy have been described quite a suicide a day for monetary problem.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The Authors describe two cases of demonstrative suicide by fire</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the first case the owner of a bakery came out crying from the State Tax Office, where he could not succeed in delaying the amount of tax to pay. His financial debts would have forced him to close the family work activity and fire his employees.</p><p>So he bought a tank, and filled it with gasoline. He went into the open country and under an olive oil tree, standing up, scattered himself with the gasoline and set fire</p><p>He was found decomposed, in the country side, two days later. He was charred with extended third degree burns on the 80 % of the body surface.</p><p>The death occurred slowly after a long suffering time as shown by the vitality of skin injuries and by the amount of carboxyhemoglobin (52 % in open space).</p><p>The second case concerned an unemployee of 55 YO. He was dismissed several years earlier, and from that time he was not able to find a new job. After one last negative attempt to obtain a job from the Local Municipality, he bought gasoline, put himself in a large rubbish plastic bag, and in the main square of the town, in the rush hours, he set himself to fire</p><p>He died 12 days later in the local Hospital for the consequences of the burns extended on 80 % of the body surface.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The suicide by fire is uncommon, extremely painful, and not rapidly lethal. It is usually used for demonstrative purposes: to contest the Central Government against the new poverty induced by the increase of taxes, the highly new unemployed and the lack of job.</p><p><bold>PP-296</bold></p><p><bold>Epidemiology of suicide deaths in the North of Portugal (2007–2011)</bold></p><p><underline>Ricardo Mendes</underline><sup>1</sup>, Maria Moura<sup>1</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>1</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>2</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>3</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine, North Branch, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>Sciences School of the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal</p><p><sup>4</sup>Forensic Sciences Center - CENCIFOR, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Suicide continues to be a common and one of the most preventable causes of death around the world. The importance of studies conducted on Jurisdictions that serve a specific geographical area is well known, as they are essential on identifying the local tendencies that are occurring amongst suicide victims. The objective of this study is to analyze the epidemiological trends of completed suicide in the North Region of Portugal.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Data from autopsy records and social inquiry of suicide cases (ICD-10 codes X60 to X84) between 2007 and 2011 at the North services of the National Institute of Legal Medicine of Portugal were obtained and analyzed by age, gender, method, time of year and other background factors.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1415 cases of suicide were autopsied in the North of Portugal. The mean interannual incidence rate of suicide in the region was 7.8 per 100.000 inhabitants, with a male:female ratio of 3:1. The age range was from 12 to 92 in males (mean = 52.60, mode = 45) and 14 to 92 in females (mean = 53.56, mode = 57). The most common method amongst male victims was hanging (n = 519; 47.1 %), followed by firearm discharge (n = 171; 15.5 %); in females, the most common method was also hanging (n = 90; 25.1 %), followed by intoxication by medicines (n = 79; 22.0 %).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Comparatively to other European countries, the results of the study suggest a higher rate of consummated suicide, even though the methods used are overlapping. Some population groups should be targeted for suicide preventive measures, being middle-aged men the most prominent.

Severe pulmonary hypertension, a condition associated with marked elevation of pulmonary artery pressures, heart failure, and high mortality, may present with the formation of plexiform lesions in medium sized pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arterial hypertension carries a high maternal motality rate in peripartum period.

Complete decapitation without any further mutilation of the victim in homicides is relatively rare. Decapitated bodies are predominantly associated with decapitation by wheels of trains or with postmortem dismemberment following homicide. Some methods of suicide may also result in decapitation, either as an intended outcome or as a result of some unforeseen complication of the method used.</p><p>Decapitation of bodies is a rare event in the civilian setting and is reported to account for approximately 0,1 % of medico-legal autopsies. Suicidal decapitation is a very rare method of self-destruction. In suicidal decapitation, the favored method is the one involving trains. Other encountered methods are decapitation in suicidal hanging, and vehicle-assisted ligature suicide. Though being encountered rarely, decapitation by guillotine was also reported.</p><p>In this retrospective study, in order to depict characteristic features of deaths with decapitation, we presented the findings of fatalities with decapitation over a 10-year period in a medico-legal autopsy series in Istanbul, Turkey. A total of 36270 forensic autopsies were performed over the period of the study and in 19 cases, the bodies were found to be decapitated (0.05 %).</p><p>The age range of decapitated bodies was 18 to 71 years (average, 39,1 years), with a male to female ratio of 13/6. There was only one case of suicide and the way used for suicide was a mechanism like guillotine. In this case, a guillotine-like device designed by male victim had been used for deliberately decapitating the body. The age of the suicide case was 41 years. There was no female suicide case. There were 13 deaths of accidental origin, 6 vehicle crashes and 7 train-pedestrian accidents. The age range of individuals killed in accidents was 26 to 68 years (average, 36.8 years), with a male to female ratio of 11/2. During the study period, the number of the homicide cases with decapitation was 5. The age range of homicide cases was 18 to 71 years (average, 45.2 years), with a male to female ratio of ¼. There were multiple traumas in other body parts of the bodies of homicide cases together with decapitation. In majority of homicide cases, multiple stab wounds were detected.

Choking on food and toys, suffocation from plastic bags and strangulation from strings on children's items are common causes of mechanical airway obstruction. Hanging is a form of ligature strangulation in which the force applied to the neck is derived from the gravitational drag of the weight of the body or part of the body. Hanging is almost always suicidal and though very rarely being accidental.</p><p>In some countries mechanical airway obstruction from choking, suffocation and strangulation is the leading cause of unintentional injury that results in death of children less than 1 year. Many of these deaths are preventable. Children's clothing and household furniture have the potential to cause strangulation.</p><p>We report a 1,5 years old boy who was dead on admission to hospital.

An assessment of levels of cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) in cadevric fluids, to estimate the postmortem interval (PMI) was carried out. cTnI is a basic regulatory protein found as part of a ternary complex responsible for calcium dependent muscle contraction.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To analyse the diagnostic efficacy of post-mortem dosage of cardiac troponine I in cadaver fluids in estimating PMI.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> Our study is prospective interesting 72 corps autopsied at the Department of Forensic Medicine of the University Hospital Fattouma Bourguiba of Monastir-Tunisia.

The table below shows the variation of levels of cTnI in cadaveric fluids with PMI</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The significant correlation between levels cTnI in pericardial fluid and PMI can be due to the fact that the pericardial fluid represents a different matrix than blood and is a filtrate produced via the serous layer of the pericardium. The fluid bathes the myocardium, enzymes and proteins may be released directly into the pericardial fluid from the cardiac muscle.</p><p>Large scale studies including more cases are needed to determine the correlation between PMI and levels of cTnI.</p><p><bold>PP-311</bold></p><p><bold>Café coronary syndrome: An autopsy case report</bold></p><p><underline>Meriam Belhaj</underline>, Abir Aissaoui, Nidhal Haj Salem, Mohamed Amin Mosrati, Ali Chadly</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine University Hospital Fattouma Bourguiba of Monastir- Faculty of Medicine- University of Monastir Tunisia</p><p>Food asphyxiation, known as “café coronary syndrome”, is defined as a sudden and unexpected death occurring during a meal due to accidental external compression of the airway by food.

The increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not related to tumor size, but rather to age and body mass index (BMI) of patients that need to be, respectively, more than 50 years and 25. The purpose of this report is to present a particular case of fatal pulmonary thromboembolism caused by pelvic compression by ovarian cancer.</p><p><bold>The case:</bold> A 74-year-old woman, weighing 103 kg and 172 cm tall, was found dead at her home. From judicial acts it was resulted that she suffered from hypertension and was reluctant to undergo medical treatment, but that she would have to perform some health checks because she was a carrier of a massive ovarian cyst. The judicial authorities ordered the autopsy two days after the discovery of the body.</p><p><bold>Necropsy findings:</bold> The corpse showed a proper nutritional state at the dissecting table and was well-preserved, with obvious abdominal globosity. No signs due to any harm were evident to external examination. The systematic examination of the organs showed formations completely occluding the lumen of the hilar pulmonary vessels, bilaterally; their morphological characteristics (mottled appearance, opacity, friability, tenacious adhesion to the vessel wall) permitted to identify their thromboembolic nature. Abdominal cavity dissection evidenced a voluminous neoformation (104 cm/15 kg), interesting adnexal structures, that occluded large part of the pelvic cavity with compression of the organs below. The exploration of the pudendal plexuses showed the origin of the material found in the pulmonary vessels. The cause of death was identified as massive pulmonary thromboembolism in a woman with massive ovarian neoplasm.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathological investigation was carried out on organs and on the material occluding the hilar vessels and pudendal plexuses, removed during autopsy and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin. The results have confirmed the same thrombotic nature and chronology of entity analyzed in the two vascular beds, making it possible to recognize the massive ovarian neoplasm, histologically identified as an "Atypical Proliferative (Borderline) Mucinous Tumor", as the risk factor for the venous thrombosis and subsequent embolization.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Authors describe a case of death caused by massive pulmonary thromboembolism originated from a voluminous ovarian mass that has given rise to venous stasis of the pelvic district.</p><p><bold>PP-319</bold></p><p><bold>Pmi estimation and multidisciplinary approach in burned remains</bold></p><p>Valentina Bugelli<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Stefania Fornaro</underline><sup>1</sup>, Stefano Vanin<sup>3</sup>, Claudia Giaconi<sup>2</sup>, Davide Caramella<sup>2</sup>, Mario Giusiani<sup>1</sup>, Luigi Papi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Legal Medicine – University of Pisa</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department III Radiology - University of Pisa</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Chemical &amp; Biological Sciences, School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield, Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fire is sometimes used in cases of self inflicted injuries and suicide. Burned remains can be found also in several accidents of different origin (cars, aircraft crash, industries, domestic, etc), and cases of burnt bodies, found in different locations such as open fields, cars and indoors have been reported by several authors. In these cases only a multidisciplinary approach allows the PMI estimation and the identification of the cause of death.</p><p>This case concerns a homicide/suicide in which the burned bodies of a female and her two sons (3 and 11 years-old) have been found in a car during the summer 2011, in Central Italy. In this case insects may be the only tool useful in the estimation of the minimum time of death (mPMI) as burning prevents the use of the classical thanato-chronological techniques for mPMI estimation.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> in order to estimate the mPMI larvae have been collected from bodies and then reared for their identification. After flames have been extinguished colonisation started in all the bodies at the same time. Lucilia sericata and Sarcophaga sp. larvae have been collected both from the abdomen and the skull, exploded because of the temperature.</p><p>Besides the autopsy, CT scan has been carried out to identify body injuries and toxicological investigations were carried out to determine whether children could have been poisoned or stunned before being been burned. All of the three bodies had undergone 16-slice multidetector CT (Toshiba Aquilion) basal scan and post processed with 3D and MPR reconstruction. Biological samples were collected for toxicological analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At MSCT scan none of three bodies exhibited signs of injuries like traumatic fractures or lacerations and no evidence of foreign bodies. Toxicological results revealed high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin and extremely low levels of cyanide in all of the three bodies while only in the children the analysis was positive for benzodiazepine, according to the fact that the mother has given them Diazepam when they still were at home, as seen in the video recorded by the security cameras placed inside the house.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> this report demonstrates the usefulness of multidisciplinary approach (pathological, radiological, entomological and toxicological) in the study of burned remains in order to confirm the event of a combined homicide-suicide as initially supposed.</p><p><bold>PP-320</bold></p><p><bold>Cause Of Death In Forensic Autopsy As A Pulmonary Fat Embolism: 2 Case Reports</bold></p><p><underline>Naciye Özeren</underline><sup>1</sup>, Demet Meral<sup>1</sup>, Necmi Çekin<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Science, Adana Group Administration, Adana, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Science Department, Adana, Turkey</p><p>Fat embolism, bone fractures, barotrauma, surgery, soft tissue damage may be due.</p><p>Fat embolism, bone marrow, soft tissue, large amounts of fat globules in the bloodstream, with the participation occurs.</p><p>Long bone fractures and orthopedic surgeries done after the main source of fat embolism.</p><p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A 67-year-old woman</p><p>Multiple fractures of the extremities and pelvis fractures after a traffic accident at the hospital in the female patient with sinus bradycardia, respiratory distress developed.</p><p>Died did not respond to CPR applied have been accepted.</p><p>The histopathological examination revealed findings consistent with fat embolism grade 3–4.</p><p><bold>Case 2:</bold> A 77-year-old woman.</p><p>Fallen from the tree, then the hospital with multiple pelvic fractures detected.

Recent literature has questioned the accuracy and completeness of ascertainment of such cases by various sources of information. In Portugal, occupational injuries are ruled by the Law 98/2009 that defines occupational injuries as a sudden and unexpected event suffered by an individual at the workplace or during working hours, performing work related tasks and/or during work related transportation. When the individual dies as a consequence of an occupational injury and enters the Forensic Pathology Department of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (INMLCF) not all of the circumstances of the death event are necessarily known, so an underreporting of the fatal occupational fatalities can occur.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The information database of the South Branch (Lisbon) of the INMLCF, which classifies medico-legal death etiologies based on the death certificates and autopsy reports, was used. These reports include autopsy findings and laboratory and auxiliary imaging studies. Also, hospital and Police reports serve as complementary informational documents related to the event of death. Nine years (2000 to 2008) of deaths classified as occupational have been identified and reviewed for general socio-demographic characteristics and circumstances of death. Data was also compared to the official government statistics as an attempt to frame them in the country panorama for the same period.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the year 2000 a total of 234.182 occupational injuries were reported in Portugal (Social Security Ministry statistics), with a mortality rate of 0.00157. A decrease in the number of fatalities and a very subtle increase in the number of occupational injuries were subsequently recorded, reaching a mortality rate of 0.00116 per occupational injury in 2008. Our institutional data reveals a following decreasing tendency in the same period.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The observed consistent gradual tendency decrease in the number of occupational fatalities accompanies a national tendency, and might be explained by a number of factors such as safety measures adopted by the employers, road safety measures and slowing of the economy. An underreporting of transportation fatal injuries during work and work related activities is to be expected, due to general lack of information on the circumstances of traffic accident. The results also suggest the importance of carrying out case finding and of incorporating death certificates as one of the documents to be systematically reviewed, in order to collect more accurate statistics minimizing the underreporting of fatal occupational injuries.</p><p><bold>PP-325</bold></p><p><bold>Lethal Disseminated Parasitosis From P. falciparum.

In our country, 83 % of cases is due to P. falciparum, that it is responsible also for the 0,004 % of deaths. The Authors report a lethal case of imported malaria that affected an Italian man (and that it was) characterized by a particular seriousness in its development.</p><p><bold>The case:</bold> A 45 year-old man was found cadaver in his home by his relatives. They reported that he had spent his Christmas holiday in Mozambique but he did not have endemic disease prophylaxis. In the days after home-coming, he developed persistent hyperthermia with shivering for which he was also examined by his family doctor that prescribed paracetamol. It is unknown if the victim had revealed anything about his journey in a country where malaria is endemic to his doctor. Judicial Authority was informed about this death and a medico-legal autopsy was ordered two days after cadaver recovery. Autopsy did not show pathological findings that were demonstrative of the cause of death. On suspicion of a death due to a malignant form of malaria, toxicological, histological and parasitological analysis were performed on organs and biological fluids collected during autopsy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The histopathological analysis of organs stained with Heamatoxylin-Eosin showed intracytoplasmic malaria pigment located in lungs, hearth, liver, kidneys, spleen and brain. The histopathological analysis of thick blood smear stained with May-Grűnwald Giemsa (MGG) showed parasites in “ring configuration” that indicated a systemic malaria infection caused by P. falciparum. The toxicological analysis were negative.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case report is particular because of the exceptional findings in Italy of an acute systemic malaria infection, the most important parasitosis in the World. For this reason, the Authors could qualify the exposed parasitosis as an imported disease diagnosed at post-mortem examination. The seriousness of this infection is also remarkable: in fact, it can be considered a pernicious malaria because of its systemic spread leading to the death of the victim, (an event considered today rare in industrialized countries.</p><p><bold>PP-326</bold></p><p><bold>Accidental cervical transection of a motorcyclist due to a rope tight across a driving street</bold></p><p><underline>Lucia Tattoli</underline>, Eloisa Maselli, Biagio Solarino, Alessandro Dell' Erba</p><p>Section of Legal Medicine, University of Bari, Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The most common mechanism of fatal injury in motorcyclists is usually due to severe blunt force trauma, determining injuries mainly located at the head, neck and thorax. Motorcyclists typically collides with moving or stationary objects hitting them in different ways. The crashes are also influenced by several risk factors, such as the behaviour of both the victim and of other people involved. The Authors present an unusual fatal case of a man driving a scooter, who hit a rope tight across the road he was riding, suffering wide lacerated wounds of the neck, rupture of trachea, and hyoid and cervical spine fractures by hyperextension of the neck.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> A 53-year-old man, while he was riding a scooter, hit a rope which was tight across the road, between a tree and a car parked on the opposite side to allow the pruning of trees. The witnesses saw the rope hitting firstly the windshield of the moped and then the neck of the rider who fell to the ground, dying shortly after. According to the police report, the man was not wearing helmet, driving fast.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> External examination showed bruises of forehead, nose, lips, and limbs with linear transverse abrasions on mandibular and laterocervical areas. A 9 centimetres lacerated wound was observed on the base of the neck. At autopsy, a cerebral and cerebellum subarachnoid hemorrhages, with transection of the brainstem, rupture of left posterior communicating artery and trachea, fractures of hyoid bone, laceration of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, fractures of C1, C2 with section of cervical spine, were found.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Trees are the most common causes in determining accidental fatal crashes in motorcyclists. In the case here presented, the cause of death was due to severe cervical spine trauma associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, transection of brainstem, and vascular injury. Neck wounds was caused by the rope dragging and compressing upward on the anterior neck, resulting in a forced hyperextension of the cervical spine, and subsequent tearing of the skull base vessels.</p><p><bold>PP-327</bold></p><p><bold>Parasailing Fatalities: a Report of Three Cases</bold></p><p><underline>Mehmet Atılgan</underline>, Sema Demirçin, Yaşar Mustafa Karagöz</p><p>Akdeniz University Medical Faculty Department of Forensic Medicine,Antalya,Turkey</p><p>Parasailing is one of the most popular recreational activities in which a person is towed behind a motorized boat while attached by tow rope to a special designed parachute.

This report regards the accidental finding of a gauze in mediastinum, “forgotten” 14 years before the death of a woman, carrier of valvulopathy, whose death would have occurred for reasons not imputable to the intrathoracic foreign body.</p><p><bold>The case:</bold> A fifty-three-year-old woman, Jehovah's Witness, underwent surgery of aortal and mitral replacement and plastic operations on a tricuspid valve. 14 years later, for the appearance of new symptoms, she had a further successful operation. The postoperative course was marked mostly by rehabilitative therapies, until the onset of respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions and fever, complicated by heart failure, which culminated in the death, due to hematemesis. At first, a not medico-legal autopsy was performed, straight afterwards suspended for the finding of a 5 cm tumefaction in the mediastinum, consisting of surgical gauze. The Judicial Authority was informed and ordered the medico-legal post-mortem examination, three day later.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The judicial autopsy, in addition to the signs of previous necropsy, showed findings on heart (globose and hypertrophic), lungs (hepatized) and stomach (ulcers), thereby identifying the cause of death in the Multi Organ Failure (MOF) complicated by gastro-enterorrhagia for cardial ulcer. The mediastinal mass, consisting of partially digested and flaked surgical gauze, free from active inflammation, was radiographically compared with a sample of gauze in use at the last division of Heart Surgery where the patient was hospitalized, appearing completely different in kind. Histopathological examination of the viscera showed an acute generalized infectious involvement of multiple organs, which was quite consistent with the proposed cause of death, whereas that of garzoma, with no signs of acute and subacute inflammation, confirmed the initial macroscopic evaluation, indicative of a dated retention in the thorax of the foreign body.</p><p><bold>Discussions:</bold> The case of malpractice, here reported, highlights the diagnostic and interpretative difficulties, regarding the incidental finding of a foreign body in the mediastinum, if the radiographic investigations, performed for chronic nonspecific symptoms, should not be conclusive. In particular, it is difficult to identify the role played by the intrathoracic foreign body, as primum movens in the genesis of sepsis responsible for the death, lacking post-mortem signs of active inflammation. Thereby, the histopathological investigation confirmed their essential importance in proper comprehension of a case.</p><p><bold>PP-329</bold></p><p><bold>Fatal injuries in cyclists: analysis of the epidemiological and medico-legal aspects and of the protective role of the helmet in a post-mortem case record in the territory of milan from 1995 to 2010</bold></p><p><underline>Luca Barulli</underline><sup>1</sup>, Marta Bianchi<sup>2</sup>, Graziano Crudele<sup>2</sup>, Guendalina Gentile<sup>2</sup>, Riccardo Zoja<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istituto di Medicina Legale – Università degli Studi di Trieste</p><p><sup>2</sup>Laboratorio di Istopatologia forense – Sezione di Medicina Legale – Università degli Studi di Milano</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The involvement of the bicycle in traffic accidents is growing, especially in large urban conglomerates, such as, for instance, the Milanese one. The use of this form of transport is aimed for sports or recreational activities and its diffusion is due to logistic expediency. and ease of use. However, bicycle crashes are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, due to simple falls and involvement of motor vehicles. In either event, the effect is often represented by head-brain injuries, which could be significatively reduced, if not even avoided, as reported by numerous studies, with the use of a suitable protective helmet. In Italy, despite the amendments to the legislative Decree of 30 April 1992, n° 285, introduced by the Law of 29 July 2010 n.120, the use of helmet is optional, as it is not mandatory even for children under 14. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the efficacy of helmets, especially as regards lethal head-brain injuries.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A retrospective study was performed using a post-mortem case record, collected between 1995 and 2005 at the Section of Legal Medicine of the University of Milan, relating to all cases of death due to road traumatism, with significant involvement of a bicycle. The analysis of the available necroscopic documents allowed to investigate the kind of the found lesions, the circumstances of the accident, and, if present, the protective efficacy of helmets.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The number of cases was equal to 269 (1.6 % of total), examined considering various parameters: sex (male in 81 % of cases), age bracket (52 % of cases between 60 and 79 years), survival (64 %), seasonal trend of the events (oftener during spring and summer) and crash site (urban roads). The accidents happened in three ways: direct impact (231 cases), running down of the cyclist (31 cases), and impact followed by projection against obstacle (7 cases). The protective helmet was worn by only one victim. In most cases (84 %), the pathological lethal found was head-brain injuries, related with non-use of helmet.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The high number of helmetless cyclists, who died from injuries sustained in the cephalic region, would require legislative implementation of proper measures of prevention, such as the obligation to wear helmet, required for all two-wheelers, and the creation of special cyclists-reserved lanes.</p><p>This in order to reduce both the number of accidents and the frequency and severity of injuries suffered by road cyclist users.</p><p><bold>PP-330</bold></p><p><bold>Postmortem trace elements in lung and its relationship with changes due to chronic exposure to tobacco</bold></p><p><underline>María D Pérez Cárceles</underline><sup>1</sup>, Miguel Motas<sup>2</sup>, Agustin Sibón<sup>3</sup>, Silvia Jerez<sup>2</sup>, Rosa Martínez González<sup>2</sup>, Francisco J Pallarés<sup>4</sup>, Aurelio Luna<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Legal and Forensic Medicine, University of Murcia, Spain</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Toxicology, University of Murcia, Spain</p><p><sup>3</sup>Institute of Legal and Forensic Medicine, Cádiz, Spain</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Pathology, University of Murcia, Spain</p><p>Different components of tobacco are heavy metals.

We studied 62 medium lobes of lung from subjects with a mean age of 56 years. The different concentrations of trace elements (Ni, Sr, Br, Cd, Pb, Cr, Zn, As, Se) have been determinated in lungs. Solutions of lungs were prepared by acid-assisted microwave digestion by employing HNO3 and H2O2, and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Lung tissue samples were examined under light microscopy. The severity of pathological changes was scored. Peribronchial inflammation was prominent, especially the presence of aggregates. Furthermore, the subjects exhibited alveolar destruction, emphysematous changes, epithelial proliferation, and increased alveolar macrophages, whereas control group did not. Vascular wall thickness, perivascular leukocyte-rich inflammation and interstitial inflammation were of moderate severity in subjects exposed to tobacco smoke. We found significantly higher levels of cadmium, bromine, nickel, arsenic, chromium and strontium in lung with histopathological changes due to chronic exposure to tobacco.</p><p><bold>PP-331</bold></p><p><bold>Carbon Monoxide Intoxication Death in the North of Portugal (2005–2011)</bold></p><p><underline>Maria Moura</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ricardo Mendes<sup>1</sup>, André Castro<sup>1</sup>, André Castro<sup>4</sup>, Sónia Tarelho<sup>1</sup>, Sónia Tarelho<sup>4</sup>, Helena M.

Domestic accidents, caused by heating devices, are a public health problem worldwide; they constitute an important problem that is happening in Portugal mainly during winter, requiring special attention. CO intoxication also becomes an important subject since it can easily be used to commit suicide. This study aims to describe the epidemiology and characteristics of CO poisoning death in the North of Portugal.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> All the autopsy reports from the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine with CO toxicological requests were analysed, between January 2005 and December 2011. Data from circumstances of death, month of the year, gender, age, marital status, racial afinity, CO source, toxicological results, carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) blood values and medico-legal death etiology were analyzed. SPSS 19 was used for the statistic analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In this period, 112 people died by CO intoxication: 70 % (n = 78) were male (ratio female:male = 1:2.4). The highest frequency of death (36 %; n = 40) occurred in the group over 65 years; the youngest was 4 and the oldest 93 years, both females. Deaths occurred mostly in winter, especially in January (27 %; n = 30) associated with fires (46 %; n = 39) and heating devices (30 %; n = 24), at home (56 %; n = 62). Mostly (63 %; n = 55) were diagnosed as domestic accident and 20 % (n = 18) as suicide; 56 % (n = 62) of the victims were alone at the moment of the occurrence.

It is usually classified into two groups, ie,exogenous or endogenous, depending on the source of lipid found in the lungs. Symptoms can vary significantly among individuals. The usual presentation occurs with nonspesific respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and/or caugh. Radiologiacally lipoid pneumonia can manifest as consolidations or pulmonary noduls of soft tissue dansities. These presentations involve a wide differential diagnosis. Owing to the nonspesific clinical presentation and radiological features, the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. Generally acut presentation runs a benign caurse if promtly treated. Chronic cases are more persistent and difficult to treat. Possible complications include superinfection by nontuberculous mycobacteria, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory insufficiency, cor pulmonale, and hypercalcemia.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> In this study, 10-year old female who had microcephally, tetraplagia, and mental-motor retardation is presented. She was presenting bronchopneumonia symptoms and hospitalized before she had died. Autopsy was performed in morgue department of Council of Forensic medicine, in Izmir. Grossly, the lungs were heavy, firm, and edematous. Microscopically, edema, hemorrhage, acut inflamatory infiltration, large lipid inclusions, foreign body giant cells, and macrophages were seen. The diagnosis is exogenous lipoid pneumonia.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diagnosis of this disease requires high index of suspicion and can be comfirmed by histo/cytological examination of respiratory samples. Physicians and pathologists should consider this medical condition in order to prevent delaying of the diagnosis.</p><p><bold>PP-340</bold></p><p><bold>Death following malfunction of mechanical ventilation in als patient: “natural” or “mechanical” asphyxia?</bold></p><p><underline>Marco Di Paolo</underline><sup>1</sup>, Laura Evangelisti<sup>1</sup>, Nicolino Ambrosino<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Section of Legal Medicine – Department of Neuroscience - University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Pulmonary Unit, Cardio-Thoracic-Vascular Department, University Hospital, Pisa, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Amiotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disease with most affected patients dying of respiratory compromise and/or pneumonia 2 to 3 years since diagnosis. As ALS progresses, ventilatory assistance is required. In the end stages of disease, patients suffer from respiratory failure and become ventilator-dependent. Deaths due to malfunction of mechanical ventilators are reported but forensic autopsy records are very few. We report the case of a 69 years old ALS female ventilator-dependent, trachostomised patient found dead by her husband, with the ventilator in “stand-by” mode.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> A forensic autopsy was performed. Samples of internal organs were taken for histological and toxicological examination. The ventilator internal memory was also analyzed and tested in order to find possible malfunction.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> gross examination did not reveal any sign of trauma but showed brain and lung congestion. Pulmonary histological examination revealed thickening of peribronchial interstitial space, alveolar over-distension, break of inter-alveolar walls and diffuse alveolar haemorrhages. Focal microhemorrhages were also detected in other organs. Analysis of the ventilator internal memory showed that during the night of death, several voltage drops happened. Specific tests revealed malfunction of the internal battery which was unable to provide the necessary voltage, as a consequence the ventilator switched off, stopping ventilation. Battery malfunction reduced the volume of the ventilator’s alarm which was not heard by caregiver.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Histological pattern, with acute pulmonary emphysema and focal polivisceral haemorrhages, is strongly suggestive for a death due to “acute mechanical” asphyxia. The authors discuss the hypothesis that ALS patient maintained a residual breathing capacity and coul still answer to hypoxia. In the present case the hypothesis is that when the ventilation stopped, the patient produced a respiratory effort trying to breath spontaneously, but found a mechanical obstacle due to the presence of cuffed tracheostomy cannula.</p><p><bold>PP-341</bold></p><p><bold>Giant cell myocarditis in newborn</bold></p><p><underline>Doğuş Özdemir Kara</underline>, Dilhan Türkkan, Sultan Pehlivan, Hanife Alkan Kurt, Barış Akduman, Mustafa Karapirli</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Idiopatic giant cell myocarditis (IGCM) is a rare cause of arrhythmia, heart failure and death in children. Abouth %20 percent of cases myocarditis is associated with number of immune disease. The etiology or an exact cause of IGCM is unknown. Endomyocardiyal biopsy and histological examination is need to be done for diagnosis. In our case, 1 month old baby boy was dead during breast feeding without any known disease before. The family has been warned abouth cardiac arrhytmia but no further diagnosis was made.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The baby boy was autopsied. During autopsy, we could not find any gross pathology and any postmortem toxic substance was not found either. Tissue sampling from main organs were done by pathologist and H&amp;E stained slides were prepared and evaluated.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> When H&amp;E stained cardiac slides were examined by pathologist, we saw widespread and multifocal necrosis with mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells. Admixed with the infiltrate were fibroblastic proliferation and multinucleated giant cells in the absence of sarcoid like granuloma. That whole view perfectly fits the IGCM.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We want to share this case with other colleagues just to remind them IGCM as a rare and highly mortal disease.</p><p><bold>PP-342</bold></p><p><bold>Bronchpulmonary Dysplasia in Preterm Infants</bold></p><p><underline>Dilhan Türkkan</underline>, Doğuş Özdemir Kara, Sultan Pehlivan, Hanife Alkan Kurt, Mehtap Yöndem, Mustafa Karapirli</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Backround:</bold> Bronchopulmanary Displasia (BPD) is actually is a problem of premature infants. But it can be explained like: mature babies’, children’s, even adults’ choronic lung disease. In neonatology it can be described like; continued oxygen requirement and need for supplemental oxygen because of the lung pathotologies in new born babies. BPD evolution risk increases when the infants with birth weight &lt;1250 grams and less mature infants(&lt;28 weeks’ gestational age). It is a disease that mortality and morbidity risk is high. In infants with BPD, the sudden death risk is seven times greater in infants with BPD than the infants who don’t have BPD.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The preapared sections of lung, which is sent to our laboratory, from the postmortemed case in Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey are stained with H&amp;E method and scanned in light microscobe.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our case is born in 7,5 months, after three week treatment our case discharged from the hospital and found dead in bed with no reason. This case’s microscopic investigation: airway epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, alveoler wall thickening and peribronchial as well as intersitial granulation tissue. The current view is that BPD is caused by an arrested development of alveoler septation at the sacculer stage.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this cases histopathologic investigation is one of the most important step of finding the reason of death. Sudden death in BDP can lead to malpractice allegation.

Death rarely occurs in acute stage and most fatalities being reported in subacute/healing period in nearly 2 % of patients. Necrotizing arteritis of subepicardial coronaries, leading to coronary aneurysm, thrombosis and dissection of coronary arteries, myocardial ischemia and myocarditis are the best known causes of death.</p><p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A 4-months-old baby boy, internalized with prolonged fever, oropharengeal hyperemia, gastroenteritis and skin rashes, died after 10 days of antibiotheraphy, according to the acute cardiac and respiratory failure, was autopsied in Morgue Department of Council of Forensic Medicine.</p><p>Necrotizing coronary arteritis with extensive occlusive thrombosis that involve the subepicardial coronary tree, myocarditis, endocarditis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia were found on macroscopical and histopathological autopsy examination of the case.

This type of asphyxia occurs as the result of applying external pressure to the neck. Strangulation can indicate usually using either of the hands or a ligature. Although they are the most common type of examples of strangulation, this type of asphyxia can be done by means of forearm or a rough object (mugging). The physical examination and autopsy findings can vary according to the using objects. Using hand or ligature are the most common type of strangulation. Many kinds of material can be used as a ligature. Although strangulation was used as a judicial execution method by many commities historically, origine of the strangulation is usually homicide.</p><p>Our case was a 70 year old man.

The first manifestation of this entity can be sudden cardiac death. Besides identified many clinical risk factors for sudden death, presence of syncope in adolescence and young adults is of high importance as an index of sudden death. In this paper we present a case sudden death of an adolescent who previously had history of syncope and incidentally diagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p><bold>Case history:</bold> A 15 years old male was immediately collapsed while fishing and admitted to the emergency department of local state hospital. Obtained medical history revealed that he had previously admitted to hospital with the complaint of syncope attacks; however the family members were unwilling and left hospital without further medical investigation after initial physical examination. Family medical history showed that mother of deceased was already dead because of alleged myocardial infarction.</p><p>At autopsy, the thickness septum and antero-septal region of left ventricle at was measured as 3 cm, which cause a subaortic obstruction. Histopathological examination showed irregularly arranged hypertrophic myocytes characterized with interstitial fibrosis. Toxicological examination was negative except 48 mg/dl of ethanol detected in blood sample. The death was attributed to the idiopathic subaortic stenosis caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy result in sudden cardiac death by a number of mechanisms, which might be prevented through early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Syncope, which might indicate cardiac pathologies, should be regarded as an important symptom particularly in young adult. As in presented case, since hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder, family members of affected individuals should also be examined for early diagnosis.</p><p><bold>PP-347</bold></p><p><bold>Application of FTIR Spectrocopy in forensic medicine and sciences</bold></p><p><underline>Ramazan Akçan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Emre Karacaoğlu<sup>1</sup>, Gökhan Gitmiş<sup>1</sup>, Aysun Balseven Odabaşı<sup>1</sup>, Alper Keten<sup>2</sup>, Ali Rıza Tümer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ankara Atatürk Trainin and Research Hospital</p><p>Various physical, chemical, and molecular techniques to detect and determine the quantity and composition of a variety of compounds have been utilized in Forensic Medicine and Sciences. Among these, Fourier Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) takes place as a sensitive and accurate technique. Furthermore FTIR spectroscopy is largely applied to obtain the molecular fingerprint of compounds such as biological samples, drugs, fibers, plastic, rubber, liquids and etc. Thanks to these, for many years, FTIR spectroscopy has been used in many different fields of science. In recent years, number of application areas increased remarkably in parallel to the development of the spectroscopic methods. In this presentation we aim to discuss the basic principles of FTIR spectroscopy and its use in the areas of Forensic Medicine and Sciences.</p><p>In medicine, use of FTIR spectroscopy has become more common in pathology and clinical biochemistry, in particular. FTIR spectroscopy provides biochemical mapping which is highly useful to detect biochemical change in tissues and set a diagnosis. Similar to the living, biochemical and pathological changes of tissues and organs can be described in postmortem cases. A few studies dealing with postmortem changes in biological samples have been performed to find out postmortem metabolic processes and to evaluate postmortem interval by FTIR spectral differences. Furthermore, application of this technique on possibly injured tissues has been used for determination of cause of death, in the literature.</p><p>Since FTIR spectroscopy is basically used to detect the molecular structure/molecular fingerprint of compounds such as biological stains, drugs, fibers, plastic, rubber, chemical agents, soil, liquids and etc. it can extensively be used in crime scene investigation, forensic chemistry, soil forensics, forensic toxicology, forensic anthropology and many more fields of forensic sciences.</p><p><bold>PP-348</bold></p><p><bold>Cytomegalovırus Enfection as a Cause of sudden death in New Born</bold></p><p><underline>Dilhan Türkkan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Doğuş Özdemir Kara<sup>1</sup>, Sultan Pehlivan<sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>1</sup>, Alper Keten<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Atatürk Training and Research Hospital United Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cytomegalovirus(CMV) is a member of herpes viruses family, which is one of the most common viruses cause congenital infections.

These stains might be useful in terms of DNA-profiling, pattern analysis for crime scene reconstruction and timing of the crime by determining various features of the stains. On the other hand, the physical or chemical structural features of surfaces that the blood dropped on may interfere with blood and complicate its analysis, which might consequently cause misinterpretation of the crime scene. To the best of our knowledge there has been no study dealing with the interaction between blood and the surface that the stain was extracted. This preliminary study was aimed to determine the interaction between blood and the type of surface that the stain was discovered on, by analyzing blood stains extracted from different surfaces using FTIR-ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection) Spectroscopy.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> Blood sample was obtained from a healthy adult and two drops of blood of 200 μl dropped on each of six different surfaces that would be available at a crime scene. Chipboard/wood, leather, glass, plastic, metal and ceramic tile were used as surfaces placed at normal room conditions. One of freshly dropped blood stains were immediately (at zero point) sampled and analyzed using Diamond FTIR-ATR Spectroscopy and the others left on the surfaces. At 7th day dried blood stains were analyzed by the same method. The FTIR-ATR spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–400 cm-1. From the obtained spectra the absorbance (Ax as the absorbance at wave x cm-1) ratios of major bands were used.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Major bands selected for the evaluation were 3282 cm-1, 2932 cm-1, 1639 cm-1, 1537 cm-1, 1394 cm-1, 1455 cm-1, 1239 cm-1, 1170 cm-1. Absorbance ratios (A3282/A2932, A1639/A1537, A1394/A1455 and A1239/A1170) were used to exclude thickness effect as FTIR absorbance might vary with thickness of sample. At initial analysis, major bands were observed at 3282 cm-1, 1639 cm-1 and 1537 cm-1 and absorbance ratios were the same for all surfaces. At 7th day absorbance ratios for five surfaces were similar; however, plastic surface showed higher number of ratios compared to others.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Findings of this preliminary study suggest that physical and chemical characteristics of plastic are likely to more interact with the blood comparing to other surfaces. However, further studies with different time intervals and larger samples are needed to reach more accurate results.</p><p><bold>PP-350</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of the Deaths Secondary to The Entrapment Under The Debris in Van Earthquake</bold></p><p><underline>Yavuz Hekimoğlu</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ipek Esen Melez<sup>2</sup>, Gürol Cantürk<sup>3</sup>, Zehra Zerrin Erkol<sup>4</sup>, Nergis Cantürk<sup>5</sup>, Mustafa Gökhan Dizdar<sup>1</sup>, Deniz Oğuzhan Melez<sup>2</sup>, Osman Nuri Güler<sup>6</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Van Branch of the Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Van, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Ankara University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Abant İzzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>5</sup>Department of Criminalistics, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Ankara University; Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>6</sup>Ministry of Justice Van Attorney Generalship, Van, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> An earthquake occurred on October 23, 2011 at 13:41 in Van city of Turkey. The epicenter of the earthquake was Tabanli, which is 17 km away from Van city center and according to Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute the magnitude of this earthquake was measured 7.2 on the Richter scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the deaths secondary to the entrapment under the debris following the earthquake, which was one of the largest on the scale in the country’s history.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Corpse external examinations / autopsy reports arranged by Van Attorney Generalship in the city center were evaluated retrospectively. Deaths secondary to the entrapment under the debris in earthquake were analyzed. Deaths which had occurred in the counties and villages and the cases whose death certificates had been arranged in the hospitals could not be included in the study. All the cases were analyzed according to gender, age, death place, regions and characteristics of the traumatic lesions, cause of death, and whether the autopsy had been performed or not. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 Packet Program.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Total 51 deaths secondary to the entrapment under the debris were evaluated. Twenty seven cases (52,9 %) were females and 24 cases (47,1 %) were males.

It is crucial to integrate the data obtained from the examination of the body with those derived from clinical documentation, crime scene inspection and information gathered from friends, relatives and witnesses. Is generally accepted that is necessary to consider the following elements: number, location and orientation of injuries, victim’s and/or perpetrator’s handedness, anatomical location of wounds, tentative wounds (hesitation marks), defensive wounds, victim’s clothing lesions.</p><p>The purpose of the present study is to analyze the differences between self-inflicted and non-self-inflicted, suicidal and homicidal sharp force injuries. In order to achieve this goal, a review of literature was conducted by searching on PubMed. The research yielded 568 potentially relevant articles. After excluding via title-screening the non-relevant papers, all abstracts were reviewed and the articles meeting the inclusion criteria underwent a full-text review.

It appears as a slimy brownish black disintegration of the gastric fundus, near the gastroesophageal junction, with release of the stomach contents into the peritoneal cavity. It can occur as early as 20 hours after death. It has been observed more frequently in association with poliomyelitis or associated with intracranial disorders of various types.</p><p>A woman of 59 years, went to the emergency deparment at the Hospital of Rome because he suffered from the previous evening, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The patient was a smoker, not taking medications and was free of major diseases. The blood pressure was found to be 120/70 mmHg. The laboratory tests disclose a modest neutrophilia (8.7 K / mcl), a moderate rise in blood glucose (184 mg / dl) and a slight hypertransaminasemia (GOT 59). The patient was treated with Plasil (1 vial), Buscopan (2 vials) and ranitidine (1 vial) intravenously. She was discharged with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis and prescription of fermenti lattice and antiemetics.</p><p>The next day the patient at the persistence of abdominal symptoms, she went back at the same hospital. On entering the patient appeared lucid and appeared agitated and abdomen poorly treatable and rhythmic cardiac activity. Blood tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, increased erythrocyte and platelet alteration indices of coagulation, renal, liver and pancreas, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia and an increased inflammatory markers. After 10 minutes the patient had loss of consciousness and massive food vomiting. Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient died.</p><p>A forensic autopsy was performed 48 hours later. The rupter of the gastric fundus was observed over a length of 8 cm with leakage of gastric contents into the abdominal cavity. There was no macroscopic evidence of peritonitis and the stomach wall adjacent to the rupture site was markedly thinned. Histological examination of a section of gastric wall from this area showed advanced autolysis without evidence of an inflammatory reaction.</p><p>The cause of death was established to be due to cardiac failure by severe electrolyte imbalance due to diffuse enterocolitis.</p><p>Gastromalacia is not directly related to the cause of death, but misinterpretations and wrong conclusions could lead to charges being brought to other fellow doctors who are in fact not guilty of any wrongdoing.</p><p><bold>PP-357</bold></p><p><bold>Subarachnoid hemorrhage and carbon monoxide exposure: accidental association or fatal link?</bold></p><p><underline>Fabio De Giorgio</underline>, Massimo Miscusi, Vincenzo M. Grassi, Francesca Cittadini, Giuseppe Vetrugno, Vincenzo L. Pascali</p><p>Institute of Legal Medicine, Catholic University, Medical School, Rome, Italy</p><p>Hemorrhagic lesions after carbon monoxide (CO) exposure or acute poisoning are rarely reported in literature. Usually, structures having a particularly high susceptibility to hypoxia are involved, such as basal ganglia, globus pallidus, or white matter.</p><p>We report a case of a 32 year-old man found dead inside his partially burned car. An autopsy was requested. At external examination, the main findings were: cherry red hypostasis distributed according to gravity; lips, tongue, teeth and nostrils covered in soot; neither burn injuries nor external signs of trauma on body. At autopsy, a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was observed. Histology confirmed the presence of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and soot particles in bronchi and bronchioles, suggesting vital smoke aspiration. Toxicological examination of blood, urine and hair revealed carboxyhemoglobin (COHb: 30 %); cyanide and commonly abused substances were absent.</p><p>After discovering the SAH, we excluded any possible site of bleeding. Interestingly, COHb was 30 % and similar levels, even if lethal only in elderly or in cardiopathic patients, caused hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy in a 20-year-old woman. Thus, although the cause of death is certainly SAH, it is not possible to ignore the presence of CO and its potential effect on vascular endothelium, involving cerebral vasodilation and oxygen radical damage. In fact, exogenously administered CO relaxes isolated blood vessels. After the inhalation of CO and the formation of COHb, cerebral vasodilation occurs. Hemorrhagic outcomes after acute CO poisoning have been described. The mechanism leading to cerebral tissue damage is supposed to be a consequence of loss in micro vascular integrity and direct vasodilator effects of CO on cerebral arterioles.</p><p>The investigators concluded that the man was probably sleeping in his car. An electrical short circuit in boot of the car ignited the fire, the smoke spread from the boot to the entire vehicle and the man began inhaling CO. While CO levels increased, the SAH would have occurred. Although we cannot certainly exclude that this was a mere coincidence and that SAH was secondary to rupture of a vascular malformation not seen autoptically, our hypothesis is that CO may have played an important role in the pathogenesis of the SAH, both causing or facilitating, due to its vasodilating effect on cerebral endothelium. Unfortunately, in the literature only few data regarding animal experiment are available, whereby further studies are necessary to evaluate the physio-pathological role of CO on human endothelium and its exact influence in the pathogenesis of SAH.</p><p><bold>PP-358</bold></p><p><bold>Die under the bed: a return into the den</bold></p><p><underline>Fabio De Giorgio</underline><sup>1</sup>, Annamaria Fiorillo<sup>1</sup>, Vincenzo M.

In the apartment, the police found the bedroom’s door opened. Just inside the room, lying on the floor, there were the slippers and the trousers. The bed was made and a corner of the duvet was reversed. Under the bed base there was the body of the man, supine on the floor in a pool of blood. To appreciate its exact position and to identify other traces of blood, every layer from the duvet to the mattress was carefully removed and inspected. The body was observed through the mattress frame: he was supine, the head was in contact with the wall, the limbs were extended. Around his head there was a dried blood pool and on the wall dried blood splash and dripping which came out from man’s mouth. The man was wearing a sweater, a shirt, pants and socks. The abdomen was uncovered and presented the typical putrefactive green color. After removing the bed base, the presence of maggots in the oral cavity was noticed. In the apartment a certificate compiled by the man’s personal doctor was found. In the pathological anamnesis, the following pathologies in this exact order were reported: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastritis, prostatic adenomectomy, chronic renal insufficiency, depressive syndrome, gallbladder lithiasis and urolithiasis.</p><p>From the psychological point of view, although it is reasonable that this behavior can be explained by the presence of a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, an ethological perspective may be proposed. It is instinctive for most animals to hide and find solitude when they are very sick, injured, or dying. There are two main reasons for this. First of all, the animal may want to find a safe place to hide and recover. The second major reason is to protect other members of the herd, family, or whatever group the animal may be a part of. In the wild, especially, an injured or sick animal is a major threat to the group as a whole. This behavior can be seen often in animals such as cattle and elk. Animals have an instinctive urge to isolate themselves when sick or hurt and in doing so protect the other members of their group.</p><p><bold>PP-359</bold></p><p><bold>Infective endocarditis vs non bacterial thrombotic endocarditis: overview and comparison</bold></p><p>Rossana Bussani<sup>1</sup>, Giuliano Pesel<sup>1</sup>, Gianfranco Sinagra<sup>1</sup>, Antonio Abbate<sup>3</sup>, Vincenzo M.

The term endocarditis refers to an inflammation of the endocardium that affects mainly, but not exclusively, heart valve leaflets.

Preexisting valve damage is a very important factor for both types of endocarditis.

The anatomical course of the artery leaves the epicardial adipose tissue and penetrates within the myocardium: the term "tunnelled artery" refers to the tract beneath the muscle. Myocardial bridges have long been considered a normal anatomical variant. Recently they have been classified in benign or pathological variant, according to the intra-myocardial length and depth. Pathological myocardial bridges may, in some cases, lead to ischemia, infarction, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular block and sudden cardiac deaths. We report two cases of sudden cardiac death in patients with post-mortem finding of myocardial bridging suffering from gastroenteritis.</p><p>A 42-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of colonic diverticulosis was taken to the emergency department because of persistent fever. After two days of hospitalization he died suddenly. At post-mortem examination, the cause of death was identified in a sudden cardiac death in presence of myocardial bridging triggered by a severe diverticulitis.</p><p>A 29-year-old man was visited at home in the evening because of fever and diarrhea. The following morning he was found dead. At post-mortem examination, sudden cardiac death in presence of myocardial bridging triggered by severe electrolyte imbalance due to diffuse enterocolitis.</p><p>According to the classification based on intra myocardial length and depth, the first case should have been considered benign, while the second a pathological variant. Nonetheless, in the first case, the myocardial bridging has not been just a normal anatomical variant but we hypothesize it was the pathological substrate capable of contributing to death.</p><p>In conclusion, our intent is to underline that forensic pathologist should carefully evaluate the autoptical finding of a myocardial bridge. In fact, even if its measurement could prompt to classified it as benign, it could still be able to cause death in specific conditions.</p><p><bold>PP-361</bold></p><p><bold>Fatal Pulmunary embolism during a corporoplasty for Peyronie’s Disease</bold></p><p><underline>Fabio De Giorgio</underline><sup>1</sup>, Vincenzo M.

It is characterized by the development of fibrotic inelastic plaques on the tunica albuginea surrounding the penile corpora, resulting in different degrees of penile bending, narrowing or shortening and sexual dysfunction. It is a relatively common disorder among men, with a reported prevalence of 3 % to 8 %. Men with significant penile curvature and satisfactory erectile function are often treated with plaque incision or excision and grafting. We describe a case of 61 year old man suffering from Peyronie’s disease who underwent a surgical intervention of corporoplasty according to Nesbit technique and suddenly died. Patient’s clinical history began approximately 18 months before, when penile retraction and marked deformity made the achievement of erection, and consequently sexual intercourse, impossible. At urological clinical examination, the most important finding was the presence of a fibro-calcific plaque localized at medium and distal shaft of the penis. During surgical intervention O2 saturation decreased until 80 %, BP was 80/50 mmHg, HR 50 bpm. Despite supplying 100 % O2 and atropine 1 mg, the patient developed asystolic cardiac arrest so cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed followed by defibrillation at 300 J twice and intra cardiac adrenalin injection. The patient was declared dead and an autopsy was requested. The autopsy revealed: cyanosis of the face; a surgical suture at penis level; normal in volume and shape heart, subendocardial circumferential pallor extending to mesocardial layer in anterolateral left side associated with moderate dilatation of right side; intramiocardic course of left anterior interventricular (descending) coronary; congestion localized at the bases of lungs; hyperemic tracheal and bronchial mucosae; erosive petechial gastritis with 300 cc of digested blood; edematous encephalon. At histological examination, pulmonary edema and diffuse thrombosis with intra-alveolar erythrocyte extravasation were observed. The cause of death was established to be due to pulmonary microembolism in periprostatic venous plexus thrombosis.</p><p>The thrombosis in periprostatic venous plexus is rarely reported in the literature and its capability of causing a fatal pulmonary embolism has been criticized. Moreover this complication is not between those reported in the literature as frequently occurring in the intervention practiced in this case.

Aortic aneurysms generally expand asymptomatically, but they can dissect the artery or rupture into a body cavity without warning. This is a life-threatening scenario even if the victim receives prompt medical emergency care. Thoracic aorta aneurysms are not as common as abdominal ones. They can cause a dull pain or dysphagia, thus taking the victim to a health care setting but, if the symptoms are mild, they can be overlooked and have potentially fatal consequences.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To contribute to the study of sudden cardiovascular deaths through the unusual presentation of an unknown thoracic aortic aneurysm.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> The subject was a 57 year old male. According to his son, he had been complaining about “back chest pain” for the last four months, but refusing to seek medical attention. He had also been eating less for undisclosed reasons. One day, while at home with his wife, he began profusely vomiting blood and lost conscience, dying at the scene. The subject had no previously known medical history.</p><p>The medico-legal autopsy was performed at the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine. External findings consisted of blood residue in the mouth. No signs of trauma were observed. Internal findings included a large fusiform aneurysm in descending thoracic aorta, measuring 18x10x7 cm, partially filled with a mural thrombus, and communicating with oesophageal lumen through a fistula, measuring 3x2 cm; stomach containing 1,5 litres of liquid blood and blood clots; erosion of the anterior aspects of the 6th and 7th thoracic vertebrae, adjacent to the aneurysm. The toxicological screening was negative for ethanol or drugs.</p><p><bold>Discussion and conclusions:</bold> This case is paradigmatic that self-undervaluation of long-term, albeit mild symptoms and refusal of seeking medical care can have death as a disastrous consequence. Nowadays, thoracic aorta aneurysms can be easily diagnosed, even in a primary care setting. Although with considerable risk, even with more modern endovascular approaches, they can be surgically managed. This death could have been avoided if the victim had looked for medical assistance at the time of the initial symptoms.</p><p><bold>PP-368</bold></p><p><bold>Self immolation in south of Tunisia</bold></p><p><underline>Adnen Ayadi</underline>, Karama Regaieg, Wiem Wiem Ben Amar, Sami Bardaa, Youssef Nouma, Malek Zribi, Zouhir Khemakhem, Zouhir Hammami, Samir Maatoug</p><p>Chu h bourguiba sfax (Tunisia)</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Deliberate self-inflicted burn is rare in high-income countries, but is reported more frequently in low- and middle-income countries. In Tunisia, the rate of self immolation, globally stable in the last years, had significantly increased in 2011, mainly after the political revolution of January 2011.</p><p>The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiologic features and risk factors of self-immolation in the south of Tunisia in order to understand this phenomenon and try to develop effective intervention programs in response to its recent remarkable increase.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> It is a retrospective observational study condacted at the forenscic unit of Habib Bourguiba Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, from January 2003 to december 2011. 41 self-immolation cases were recorded in this period.</p><p>All cases were reviewed for demographic variables and health related aspects including age, gender, living area, marital and employment status, mental illness history, previous suicide attempts and trigger factor. We also report the most important autopsy findings.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Demographic information revealed that self-immolation ranges in the fifth place of all methods of suicide used in the study period. The number of cases ranged between 1 and 5 cases per year between 2003 and 2010. Only in 2011, we recorded 14 cases.</p><p>Of all our cases, 80 % were male. The mean age was 32 years. Geographical features of self-immolation indicated that the self-immolation rate was higher in rural areas. In most of the cases, the victims doused themselves in inflammable fluid in public.</p><p>Unemployment was the most important risk factor reported. Social oppression and disadvantage played an important role for increasing the rate of self-immolation.</p><p>According to the autopsy findings, the median total body surface area burned was 82.5 % (range30-100 %). All the victims had soot in their respiratory tracts. Soot in the respiratory tracts was associated to soot in digestive tracts in 10 cases. Blood had a mean 21 % carboxyhemoglobin concentration.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study suggests that self-immolation is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes, directly associated with low socio economic status.</p><p>Despite the religious context strictly forbidding suicide, this phenomenon reached epidemic proportion and became a significant public health problem in our country since the revolution of January 2011. Self immolation is now considered as a form of protest against political and social discrimination.</p><p>Various intervention options should be discussed to prevent it. During the long-term, programs to and strategies should focus on social interventions.</p><p><bold>PP-369</bold></p><p><bold>Complicated or Unplanned Complex Suicide: A Case Report</bold></p><p>Veysi Asoglu, Esra Ozgun Unal, <underline>Murat Nihat Arslan</underline>, Bulent Sam</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>The phrase “Unplanned complex suicide” explains the situation where the victim tried another suicide method and succeed after an unsuccessful attempt for suicide. “Complicated Suicide” is a quite different phenomenon that characterized with the unintentional way of death, arises out of the suicide method.</p><p>A 48-year-old woman, with judicial information of fatal fall from height from the balcony of her apartment, referred to the Morgue Department for determining the cause of death. On the external examination in addition to traumatic findings due to fall from height, ligature mark has been detected on the neck. In the autopsy there were severe traumatic changes that lead to cause of death but also there were findings of a completed hanging. According to the autopsy report ligature mark was convenient with free hanging. At the crime scene report an antenna cable, tied to the door handle, was found in the balcony. And the free tip of the cable found at the inside of the balcony. There were o struggle findings either on the deceased body or at the crime scene. The cause of death was determined as the common effect of hanging and trauma.</p><p>When performing autopsies of suicide cases, it is hard to determine the origin if it was a suicide or homicide. Only with autopsy findings it should not be concluded either as a suicide or homicide. Especially in complex suicide cases and in complicated suicide cases it is very important to get and read carefully the crime scene report. And then it would be possible to drive the investigation on the right way.</p><p><bold>PP-370</bold></p><p><bold>Study of verification and analysis of probable doctor’s clothes contamination and its relation with the microorganisms found at the coat worn by this practioner, at the hospital area of Belo Horizonte/Brazil</bold></p><p><underline>Leandro Duarte De Carvalho</underline>, Eduardo Antônio Roquim E Silva, Phelippe Costa De Cerqueira, Robson André Junior, Paulo Augusto Oliveira Carvalho De Goes, Lucas Roquim E Silva</p><p>Medical Sciences Faculty of Minas Gerais</p><p><bold>Background and objectives:</bold> The health professionals are easily exposed to risks during their professional practice. The lack of caution while preventing diseases, with the inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is one of the most important causes that induce the rise of these risks to the health professional, to the patient and to the society, considering the PPE as a possible source for cross infection. The main objective will be to establish the physician’s clothes capacity of being a vehicle of contamination, not being this a problem only related with the physician’s coat.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The research was made with nine physicians at Santa Casa, HOSPITAL DAS CLÍNICAS e SEMPER hospitals of Belo Horizonte- MG. It was made an in-print of the internal part of the front leg’s pockets of the volunteers at the bacterial culture plates with Agar Mueller Hinton and Agar Sabouraud environments, followed by the incubation of the bacterial environment at the laboratory stove, and of the fungus environment at room’s temperature. The plates were identified differentiating the physicians that were arriving at the hospital from the one who were leaving the hospital. After the microbial growth, it was made the GRAM staining procedure of some of the bacterial colonies. The species found in this study were compared with the ones found at physicians coats identified in previous studies which were published at the scientific literature. Moreover, it was made a comparison between the microbes found in the cloth of the physicians entering with the ones leaving the hospital.</p><p><bold>Results and discussions:</bold> Cladosporidium, Penicillium and yeasts Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus sp. were the microbes found in the plates identified as “arriving at the hospital”; yeasts Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus SP and bacillus of the family Enterobacter were found in the plates identified as “leaving the hospital”. The difference between the microbes found at the clothes of the physicians who were entering the hospital and the ones who were leaving was statistically irrelevant.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The presence of potential pathogenic microorganisms at the physician’s clothes, as the S. aureus and yeasts, was frequent, indicating that the doctor’s clothes also can be a contamination source, just as the already proved coat.</p><p><bold>PP-371</bold></p><p><bold>Contamination of physicians’ stethoscopes who works in hospital area: medical-forensic implications</bold></p><p><underline>Leandro Duarte De Carvalho</underline>, Carolina Beatriz Brum Paiva, Lucas Roquim E Silva, Wagner Leonardo Amaro, Arinos Romualdo Viana</p><p>Medical Sciences Faculty of Minas Gerais</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Analyze quantitatively and qualitatively the microbiological contaminations in stethoscopes’ diaphragms used by physicians, verify the efficacy of antisepsis performed with 70 % ethanol and stimulates medical discussion of related legal implications.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using the method in print, cultures of 70 private stethoscopes of randomly selected physicians in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais - Brazil, hospital area were taken, between March and November 2010. The cultures were made on Müller-Hinton and Sabouraud agar plates and were incubated for appropriate development of bacteria and fungi. This procedure was performed twice in each stethoscope, one before and another after 70 % ethanol cleaning. For identification and classification of each isolated colony were performed standardized tests and, to bacteria, antibiogram.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> It was not found any fungi colonies in the samples. Before the antisepsis with 70 % ethanol, it has been isolated 182 different types of bacterial colonies. 98,6 % (69), of the 70 surveyed stethoscopes, were contaminated at least with one specie. Identified species included coagulase negative Staphylococcus (64,3 %), being 41 % Amoxicillin resistant; Staphylococcus aureus (4,4 %), 50 % Chloramphenical resistant; Enterobacteriaceae (2,1 %), 100 % Ceftazidime resistant, and gram positive bacillus. After the antisepsis, it was isolated 62 distinct types of colonies, that means 66,1 % less contamination than found before, and 22 samples (34,3 %) did not have any kind of bacterial growth. Also, it has been found coagulase negative Staphylococcus (62,9 %) and the antibiogram indicated that 30,8 % of these were Amoxicillin resistant.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Stethoscopes can be vectors in the dissemination of nosocomial infections, duo to high incidence of bacteria on the diaphragm. Frequently, antibiotic resistant bacteria were isolated. It can result in medical-forensic irreversible implications for the physician and his patient’s health. It is clear that the adherence to regular stethoscope disinfection practices is fundamental, and the 70 % ethanol proved to be a powerful alternative.</p><p><bold>PP-372</bold></p><p><bold>Atypical lymphoid infiltration of the heart as a random autopsy finding</bold></p><p>Nikolaos Goutas<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Emmanouil Sakelliadis</underline><sup>1</sup>, Dimitrios Vlachodimitropoulos<sup>1</sup>, Soultana Marianou<sup>2</sup>, Stavroula Papadodima<sup>1</sup>, Chara Spiliopoulou<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, National &amp; Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece</p><p><sup>2</sup>Athens Forensic Service, Ministry of Justice, Athens, Greece</p><p>We report the case of a 68 years old male that was referred to the Athens Forensic Service for autopsy after sudden unexpected death.

The corpse was sent for autopsy and tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination, with the autopsy revealing as probable cause of death the perforation of a duodenal ulcer. The main findings of the autopsy were the perforation of the duodenal ulcer, a tumor of the heart, a tumor of the thyroid and finally a tumor of the left kidney. The tissue samples were sent for histopathological examination in the Department of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology of the University of Athens. The results revealed infiltration of the myocardium, of the thyroid and of the external surface of the left kidney by a malignant neoplasm with characteristics of multiple myeloma.

The patient was diagnosed with soft tissue inflammation (at the time thought to be perianal fistula) and was subsequently led to the operating room for surgery. During the surgery, a second diagnosis was reached, that of Fournier’ s gangrene, thus leading to surgical debridement of the affected area. The patient remained under general anesthesia and was transferred the day after to the ICU of another hospital. At the second hospital surgical debridement was repeated several times and colostomy was as well performed. During these surgical operations, a foreign body perforating the rectum was observed, it was in fact a piece of bone. The patient remained in the ICU for approximately 17 days and subsequently died. The corpse was then referred to our department for medico - legal investigation. The autopsy combined with histopathological examination revealed focal necrosis of the brain, the liver and the kidneys, as well as multiple inflammatory foci in the heart, the lungs, the abdominal wall and the uterus.

Mangiagalli 37, 20133 Milano</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Suicide cases usually report a unique kind of lesion: either stab injuries, or gunshot lesions, or hanging, or poisoning, or precipitation and so forth. Sometimes, suicide victims perform a strange complex ritual involving several different self-inflicted lesions, to reach their purpose. Since the beginning of 2012, two very peculiar cases have come to the attention of the Institute of Legal Medicine in Milan.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> CASE 1: a 36-years-old transexual women was found dead in her home, with a knife stuck in the thorax and another stab injury beside the previous one. A pajama sleeve was tied tightly around the neck and the gas stove was open. At autopsy, the neck groove was depressed but there was no evidence of excoriation; both thyroid horns were fractured, with blood infiltration. Stabbing injuries involved the left lung, diaphragm, stomach and spleen. Toxicological analysis showed a small amount of alcohol (0.29 g/l) in the blood and the presence of benzodiazepines in blood and urine. Instead, the presence of carbon monoxid in cardiac blood was very low (2,7 %).In the gastric content there were chemicals such as methylpalmitoleate, ammonium laurate and so on, normally used in detergents, which she had presumably swallowed.</p><p><bold>Case 2:</bold> The latter concerns a 49-year-old woman, who jumped from the sixth floor and was found dead on the sidewalk beside her house. Law enforcement officers found in her flat a farewell letter; a plastic chair on a table in the terrace, probably used to climb over the wall and reach the roof; an almost empty plastic bottle containing sodium hydroxide, and a kitchen knife on the roof. At autopsy the presence of multiple stab injuries in neck, chest and abdomen were found, causing a lesion to the jugular vein. The stomach contained 500 ml of a brownish-blackfowl-smelling liquid, conditioning the presence of a blackish mucosal surface and a hypertrophic plicature. However the cause of death were the multiple skeletal and visceral lesions due to the contusive mechanism of the fall.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Literature contains many case-reports of complex suicides: they account for 1,5-5 % of all suicides. In most cases a double-modality of combined suicides is described; three-modality ones are more rarely observed. We report a four-modality-combined suicide (described only once in literature), in which there is more than one deep stab wounds: even cases of multiple stab wounds in suicides are reported few times in literature.</p><p><bold>PP-375</bold></p><p><bold>Medical legal implications of cardiac contusion: a case report of death due to cardiac conduction of system injury from a blunt chest impact following traffic accident</bold></p><p><underline>Stefania Zerbo</underline>, Cettina Sortino, Elvira Ventura Spagnolo, Emiliano Maresi, Valentina Triolo, Paolo Procaccianti</p><p>Department of Biotechnology and Legal Medicine, Univerity, Palermo, Italy</p><p>Cardiac contusion, usually caused by blunt chest trauma, has been recognized with increased frequency over the past decades.

The man was not seat-belted in the retro passenger seat. External examination found a few bruises in the right tempora, and ecchymoses on anterior surface of right emithorax, a small contusion in the middle third of the sternum with hemorrhagic infiltration of the subcutaneous tissues, few bruises in the upper and lower limbs. The autopsy revealed a small area of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left parietal region, contusion of left lung, hemorrhagic infiltration of the left intercostal muscles, hemorrhagic infiltration of tissue borne para-aortic and paratracheal in correspondence of the 7a- 8a - 9a dorsal vertebra.</p><p>Heart macroscopic examination showed punctiform ecchymoses on the posterior wall of the right atrium and in the left margin of heart and coronary atherosclerosis. The histological examination of cardiac conduction of system (CCS) showed hemorrhagic infiltration of atrio-ventricular node and His' bundle. Toxicological analysis revealed blood ethyl alcohol level of 2.05 g / l.</p><p>Although cardiac injury including contusion of the myocardium itself was not so extensive, it was presumed that arrhythmia was induced by the cardiac conduction system failure, which was considered to be the effective cause of death.</p><p>This report suggests that when the autopsy findings and toxicological examinations are inconclusive, the histological examination of cardiac conduction system is helpful for revealing the cause of death diseases of the CCS and improving the quality of forensic pathological diagnosis.</p><p><bold>PP-376</bold></p><p><bold>A case of unexplained lesion pattern.

It may be solitary or multiple. Apart from the main body of spleen, accessory spleen is the variation that is seen in omentum majus and minus, mesentery, thorax, gastric fundus and pelvis. On the fifth week of embryological development, the spleen primordium appears as a mesodermal proliferation in between the two sheets of mesogastrium. As the dorsal mesogastrium elongates, the spleen slides to the left and fuses with the periton on the posterior wall of the abdomen. In our study, 3 cases of accessory spleen that were seen in the autopsies that were performed by our department in 2011 are discussed. First case; on a 61-year-old male died of an acute myocardial infarction, in addition to the main spleen, 2 accessory spleens with the largest diameter of 7 cm. and 3 cm. were seen in the splenic hilum. Second case; on a 2-month-old male infant died of aseptic (viral) meningitis, in addition to the main spleen, 2 capsulated accessory spleens with the largest diameter of 0.4 cm. and 0.3 cm. were seen adjacent to the splenic hilum. Third case; on a 12-year-old male died of a compression between the elevator cabin and the wall, 3 accessory spleens with diameters of 2 cm., 2 cm. and 0.5 cm. were seen in the splenic hilum.

It is also a substantial source of morbidity in the United States and the Western world. Varicosis is found in 15–50 % of the population. Several risk factors associated to the development of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency or both are older age, female gender, family history, obesity and standing occupation. Small arteriovenous communications (AVCs) are an important etiology of varicose veins and stasis ulcers of the lower extremities. Haemorrhage from ruptured varicose veins of the legs can occur spontaneously or after a minor trauma. More frequent complications of varicosis include peripheral oedema of the ankles, skin ulcers and varicose eczema. On the contrary, in most forensic practices fatal haemorrhage from rupture of varicosis is a rare event. One case of fatal varicose vein rupture is reported. A 80-year-old man, was found dead in the bedroom of his apartment. Traces of blood were found in the whole room. The body showed typical signs of death due to exsanguination. A large pool of blood was found on the floor. The scene analysis allowed to evaluate the presence of small spatters of blood on the back of the left foot. An external examination of the victim showed a circular lesion linked to a subcutaneous arteriovenous anastomoses. Blood spatters investigations and circumstantial data allowed us to detect the cause of the breaking of the ulcer. In fact, the sock worn by the victim presented a circular blood crust that served as a “cap” on the skin lesion (ulcer). Analysis of the collected data showed that the old man, removing the sock, at the same time tore out the crust (cap) from the lesion. Other traumatic lesion was not found. In particular blood stain patterns analysis was performed in order to understand the origin and the location of venous and/or arterial bleeding. However, blood projected from ruptured varicose veins of the lower limbs may also result in a similar pattern of projected, disseminated fine bloodstains. In this case the cause of the haemorrhage was a small lesion of the skin of the left lower leg of the victim linked to a small arteriovenous communication. At first sight, fatal haemorrhage, with massive traces of blood, may be associated to the death scene related to a crime and focus primarily on a non-natural death.</p><p><bold>PP-379</bold></p><p><bold>Death by ingestion of caustic substances: case report and review of literature</bold></p><p><underline>Francesca Pepe</underline>, Isabella Aquila, Ciro Di Nunzio, Arianna Serra, Francesco Ausania, Pietrantonio Ricci</p><p>University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Chair of Legal Medicine</p><p>Ingesting caustic substances represents a common event which may result in serious injuries of the gastrointestinal system.

The vast majority of hangings are suicidal and only occasionally are accidental or homicidal cases. Internal injuries of hanging are characterized by: fracture of the hyoid bone and/or laryngeal cartilages, cervical fractures, muscle haemorrhages, vascular lesions. At external examination there are specific hallmarks of hanging. In particular sulcus skin is the most common external sign. Characteristics of the hanging mark vary in relation to the type of suspension and ligatures used.</p><p>In this paper, we describe 8 cases of the hanging mark in which were analysed the association between the characteristics of hanging mark and the characteristics of the method of suspension and ligatures employed. The analysis of the suspension medium used was conducted through the evaluation of the nature of ligatures: soft, smooth, hard and rough. After this analysis, we compared the macroscopic characteristics of the skin with the ligatures used. In some cases (3) we showed the correlation between soft and smooth ligatures with the clear hanging mark. In five cases we correlated macroscopic characteristics of the brownish hanging mark with hard and rough ligatures. We also showed that the rough and hard ligatures left a negative impression in the skin of the fabric’s weft of the medium used in contrast to the smooth and soft ligatures. Also it is possible identify the number of rope turns in cases of hanging by rough and hard ligatures compared to binding soft and smooth. Also in the hanging mark by hard ligatures we founded the presence of small blisters and excoriations yellow-orange.</p><p><bold>PP-381</bold></p><p><bold>An Original Wound Model As a Result of Postmortem Animal Attack</bold></p><p>Cihan Göktürk, Ali Tavasli, Evrim Akça Kaya, <underline>Deniz Oguzhan Melez</underline>, Ipek Esen Melez, Bulent Sam</p><p>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>In this study, autopsy findings of postmortem lesions formed on the body as a result of the attacks by wild animals were assessed.

The identification of VOCs released from decomposing remains provides investigators with a plethora of potential applications; forensic information, material for training cadaver dogs, development of field analytical devices for dead victims, determination of the post-mortem interval. The potential use of VOCs emissions from dead bodies is so far examined using mainly combined analytical instrumentation, such as thermal desorption gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD/GC/MS) utilizing both active and passive sampling into solid sorbents and solid phase microextraction GC-MS (SPME-GC-MS).

For comparison reasons, the first pig was placed in a full closed body bag to limit the diffusion of the gases in the air and the second in an open body bag under the ruins. VOCs were sampled using preconditioned stainless steel sorbent tubes which were subsequently analyzed using a TD/GC/Time-of-Flight MS (TD/GC/TOF-MS). Daily inorganic gas monitoring was also performed with the use of portable gas detectors.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among samples differences were observed in VOCs, inorganic gases, temperature, and humidity measurements. A variety of VOCs were identified including almost all chemical classes: sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen compounds, hydrocarbons, fluorides and chlorides. During the first two days of decomposition the majority of VOCs released were hydrocarbons, including acetone, benzene, toluene and xylene. The VOCs released during days 3–5 revealed the main compounds involved in the decomposition process. Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide were the most prominent odorous VOCs during these days. The main inorganic gases detected were carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulfide.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The multiple volatile products identified provide important information not only for the location of buried bodies and entrapped victims but also for documenting some commonly encountered products when performing toxicological analyses on decomposing remains.</p><p><bold>PP-383</bold></p><p><bold>Is every histopathologically determined fat embolism syndrome the exact cause of death?</bold></p><p><underline>Emine Turkmen Samdanci</underline><sup>1</sup>, Dilhan Turkkan<sup>2</sup>, Dogus Ozdemir Kara<sup>2</sup>, Sultan Pehlivan<sup>2</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>2</sup>, Alper Keten<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Inonu University School of Medicine, Pathology Department, Malatya Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Ataturk Training Research Hospital, Forensic Pathology Department, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fat embolism syndrome (FES), is a rare and serious complication that was seen after multiple trauma. Petechiae, unconsciousness and respiratory failure are the clinical findings of FES within three days after severe trauma or orthopedic surgery however laboratory and radiological diagnostic methods are not available. In contrast to patients hard diagnosed, followed in clinic, assessed judicial cases with FES, histopathological diagnosis of tissue samples, is easier. But the often diagnostic finding of lung vascular lumen fat globules that seen in FES are not specific for the syndrome. In judicial cases without any trauma we found the same findings the with the real FES.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> 212 autopsy cases performed Council of Forensic Medicine in Ankara with the histopathological diagnosis of FES were evaluated retrospectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 76.4 % of the cases were male (n:162) and 23.6 % (n:50) were female. The mean age was 56.1 years (range 3 to 89). Cardiopulmoner resuscitation (CPR) was performed to the 60.4 % of the cases (n:128). 45.3 % of the patients who underwent CPR (n:58) did not have any history of trauma. 48.3 % of the patients (n:28) were made CPR due to myocardial infarction and in the remaining cases of (51.7 %, n:30) with multiple bone fractures, which is mostly happened after traffic accidents and falls from height.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FES is one of the exact cause of death in forensic practice. However, a substantial portion of patients with postmortem histopathological findings of FES does not constitute definitive cause of death. Affecting the process of criminal cases when FES was diagnosed histomorphological findings should be correlated with autopsy findings.</p><p><bold>PP-384</bold></p><p><bold>A Case of Medical Malpractice ?: Truncus Arteriosus</bold></p><p><underline>Hatice Gülbeyaz</underline>, Deniz Oguzhan Melez, İpek Esen Melez, Hakan Efil, Pinar Bakir</p><p>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Persistent truncus arteriosus is a rare form of congenital heart disease. The incidence is &lt; 3 % among the congenital heart anomalies. A single great artery arises from the two ventricles in this anomaly and sometimes two arteries arise but without complete separation from each other with only a membrane between them. There can be also a concomitant ventricular septal defect. Pulmonary arteries arise from this truncus. If surgical repair is not done, mortality is 50 % in the first month, 80 % in the first 3 months, and 88 % within the first year. Truncal valve insufficiency, aortic interruption, coronary anomalies and DiGeorge syndrome are among the significant factors impacting the mortality.</p><p>The case we present was a 40 day-old female infant who did not have any medical intervention. The infant was hospitalized when she deteriorated, then she was referred to a university hospital from the first hospital and died during the transport. Because of the family’s suspicion regarding possible medical malpractice in the first hospital, the case was referred to the Council of Forensic Medicine Morgue Department for autopsy to determine the cause of death. In autopsy, all organs were found to be laterally on just the opposite direction like a lateral mirror image (situs inversus totalis). Besides, in detailed macroscopical examination of the heart, pulmonary artery and ascending aorta were seen to be arising as one root as truncus arteriosus and one venticule was detected instead of two separate ventricules. Thus, the case was decided not to be a malpractice.</p><p>Truncus arteriosus can be diagnosed in fetal life and early intervention can be life saving. The aim of this case report was to emphasize the significance of early diagnosis and point to the importance of autopsy in potential medical malpractice cases by demonstrating the findings even when there is no previous medical report on the underlying cause.</p><p><bold>PP-385</bold></p><p><bold>Retrospective analysis of suicide cases in the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria</bold></p><p><underline>Marin Kostadinov Baltov</underline></p><p>Retrospective analysis of suicide cases in the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria</p><p>Suicidal dynamics is being followed in the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria for the period of 2000 – 2009.

Hypothermia can be divided into two categories as primary and secondary according to its etiology. The loss of the body temperature can be through radiation, convection, conduction and evaporation.</p><p>Hypothermia shows its affects on the body through thermoregulatory system with a number of mechanisms. Instantaneous or slowly progressing types of behavioral adaptations can be seen on the individual. In forensic medicine, these mechanisms can explain the immediate behavioral changes, which can be seen on the crime scene. However, the hide-and-die syndrome, the messy house syndrome and the paradoxical undressing can show variations.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Our case was an 82 year-old male, who had relatively low self-care and in low socioeconomic class. The crime scene report revealed that his house had been opened after 2 days in which there had been no contact with him. The house was messy, there were broken electric and wood-burning furnaces in his bedroom, and the comforter was on the floor. The body was lying face-up, and was between the comforter and the furnaces; the lower part of the body was naked except a sweater’s arm worn on his left leg. The external examination confirmed that there were lesions consistent with frostbite on the peripheral parts of body known to be sensitive to cold. Besides, crepitations of the joints, hardening of the scrotal skin were noted. The internal examination revealed submucosal focal bleeding areas consistent with Wischnewski ulcers in the gastric mucosa.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> During the crime scene investigation, besides the paradoxical undressing and messy house syndrome secondary to exposure to cold, “inappropriate dressing”, a behavior which is not mentioned in the literature, was also noted.</p><p>“Inappropriate dressing” points to a possibility of at least partial regain of consciousness during a stage of paradoxical undressing which is secondary to some unknown changes in consciousness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a possible hypothesis by sharing our knowledge and experience with an extensive literature search.</p><p><bold>PP-388</bold></p><p><bold>Suicide by high voltage electrocution in south Tunisia</bold></p><p><underline>Samir Maatoug</underline>, Wiem Ben Amar, Malek Zribi, Sami Bardaa, Adnen Ayadi, Karam Regaieg, Youssef Nouma, Zouhir Khemakhem, Zouhir Hammami</p><p>Department of forensic medicine CHU Habib Bourguiba,Sfax,Tunisia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> High voltage electrocution is a relatively infrequent mode of suicide which is surprising in view of the availability of means.</p><p>In fact, only a few cases are reported in the forensic literature.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> To identify the risk factors of suicide by high voltage, its features and to insist on the danger of the mediatization in increasing the prevalence of this way of suicide.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Retrospective case–control study, based on the autopsy records collected in the forensic unit of HABIB Bourguiba in Sfax (Tunisia), from January 2007 to December 2011.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 7 suicidal deaths from high voltage electrocution occurred between 2007 to 2011, representing 0,7 % of all cases of suicide.</p><p>The distribution is uneven depending on the year.

Of these, 189 were committed using a firearm (39.7 % of total homicides). The average annual incidence was 0.5/100.000 inhabitants. The assault was more frequently in public places. The victims were mostly males (n = 138), aged between 20–49 years. While female victims (n = 51) were assaulted by their husband or ex-husband in the context of family violence (23.5 %) or for passion motives (17.6 %), males were assaulted by strangers or non-relatives for futile reasons, such as robbery, retaliation or prior enmity. The majority of victims were hit with a single shot (66.1 %), being the chest the region most frequently shot (28.6 %). The short-barreled weapons, especially guns of 6.35 mm caliber, were the most used (65.6 %). It was not possible to define a typical trajectory of the bullets once they differed depending on the location of the entry wounds. Only 11 % of the victims suffered additional forms of violence. The toxicological tests revealed that 65 victims (34.4 %) had a positive blood alcohol concentration, 7 (3.7 %) tested positive for "illicit drugs" and 2 (1.1 %) for medicines. The present study provides data which may help prevent this type of violent deaths.</p><p><bold>PP-390</bold></p><p><bold>Hypothermia related death – a retrospective study (2000–2011)</bold></p><p><underline>Krisztina Danics</underline>, Marta Hubay, Agnes Dosa</p><p>Department of Forensic and Insurance Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hypothermia is defined as body temperature below 35.0°C. There are two subtypes of hypothermia: hypothermia with intact and with impaired body temperature regulation. Hypothermia can be further subdivided into three different degrees: mild; moderate; severe. Below 25°C the functioning of vital organs is seriously endangered. In case of hypothermia the toxins originating from the decomposing tissues lead to general intoxication, causing death.</p><p>Autopsy findings in fatalities due to hypothermia are unspecific. Lividity and blood is usually reddish in color, the signs of right heart failure are often present, and Wischnewsky spots (small hemorrhagic gastric erosions) can be seen. If the possible cause of death is hypothermia, a complete toxicology screen for alcohol and drugs should be performed.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective autopsy study was performed for a twelve-year-period (2000–2011), the relevant data were collected from the autopsy records of the Department of Forensic and Insurance Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest. The data were analyzed according to gender, age, the presence of Wischnewsky spots, core temperature (measured at the scene or in the hospital), survival time, the presence of frostbite areas, blood alcohol concentration. Special attention was given to the scene (in-door or out-door place).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The number of hypothermia related death cases increased in the observed period, and surprisingly many of the victims were not homeless people. Wischnewsky-spots were present in 85 % of the cases. The average core temperature was 26°C. Frostbite injuries were present in 1/3 of the cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on our findings we conclude that that he cause of death must be based on the circumstances of death, suggestive autopsy findings (such as the Wischnewsky-spots) and exclusion of other causes.</p><p><bold>PP-391</bold></p><p><bold>Firearm-related incidents in the north of Portugal: legal consequences and social–economical burden (2004–2008)</bold></p><p><underline>Luís Marques Fernandes</underline><sup>1</sup>, Nuno Sousa Pereira<sup>2</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>1,3,4,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Medicine of Porto University, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>EGP – Business School of Porto University, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine – North Branch, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>4</sup>CENCIFOR - Forensic Sciences Center, Portugal</p><p><sup>5</sup>School of Health Sciences, Minho University, Portugal</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> although firearm-related incidents are not a major health problem in Portugal, their number increased in the past few years. Since 2005, violent crimes perpetrated with firearms have risen to numbers never seen before: in this setting, carjacking, robberies to jewelleries and gas stations, and homicides, are the most common type of crimes. The loss of years of life and the consequences resulting from injuries caused by firearms represent high socio-economic costs.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> this study aims to be the first to quantify the social costs due to firearm-related incidents in North of Portugal, both fatal (homicidal, suicidal or accidental) and non-fatal ones (minor and major), as well as analyze the legal consequences of firearm related incidents after the introduction of the new Portuguese Firearms Law, in 2006.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> a retrospective study was made using data from autopsy reports of the National Institute of Legal Medicine – North Branch, Criminal Police, Courts and Jail Services reports, and clinical registrations, in the period between 2004 and 2008.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusions:</bold> in this period, firearms were responsible for a total of 281 deaths and 618 non-fatal injuries. In fatal cases, the manner of death was homicidal in 34.2 % (n = 96) of them, suicidal in 60.9 % (n = 171) and accidental in 4.9 % (n = 14). In suicides, the most used guns were handguns (65 %). In contrast, shotguns were used in 48 % of all homicides. Shotguns were also responsible for all the observed accidents. This study analyzed and characterized: (1) the mean sentence to serve in jail for crimes involving the aggression with firearms; (2) the medical mean costs by type of injury; (3) the loss of productivity for the society; (4) the mean costs of police investigations; (5) the mean costs of judgment and imprisonment. The obtained results can add an important contribution to the evaluation of the new Firearms Law efficacy, both in the prevention of firearm-related crimes and accidents and in the reduction of social-economic costs.</p><p><bold>PP-392</bold></p><p><bold>Unusual suicide by a router saw: a case report</bold></p><p><underline>Wiem Ben Amar</underline>, Malek Zribi, Sami Bardaa, Zouhir Khemakhem, Adnen Ayadi, Youssef Nouma, Karama Regaieg, Zouhir Hammami, Samir Maatoug</p><p>Department of forensic medicine CHU Habib Bourguiba,Sfax,Tunisia</p><p>Suicide by power saws (bland, chain, circular or router saw) are extreme exceptions.

Physical examination of corpse revealed an abdominal distention consistant with a 4–5 months of pregnancy and traces of needle entry on both elbows and dorsum of her left hand. In her autopsy, brain, cerebellum and brain stem of her weighed 1360 grams. From her right hemithorax 400 cc serohemorrhagic fluid and from her left hemithorax 1700 cc coagulated blood were drawn. A 50 cc serous fluid was collected from her pericardial space. Some atherom plaques were observed in her arcus aorta. There were also some endothelial irregularities surronding the orifice of the anuerism. The orifices of the aneurism were located at the wall of left subclavian artery with 0.8 cm in size and and the upper end of the aortic arch with 2 cm in size. The thin walled saccular aneurism with advetitial hemorrahges was anostomozing with vessel walls and had 2 tears with 0.5 cm and 0.2 cm in lenght. The hearth was 239 gram.

According to our knowledge, the use of a wood cutting machine is not yet reported in the existing literature as a suicidal mean.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> A 44-year-old man was found hanged with complete suspension inside the toilet of his house with three wounds in flexor surfaces of the forearms. Blood spots were observed in the decedent’s house, and in an electric wood cutting machine placed in the living-room floor. A bottle of chlorine was found, next to a semi-filled glass containing also chlorine. Two hand written suicide notes were placed on the furniture next to a kitchen knife. Signs that would have raised suspicions of previous violation of the space were absent. Besides, the victim had a history of a previous use of antidepressant medication, but he had stopped taking them without medical consultation.</p><p>The autopsy apart from the typical ligature marks at the decedent’s neck, it also revealed three self-inflicted hand wounds without hesitation marks besides them. The one of them was an incised wound of the flexor surface of the left elbow caused by knife. The other two wounds were chop wounds with characteristics of incision and blunt force trauma in combination, placed in the flexor surface of the right elbow and in the flexor surface of the left wrist, respectively. They were caused by an electric wood cutting machine found in the house full of blood. Former consumption of chlorine was excluded.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The cause of death based on case history, scene and autopsy findings, is attributed to cerebral hypoxia due to hanging, and the manner of death is suicide. In spite of the former self inflicted wounds caused by a knife and an electric wood cutting machine, medicolegal examination of the body proved that the decedent was capable of physical activity. Probably, in too much pain, he decided to cease his life with a less painful method, that of hanging.</p><p><bold>PP-395</bold></p><p><bold>Suicide in the context of intimate partner violence – A case report</bold></p><p><underline>Paula Carina Oliveira</underline>, Rui Oliveira, Susana Tavares, Francisco Corte Real</p><p>Center Branch of National Institute of Legal Medicine, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Intimate partner violence (IPV) is broadly defined as a pattern of abusive behaviors within intimate relationships. It has been associated to many health consequences including depression and suicidal behavior, being one of the most extreme one the victim´s suicide. The relation between intimate partner violence and suicidal ideation is moderated by depression that is the most prevalent mental-health sequelae of IPV. Furthermore suicidal behavior was identified as one of the most alarming sequelae of IPV. Abused women are more likely than non-abused women to have a history of suicide attempts.</p><p>Most of the times, the correct identification of IPV-related suicide deaths is not made so easily, mainly because there is lack of information on the circumstances surrounding the suicide. This study intends to contribute to a better understanding of the suicide phenomenon in context of IPV, to improve the professionals’ knowledge in this area and help to prevent suicide.</p><p><bold>Case Report:</bold> The authors report a case of suicide (hanging) of a fifty-eight years old woman, institutionalized since the previous day in a shelter, for being victim of intimate partner violence for several years and with depression unresponsive to their family situation. We recorded previous suicide attempts, with a recent hospitalization for pesticide ingestion (suicide attempt), occurred after a physical assault inflicted by husband, which resulted in a penetrating trauma in the right eye, with subsequent blindness.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study highlights that collecting routinely social information and data about circumstances surrounding the suicide is crucial so that IPV-related suicide deaths can be correctly identified. Also, recognizing prior IPV and improving mental health care services, should have a positive impact in decreasing suicide deaths in the context of abusive intimate relationships.</p><p>The present study has also important implications for health care professionals. An awareness of the association between intimate partner violence and suicidal ideation can lead to the development of effective preventive strategies and intervention programs. Proactive monitoring of the identified cases through phone calls or home visits may also be considered, and psychosocial support programs should be provided to victims who are depressed. Therapeutic sessions are also recommended to safeguard or reduce the possibility of these individuals committing suicide.</p><p><bold>PP-396</bold></p><p><bold>Pethidine releated sudden death</bold></p><p><underline>Zehra Bozdağ</underline><sup>1</sup>, Emine Türkmen Şamdancı<sup>2</sup>, Nurhan Şahin<sup>1</sup>, Nasuhi Engin Aydın<sup>2</sup>, Sadegül Sayın<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Pathology.

Affects more women than men, with an estimated female to male ratio from 1.4 to 2.3. There is progressive neurodegeneration and multifocal areas of demyelination with loss of oligodendrocytes, astroglial scarring and axonal injury. Macroscopically, it reveals itself as gray discoloration (plaques) spread throughout the central nervous system. Chronic plaques are sunken and grey and generally sharply defined. Acute plaques have a rater more granular appearance. The outcome of the progressive form of MS is usually poor, leading to early death, due to progressive neurologic deterioration.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The authors report a case of sudden death in a fifty years old woman whom social information appeared stuck with the intrusion of food in the upper airways and a history of multiple sclerosis and severe disability. Albeit the known patient’s clinical history, a forensic autopsy was required.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At necropsy, samples of heart, lungs, liver and kidneys were collected for ancillary histological evaluation. After brain and spinal cord fixation in a 10 % formalin solution, a further neuropathological evaluation was performed. This exposed widespread plaques of gray discoloration of the white matter, noted mainly in periventricular areas of the cerebral hemispheres, pons and spinal cord. Samples of brain, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord were additionally collected. Histopathological analysis showed extensive autoimmune demyelinating phenomena of the central nervous system sections and severe bronchopneumonia, the ultimate cause of death. Toxicological quantitative analysis showed therapeutic blood levels of propranolol.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The investigation of sudden death among young adults with progressive neurologic disorders is uncommon in forensic practice. In most cases, death is expected and usually there is thorough clinical documentation to support the premature fatal outcome. In this case, notwithstanding there was no wary fact in the victim’s clinical background, a forensic autopsy was required, mainly to exclude a violent cause of death by food intrusion in the upper airways, providing us the chance to analyze such a progressive neurological disorder and, to some extent, contribute to its further characterization. We must emphasize that the accurate analysis of the post mortem brain, pons, spinal cord, heart, lungs, liver and kidneys examination is mandatory to provide vital information related with victim’s disease and exclude a violent death.</p><p><bold>PP-398</bold></p><p><bold>Oxidized Bullet Secondary to Long-Term Stay in the Body: Case Report</bold></p><p>Fatih Yildiz<sup>1</sup>, Adnan Celikel<sup>1</sup>, Sayit Ozsoy<sup>2</sup>, Ipek Esen Melez<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Deniz Oguzhan Melez</underline><sup>1</sup>, Murat Nihat Arslan<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Firearm wounds constitute a significant percentage of forensic cases. According to our law, the fine is determined based on the degree of the injury. When there are multiple perpetrators causing firearm wounds, the injury that each individual caused is assessed separately for determining their fine according to their part in the whole injury. This is an important responsibility of the forensic medicine specialist performing the autopsy.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> There were a total of 5 firearm wounds in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, right thigh, and right hand in this case. The radiologic examination revealed presence of a bullet image in the right lower abdomen, and right tuber ischiadicum. A discrepancy was noted when the external firearm wounds and radiologic examinations were compared. Thus, the exploration was continued to be able to find the ‘extra’ bullets seen in the scopy image but couldn’t be matched with a firearm entry wound. Then, after a long exploration a 7.65 mm oxidized bullet encapsulated with a fibrotic tissue was found in the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the right lower abdomen and in the bone tissue of tuber ischiadicum during the autopsy. Based on these findings, it was concluded that these bullets were the results of a previous firearm injury despite the lack of any wound at the external examination of the abdomen except widespread striae.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The aim of the current study was to emphasize the significance of demonstrating short-term versus long-term changes in the firearm wounds with images, when there is discrepancy in the radiological and external examination findings.</p><p><bold>PP-399</bold></p><p><bold>Suicide by hanging and nonlethal self-inflicted injuries – a case report</bold></p><p><underline>Paula Carina Oliveira</underline>, Claudia Marques, Susana Tavares, Francisco Corte Real</p><p>Center Branch of National Institute of Legal Medicine, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The self-inflicted injuries can be divided into two major groups: the self-inflicted injuries lethal and nonlethal.</p><p>Self-harm behavior is defined as any attempt of intentional and direct injury on body tissue, by an individual, in order to cause self-harm. Often used as a way to draw attention or as an emotion regulation strategy or relief of pain. It presents itself in many ways such as: small cuts on the body, superficial, regular, with equal depth on both sides, often parallel, especially on the non dominant part of the body and originated from cutting objects. The self-inflicted behavior can become a natural response to the stress and may increase the frequency and severity. People who self-inflict can be considered high risk to repeat the same behavior. The lethal self-inflicted injuries are called suicide, and the hanging was the method often used. In these cases, the victim usually leaves a note to justify such act, showing that suicide is, in general, a carefully planned act. Some authors recognize the high risk of suicide in people with history of nonlethal self-inflicted injuries.</p><p>Autopsy of a 34-years-old man whose death was due to mechanical asphyxia by extrinsic constriction of the neck (hanging). In the death scene conducted at the residence of the victim was found a farewell note. During the autopsy we found several wounds superficial, linear and parallel, in the flexor and extensor surfaces of the forearms and wrists. We also observed numerous linear scars in those regions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case highlights for the understanding of the relation between self-inflicted injuries lethal and nonlethal. It’s important to know the relation between the victim’s history and the medico-legal diagnosis made. Suicide cuts are mostly inflicted by sharp instruments. The presence of linear scars may suggest previous attempts. In many attempts of suicide the victim replaces the method of cutting the handles after some experimental incisions and tries other type of self-destruction that expects to be more effective. The left wrist is the most common target of right-handed people, but frequently they cut both wrists.</p><p>As there is no clinical marker for self-injury behavior, often these individuals are not taken seriously by other people who come to doubt what they feel and, at a later stage of life, after the attempt suicide, they end up consummating the act. Men tend to use violent self destruction methods characterized by high mortality, such as hanging.</p><p><bold>PP-400</bold></p><p><bold>penetrating chest wounds by knives</bold></p><p><underline>Mohamed Bachir Tidjani</underline></p><p>department of medicine -Constantine- Algeria</p><p>penetrating chest wounds by swords are frequantes in our city because of widespread violence in our metropolis. they warrant special attention due to morbidity and mortality. a retrospective study in our analysis the different parameters.. these wounds penetranters result sex masculindans almost all of the cases of aggression. they interessnt young adults,</p><p><bold>PP-401</bold></p><p><bold>Complex suicides: Two cases report and a review of literature</bold></p><p>Clarice Mestre, Filipa Gallo, Luísa Eiras, Maria Cristina Mendonca, <underline>Jorge Costa Santos</underline></p><p>National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal – South Branch</p><p>Complex suicides occur when more than one method is used in order to commit suicide, whether simultaneously or sequentially.

Dolores Perez Carceles, Aurelio Luna</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine University of Murcia</p><p>In Spain, the practice of autopsies carried out due to violent deaths or deaths suspected of criminality, are regulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. In the particular case of car accidents, our legislation allows The Police to be the one who directly performs the removal of the corpse; they carry out a report where they describe how the accident happened and which is later sent to the judge. Therefore, in this case, the forensic doctor does not know how the accident happened. This can lead to an error, because in some cases like run overs, the forensic doctor does not have the initial information that the ocular inspection in the place of the accident provides, and when performing the examination of the corpse, it can present wounds which can lead to believe that they could have been produced by different means.</p><p>Given the fact that a run over implies a complex traumatism with a wide variety of injuries, we can face problems when it comes to the medical-legal diagnosis of some of the wounds that the corpse may present. This means that a differential diagnosis with other possible medical etiologies, such as homicide, should be performed.</p><p>An example of this is illustrated in our study, which consists of a deceased male who was run over by a truck when he left the car he was driving in a highway. When starting the autopsy and performing the initial external examination, we could observe, amongst other injuries, a wound that looked like the result of a sharp stab, in the middle- superior region that did not seem compatible with the features of the run over he suffered. This opened the possibility that such wound might have been produced by a knife, making us consider, then, a homicidal etiology.</p><p>After studying the Police´s report, including detailed photographs, and wreckage of the vehicle which could have been responsible for the mentioned injury, a morphological comparative study was carried out. Through this study, we could check the compatibility between a metallic remain of the vehicle and the observed lesion, and the study was completed with a DNA analysis of blood samples found in the object.</p><p><bold>PP-403</bold></p><p><bold>Severe hemorrhagic myocardial infarction</bold></p><p><underline>Carmen Torres Sánchez</underline>, Faustina Sánchez Rodríguez, Juan Pedro Hernández Del Rincón, M.

There is no record of previous cardiac symptoms. As an interesting macroscopic finding during the autopsy, a 939-gram heart with hemorrhagic infiltration in the surface stands out.

Pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis and abdominal bleeding may occur as well.</p><p>Pulmonary edema as the first presentation of pheochromocytoma is uncommon and usually fatal. In most cases it is cardiogenic in origin. Nonetheless, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may also be observed rarely (only 7 cases have been reported in the literature since 1966). It is believed to occur as a result of catecholamine-induced transient increase in pulmonary capillary pressure due to pulmonary vasoconstriction and altered pulmonary capillary permeability.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> The authors present the case of a 39-year-old female, former drug abuser who died unexpectedly at her residence, in her 6-year-old son’s presence. During autopsy, a spherical tumor 3.5 × 2.5 cm was detected on the left adrenal gland, along with massive edema of the lungs each weighing more than 900 g. No further pathological lesions were identified during autopsy. The toxicological analysis of whole blood, urine, bile and gastric content was negative. Microscopic and immunohistochemical examination of the tumor specimen revealed a pheochromocytoma.

We refer to traumatic disorders due to external contusive injuries, without any major damage to the vital organs and underline the need to quantify their patho-physiological effects, with the purpose of establishing the homeostatic threshold for the onset of the death-generating syndrome.

Belonging to the Order Hymenoptera the genus Apis is created around the world and these insects also have great medical importance since they are cause of human deaths due to the toxicity of their venom. In Brazil, in the 50s, there was hybridization of European and African strains of Apis, known as "Africanized Bees" (AB), with good production of honey and highly aggressive behavior. Since then, in Brazil there are hundreds of reports of serious and fatal accidents caused by AB. A bee can kill a human being by two mechanisms: hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs as a result of individual predisposition that is not related to toxicity of the venom. The other way is attributed to the synergistic action of two venom's compounds, melittin and FA2, whose predominant symptoms are nausea, vomiting, weakness, hypotension, pulmonary edema, tachycardia, loss of consciousness and shock.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Male, 81 years-old. Hometown Cáceres-MT, hight 1.68 m and obese. In june's 7th, 2010, the victim suffered a massive attack of AB. The victim had countless bee stings, with presence of stingers and glandular structures visible on the skin. The highest concentration of bites occurred on the face, neck, ears and the proximal portions of the corpse's chest, sparing areas covered by clothing. A large number of stings around showed the presence of bruises.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> the countless injuries that the victim suffered caused his death. We considered that this victim had his death almost instantly (not a common fact) due to the large number of stings and the excessive amount of venom inoculated. The causes may be multiple, but it is necessary to consider venom 's cardiotsoxicity and its potential to cause hypotension and shock as a major cause of death. The glottis, in direct examination, had no swelling that would justify the death of allergic phenomena. Hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis are delayed effects that would not manifest itself as an in acute envenomation, but the venom appears to cause local bleeding, detected through the bruising and bleeding around the stings. The victim's expertise was determined by massive exogenous envenomation caused by AB attack.</p><p><bold>PP-410</bold></p><p><bold>Experimental study IN VITRO about dettection of Cocaine Capsules swallowed by “Human Mules”, using wraps with Aluminium foil</bold></p><p><underline>Manoel Campos Neto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Clemente Calvo Castilhone Júnior<sup>2</sup>, Ivo Antonio Vieira<sup>3</sup>, Antonio Mário Da Silva Ibanez Filho<sup>4</sup>, Sérgio Castelo Branco F.

Capsules containing drugs (cocaine and pasta base) are swallowed by the "human mules", usually involved in resistant materials to prevent the action of digestive juices, avoid leaking and bypass the diagnostic imaging equipment. Often, among the various layers of capsule shells, they use carbon paper, fingers of surgical gloves, rubber balloons, PVC films, automotive solar control film (obscuring glass) and recently, also aluminium foil. <bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the wraps in conventional radiography and computerized tomography, analyzing its ability to hinder detection of capsules.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using a test tube with saline solution, sealed with plastic stoppers and involved in the same materials used by drug traffickers, the samples were numbered and radiographed with x-ray equipment (TFX 15, GE, USA), being documented on radiological film and digital file. The material was also scanned on a multislice CT (model BrightSpeed, GE), with slice thickness / reconstruction of 3.75 mm and printed on special equipment (Dry-view Laser Printer 8900, Kodak). The images were analyzed by a radiologist expert and CT analyzed quantitatively by the specific device (ROI - Region of Interest).</p><p><bold>Results / conclusion:</bold> There was no detectable difference in radiological density of the contents in the RX and CT scan. The densities (Hounsfield scale) showed little difference attributed to the positions of the object within the field of vision.

Thus, inevitably becomes a gateway to narcotic's traffic to Europe, Africa and to a lesser extent, to the United States. Although the main concern is focused on domestic consumption of marijuana, cocaine and crack. Consumption of synthetic drugs is also growing as small ecstasy's exports to European markets, just like appoints United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Brazilian's law does not provide a generic classification of drugs. It depends on an exhaustive list of proscribed substances provided by the Ministry of Health. This feature makes that this list of drugs, should be changed every time there is a new drug, generated from chemical modifications of an existing one, for example. Thus, criminal organizations manufacture drugs by slight modification of the molecular structure of illegal substances, staying on the sidelines of national and international monitoring. The most consumed synthetic drug in Brazil is ecstasy (3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) seized by police since the 90's. In march 2011 a new drug, diferent of brasilian's drug standards where identified. Methamphetamine as a drug of abuse, usually comes in many different settings and the most common forms are crystals and powder, getting the names of ice, speed, crystal, meth, among others. Forty one tablets were seized at several locations in São Paulo state during August to December 2011. The initial chemical and physicochemical results were negative for narcotic substances listed in Ordinance No. 344/1998 SVS-MS that are routinely investigated according to law. However, all of them contained synthetic drugs and were sent to the Narcotics Division to further analysis. It was observed that 20 samples were positive for MDMA associated with caffeine. Methamphetamine was the second psychoactive substance found in 11 samples. The high amount of methamphetamine found in those seized tablets, drew authority's attention because methamphetamine, is defined in national legislation only as a psychotropic substance, subject to reporting revenue "A", but it does not figure in prohibited substances list. In this case the interaction between Judicial Police and Scientific and Technical Police was crucial for an efficient detection of this new expression of synthetic drug, triggering the process to seek its inclusion on the banned substance list and subsidizing research and tracking of drugs.</p><p><bold>PP-412</bold></p><p><bold>Cocaine Base Paste (PBC) - Ways of transportations on the Western borders of Mato Grosso – BRAZIL</bold></p><p><underline>Manoel Campos Neto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Clemente Calvo Castilhone Júnior<sup>2</sup>, Ivo Antonio Vieira<sup>3</sup>, Antonio Mário Da Silva Ibanez Filho<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>POLITEC - Perícia e Identificação Técnica - Seção de Medicina Legal - Regional de Cáceres-Mato Grosso-Brasil.</p><p><sup>2</sup>DENARC - Polícia Civil do Estado de São Paulo e UNIBAN /ANHANGUERA Educacional - Universidade Bandeirante de São Paulo - Brasil</p><p><sup>3</sup>MINISTÉRIO DA FAZENDA - Departamento de Perícia Oficial Federal - Cuiabá - Mato Grosso - Brasil</p><p><sup>4</sup>GEFRON - Grupo Especial de Segurança de Fronteira - Mato Grosso - Brasil</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> According to annual reports from institutions responsible for monitoring drugs in the world, Brazil is considered the largest consumer of cocaine in Latin America, serving as a corridor and route for the distribution from the manufacturers in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Make inventory and research, with the cooperation of the Federal Police Department of Caceres, the GEFRon (Special Security Frontier) and the Federal Highway Police, about the ways expedients used in the illegal transport of the drug thought the west borders of Mato Grosso State – Brazil, side by side with Bolívia.

Recently, more precisely on July’s 22th, 2009, at the International Airport Marechal Rondon, Varzea Grande, MT were arrested two "HUMAN MULES" coming from Bolívia (J.M.S., male, 30 years old and F.M.G.Q, female, 22, both bolivians), when they were held in the metal detector device. Later, in the emergency room of Cuiabá, with the x-rayed and it was diagnosed the presence of swallowed capsules in their abdomen. With specific proced and under medical supervision, they expelled the cocaine capsules (with 90 and 80 capsules respectively), aroused great interest in authors by the unusual material used in the cocaine’s wraps: ALUMINIUM FOIL.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> Present to the medical community of other states in Brazil this new expedient to wrap swallowed cocaine capsules, documented with the images detected with only by the x-ray.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Study carried out by evaluating all radiographs of the abdomen obtained from the patients and compare with other standard radiographs.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The RX method had already defined the patterns in the detection of cocaine capsules swallowed, being common expedient used by the "human mules" in western border of Mato Grosso (Brazil – Bolivia). These characteristics should be considered in the evaluation of suspected cases, especially in regions of known high incidence of drug traffic or transit route for drugs. Besides the quick diagnoses being useful for the suppression of drug traffic, avoids any abdominal complications that can even lead to death of the patient. The lack of familiarity of radiologists and health professionals in general can lead to greater difficulty in finding an accurate diagnoses, especially in areas where drug traffic is unusual for this type. As outcome of our research, we present two recent cases photos, confirming the presence of aluminum foil among the layer of swallowed capsule wraps, without modifying the characteristics of these images comparing with other standard previous studies carried out by the authors.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The cylindrical abdomen radiographies images show soft tissue density and sharp boundaries, best seen in the region where its laps are highlighted by contrast with the adjacent gas.

Annaba, Algeria</p><p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of magnesium against nickel-induced oxidative liver injury in male albino rats. Male albino rats were randomly divided into four groups, where the first group was served as a control, whereas the remaining groups were respectively treated with magnesium sulphate (296 mg/l in drinking water), nickel sulphate (2 mg/100 g b.w./day, intraperitoneally), and a combination of nickel sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The treatment of all groups was lasted for three consecutive weeks. Liver dysfunction parameters represented by glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, serum glucose, serum total protein and serum albumin were estimated. Liver glutathione level, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were also determined in liver as indicators of oxidative damage. Exposure of rats to nickel caused a significant decrease in body weight and an increase in liver weight compared to the controls. Nickel treatment was also led to high glucose concentration and produced oxidative liver injury characterized by increasing GPT, GOT and ALP activities. Meanwhile nickel administration decreased serum total protein and albumin in animals. In addition liver glutathione level, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were diminished due to high lipid peroxidation. However, the administration of magnesium with nickel resulted in a remarkable improvement of the previous parameters comparison with rats treated with nickel alone. Liver histological studies have confirmed the changes observed in biochemical parameters and proved the beneficial role of magnesium. In conclusion, nickel sulphate led to hepatotoxicity and enhanced an oxidative stress by disturbing the tissue antioxidant system, but the Mg coadminstration offered a relative protection for liver against nickel intoxication probably to its indirect action in reducing the levels of oxygen reactive species.</p><p><bold>PP-415</bold></p><p><bold>RP HPLC determination of benzhexol hydrochloride in tablet formulations and urine</bold></p><p><underline>Ashraf Mohamed Ahmed</underline></p><p>A new, rapid and sensitive reverse phase HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of benzhexol hydrochloride in tablet formulations and urine.

In Brazil the first crack seizure was made in 1992. Since then its use has spread throughout the country, reaching indiscriminately, beyond the urban centers, rural areas and small and medium cities, representing a serious public health. In a recent research, its estimated that 2 % of Brazil's population (people over 16 years) have experienced the crack, representing about 3 million people. In São Paulo state, crack is now considered the second most common drug, losing only to the alcohol. The police strategy is usually focused on struggle against drug's supply chains, arresting the main drug dealers and dismantle gangs. However, the demand continued to grow and problem emerged in small urban areas with large conspicuous consumption of crack. In São Paulo downtown there is small area, that does not include more than 4 blocks, known as "cracolândia, where hundreds of users difficulting drug dealers arrest, somewhat protected by dependents. Adopting a new strategy, the police made a intervention in that area, and in the first 15 days of 2012 were arrested more than 100 drug dealers, representing 50 % of the entire previous year (200). However, the biggest public health problem is far from being solved because users have not received effective treatment for addiction recovery and social reintegration. The most region dependents are in acute stages of addiction and the outpatient treatment has presented no effect. Even those patients are deprived of full understanding and self-determination, involuntary hospitalization can only occur through a complicated procedure, regulated by a Federal Law (which deals with mentally illness), after medical advice. It is estimated a mortality rate of 13 % of these users in just two years, although most of the cases are linked directly to the atmosphere of violence they face. Thus, this complex issue of drug abuse in urban areas has been intensely debated by all sectors involved seeks the best therapeutic strategies and legal actions to be taken together. However, at the center of this debate is the better regulation of involuntary (or forced) hospitalization in psychotic cases caused by cracks abuse and cases of serious drug addiction. Initially it was only measure of health and protection of life but now it constitutes very controversial issue and there are current discussions in Brazilian national congress together with the medical community and public safety.</p><p><bold>PP-417</bold></p><p><bold>Forensic toxicological implications of pleural effusion; an autopsy case of drug overdose</bold></p><p><underline>Hiroshi Kinoshita</underline><sup>1</sup>, Naoko Tanaka<sup>1</sup>, Azumi Kuse<sup>2</sup>, Mayo Takatsu<sup>3</sup>, Mostofa Jamal<sup>1</sup>, Mitsuru Kumihashi<sup>1</sup>, Yasushi Nagasaki<sup>3</sup>, Migiwa Asano<sup>2</sup>, Yasuhiro Ueno<sup>2</sup>, Kiyoshi Ameno<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Kagawa University, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan</p><p><sup>3</sup>Hyogo Medical Examiners Office, Japan</p><p>Pleural effusions are occasionally collected as an alternative specimen in toxicological examination, in cases where clean blood samples are not available.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cerebrocortical toxicity resulting from short term and long term Ultram administration in to albino rats using biochemical and histological parameters. The study was carried out on 25 adult male albino rats divided into: control group received 0.5 ml /day saline orally by orogastric tube for two months, a short-term Ultram-treated group that received a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1/10 LD50) for one month orally and a long-term Ultram–treated group that received the same dose for two months. The study revealed that Ultram administration caused a significant elevation of serotonin level in the cerebral cortical tissues of rats which was directly proportional to the duration of Ultram admistration. Histologically, there were many changes in the organization and ultrastructure of neurons in the different layers of cerebral cortex associated with an increased response of the supporting neuroglial cells. Intense neurological tissue lesions were more evident with the two months Ultram dosing than with one month. The correlation between the biochemical results and the histological findings proved that Ultram induced neuronal lesions could be mediated by the elevated cerebrocortical serotonin level which gives serious alarms for reconsidering the rush towards the excessive use of ultram.</p><p><bold>PP-420</bold></p><p><bold>Epidemiological study of the incidence of suicidal organophosphorus poisoning deaths in Upper Egypt</bold></p><p><underline>Amr Mohamed Mandor</underline><sup>1</sup>, Randa Hussein Abdel Hady<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Forensic Department of Ministry of Justice, Assiut.

The aim of this study was to analyze the neurotoxicity induced by deltamethrin which caused neuro-oxidative stress, histopathological &amp; immunohistochemical changes in adult male Wistar rats and to evaluate the possible ameliorative effect of melatonin. Melatonin (10 mg/Kg, once daily), corn oil (0.005 ml/Kg, once daily), deltamethrin (12.5 mg/Kg, once daily), and melatonin (10 mg/Kg) + deltamethrin (12.5 mg/Kg) combination were given to rats I.P for 8 weeks. By the end of 8th week, rats given deltamethrin alone had significantly higher MDA (malondialdehyde), lower reduce glutathione and catalase levels in the hippocampus and lower ACTH &amp; cortisol hormone levels than the control group. Co- treatment of deltamethrin with melatonin had an ameliorative effect on the previous parameters. Light microscopic investigations revealed that deltamethrin caused marked degenerative changes in the hippocampus &amp; pituitary gland of rats received deltamethrin.

This substance is called rice tablet mistakenly. The Aluminum Phosohide (AlP) poisoning which leads to a faster than usual death is misdiagnosed with ecstasy misuse. This fact has increased the number of victims in Iran. Rice tablet toxicity is highly dangerous and may cause irreversible effects and even death. The heart and lungs tissues are most influenced by rice tablet in compare to other body tissues. The destruction of the cells of these tissues leads to fluid leakage into extravascular compartments which cause cardiac arrhythmia, dyspnea and eventually pulmonary edema and death. Due to highly toxicity of rice tablet, ingestion of only ¼ of a tablet (about 0.75 g) can cause sever poisoning and death. The most critical factor in the treatment of poisoned people is Time. These organs include brain, heart, liver and lungs. Ingestion of this tablet causes nausea, stomachache, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspnea, feeling cold due to the damage to vasovagal system, thirst, headache, seizure, coma and eventually death that occurs in 1–3 days after ingestion. Specific symptoms of rice tablet poisoning include severe hypoglycemia, hypokalemia and feeling cold. In Iran, the bodies of deceased patients are referred to legal medicine organization with no exceptions for further forensic medicine studies. In legal medicine organization, the first step is to create a file for the deceased patient. After that, examinations begin with external examination. Particularly, the external examinations are important in regard to physical abuses because the most cases of rice tablet suicide have been done due to financial problems and rapes (by their partners or a second person). In external examination, the eyes are hyperemic, the face and body looks rather edematous that is due to fluid therapy and physiologic disturbances, fingertips are cyanotic due to hypoxia. Accurate examination of body surface especially fingers, thighs, genital area and breasts are mandatory in regard to love bite or other rape signs. In Iran before an autopsy examination, rectal and vaginal swabs are always taken for further investigations.</p><p><bold>PP-423</bold></p><p><bold>Detection of Long-Term Use of Some Psychotropic Drugs in Hair</bold></p><p><underline>Wafaa Mohamed Abdel Moneim Mohamed</underline><sup>1</sup>, Sherif F.

It is typically used for the management of chronic pain and pain during and after surgery. Except of its analgetic and sedative effects, fentanyl produces also euphoria in less extent than morphine. The greater potency, the rapid onset and sometimes the combination with other drugs can lead to sudden death. In this study, we present a fatal case as a result of fentanyl misuse in combination with bromazepam.</p><p><bold>Case History:</bold> A 27 years old man found dead in a town of Northern Greece. The deceased was a known drug user and had involved in an opiate substitution programme using buprenorphine. No drugs were at the scene of death. Autopsy was performed and biologigal samples were sent for toxicological analysis.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> Post-mortem blood sample of the deceased was analysed by GC-MS. A gas chromatograph Agilent Technologies 7890A with an MS 5975CinrtXL, EI/CI MSD with Triple-Axis detector was used for the analysis. A simple and rapid sample preparation method has been developed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Autopsy findings revealed acute pulmonary edema with petechial haemorrages of the lungs and epicardium, atherosclerotic lesions of the heart vessels with “binging” of the left coronary artery, splenomegaly and liver liposis. Using the developed methodology, calibration curve was obtained for fentanyl (8 concentration points from 5 to 30 ng/ml and four repetitions for each point). Linearity was found satisfactory. Toxicological analysis of the post mortem blood sample revealed the presence of fentanyl at concentration of 16.7 ng/ml and bromazepam in levels below the limit of quantitation.Fentanyl quantitation was accomplished using selected ion monitoring GC/MS (target ion:245, qualifying ions: 105, 146,189)</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In fatalities, without any specific autopsy findings, the toxicological analysis is crucial for determining the cause of death in many cases. The found concentration of fentanyl in blood in combination with the detection of bromazepam in traces indicates illicit fentanyl misuse and death caused by fentanyl and bromazepam intoxication, according to literature. Some researchers concluded that a postmortem blood level above 7 ng⁄mL is frequently related with illicit fentanyl misuse despite poly-drug intoxication. In contrary to existence of other drugs, other stated that fentanyl blood concentrations around 7 ng/ml or higher have been related with poly-drug deaths. In any case, the determined blood concentration of fentanyl has confirmed the above mentioned cause of death.</p><p><bold>PP-425</bold></p><p><bold>A Seven years retrospective study of acute poisoning cases investigated by the Forensic Laboratory of Ministry of Justice in Upper Egypt</bold></p><p><underline>Nady Sayed Aly</underline>, Ihsan Kamil Georgy</p><p>Poisoning is an important health hazard and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

The chemical analysis report of the viscera was perused to identify the poison consumed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among total of 1917 autopsies conducted, 372 cases were due to poisoning out of which 287 cases (15 %) were of death due to insecticides with a predominance of organophosphates. Ninety two percent of poisoning fatalities were due to self-poisoning. Majority of victims were males in their 3rd decade of life. Majority of the cases occurred in villages, more during winter season with indoor consumption of poison in more than 3/4th of cases. Thirty four percent of the victims survived for a period of 6–12 hrs after consuming poison.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Insecticides especially organophosphates are responsible for most of the poison related fatalities. In a developing country like India, where agriculture is the main source of livelihood of the majority, loss of crops due to insects can’t be ignored. Hence, instead of banning a particular insecticide, some measures for their safe usage and disposal could be adopted like; proper labeling, imparting awareness programme to the general public about the hazards of insecticides and their safe and proper handling. Extending psychiatric services to the community may help in identifying the high risk individuals who are likely to commit deliberate self-harm. We suggest further studies at multiple centers to observe a trend in order to float a new strategy for controlling this insecticide menace.</p><p><bold>PP-427</bold></p><p><bold>Organs Transplanted From Intoxicated Donors in North Tunisia</bold></p><p><underline>Mohamed Allouche</underline>, Mohamed Mootassem Bellah H’maaied, Mongi Zhioua, Ahmed Banasr, Moncef Hamdoun</p><p>Service de Médecine Légale de Tunis, Hôpital Charles Nicolle</p><p>The increasing gap between the demand for organs for transplantation and the availability of grafts have made it necessary to extend the criteria for “marginal” donors.

The authors present a fatal case involving a 40 year-old male, found dead in his bedroom by his mother, lying on the floor with a puddle of vomit next to his head. He was undergoing psychiatric treatment because he was suffering from depression after his divorce. He had two previous suicide attempts by pill ingestion.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Oxazepam was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with electrospray ionization source in positive ion mode. Samples were prepared using Oasis® HLB solid-phase cartridges (3 cc, 60 mg) and chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 (100x2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 μm particles) column with a gradient mobile phase of 0.1 % formic acid and acetonitrile at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate.

Sending non-biological samples available at the scene to be analyzed can be very important to guide the search of substances potentially involved. The authors present a fatal case involving a 30 year-old male, who was found lifeless. Beside the body there was a plastic cup with a pink residue. In the information available to the coroner it was suggested that the individual was depressed and treated with alprazolam and citalopram. During the autopsy several biological samples (blood, urine and gastric contents) were collected and sent for toxicological analysis, together with the non-biological samples found at the scene.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Chromatographic analysis was preceded by an optimized solid-phase extraction procedure on Oasis® HLB (3 cc, 60 mg) extraction columns. The extracted analytes were analysed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization source in positive and negative ion mode. Separation was achieved with a reversed-phase Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 (2.1x100 mm id, 1.8 μm) column and acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid in water as mobile phase, at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate.

The high concentrations of the compounds found in the biological samples and its presence, all mixed together in the cup, were very important to characterize the circumstances of death, assigned to a suicide.</p><p><bold>PP-433</bold></p><p><bold>Development and validation of an analytical procedure for detection and quantitation of salvinorin a in biological specimens using mixed-mode solid phase extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry</bold></p><p><underline>Cláudia Margalho</underline><sup>1</sup>, Eugenia Gallardo<sup>2</sup>, Alice Castanheira<sup>1</sup>, João Franco<sup>1</sup>, Duarte Nuno Vieira<sup>1</sup>, Manuel López Rivadulla<sup>3</sup>, Francisco Corte Real<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine (INML, I.P.) – Center Branch, Coimbra, (Portugal)</p><p><sup>2</sup>CICS-UBI - Health Sciences Research Centre, University of Beira Interior (Portugal)</p><p><sup>3</sup>Forensic Toxicology Service, Institute of Forensic Sciences - University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain)</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Salvia divinorum is a plant member of the Lamiaceae mint family. This plant is a powerful hallucinogenic whose availability has been rapidly increased, due to the spreading of the “smart shops” and also to its easy purchase by internet websites. Its main active metabolite is the neoclerodane diterpene Salvinorin A and the only known psychoactive terpenoid of Salvia divinorum. Its acquisition is legal in most states of USA and several European countries, including Portugal, and its main consumers are adolescents and young adults. The aim of this work was the optimization and validation of a solid phase extraction procedure that performs rapidly and sufficiently sensitive to detect and quantify low levels of Salvinorin A, in low volumes of vitreous humor, whole blood, pericardial fluid, and plasma matrices using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The developed methodology utilizes a mixed-mode solid phase extraction procedure coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry operated in selected ion monitoring mode. The method was linear in the range of 5.0 (lower limit of quantitation) to 100 ng/mL, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.99 in all matrices. The limits of detection and quantitation were experimentally determined as 5.0 ng/mL. Intra- and interday precision and trueness were in conformity with the criteria normally accepted in bioanalytical method validation. The sample cleanup step presented mean efficiencies between 75 and 106 % in the different biological specimens analysed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to the low volumes of samples used, and the low limits achieved using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer, which is available in most forensic toxicology laboratories, we can conclude that the validated methodology is rapid and simple and it is suitable for the application in the routine analysis of Salvinorin A in both conventional and unconventional biological samples.</p><p><bold>PP-434</bold></p><p><bold>Fatality due to toluene intoxication</bold></p><p><underline>Cláudia Margalho</underline><sup>1</sup>, Fernando Castanheira<sup>1</sup>, Alice Castanheira<sup>1</sup>, João Ramos<sup>2</sup>, João Franco<sup>1</sup>, Duarte Nuno Vieira<sup>1</sup>, Francisco Corte Real<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine (INML, I.P.) - Center Branch, Coimbra, (Portugal)</p><p><sup>2</sup>Medico-Legal Office of Funchal, (Portugal)</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon, widely used as industrial solvent and as participant in the production of many chemicals such as solvents, paints or glues. Due to its easy acquisition it leads to an almost exclusive use by adolescents solvent abusers, usually discontinued in adulthood. Toluene is a CNS depressant and has similar effects to alcoholic intoxication cases. The initial excitement is followed by a state characterized by headache, dizziness, blurred vision, arrhythmias, and respiratory depression, sometimes progressing to convulsions, coma and death in cases of acute intoxication. The main route of exposure to toluene is via inhalation (sniffing), usually pouring the product into a plastic bag (bagging) and breathing the vapours by tightening the opening of the bag around the mouth and nose. The authors present the case of a man of 53-years-old, polisher, who lived alone, with a history of long-term solvent abuser.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Toxicological analyses were performed in blood, gastric contents and lung. Drugs of abuse were investigated in blood by an immunoassay procedure and medical substances were extracted from the biological matrix using solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB, Waters) and analyzed by LC-MS-MS. With the purpose of examining unknown solvents we used a procedure that included gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for detection and identification of substances which might be present.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Blood sample did not reveal the presence of drugs of abuse or medical substances. Toluene was detected and confirmed in blood, lung and gastric content. Ethyl acetate was also detected and confirmed in gastric content.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Considering the available information and the toxicological results we believe that the death was caused by the continued ingestion/inhalation of solvents.</p><p><bold>PP-435</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Acute Alcohol Intoxication Deaths in Bursa Between the Years of 2003–2007</bold></p><p><underline>Nergis Canturk</underline><sup>1</sup>, Nursel Turkmen<sup>2</sup>, Gurol Canturk<sup>3</sup>, Bulent Eren<sup>4</sup>, Recep Fedakar<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Forensic Sciences, Department of Criminalistics, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Uludağ University, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Bursa Branch of The Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, Morgue Department, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alcohol is the most commonly used substance after caffeine and tobacco. When used as an overdose it may lead acute respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse and death. Methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol are used as a solvent in the industry. Our aim in this study is to evaluate cases of deaths occuring due to acute alcohol intoxication.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Events underwent autopsy between the years of 2003 and 2007 in the Morgue Department of Bursa, were retrospectively examined and evaluated respect to parameters like age, gender, season, scene, origin, levels of ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol, systematic toxicological analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In our study 33 cases were methyl alcohol intoxications and 10 cases were ethyl alcohol intoxications of 43 acute alcohol intoxications. 40 cases were male and 3 cases were female. The age distribution of cases was between the ages of 2 and 76, and the mean age of cases is 44,49 13,61. There was significant difference in gender distribution by age groups (p &lt; 0,05). The origin of death in all of the cases was accident and the scene of crime was determined as home in 20 cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In autopsy, as alcohol may be the cause of death, also may accompany and effect to another cause of death.

It has been implicated in cases of drug facilitated sexual assault when administered in solution with alcohol. Chloral hydrate is rapidly metabolised, the main metabolites being trichloroethanol, trichloroethanol glucuronide (urochloralic acid) and trichloroacetic acid. Both trichloroacetic acid and urochloralic acid are present in blood/plasma at levels equal to or greater than trichloroethanol during chloral hydrate administration. Ethyl glucuronide is a direct metabolite formed in the body by glucuronidation of alcohol following alcoholic beverage consumption and is used as marker to test alcohol use. Even after ingestion of small amounts of alcohol, ethyl glucuronide becomes positive and can be detected through body fluids (serum/blood), tissues and hair up to 80 hours after the completion of alcohol elimination from the body. This study reports the development of target specific immunoassays on a biochip platform for the simultaneous screening of urochloralic acid and ethyl glucuronide in whole blood. This represents a useful analytical tool for applications to forensic toxicology.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Competitive chemiluminescent immunoassays are employed and they define discrete test sites on the biochip surface. The biochip is also the vessel for the immunoreactions. The Evidence Investigator biochip analyser was used. The system incorporates the dedicated software to process, report and archive the data generated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The chloral hydrate metabolite assay was standardised to urochloralic acid (trichloroethyl beta D glucuronide) and was target specific, no cross-reactivity with ethyl glucuronide was observed. The ethyl glucuronide assay was standardised to ethyl glucuronide and presented %cross-reactivity of 5 % (methyl glucuronide), 9 % (methylethylglucuronide), no cross-reactivity with urochloralic acid was observed. The limit of detection values (LOD) in whole blood were as follows: 92 ng/ml for chloral hydrate metabolite and 88 ng/ml for ethyl glucuronide. The intra-assay precision and inter-assay precision, expressed as %CV, were for the chloral hydrate metabolite assay &lt;9 % and &lt;10 % respectively and for the ethyl glucuronide assay &lt;8 % and &lt;12 % respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The data indicate applicability of the developed biochip immunoassays to the simultaneous and specific screening of chloral hydrate metabolite and ethyl glucuronide in whole blood. This analytical tool facilitates the test process as only positive test results need to be confirmed.</p><p><bold>PP-437</bold></p><p><bold>Screening and quantitation of selected opiates, methadone and metabolites in hair</bold></p><p><underline>Mário Barroso</underline><sup>1</sup>, Eugenia Gallardo<sup>2</sup>, Mário Dias<sup>1</sup>, João António Queiroz<sup>2</sup>, Manuel López Rivadulla<sup>3</sup>, Duarte Nuno Vieira<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine – South Branch, Lisboa, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>CICS-UBI - Health Sciences Research Centre, University of Beira Interior, Covilhã, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>Forensic Toxicology Service, Institute of Forensic Sciences - University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain</p><p><sup>4</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine, Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alternative specimens are becoming more and more relevant in the field of toxicological analysis. Amongst these samples, hair plays a special role for several reasons, e.g. the fact that its collection is not invasive, its adulteration is difficult, and the windows of detection for certain drugs can be strongly enhanced. A method for the sensitive screening of selected opiates, methadone and metabolites in hair is presented.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using only 20 mg of sample, the analytes were extracted overnight with 2 mL methanol at 65°C, to avoid spontaneous conversion of 6-acetylmorphine to morphine, which would impair the identification of heroin consumption. The extracts were further cleaned-up by mixed-mode solid-phase extraction, derivatized with N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide with 5 % trimethylchlorosilane and analysed by GC-MS. These derivatization conditions hindered the detection of methadone’s metabolite EDDP, and therefore in the case of positivity for methadone, a different method for the rapid analysis of those compounds was used, using only 10 mg of sample. The analytes were extracted in 45 minutes, and analysed by GC-MS without derivatization.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The method has shown good sensitivity, with quantitation limits between 0.05 and 0.1 ng/mg for all compounds, while precision and accuracy were in conformity with the criteria normally accepted for bioanalytical method validation. In addition, the conversion of 6-acetylmorphine to morphine was found to be minimal. The method’s imprecision was also determined using authentic samples (15 measurements) and excellent results were obtained.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The qualitative and quantitative determination of selected opiates, methadone and metabolites is described. Adequate precision and accuracy were obtained, inclusively in authentic samples. The described procedures use only 20 mg of sample (10 mg for methadone), and low limits of quantitation were achieved, enabling quantitative analysis even in those situations where there is little sample available and/or further exams are necessary, as often occurs in forensic scenarios.</p><p><bold>PP-438</bold></p><p><bold>Devepopment and validation of UV-spectrophotometric method for simultaneous determination of gliclazide and metformin in its pure forms and human plasma</bold></p><p><underline>Mareta Mukharbekovna Ibragimova</underline><sup>1</sup>, Latif Tulaygaynovich Ikramov<sup>2</sup>, Ilhom Gafurovich Akhmedjanov<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Forensic-Medical Bureau of Tashkent City, Uzbekistan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Tashkent Pharmaceutical Institute, Uzbekistan</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Forensic-Medical Bureau of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Tashkent</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Gliclazide (GLC) as sulfonylurea agents in combination with metformin (MET) is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Abuse of these drugs has been a topical issue up to the present-day. The aim of the present investigation is development and validation of UV-spectrophotometric method for simultaneous estimation of GLC and MET in its pure forms and human plasma.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Reference standard of GLC (purity 99.74 %) and of MET (purity 99.14 %) were used in study. Standard stock solution of GLC and MET were prepared separately by dissolving of standards in ethanol. Each working standard solution (10.0 μg/mL) was scanned between the range 200–400 nm. UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Model 8453, Agilent Technologies, USA) with 1 cm matches quartz cell was used to measure absorbance of the resulting solutions. GLM and MET shows absorbance maxims (λmax) at 228.0 nm and 237.0 nm wavelengths, respectively. The calibration curves (n = 6) for GLC and MET were prepared in the concentration range of 2–20 μg/mL. In quantitative estimation of two components by simultaneous equation method, two wavelengths i.e. 228.0 nm (GLC) and 237.0 nm (MET) were selected from the overlain spectra, at which both drugs has absorbance. A set of two simultaneous equations were formed using absorptivity coefficients at selected wavelengths.

The aim of the present investigation is to use thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and UV spectrophotometric methods for the estimation of GLM in biological fluids.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Analysis was performed using drug-free biological fluids: 5 mL of whole blood and 10 ml of urine. Blood samples were diluted with distilled water (1:1). Specimens were spiked with chromatographically pure GLM (purity 99.30 %). After hydrolysis with diluted hydrochloric acid at 50–60°C for 15–20 min and twice extraction into chloroform, GLM was identified by TLC. Standard solution of GLM (1 mg/mL) and Sorbfil chromatographic plates were used for TLC. Optimal systems of solvents were selected by chromatographic mobility of the GLM studied in some solvents with different polarity. Chromatograms were developed with different reagents. For spectrophotometric estimated of GLM in specimens was used a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Model 8453, Agilent Technologies, USA) with 1 cm matches quartz cell. Standard solutions of GLM in ethanol were prepared with concentrations 1–50 μg/mL and scanned in spectrum mode between 200–400 nm.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The TLC studies showed that the best mobile phase was chloroform:acetone (9:1), Rf value of GLM in five examinations was 0.37 ± 0.02. In the examination of detection reagents for GLM, the spraying of Dragendorff”s test solution produced a pale yellow-red spot, Bushard’s test solution-brown spot, diphenylcarbazone chloroform solution with following spraying by mercury sulphate - blue spot (remains after drying the plate) from GLM standard solution and spiked specimens extracts. The limit of detection (LOD) of pure GLM by TLC was 0.5 μ/mL, 1.5 μg/mL in whole blood and 1.0 μg/mL in urine. The wavelength maxima for GLC was found to be 227 nm with molar absorptivity of 3.2685 × 10 4 l/mol/cm. Beer’s law was obeyed in the concentration range of 2–40 μg/mL. The LOD and limit of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 0.97 μg/mL and 2.70 μg/mL, respectively. The results successfully have been tested on the blood of patients after oral administration and on the poisoning body blood in overdose cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results demonstrate that proposed method is accurate, precise, and reproducible while being simple and rapid too for the determination of glimepiride in biological fluids.</p><p><bold>PP-440</bold></p><p><bold>The concentration of glucocorticoide, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha in mouse serum after single and repeated ethanol administration</bold></p><p><underline>Yoriko Shinba</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kazuya Ikematsu<sup>2</sup>, Shuuji Kozawa<sup>3</sup>, Takahiro Umehara<sup>2</sup>, Masahide Mitsuma<sup>1</sup>, Ichiro Nakasono<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagaski, Japan</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Legal Medicine, Division of Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The suicide rate is extremely high in alcohol abusers with depression. Many researchers reported that the depressed patients abused alcohol as a result of much drinking, but others did that repeated alcohol drinking might induce depression. The neuroendocrine immune (NEI) axis in depressed patients alters, since the concentration of hormones and cytokines such glucocorticoid (Gc), interferon (IFN) –alpha and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -alpha in their serum is different from those of healthy people’s. Additionally, some researchers reported that NEI axis of alcoholics might change. However, there were few reports concerning the relation between the symptoms like depression and alteration of NEI axis in alcoholics. Thus, we investigated that the concentration of Gc and cytokines including TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha to clarify the alteration of these substances after chronic alcohol treatment.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Mice were administrated with 2.0 g/kg ethanol (Alc), and saline as control. Mice were euthanized and blood was collected at 0.5 or 6 hour after the single injection as single model. In addition, other mice were treated every 6 hours for 1 week as chronic, and blood was collected at 0.5, 3, 6, 12 hour later after the final injection. The serum was obtained from the blood. The concentrations of corticosterone, IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha were measured.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> The concentration of corticosterone did not increase at only single −0.5 hour treatment, but increased at the other time points including chronic −0.5 hour. This suggested that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis might change after chronic treatment. TNF-alpha in Alc decreased at single −6 hour and increased at chronic from 0.5 to 6 hours after the final injection. In contrast, IFN-alpha in Alc has no significant difference in single, and decreased in chronic from 3 to 6 hours. The expressional pattern of corticosterone, could be different at single and repeated ethanol administration, and could be the inflammatory cytokines of this study. Although it was reported that TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha increased in the patients with depression, IFN-alpha decreased after chronic treatment. Our finding suggested that the expression of inflammatory cytokines of alcoholics might not be same that of mood disorder. In conclusion, our results suggested that NEI axis in alcoholics might change. Additionally, since depressions become worse in alcoholics, the differential dynamics of cytokines in alcoholics compared to healthy people, which were shown in this study, might be one of the exacerbation factor when alcoholics manifested the symptom like depression.</p><p><bold>PP-441</bold></p><p><bold>Development of simultaneous drug tests with different specificity profiles on biochip platform for the screening of bath salts</bold></p><p>William Snelling, Victoria Anderson, Ryan Mccreanor, Emma Mcshane, Joanne Darragh, <underline>Erin Montgomery</underline>, Ivan Mcconnell, Peter Fitzgerald</p><p>Randox Toxicology Limited</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Bath salts are synthetic stimulants that mimic the effects of amphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy. They present a high abuse and addiction liability. The majority of these designer drugs are derived from the parent compound cathinone, the active ingredient of the plant khat (Catha edulis). Some of the chemicals found in bath salts are methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), mephedrone. The recent proliferation of analogues creates a challenge for the detection. The availability of analytical methodologies enabling the screening of a wide range of these compounds from a single sample represents an advantage in the test process as only positive test results need further assesment with a confirmatory method. This study reports the development of two simultaneous immunoassays with different specificity profiles on a biochip platform for the screening of bath salts including: mephedrone, methcathinone, 3,4’-methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (MDPBP), MDPV from a single sample using biochip array technology.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Competitive chemiluminescent immunoassays are employed for the detection. The biochip (9 mm x9mm) represents the chemically activated solid phase where the capture antibodies are immobilised and stabilised defining discrete test sites. The biochip is also the vessel for the immunoreactions. For the detection of bath salts two test sites were applied to the biochip surface. Biochip array technology is applicable to the dedicated analysers Evidence or Evidence Investigator. The systems incorporate the dedicated software to process, report and archive the data generated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The evaluation of the two simultaneous immunoassays showed different specificity profile. One of the immunoassays was standardised to mephedrone and presented %cros-reactivity of 47 % with R(+)-methcathinone and flephedrone as well as %cross-reactivity of 39 % with methcathinone and 27 % with 3-fluoromethcathinone. The other immunoassay was standardised to MDPBP and presented %cross-reactivity of 75 % (MDPV) and 21 % (naphyrone). The limit of detection values (LOD) in neat sample of whole blood on the Evidence Investigator were 0.16 ng/ml (mephedrone) for the first immunoassay and 4.8 ng/ml (MBDPB) for the second immunoassay. The precision expressed as %CV (n = 9) was typically &lt; 12 % for two precision materials analysed in seven different runs using different batches.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results indicate that these two developed simultaneous biochip immunoassays present different specificity profiles for the detection of different chemical compounds found in bath salts. One immunoassay detects mephedrone, R(+)-methcathinone, flephedrone, methcathinone and 3-fluoromethcathinone, while the other immunoassay detects MDPBP, MDPV and naphyrone. This facilitates the screening of these compounds in biological samples.</p><p><bold>PP-442</bold></p><p><bold>Simultaneous analysis of mephedrone and methcathinone after liquid-liquid extraction and analysis using HPLC-DAD</bold></p><p><underline>Majed Yasin Alshamaileh</underline>, Jose Gonzalez Rodriguez, Mark Baron, Ruth Croxton</p><p>University of Lincoln</p><p>The cultural problem of drugs abuse is of critical importance for the public and the authorities. Beta-ketoamphetamines, with methcathinone and mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) as best known members of this family, are ones of the most commonly experienced “legal highs”. Mephedrone, one of the newly controlled ‘legal highs’ is a synthetic cathinone derivative, where its history dates back to 1929. Not much data is available about the clinical or toxic effects of the mephedrone. Mephedrone started to appear online and become available in 2007, and it was late April 2010 till mephedrone was added to the list of the illegal drugs of abuse in the UK. Methcathinone is a methyl derivative of cathinone which has similar clinical effects to Amphetamine, to its methylated form (i.e.: mephedrone) and to cathinone. A method for the liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and simultaneous analysis of the drug mephedrone with the drug methcathinone was developed and validated. LLE of these drugs from biological samples (whole blood or serum) and reverse phase HPLC-DAD were optimized for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Linearity of the method was obtained with R2 &gt; 0.99 for both drugs over the specified range (0.1-10 μg/mL). The accuracy was assessed by calculating percentage recovery at different concentrations for both drugs. The method was found to be accurate with recovery values for both drugs ranging between 83-109 %. For repeatability and intermediate precision tests, RSD values were &lt; = 8.4 %. The method was found to be specific for both drugs with a limit of quantitation (LOQ) ranging between 0.036 and 0.043 μg/mL and limit of detection (LOD) ranging between 0.011 and 0.013 μg/mL for mephedrone and methcathinone, respectively.</p><p><bold>PP-443</bold></p><p><bold>Highly Sensitive Rapid Quantitative Analysis Of Psychotropic Preparations By Thermodesorption Surface-Ionization Spectrometry</bold></p><p><underline>Usman Khasanov</underline>, Utkur Kh. Rasulev, Saida S. Iskhakova</p><p>Arifov Institute of Electronics</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Highly sensitive analysis of psychotropic preparations and rapid determination of their quantity in biological samples is a topical and actual problem of present-day legal toxicology. The aim of this work is to develop a new highly selective and sensitive atmosphere pressure thermodesorption surface ionization spectrometry for detection and rapid quantitative analysis of psychotropic preparations in biosamples.</p><p><bold>Materials and method:</bold> The chromatographically pure and commercial samples of psychotropic preparations have been studied, as well as extracts of blood, urine and postmortem materials. The psychotropic preparations were extracted from biological samples by liquid-liquid methods. Developed at the laboratory, a simple-in-design atmosphere-pressure thermodesorption surface-ionization spectrometer (APTDSIS) has been used. Its operation is based on the fact that the thermodesorption spectra of psychotropic preparation molecules have characteristic features and high efficiency (up to 0.2). Unique selectivity (molecules of simple gases and organic solvents are ionized with efficiency by 106–1010 less than that of molecules under study) of the surface ionization method allows extract analysis in air without preliminary chromatographic separation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The analytical feasibility of APTDSIS is demonstrated for neuroleptics – derivatives of butyrophenone, phenothiazine, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers – derivatives of benzodiazepines. A database of over 20 thermodesorption surface-ionization profiles and calibration curves of psychotropic preparations has been created allowing identification and quantitative analysis of substances in biosample extracts. The thermodesorption spectra of studied preparations are characteristic; the maximum temperature Tмax is 180-1900 C for butyrophenone derivatives, 130-1500 C for phenothiazine derivatives and 110-1200 C for tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants. Tranquilizers have intermediate Tмax from 120 to 1500 C. The linear dynamical interval of calibration curves is within the linear range ~3.5-5 orders of a magnitude. Limits of detection are from 0.4 (chlorpromazine) to 2.7 (haloperidol) pmol for neuroleptics, from 0.15 (amitryptiline) to 2.3 (maprotiline) pmol for antidepressants and from 1.0 (medazepam) to 3.4 (diazepam) pmol for tranquilizers. The mean time for one analysis of extract is ~3 min. The results are compared with those of TLC and GC/MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> High analytical feasibility of the APTDSIS method in combination with relative simplicity, cheapness and rapidity allows its effective application in toxicological laboratories for detection and quantitative analysis of psychotropic preparations.</p><p>Key words.

The value of COHb obtained at the time of autopsy was compared with that obtained following the storage at 4°C.</p><p><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> There was good correlation between the MetHb values obtained by AVOX and by the conventional method during the experiments. The AVOX is applicable to the measurement of postmortem MetHb concentration. The value of MetHb decreased gradually within a week, as reported previously, as it is unstable during the storage at 4°C [2]. On the other hand, the values of COHb were stable up to 12 months.

In 14 % of the samples drugs regulated by the German Narcotics Law (Betäubungsmittelgesetz, BtMG) were found including 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, amphetamine, etilamphetamine, N-benzylpiperazine, mephedrone, methcathinone, and phenobarbital. In 37 % of the samples substances regulated by the German Medicinal Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz, AMG) were found (e.g. ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, synephrine or local anesthetics). Other interesting pharmacologically active ingredients found were 4-methylcathinone (n = 13), flephedrone (n = 8), trifluoromethylphenyl-piperazine (n = 7), methylone (n = 5), butylone (n = 2), hordenine (n = 2), and harmane (n = 2).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Analytical results of recently seized “legal highs” and “research chemicals” showed that most of the samples contained pharmacologically active substances and according to the Medicinal Products Act, § 5 (2), these substances not covered by the BtMG can be classified as “unsafe” drugs.

Little is known about the toxicological and pharmacological effects of those single substances let alone of interactions in mixtures of such substances.

These compounds may be relevant in forensic intoxications, due to their widespread use, their small therapeutic window or the onset of toxic side effects. Also, establishing correlations between plasma concentrations and pharmacological effects is difficult, perhaps due to individual genetic differences. In this work it is described a method using gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for the simultaneous determination of seven selected antipsychotic drugs in human plasma (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, cyamemazine, clozapine, olanzapine, levomepromazine and quetiapine). Promazine, protriptyline and chlorpromazine-d3 were used as internal standards.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Plasma samples (0.5 mL) were diluted with 8 mL of phosphate buffer and spiked with 50 μL of the internal standards working solution. The mixture was homogeneized and added to StrataTM extraction cartridges previously conditioned with methanol and water. The columns were washed sequentially with deionized water, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid in water and 0.1 M hydrochloric acid in methanol. The analytes were eluted with 5 % ammonium hydroxide in methanol. The dry extracts were dissolved in 65 μL of MSTFA with 5 % TMS, and derivatization took place in a dry bath at 85°C for 45 min. An aliquot of 2 μL was injected into the GC-MS/MS instrument in the splitless mode.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The method was linear from the LLOQ (2 to 40 ng/mL) to 600 ng/mL (80 ng/mL for haloperidol and olanzapine), with determination coefficients higher than 0.99 for all compounds. The limits of detection were between 1 and 20 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were below 15 % for all analytes at all tested concentrations. Recoveries ranged from 83 % to 95 %.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The developed method was considered adequate for application in routine analysis, taking into account the low volume of sample used (0.5 mL), detection limits, precision and accuracy.

The relationship between alcohol/violent deaths is not accurately described in medical literature, and generally alcohol is seen only as a trigger agent of aggressive behaviour. The role of alcohol as a risk factor for victims of non-natural causes of death has been insufficiently researched. Thus, our goal is to check what role does the influence of alcohol play in victims of violent deaths as homicides, suicides and accidents.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Retrospectively, the medical records of 805 necropsies performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IML) of Franco da Rocha, in the period between 2001 to 2007 were reviewed. The variables studied were sex, age, types of violent death and alcohol levels - these were considered positive when above 0.3 mg / ml.</p><p>The dosage of alcoholicity was performed using samples of 10 ml of blood collected during necropsy, collection from the cardiac chambers (LV) or from the right femoral vein being preferred. Alcohol dosages in the blood samples were done at the Forensic Toxicology Center of the IML by gas chromatography, using the technique of separation "head space" and double column.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The toxology test for blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was available for 488 (79.1 %) of 617 necropsies. Of the 617 subjects studied, 532 (85.7 %) were male and 85 (13.8 %) females (with high rates of adolescents). The vast majority (n = 230) died as a result of homicide, and 40.5 % of these cases victims presented alcoholicity levels above 0.3 mg / ml blood. Traffic accidents came next, accounting for 181 deaths, with 41 % of victims presenting positive levels of alcoholicity</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> High blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on the victims was associated mainly with the genesis of accidents (drowning, falls, traffic, choking aspiration, i.e. smothering) and murder (with impaired ability to resist or by causing release of impulses to engage in violent situations), in about 40 % of cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that alcohol abuse is a risk factor for victims of violent death. In these cases alcohol has two types of action. Direct: contributes to accidents of various kinds - from traffic by decreasing powers of concentration, attention and loss of reflexes, to other types of accidents such as drowning, falls, swallowing disorders causing airway obstruction and mechanical asphyxia. Indirect: making it easier for individuals to engage in conflict (and thus become victims of crimes).</p><p><bold>PP-449</bold></p><p><bold>Preparation and characteristics of anti-LSD monoclonal antibodies</bold></p><p><underline>Libo Zeng</underline>, Liankang Chen, Xiaolong Hu, Guorong Ding, Yurong Zhang, Runsheng Zhang, Chen Liang, Rong Wang, Wei Wang, Fangqi Cao</p><p>Shanghai Institute of Forensic Science, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Crime Scene Evidence, China</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> To prepare anti-LSD and its metabolite monoclonal antibodies, and identify their immunological characteristics.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> LSD was oxdied to 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD.

The SPE cartridge (Oasis HLB) was conditioned before use with 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of purified water. The washing solution were 1 mL of 5 % methanol solution (with 2 % ammonia) and 1 mL of purified water, and the elution solvent was 1 mL of methanol. Separation was achieved on a C18 column (Waters Xterra® MS C18, 3.5 μm × 2.1 × 150 mm) kept at 45°C, with a mobile phase flow-rate of 0.2 ml/min and elution gradient composed of solvent A (2 mM ammonium formate and 0.05 % formic acid in water) and solvent B (2 mM ammonium formate and 0.05 % formic acid in acetonitrile). Detection was achieved using a LC-MS/MS system equipped with an electron spray ionization (ESI). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to analyze the target compounds. Extraction recoveries were 96.15-118.82 % for all the analytes. The method showed excellent intra-assay (relative standard deviation (RSD) &lt;10 %) and inter-assay precision (RSD &lt; 20 %) for quality control (QC) samples spiked with oxazepam-glucuronide and temazepam-glucuronide at concentrations of 50, 200, 500 ng/ml, with oxazepam at concentrations of 20, 800, 2000 ng/ml, and with other compounds at concentrations of 5, 200, 500 ng/ml. The calibration curves were linear with coefficient of determination r2 &gt; 0.99 over the range investigated (5-1000 ng/ml for oxazepam-glucuronide and temazepam-glucuronide, 0.5-1000 ng/ml for nordiazepan, temazepan, diazepam, and 2-4000 ng/ml for oxazepam). Limits of detection (LOD) were 0.4 ng/ml for oxazepam, 0.1 ng/ml for norazepam, temazepam and diazepam, 2 ng/ml for oxazepam-glucuronide and temazepam-glucuronide. The present assay was applied to measure diazepam and its glucuronide metabolites in human urine obtained from three volunteers after oral administration of 5 mg of diazepam. The results showed that, diazepam and the free forms of its metabolites (nordiazepan, oxazepam and temazepam) could be detected and quantified 4 days and 8 days after administration, respectively, while oxazepam-glucuronide and temazepam-glucuronide could be detected and quantified at least 15 days after administration.</p><p><bold>PP-452</bold></p><p><bold>Pesticide poisoinings in the region of Ankara and surrounding cities, Turkey, within the period of 2001–2011</bold></p><p><underline>Mukaddes Gürler</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ziya Kır<sup>2</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>3</sup>, Gönül Erden<sup>4</sup>, Gülfer Öztürk<sup>4</sup>, Ömer Akyol<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Chemistry, Ankara Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Erzurum Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Ankara Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Biochemistry, Dışkapı Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>5</sup>Department of Biochemistry, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey</p><p>Pesticides have been widely used and available in open markets and pharmacies in all over the country.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of acute organophosphate exposure on hepatocyte and to examine caspase 1 and caspase-3 gene expression, and cell apoptosis related genes as p53, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1-alpha expression changes in rat hepatocyte.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> 10 adult Wistar Albino female rats weighing 250–300 g were divided into control (n = 5) and experiment (n = 5) groups. In experimental group, rats were treated 25 mg/kg of dichlorvos (Bayer DDVP EC 550, Bayer) in corn oil by 16 gauge oral gavage tube. In control group, rats were treated only 2,5 ml corn oil by oral gavage. After seven days, all of the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under anesthesia. The liver was removed and divided into fragments. Hepatocyte density and histopathological examination were performed in fixed liver tissues. For this purpose, sections were taken and stained with hematoxylene-eosin. A part of the liver was used for gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the liver tissue using an RNA isolation reagent via manufacturer’s instruction. Changes in mRNA levels, detected using semi-quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, were calculated as the proportion of the target gene amplification products to the amplification products of the housekeeping gene GAPDH.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Hepatocyte density were decreased in experimental group compared to control group (p &lt; 0,05).

These compounds can lead to considerable adverse drug reactions, side-effects and interactions, even at therapeutic concentrations. Their quantitation in biological fluids is often deemed necessary in forensic toxicology laboratories to help identifying the cause of death. Therefore, post-mortem reference concentrations are a valuable source of information to compare toxicological findings between similar cases.</p><p>Positive post-mortem blood samples for antidepressants were selected among all the cases analyzed in Laboratory of Forensic Toxicology of South Branch of National Institute of Legal Medicine (NILM) in Portugal, since 2009. Quantitative results were listed with other relevant information, including gender, age, circumstances and cause of death, as well as the presence of other substances.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The blood samples were prepared using solid phase extraction (SPE) and analysed with a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method in SIM mode, fully validated for the detection and quantitation of fifteen antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, citalopram, dothiepin, fluoxetine, imipramine, maprotiline, mianserin, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, trimipramine and venlafaxine).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> During the studied period, a total of 4080 cases were screened for therapeutic drugs, and 519 (13 %) were positive for at least one of the fifteen antidepressants analysed. Among the positive cases, only 18 % had information of possible intoxication. The majority of positive cases was found in the elderly (61 % were older than 50 years old) with a evenly gender distribution (52 % male / 48 % female). Sertraline was identified in 96 cases (18 %), followed by citalopram (84 cases, 16 %), trazodone (79 cases, 15 %) and venlafaxine (79 cases, 15 %). In 52 % of the positive cases more than one substance was detected. The reported levels of amitriptyline, clomipramine, mianserine and trimipramine were above toxic concentrations in more than 50 % of the cases. The distribution of the quantitative results for each compound is presented, together with the causes of death.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The analytical method was successfully applied in the Proficiency Test for Tricyclic and other Antidepressants (TCA and TDMD from Arvencom GmbH), and proved to be sensitive and specific for application in forensic routine analysis. The information collected can be used to provide a correlation between the presence of antidepressants and the cause of death, even at therapeutic levels.

In consequence a precise and reliable method for identification and quantification in human serum samples is needed.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Aim is to develop a method for liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the simultaneous identification of cardiac glycosides and some of their metabolites in human serum samples.</p><p>The following analytes are included: digoxin, digitoxin, digoxigenin, digitoxigenin, digoxigenin-bisdigitoxoside, digoxigenin-monodigitoxoside, β-methyldigoxin, convallatoxin, cymarin, gitoxin, gitoxigenin, lanatosid c, oleandrin, ouabain, ouabagenin, proscillaridin a, strophanthidin, strophanthidol and the internal standard digoxin-d3. A mixture of diethylether, chloroform and isopropanol is used for liquid-liquid-extraction at pH 9.5. Analytes are separated on a phenylhexyl column using gradient elution with solvent A consisting of H2O and methanol (95:5) and solvent B consisting of acetonitril and methanol (50:50). 10 mM of ammonia formate and 0,1 % of formic acid have been added to both solvents to optimize formation of ammonia adducts and protonated adducts.

However, the methods routinely used to measure human insulin are almost invariably different types of immunoassays. These assays do variably detect synthetic insulins or lead to misleading results due to cross-reactivity and are disturbed by proinsulin-like molecules. Another problem in forensic toxicology is the rapid degradation of human insulin and its synthetic analogues in blood after death.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Serum samples of 264 diabetics which were on therapy with human or synthetic insulins and of 75 non-diabetics were measured for human insulin both with a chemoluminescence microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) and a LC/MS-method, the latter could also detect synthetic insulin analogues (lispro, detemir, glulisine, aspart, glargine) after immunoaffinity precipitation and reversed phase liquid chromatography with the internal standard bovine insulin. Post mortem samples (blood from the femoral vein, vitreous humour, urine) were also measured.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, human insulin concentrations measured by CMIA were significantly higher (mean value 41.9 μU/ml) than measured with LC/MS (mv 25.2 μU/ml). However, CMIA did not allow differentiation of human and synthetic insulins and in the 161 cases without any synthetic insulin findings, human insulin concentrations were higher with LC/MS (mv 29.4 μU/ml) than with CMIA (mv 24.3 μU/ml). Both methods are not linearly related (r = 0.78, Bland-Altman plot with an acceptable deviation of 20 %). Values for human insulin measured by CMIA could not be transferred to synthetic insulin concentrations due to the different cross-reactivity of the insulins.After death, inuslins can not be detected in blood, however, in overdose situations, vitreous humour and urine by detection of the metabolites can be used to detect the misuse.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In cases of suspected overdose with insulins it is recommended to measure with LC/MS for an unambiguous determination of human or synthetic insulins. Especially in forensic cases the differentiation of human and synthetic insulins is important.</p><p><bold>PP-460</bold></p><p><bold>Cyanide-intoxication related fatalities in Istanbul (2008–2009)</bold></p><p><underline>Bahadır Kumral</underline>, Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş, M.feyzi Şahin, Esat Şahin, Yalçın Büyük</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine</p><p>Although being the most rapid acting poison known, fatalities due to intoxication by cyanide are rare.

Four parent phenothiazines and their monoxide metabolites could be also identified in extracts of sera taken from patients after oral administration of them with the capillary HPLC/FAM-MS. Thus, the present system seems sufficiently sensitive to detect all four phenothiazines under investigation.

Clean FAB mass spectra of all nine antibiotics could be obtained with the detection limits of 50–200 ng on column. Both quasi-molecular ions which are useful for estimation of the molecular weights of a compound, and fragment ions which are useful for identification of a compound appeared as intense peaks for all the drugs in a single mass spectrum. Intense peaks due to common moieties, m/z 161,162 and/or 163 occurred for eight compounds, and seem to be a good indication of the presence of AG antibiotics in forensic or clinical drug screening. An ion-pair solid phase extraction was devised using octadecyl reversed-phase cartridge; the recovery rates of the nine AG antibiotics, which had been added to blank sera, were generally over 60 %. With the HPLC/MS system coupled with the simple extraction, we were able to identify ribostamycin, one of the representative AG antibiotics, in the serum obtained from a cadaver of a person who had died from shock after intramuscular administration of 1 g of the drug.</p><p><bold>PP-463</bold></p><p><bold>Long-term Storage of Blood Samples as Freezing Hemolysates with Good’s Buffer for Methemoglobin Determination</bold></p><p><underline>Masahiro Kito</underline>, Susumu Nittono, Masaya Fujishiro, Tetsuya Nemoto, Xiao-Pen Lee, Keizo Sato</p><p>Department of Legal of Medicine, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan</p><p>Changes in methemoglobin (Met-Hb) concentration of hemolysates during storage in various buffers at −30°C were examined using human blood samples prepared in vitro and blood samples obtained from nitrite-administered rats.

Alcohol analysis was performed in whole blood samples of drivers from non-fatal traffic accidents by using Head Space-GC.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> It is well known that alcohol use is significantly attributed to traffic accidents. In the present study, alcohol was detected in blood samples of 23.6 % persons involved in traffic accidents. 31.1 % of the special car drivers were alcohol positive. 27.7 % of the special car drivers are found to have been intoxicated according to the BAC law. Only, 3 % of the public, commercial and official motor vehicle drivers were alcohol positive. In this study, the value of ORs suggests that motor vehicle drivers who must obey &lt; = 50 mg/dl BAC limit were more frequently alcohol positive in traffic accidents than special car drivers who must obey zero BAC limit (OR = 14.41, 95 % C.I. = 1.92-107.98) (Fisher exact test, P &lt; 0.001).The mean blood alcohol level of drivers who must obey &lt; = 50 mg/dl BAC limit in non-fatal traffic accidents (52.60 mg/dl ± 94.84) was higher than the drivers who must obey zero BAC limit (10.76 mg/dl ± 61.80) (t = 2.44, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It is concluded from the current study that decreasing the legal BAC limits of drivers has proved to be effective in reducing drunk driving in Turkey. This is also expected to reduce alcohol related traffic accidents.</p><p><bold>PP-466</bold></p><p><bold>Histopathological changes in rat brain and spinal cord in long term Tramadol administration</bold></p><p><underline>Hala Ahmed Kashila</underline>, Heba Atia Yassa, Doaa Mohamed Almaz, Rabab Ahmed Mohamed</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Tramadol is one of a typical centrally acting opioids.It is indicated for management of moderate to sever pain. Now it is considered to be the most widely sold analgesic in the world, it is registered and marketed in more than 100 countries.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> A study was conducted to investigate the histopathological changes in rat brain and spinal cord with particular reference to formation of red neurons in response to long term administration of Tramadol in progressively increased doses.</p><p><bold>Material &amp; methods:</bold> Sixty adult male albino rats (160–180 g) were divided into three groups. Control group: given 1 ml normal saline 0.9 % (a) for three months (n = 10) (b) for one month (n = 10) orally. Group I (n = 20) received Tramadol orally at doses 1/10 LD50 (30 mg/kg/day), 1/5 LD50 (60 mg/kg/day) and lastly four times the initial dose for the first second and third months respectively. Group II received 1/10 LD50 for one month. All rats were scarified after 24 hours of the last dose at the end of each experimental period under ether anesthesia. Craniotomy and laminectomy was performed and intact brains and spinal cords were dissected and removed for histopathological studies. The presences of number of red neurons which are histological marker of apoptosis were investigated in frontal, parietal, temporal, Entorhial, pyriform occipital, hippocampal and spinal cord tissues.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There was significant decrease in weight of experimental animals in both groups in comparison to the control one. The number of small sized neurons was greater in group II than in group I. There was statistical difference regarding neuopil density and color staining among three groups. Neuopil was lighter in staining and less dense in groups I and II comparing to control (p &lt; =0.002 and p &lt; =0.001) using ANOVA test. Red neurons were found in group I and II higher than control. There were statistical difference between density of red neurons in group I and II and control (p &lt; 0.001). The highest number of red neurons was found in hippocampal region followed by occipital and frontal. The abnormalities occurred in the spinal cord tissue is less than those in the brain tissue. The only changes were found in the neuropil (fainter and less dense in group Iand II compared with control.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> chronic use of Tramadol is an important factor responsible for histopathological changes in neurons, which may be the cause of cerebral dysfunction after prolonged use.</p><p><bold>PP-467</bold></p><p><bold>Is There Apple Cider or Malpractice ?

If he or she does a traffic accident during alcohol effect, insurance agent will not pay any money or automobile because of mixed traffic insurance policy of motor vehicles. In this case we determine, investigate and discuss about these reports.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Mr D was injured with traffic accidents. In hospital, Mr. D blood alcohol concentration was measured 0.79 promile. He declared to drink apple cider without drinking alcohol during 24 hours because of conventional ceremony day. He complained fault due to send laboratory mixing blood or wrong way, cutaneous contamination with desenfectation agents.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Pathologic alcohol status is seen cirrhotic process or alcohol sensitivity because of genetic status during minor alcohol intaking. It ıs rarely seen and don’t make an mistake for alcohol intoxication. The patient know his status and declared. If he takes lower than 0.50 promile, he don’t take any punishment except pathologic alcohol intoxication. A patient have more than 1.00 promile blood alcohol concentration, he make traffic accidents during alcohol effect. This is not generally problem in forensic cases. Although it is generally observe 0.50-1.00 promile alcohol concentration, we need to search neuropathologic status. In our case, ıt was measured 0.79 promile blood alcohol concentration so we look at patient examination document. We don’t understand intoxicated patient with alcohol.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We reported that a patient has 0.50-1.00 promile blood alcohol concentration, physcian must report neuropsychologic status except pathologic alcohol disease. If patient have alcohol effect on traffic accidents, he punished with this situation and didn’t take any insurance garanties status. It must be reported to patient document about neuropsychologic status after traffic accidents during 24 hours.</p><p><bold>PP-468</bold></p><p><bold>Intoxication Caused Death by a Kind of Plant Species (Clematis) of Ranunculaceae Family: A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Harun Akkaya</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Özbay<sup>2</sup>, Ayşe Keskin<sup>3</sup>, Mukadder Erbilgin<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 2nd Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Morgue Speciality Department, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>4</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 1st Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>Ranunculaceae plant family consists of 1700 plant species. Most plant species in this family are ranunculus (600), delphinium(365), thalietrum, clematis, aconitum and actea. All species of this family comprise protoanemonin and its toxic metabolite ranunculin in their leaves, stems and flowers, besides some species comprise alkoloid and glycosides. Clematis and actea species comprise alkoloid and they are used as ’herbal medicines’ because of their fungicidial, antimicrobial and antimutagenic nature. Clematis species can be encountered nearly all over the world flora, however, actea is known as South America origined.</p><p>When a plant species of the Ranunculaceae family applied externally; local irritation and related contact dermatitides on skin and bullae occurs, when taken from the mouth, irritation caused lesions in mouth and stomach,ventricular arythmia, respiratory insufficiency and rarely convulsions occur.</p><p>Death case casued by intoxication by Ranunculin is submitted in order to underline the importance of this plant which is frequently seen in world flora, easily supplied but not held any place in toxicological analysis.</p><p>Our case is 26 years old male who dead in suspiciously. Not a specific feature detected in external examination, in internal examination; it was seen the brain was like oedematous, except increase of consistency in both lungs, not any pathologic symptoms observed macroscobically. Partially fragmented leaves and leaf stems found in the 500 cc liquid in stomach. Leaf and leaf stems were sent to be analysed to University of Istanbul Faculty of Pharmacy Pharmaceutics Botanical Head Department. After the anatomical analysis of leaf and leaf stems, it was reported that the material might belong to Ranunculaceae family,Clematis or Actea species; chemical analysis detected alkoloid and it verifies the material is Clematis. Histopathologic analysis revealed brain, myocard, liver and kidney;hyperemia, lungs;lobar pneumonia, bronchitis. In toxicological analysis; carbamazephin and chlorpromazin detected in cure dose. It was mutually agreed that the cause of death is intoxication of ranunculaceae protoanemonin by taking it from the mouth.</p><p>Consequently, the toxicity of this type of plants is highly dangerous when used unconsciously that can be encountered in World and Turkey flora nearly everywhere, people should be informed sufficiently about this subject, the plants should be used under the control of experts within the frame of alternative medicine. Moreover, it is well known that in routine toxicologic analysis this kind of material may not be detected and therefore crime scene and autopsy symptoms are also important to guide the analysis process.</p><p><bold>PP-469</bold></p><p><bold>Acute quetiapine overdose: a case report</bold></p><p><underline>Natalia Minelli</underline><sup>1</sup>, Francesco Ausania<sup>1</sup>, Nadia Fucci<sup>1</sup>, Francesca Cittadini<sup>1</sup>, Riccardo Rossi<sup>1</sup>, Pietrantonio Ricci<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Forensic Medicine, Catholic University, School of Medicine, Rome - Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Forensic Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Catanzaro - Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Quetiapine fumarate is a new atypical antipsycotic drug of the dibenzothiazepine class of antypsycotics approved for treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders by the US FDA. Quetiapine exhibited high affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A-receptors, and moderate affinity for dopamine D2-receptor; whereas antagonism of D1 and 5-HT1A-receptors is relatively weak. Remarkable side effects, reported in many studies, were tachycardia, somnolence, hyperglicemia, transient hypothyroidism, moderately prolonged QTc-interval and central nervous system depression. These effects can be explained by blockage of the α-adrenergic, muscarinic and histamine receptors.</p><p>In the letterature, several case reports about intoxication with quetiapine are reported, but few patients had a fatal outcome. Nonetheless, in rare cases, people have died as a result of taking atypical antipsychotic drugs at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. Toxic doses of atypical antipsychotics are highly variable: some patients have died while taking therapeutic doses and others have survived massive overdoses. Toxicity may be increased by coingestion of other agents, particularly drugs with similar metabolic pathways.</p><p>We report a case of 21-year-old male with a history of depression and other psychotic disorders who died after a presuntive oral-overdose of antipsychotic drugs. He was found unconscius and hypothermic lying in his bed. Many empty bottle of quetiapine (Seroquel) and benzodiazepine was found next to the patient. Alcohol and illicit drugs use was denied by his family members, and no other bottles were found.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Autopsy, toxicological analysis and histological examination were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The autopsy revealed pulmunary congestion and oedema, diffused miocardial petechial haemorrhages and multi-organ congestion. Histologic examination showed the absence of any other pathological finding. Toxicological analyses on blood performed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique revealed the presence of quetiapine (blood sample 8 mg/ml; gastric content 20 mg/ml) and flurazepam (blood sample 0.8 mg/ml; gastric content 20 mg/ml). The blood postmortem concentration of flurazepam and quetiapine are included in the lethal concentrations reported in the scientific literature for related deaths to overdose.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Quetiapine is marketed as a safe antipsycotic mediation with a low risk of extrapyramidal reactions and other side effects, rather that other atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and olanzapine. Actually, the indications for quetiapine use, include also anxiety and personality disorders.</p><p>This case suggests that, although the incidence of major complications or death related to quetiapine is low, caution needs to be exercised on administration of this medication in association with other antipsycotic drugs extensively used in clinical practice.</p><p><bold>PP-470</bold></p><p><bold>Current Trends in Drug Abuse Associated Fatalities in Cukurova, Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Dilek Battal</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ayca Aktas<sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Ali Sungur<sup>2</sup>, Nursel Bilgin<sup>3</sup>, Necmi Cekin<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Toxicology, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>School of Medicine, Department of Biostatistics, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>School of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Turkish Forensic Medicine Council Adana Group Administration, Adana, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Drug abuse has been increasingly involved in violence and the number of deaths around the world and in Turkey.</p><p>Although this abuse is not always the cause of death, it can influence the final outcome of a violent event. The aim of this study was to present the recent trends in drug abuse associated with fatalities during a period between October 2006 and August 2011 based on the data collected from the results of toxicological analysis in the laboratory of toxicology in The Turkish Forensic Medicine Council Adana Group Administration.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> This study was based on the autopsy records of Morgue Department of The Turkish Forensic Medicine Council Adana Group Administration which were evaluated retrospectively for all drug abuse associated with deaths recorded between October 2006 and August 2011. Cases were analyzed according to the following criteria: origin, age, gender, month, year, presence or not of autopsy report and post mortem drug determination.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Based on the scene investigation, autopsy examination, and toxicology study, it was found that 360 cases (5.04 %) out of the 7141 total autopsies were attributed to drug abuse associated with deaths between October 2006 and August 2011. The age range was from 1 to 81 years (mean+/−S.D. = 28.39 ± 15.77). The reported abuse substances were, cannabis (THC) 31.39 %, opiate 30.27 %, barbiturate 18.05 %, benzodiazepine 14.72 %, amphetamine 3.89 %, ketamine 1.12 %, cocaine 0.56 %.

In this sense, it’s justified the need of development of an analytical methodology for the identification and quantification of these drugs in biological fluids.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A simple and fully validated procedure is described for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of ATS in whole blood samples, using mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and GC-MS. Additionally, an innovator procedure was also tested for the first time in this compounds, the bar adsorptive micro-extraction (BAμE). The target analytes were extracted from urine samples by BAμE and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The SPE-GC-MS method was linear from 5 (limit of quantification) to 500 ng/mL, with determination coefficients (R2) higher than 0.99 for all analytes, except for methcathinone (0.96). The limits of detection (LOD) were 1 ng/mL for all analytes and the method was considered selective and robust, presenting adequate precision and accuracy for all analytes, except methcathinone, fulfilling the criteria usually accepted for bioanalytical method validation. Extraction efficiency was higher than 80 % for all analytes. Furthermore, the procedure showed to be sensitive and with appropriate selectivity to detect small amounts of the compounds and quantification of 2 C-T-2, 2 C-T-7, PMA, PMMA, ephedrine and norephedrine in blood samples. Considering that the BAμE-LC-MS/MS methodology was applied in standard conditions the preliminary results were satisfactory, presenting extraction efficiencies between 19 % and 48 % and LOD of 2 ng/mL.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A simple and fully validated procedure is described for the qualitative and quantitative determination of amphetamine-type stimulants in human whole blood samples, using SPE-GC/MS.

The recent improvements in transportation and communication technologies have made it easy the process of long-distance collaboration research activities. However the bridging of physical distance between collaborating researchers requires good coordination and the presence of efficient interface. Thanks to AFPreMed as interface, French (IRCGN, Claude Bernard Laboratory) and Algerian researcher teams (CHU of TIZI-OUZOU) have recently initiated a forensic toxicological collaboration. In this abstract we report an example of Mediterranean collaborative investigations concerning the first case of fatal human poisoning by vanadium.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> At 10 h30 p.m., a 24-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department of hospital University of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria), for diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, multiple daily diarrhoeas. Initial chemistry tests were normal except for glucose 0.2 g/L (1.1 mmol/L), creatinine 265 μmol.L-1 (normal 49-90 μmol.L-1), alanine amino transferase: 114 IU/L (normal 10–45 IU/L). The glomerular filtration rate were estimated at 21 ml/mn-1. A rapid urine drug of abuse panel was negative. This patient had taken an undetermined amount of ammonium vanadate at about 10 a.m. the same morning. She died next morning in the context of respiratory distress, despite intensive care and oxygen therapy. The sample collected in vacuum tube with K3EDTA, was stored at −18°C and transferred to IRCGN (France) for analysis. Determination of vanadium concentration in blood was carried out by means of mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) using the Rhodium (103Rh) as internal standard.</p><p><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> The autopsy revealed widespread asphyxia syndrome, labial mucosa with a greenish color and erosive gastritis.The Vanadium concentration was 6.22 mg/L corresponding to 6000 times higher than normal concentration in the non-exposed population. In our case, the low glomerular filtration rate 21 ml.mn-1 indicates the severe acute renal failure. In addition, the elevation of blood alanine amino transferase level (2.5 times normal value) suggests a mild hepatic cytolysis. Otherwise, In vivo Vanadium is concentrated in some subcellular structures, particularly in mitochondria. Therefore, the oxidant vanadyl and vanadate ions interact (E° Vanadyl/Vanadate: 1.0 V) on the respiratory chain and enzymes namely sulfhydryl-dependant succinic dehydrogenase implied in citric acid cycle leading to oxidative stress. The latency and the brutality of clinical picture degradation seem to be in consideration of systemic poisoning by vanadium leading to inhibition of the cellular respiratory process.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This documented case is of great importance for understanding the mechanisms of vanadium toxicology. This interesting result argues that multidisciplinary collaboration between many mediterranen contries may enhance the forensic research and requires a good coordination.</p><p><bold>PP-473</bold></p><p><bold>Comparative Analysis Of Mixed Internal Organ Samples And Isolated Internal Organ Samples</bold></p><p><underline>Evrim Akça Kaya</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bülent Şam<sup>1</sup>, Cengiz Haluk İnce<sup>1</sup>, Rezzan Gülhan<sup>2</sup>, Ahmet Akıcı<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Medical Pharmacology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Whether the origin is accident, suicide or homicide, any intoxication resulting in death is a forensic case and requires an autopsy. Cause of death can be determined by close cooperation of a forensic medicine specialist and a forensic toxicologist. Intoxication cannot be diagnosed as a cause of death without proving the presence of a toxicological substance in samples taken from the body.</p><p>In forensic toxicology; systematic toxicological analysis (STA) defines a general toxicological approach involving drugs and substances which may cause intoxication. Appropriate sampling for toxicological investigation is one of the most critical factors of a forensic autopsy. Incorrect sampling may not only hinder yielding accurate results in toxicological investigations, but under certain conditions it may also cause legal problems.</p><p>Samples for a routine STA should be economic and practical.</p><p>In this study, internal organ samples for STA were taken and sent to toxicological analysis in same container, and kidney, brain, lung, heart and liver tissues were taken and sent isolated in individual containers, aiming to compare data obtained from toxicological analysis and to evaluate any superiority of toxicological analysis of isolated liver samples to mixed internal organ sampling and other isolated organ samples.</p><p>57 autopsy cases sent to the Council of Forensic Medicine with either a suspicion of intoxication or who died in a health institution during medical treatment were included to the study. Besides blood and urine, isolated liver right lobe, isolated liver left lobe, isolated kidney, isolated lung, isolated heart, mixed internal organs, and stomach content samples were taken from each case. TLC and GC-MS analyses were applied respectively to acid ether and alkaline chloroform residues obtained from internal organs.</p><p>Data obtained from our study, interpreted together with literature data, indicated that besides blood, urine, and stomach content, liver and kidney samples in individual containers are adequate for routine STA. TLC screening of internal organs were shown to be leading to serious failures; thus excluding them from routine application will achieve a significant decrease in unnecessary workload, and more importantly prevent false negative results.</p><p><bold>PP-474</bold></p><p><bold>acute intoxication in a 25-year-old male acute exposed to mix type illicit drugs: a case report</bold></p><p><underline>Salim Kemal Tuncer</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Toygar<sup>2</sup>, Enis Macit<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Dept.of Emergency Medicine</p><p><sup>2</sup>Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Dept.of Forensic Medicine</p><p><sup>3</sup>Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Dept.of Toxicology</p><p>Some of patients admitted to emergency service are also a case of forensic medicine. Health care workers are liabil to inform those cases to judicial authorities. In cases with unconciousness since the anamnesis is not clear, a state of intoxication should not be ignored. In our case a 25–year-old male was admitted to our emergency service, with loss of consciousness. In his physical examination, failure of respiration, bilateral pupil dilation unreactive to light, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores was 3. Prior to naloxan administration, endotracheal intubation was performed, and patient was able to give information about his situation. According to his statement was poisoned by some unknown people with heroin. A little package was also found on him. For a suspicion of intoxication, his blood urine samples and the suspicion package were send to toxicology laboratuary. Toxicological analysis by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) both acidic and basic forms (Toxitube, Varian Inc) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was therefore carried out to identify the individual substances present in the biological fluids and the package. GCMS of the urine and blood this time confirmed the presence of heroin metabolite, and mix type illicit drugs (6-acetylcodeine, 6-acetylmorphine, papaverine, noscapine) in the suspicious package. This case highlights the potential of toxicological screening that is very important in unconcious and cases with/or with out having any traumatic lesion.</p><p><bold>PP-475</bold></p><p><bold>Clavicle Bone as an Alternative Matrix in Forensic Toxicological Analysis</bold></p><p>Ioanna Vardakou, Sotiris Athanaselis, Constantinos Pistos, Stauroula Papadodima, Chara Spiliopoulou, <underline>Konstantinos Moraitis</underline></p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Greece</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Although human blood is the reference medium in the field of forensic toxicology, alternative matrices may be required when traditional specimens are unavailable, especially in the investigation of cases involving decomposing remains. According to the literature different human bone specimens have already been tested for the detection of drugs, such as vertebrae, iliac, and femoral segments. Clavicle bone may provide an appropriate sample of choice since can easily be obtained at autopsy after the removal of the breastplate for the inspection of the thoracic viscera. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first time that clavicle bone is used as an alternative matrix for the detection of drugs.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The present study aimed to investigate the suitability of clavicle bone as an alternative matrix for the detection of opiates and particular specificities of this matrix is discussed. Midshaft clavicle samples were extracted from autopsied cases referred to us from the Public Prosecutor’s Office of District Court. Adhering soft tissues were removed and each specimen was sectioned into 2 mm pieces by means of a band saw. The samples were subsequently rinsed with deionised water and air-dried. Each sample underwent methanolic extraction (12 h, 25°C), reconstitution, solid-phase extraction, using a Bond-Elut Certify cartridge, and further derivatization with PFPA. Opiates were assayed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode. Morphine-d6, codeine-d6 and 6-MAM-d3 were used as internal standards for the determination of morphine, codeine and 6-MAM, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A GC/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of opiates in clavicle samples. Morphine, codeine and 6-MAM were successfully separated in spiked samples allowing for their detection at low levels without interferences from the matrix. Chromatographic run time was less than 15 min and the tested linearity ranged from 5–500 ng/g (r2 &gt; 0.99) for all analytes. The method was further applied in clavicle samples and analytes’ concentrations were compared with the respective values in blood samples.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the potential use of clavicle as an alternative matrix in forensic toxicology. Its validation parameters and the application of the developed method in clavicle samples from drug addicts, prove its suitability for the detection of opiates and potentially other drugs. Our method could be used for answering specific questions that arise during the investigation of drug-related cases. However, further analytical data are required to confirm its relevance in forensic toxicology.</p><p><bold>PP-476</bold></p><p><bold>Detection of Cannabinoids, Opiates and Metabolites in Human Hair Samples by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry</bold></p><p><underline>Nebile Daglioglu</underline>, Pınar Efeoglu, Mete Korkut Gülmen</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine,Adana,Turkey</p><p>A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of common drugs of abuse in Cukurova region. The method was able to simultaneously quantify opiates (morphine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine) and Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabinol, cannabidiol) in human hair. 20 mg hair samples were washed, cut and incubated overnight at 56 0 C in methanol for opiate analysis. For the analysis of THC, 50 mg hair samples were washed, cut and the samples were dissolved in 1 ml 1 M sodium hydroxide (10 min at 95 0 C). The samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction, derivatized using BSTFA (N,O-bis ( trimethylsilyl)trifluoraacetamide and TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) the derivates were analyzed by electron ionization (EI) GC/MS in selected ion monitoring mode. Calibration curves for six analytes were established in the concentration range 0.05-10 ng/mg with high correlation coefficients (r2 &gt; 0.999). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of detection (LOQ) obtained were 0.03 ng/mg and 0.1 ng/mg for opiates and metabolites; and 0.007 ng/mg and 0.05 ng/mg for tetrahydrocannabinol and metabolites.</p><p>The developed method was used to analyze ten hair samples from known polydrug abusers.</p><p><bold>PP-477</bold></p><p><bold>Comparison Of Toxicological Screening Test Results And Verbal Reports On Marijuana Use For Probationers</bold></p><p><underline>Gorkem Yararbas</underline><sup>1</sup>, Melike Güngör<sup>2</sup>, Demet Havaçeliği<sup>1</sup>, Hakan Coşkunol<sup>1</sup>, Serap A.

Toxicological analysis for cannabinoids were made by Immunoassay (CEDIA-Cloned Enzyme Donor Immunoassay) and GC/MS (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The results of this study have indicated that verbal reports of probationers significantly differ from the toxicological screening test results (χ², p = 0.001). Additionally, it was found that 22.2 % of subjects are using other drugs simultaneously for the therapeutic reasons which are considered as a possible cause for false positive results. These drugs include antiulcer agents, antidepressants, antipsychotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Probation was put into practice in 2006 in Turkey and new arrangements should be carried to develop the programme. During this development stage, our data might show the importance of toxicological screening test results in terms of self-report of the probationers during personal interview. Number of simultaneous drug use for therapeutic reasons show the importance of confirmation methods in order to prevent false positive test results.</p><p><bold>PP-478</bold></p><p><bold>The Prevalence Of Ethyl Alcohol Intoxication In Medicolegal Cases During One Year Period</bold></p><p><underline>Asli Erdem</underline>, Meral Özkan, Nevin Köprübaşı, Hakan Coşkunol, Serap Annette Akgür</p><p>Ege University, Institute on Drug Abuse, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (BATI), Bornova, İzmir / Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alcohol is the most commonly encountered toxic substance in forensic toxicology. Alcohol intoxication (AI) is a clinically harmful condition that usually follows the ingestion of a large amount of alcohol. During last years, as the proportion of alcohol consumption has increased, medical problems caused by AI have become more severe. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of AI in the BATI Institute for a one year period.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The data was obtained for 2734 patients for a one year period from the records kept in the toxicology laboratory of BATI Institute. The patients profile were; traffic accident, trauma, drug intoxication, stab wound, firearm wounds, falling and other forensic cases (suicide etc.). Blood samples (with EDTA) have been forwarded to the Toxicology Laboratory of BATI Institute for the analysis under the chain of custody. All analyses were performed by Cloned Enzyme Donor Immunoassay Technique (CEDIA) in plasma. The cut-off concentration was 10 mg/dL.The subjects were categorized based on their BAC. The classification is done in terms of both legislative and clinical/behavioral aspect. Group A: 10–49 mg/dL; Group B: 50–99 mg/dL; Group C: 100–199 mg/dL, Group D: 200-299 mg/dL; Group E: 300–399 mg/dL; Group F: 400–499 mg/dL, Group G: &gt; 500 mg/dL.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The alcohol prevalance was 80.9 % and 19.1 %, in male and female subjects, respectively. Among the subjects, 16.1 % of the cases were found to be alcohol positive. In alcohol positive cases (APCs), 17.1 % were in Group A, 16.2 % in Group B, 39.4 % in Group C, 19.8 % in Group D, 5.0 % in Group E, 1.4 % in Group F and 1.1 % in Group G. Among the APCs, 82.9 % were above the legal limit for for driving under the influence of alcohol (50 mg/dL) according to Turkish regulations. 7.5 % of the APCs were found to be above 300 mg/dL which is the situation observed for stupor followed by coma in the preliminary analyses involved.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Chronic or acute alcohol intoxication is connected with many serious pathologies and legal cases. Simultaneous determination of volatile compounds in blood is very important in medicolegal cases.</p><p><bold>PP-479</bold></p><p><bold>An Investigation On Substance-Crime Relationship For Probationers In İzmir</bold></p><p><underline>Burcu Yücetürk</underline><sup>1</sup>, Demet Havaçeliği<sup>2</sup>, Aslı Erdem<sup>2</sup>, Hakan Coşkunol<sup>2</sup>, Serap Annette Akgür<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ege University, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ege University, Institute on Drug Abuse, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (BATI), Bornova, İzmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Probation is a compliance monitoring which is conducted with individuals under criminal justice supervision who are required to abstain from illicit drug use. According to Turkish Penal Code, any person who purchases, accepts, or carries addictive or relieving/exciting drugs for use can be punished with imprisonment from one to two years. Since 2006, probation has been an accepted alternative to institutional confinement in Turkey. The aim of the study is to investigate substance-crime relationship for the probationers with drug abuse.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study that evaluates substance-crime relationship for the subjects that are sentenced to probation with drug abuse. All subjects were court-ordered to BATI Institute for a 12-month period. during 2011 (n = 294). Toxicological analysis made by Immunoassay and Gas Chromatography for substance in the urine. All data were analyzed with SPSSv18.0.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All subjects were male and aged between 18 and 67. The subjects are investigated under two different groups; Group 1: Probationers (41 %) that additionally have other certain kinds of offences apart from drug use (violence, crimes for profit, robbery, weapon-related crimes), Group 2: Probationers (59 %) that are sentenced only for drug abuse. The mean age of Group 1 and 2 are 31.3 ± 9.9 and 29.1 ± 7.9, respectively. When the sociodemographic characteristics (marrital status, education, income, profession, age) are investigated for Group 1 and 2, the significant difference was determined only for age (p = 0.048). Both groups had comparably high lifetime rates of multiple substance use (marijuana, heroin, ecstasy, benzodiazepines, etc) where significant differences (p = 0.001) were observed. This finding indicate a relationship between tendency to commit crime and drug abuse. When the groups are compared in terms of lifetime drug abuse, again a significant difference is observed (χ², p = 0.001).</p><p>Alcohol and tobacco use is also very common in both of the groups. In addition, when the groups are compared in terms of employment, family relationships and financial problems, a significant difference is observed only for the occupational status (χ², p = 0.009).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The strong correlation between crime and drug abuse is inevitable. Therefore it is very important to confine the subjects to the probation system at earlier periods to lower the rates of global crime.</p><p><bold>PP-480</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Cup Screening Test Results For Cannabinoids</bold></p><p>Aslı Erdem<sup>1</sup>, Meral Özkan<sup>1</sup>, Nevin Emircan Köprübaşı<sup>1</sup>, Nuri Idiz<sup>2</sup>, Mustafa Dalgıç<sup>2</sup>, Cengiz Yavuz<sup>2</sup>, Hakan Coşkunol<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Serap Annette Akgür</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ege University, Institute on Drug Abuse, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (BATI), Bornova, İzmir, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ministry of Justice-Council of Forensic Medicine, Bayraklı, İzmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Marijuana use draws an attention from the public and represents a worldwide problem. The most psychologically active component of marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The determination of urinary cannbinoid excretion is very important especially in medicolegal cases. Analytical methods for detecting cannabinoids fall into two categories: screening methods and confirmatory methods. Screening tests are easy and fast but their specificity and sensitivity are not high.The positive results must be confirmed by an alternate analytical method (generally GC/MS). Cup tests are frequently used for screening urinary cannbinoids in clinical laboratories, but the visual determination of these tests sometimes becomes challenging, especially when the specimen cannbinoid concentrations are near the cutoff values. The aim of this study is to evaluate borderline results of cup tests in conjunction with GC/MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The urine specimens were taken from the probationers who were court-ordered to BATI. The urinanalyses of the subjects were first performed by Screen Dipcards according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The urine samples (n =36) giving a borderline result (which are normally accepted as negative) were included in this study. All urine samples were tested for urine adulteration/dilution. Liquid-liquid extraction were used to prepare the samples prior to GC/MS analysis. Derivitization made by N,O bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) in %1 trimetilklorosilam (TMCS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Urine samples (n = 36) which are decided for being “negative” were analysed using GC/MS. In 9 of the urine samples cannabinoids were detected, ranged between 30–97 ng mL-1 (mean 62.2 ng mL-1). The cannabinoid drug screen device used in the study has a cut-off level of 50 ng mL-1, therefore GC/MS results were classified according to this cut-off value. Four false negative results were obtained in the thirty of the cases where THC concentration is &lt; 50 ng mL-1 whereas five false negative results were detected for THC concentration is &gt; 50 ng mL-1. It is clearly seen that false negative results is not rare in cup tests.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Qualitative and semiquantitative screening tests are commonly used for substance analysis. In order to reduce false negative results, sensitivity has to be taken into consideration. Scientific awareness of the toxicological methods should be standardized in Turkey for justness especially in medicolegal cases.</p><p><bold>PP-481</bold></p><p><bold>Prevalence Of Professional Drivers Among Probationers For Marijuana Use In Izmir, Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Alev Aktaş</underline>, Dilek Gürbüz, Demet Havaçeliği, Aslı Erdem, Hakan Coskunol, Serap Annette Akgür</p><p>Ege University, Institute on Drug Abuse, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (BATI), Bornova, İzmir /Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The use of illicit drugs, particularly marijuana, is on the rise and this increase also extends to drivers. The extent of driving under the influence of drugs is not considered sufficiently enough since law enforcement agencies do not routinely test impaired drivers for drugs. This study aims to evaluate the professional drivers (PD) among probationers (that are subjected due to marijuana use) in İzmir in terms of their substance abuse characteristics.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The data was obtained for 624 probationers for a 9 month period from the records kept in the toxicology laboratory. Toxicological analysis made by Immunoassay and Gas Chromatography for cannabinoids in the urine. All data were analyzed with SPSSv18.0.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 624 of the probationers, 31 of them were PD who are aged between 21 and 53.. 29.8 % of them have more than 3 probation files and 45.8 % of them have 2 probation files. Most of the probationers were found to have a habit of cigarette (61.9 %) and alcohol (65.5 %). The age of early onset of using cigarette, alcohol and marijuana were found to be 11, 14 and 12, respectively.</p><p>Despite being in a probation rehabilitation programme, 29 of the PD have self-reported their marijuana use. Among these, 58.3 % have declared that they have used marjuana in the last month, and 29.2 % in the last 6 months. The carboxy-THC concentrations ranged between 79–124 ng mL-1. According to the toxicological analysis, positive results were obtained for 38.7 % of PD and this incidence was higher (71.4 %) in the group which have self reported marijuana use in the last month.</p><p>Marijuana using frequency were; several times a day (27.6 %), once a day (13,8 %) and less than 3 times a week (27.6 %) for PD. There were significant differences (χ², p = 0.032) between toxicological results and marijuana using frequency. Life time use of marijuana was 67.9 % for more than 5 years for PD and being sober for more than a year was 45.5 %. The PD that have self-reported experiencing other substances (ecstasy-MDMA, rohypnol, heroin) during the probation period was very rare (only 6 cases).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The increased availability of cannabis inevitably increase its prevalence among drivers, it is hoped that new arrangements will help to increase the awareness about drugged drivers.</p><p><bold>PP-482</bold></p><p><bold>Cannabis Self Medication In Cancer: A Case Study On A Probationar</bold></p><p><underline>Burcu Yücetürk</underline><sup>1</sup>, Serap Annette Akgür<sup>2</sup>, Hakan Coşkunol<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ege University, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, İzmir/Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ege University, Institute on Drug Abuse, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (BATI), İzmir/Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cannabis sativa is one of the abused plants and may also be used for medical purposes. The medical indications of cannabis are sedative or hypnotic, analgesic, improving appétit, digestion and such situations like diarrhea, nause, vomitting, dysentery, cholera, diabetes mellitus, cardiac palpitation and vertigo. The plant, cannabis sativa, contains over 60 different cannabinoids. Although cannabis is one of the abused substance in our country, emerging evidence suggests that cannabinoids may have beneficial influence on intestinal inflammation and cancer.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> We report a 61- year old man applied for admission into probation programme. He was suffering from metastatic colon cancer. He was smoking cannabis to alleviate side effects of chemotherapy drugs. He was examined for eight times at scheduled visits and taken urine sample for three times to make toxicologic analysis. We observed that when the patient reduced the level of cannabis smoking or stopped using it, his adherence to medical treatment was getting worse because of serious side effects of chemotherapy drugs.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Three different associations with cannabinoids and cancer can be disscussed. First, it assesses evidence that smoking of cannabis preparations may cause cancers of the aerodigestive and respiratory system. Second, there is mixed evidence on the effects of THC (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and other cannabinoids on cancers: in some in vitro and in vivo studies. THC and some synthetic cannabinoids have antineoplastic effects,conversely in other studies THC seems to impair the immune response to cancer. Third, THC may treat the symptoms and side-effects of cancer, and there is evidence that cannabinoids may be useful in adjuvant treatments that improve appetite, reduce nausea and vomiting, and alleviate moderate neuropathic pain in patients with cancer. Although cannabinoids exhibit a broad variety of anticarcinogenic effects, their potential use in cancer therapy is limited by their psychoactive effects. In this case maintaining side effects of chemotherapy drugs were curious for keeping patient on medical treatment. And the only way of this was his self medication for some side effects like nausea, vomiting and anorexia. We concluded that using medical cannabis can be benefit in selected cases.</p><p><bold>PP-483</bold></p><p><bold>Myocarditis: a rare cause of scorpion sting related death</bold></p><p><underline>Mlayeh Souheil</underline>, Masmoudi Tasnim, Ben Dhiab Mohamed, Souguir Mohamed, Zemni Majed</p><p>Department of forensic pathology Farhat Hached University Hospital Sousse-Tunisia 4000</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite their scarcity (less than 1 % of clinical presentation of overall scorpion stings), severe forms of scorpion envenoming account for the reported mortality related to this dreaded accident.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> we report a case of à 24 years old women who rapidly dead after a scorpion sting.

Some of these products are marketed without a legal permission and sold through internet. Although it is claimed that they are herbal, some of them contain drugs such as sibutramine, synephrine, ephedrine, amphetamine, caffeine which are not mentioned on their brochure. Here, we report a herbal weight loss product containing unlabeled sibutramine used by a young men who was found death.</p><p><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Capsules sent to the Council of Forensic Medicine Department of Chemistry were examined. Content of capsules were dissolved in methanol and analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Agilent 6890 GC/5973 inert MS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The ingredients of the product were mentioned in Turkish on the label. Label in Turkish displayed: “Mexican red pepper, ciprus, guarana fruit, gum tragacanth extract, starch. The directions to use for the pepper capsule: take 1 capsule with large amount of water after breakfast”. There were also expressions in Chinese on the label. Another sentence was in English: “0,3 g pretty living beings science and technology limited companies of………”. The analysis of the capsule with GC/MS in scan mode showed a peak at 11.6 min in the chromatogram which was identified as sibutramine according to the mass fragmentation.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The analysis of an herbal weight loss product found in the crime scene investigation of a death young man showed sibutramine which was not mentioned on its label. Sibutramine is banned due to the increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in many countries in the world as well as in Turkey. However, many products claiming that they are herbal contain unlabeled drugs and substances such as sibutramine. Therefore, they cause serious health problems, even deaths and they should be regulated and controlled strictly.</p><p><bold>PP-485</bold></p><p><bold>Detrimental toxic effects of bango and hashish abuse on brain neurotransmitters such as (cholinesterase, gamma-amino–butyric acid gaba)</bold></p><p><underline>Nadia Abd El Monem Kotb</underline><sup>1</sup>, Magda Abdel Kader Awad<sup>2</sup>, Rasmy Boulos Girgis<sup>2</sup>, El Sayed Abbas El Dessouky<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology, Cairo university, Cairo, Egypt</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Cairo university, Cairo, Egypt</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Industrial Medicine, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt</p><p>Cannabis was considered one of the mildest, safest and most effective substances available for recreation, social relaxation and as an organic treatment of many medical conditions.

There is a dispute or ruckus in every family and no one is satisfied with their meager resources. Merely due to avariciousness, quarrels have crapped up a row just to leave another person in depression. Failures are the other subsequent factors which have marred the society and made all the people trouble- ridden. Failure in the examination, unsuccessful in achieving a lucrative job or to be failure in maintenance of social hierarchy can lead to oppression and depression. Moreover, failure in love or to achieve some important suitable and particular target can also lead to self inculcated depression.Due to harmony and synchrony of all these important factors, a psyche person; male or female may try to commit suicide. But no one can engulf this poison of his own accord due to its peculiar smell. Only a master mind accused can induce this poison or can give it in a disguise along with liquor or beverages etc. On reaching the stomach, there is heavy propulsion of gases which lead to shattering of vital organs into pieces along with heavy profusion of blood inside, impairment of nervous system and can make an individual even blind. Therefore, to meet the essential requirement of mankind, there is an imperative need to explore the antidotes which may act as subtle factors to form an emulsion layer by counteracting dissolution of celphos tablet or powder and to tide over this unfavorable period towards which emergent care, fast hospital management may be given to the victims. If possible, to strike off the dissolution mechanism altogether so that no further loss of life may ensue.

Substances such methane gas physically displace oxygen in inspired air, preventing the cells from receiving oxygen. Thus, methane is classified as a suffocating gas on the basis of its mechanism of action.</p><p>A 35-year-old single male was found dead at home. He was lying on the sofa next to the kitchen, with no external signs of trauma. In his mouth, sealed with packing tape, there was a hose connected to the gas wall outlet. Written suicide notes were found on a table. A forensic autopsy revealed no trauma or signs of violence. Toxicological analysis of blood showed the presence of methane at the concentration of 0.016 mg/ml. The cause of death was ascribed to asphyxia resulting from oxygen displacement.</p><p>A 53-year-old woman was found dead in her bed at home with her husband lying near her. The distinctive smell of domestic gas was detected in the apartment. Within the bedroom, the man was lying on the floor behind the door, and the woman’s body was supine on the bed under a duvet. The man was still alive and was transferred to the nearest hospital. The police knew that the victim was convalescing from a surgical intervention. This report, combined with the first-sight evidence, prompted the hypothesis of a classic case of incomplete homicide-suicide. An autopsy was ordered and revealed no trauma or signs of violence, cerebral and pulmonary oedema. A toxicological examination of the blood revealed the presence of Lorazepam (200 ng/ml, within the therapeutic range) and methane (0.094 mg/ml), therefore the cause of death was methane exposure. Soon after recovery, the man was interrogated by the police and confessed he murdered his wife. He had first given her the Lorazepam and then exposed her to methane in the bedroom. Just prior to the entry of the police into the apartment, the man quickly entered the bedroom to ensure that he would be rescued.</p><p>These cases confirmed that if methane is detected in cardiac blood at concentrations higher than 0.006 mg/ml, it is possible to diagnose asphyxia due to oxygen displacement as the cause of death. Moreover makes unnecessary determining the composition of the inspired air in cases of asphyxia, measurement very difficult in practice, because one of the first precautions is to guarantee an adequate oxygen supply, e.g. opening the windows.</p><p><bold>PP-489</bold></p><p><bold>A death case caused by accidental ingestion of corrosive substance</bold></p><p><underline>Zerrin Erkol</underline><sup>1</sup>, Hakan Oğuz<sup>2</sup>, Çisem Elçi<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Medicine Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Ingestion of corrosive substance causes fast and progressive serious burns. This clinical situation means as corrosive esophagitis. Stricture or malignancy may be developed in esophagus during the recovery process. Besides, gastric perforation may be developed outcome of gastric necrosis. Following, damages of the other internal organs may be occured caused by leakage of the corrosive substance in to the abdominal cavity. The aim of the study is to present a 48-year-old woman case, who drank the liquid in the plastic bottle because she supposed it as water and urgently hospitalized with the diagnosis of corrosive substance intoxication, then died in the hospital after 35 days and point out to the precautions for protection from such accidents.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> When she was brought to the hospital, her consciousness was confuse, deeply acidosis was observed. Because her respiration was insufficient, she intubated. Free air and liquid were observed at abdominal CT. At the operation, multiple organ necrosis and perforations were determined in gastrointestinal tract. Esophagus, stomach, duodenum, omentum, gallbladder were removed totally. Tube esophagostomy, jejunostomy and choledochostomy were performed. In the following days, seven operations on the gastrointestinal tract were performed also. Although all of the treatment, she died in the hospital at 35th day of the hospitalization. At the autopsy; edema, findings of old hemorrhage, hyperemia, fresh lobular pneumonia in the lungs; hyperemia in the brain and brain stem; stasis in the liver; hyperemia in the kidneys; hemorrhage and purulent and fibrinous peritonitis organized on the bowel were observed in the microscopical examination.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the present day, owing to advanced diagnosis and treatment methods, mortality rate was decreased in the cases of ingestion of corrosive substance. However, this kind of intoxications may cause serious complications, even death currently.

This culture, and subsequent subculture, of substance abuse has been seen to grow yearly. The aim of the study is to investigate awareness of substance abuse culture amongst university students while documenting their views on the subject.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The survey performed consisted of 37 questions, 26 of which were on drug abuse and culture. The remaining questions were regarding demographic data. Surveys were performed with freshmen and seniorsat the pharmaceutical, literary and communication faculties at Istanbul University.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> When looking for peculiarities of participants who triedthe substances at least once, we saw most were male (n = 24, %66,7), who had a monthly income greater than 751 TL (n = 14, %38,9), hadseparated parents (n = 12, %33,39), had a friend who was a substance abuser (n = 24, %75) and lived alone (n = 6, %16,7). Those who visit clubs (n = 32,%88,99)we saw that most consumed alcohol at least 4 times a month(n = 14, %41,2). Regarding education levels, survey takers usually had fathers with education under the high school level (n = 15, %41,7).</p><p>Participantswhose parents were together had different profiles. In this group, both the “attending the clubs” and “taking alcohol at least 4 times in a month” were high, and correlated with the level of their parent’s education level (high school or more). There was a direct correlation between the “below high school” education level of the mother, and being in environments where drug abuse existed.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Being male, having a high income level, having separated parents, single living, having a father with education lower than high school level, and befriending substance abusers,as well as an increase in alcohol consumption ties directly to the risk of substance dependency.</p><p>The education level of thestudent’s parents is rendered insignificant if they are not living together.

This approach for sample preparation is very promising because of its ease of use, full automation, speed, reduction of solvent volumes (being therefore more environmentally friendly) and the cost of analysis is minimal compared to conventional solid-phase extraction procedures. The aim of this work was the development and full validation of a method for the detection and quantitation of seven selected antipsychotic drugs in human plasma using MEPS and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The studied analytes were chlorpromazine, haloperidol, cyamemazine, quetiapine, clozapine, olanzapine and levopromazine. Promazine, protriptyline and chlorpromazine-d3 were used as internal standards.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The analytes were extracted using a mixed-mode sorbent, and were detected in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. Plasma samples (0.25 mL) were diluted with 0.25 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and 25 μL of the IS mixture was added. The sample was manually drawn through the sorbent and ejected in the same vial 3 times. The sorbent was washed with 100 μL of 5 % acetic acid and 100 μL of 10 % methanol in water, and the analytes were eluted with 200 μL of 5 % ammonia in methanol. The extracts were evaporated to dryness, and were dissolved in 65 μL of MSTFA with 5 % TMS, and derivatization took place in a dry bath at 85°C for 45 min. An aliquot of 2 μL was injected into the GC-MS/MS instrument.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The described method was fully validated according to internationally accepted guidelines (FDA and ICH). The method was found to be linear between 0.8 and 1000 ng/mL, with determination coefficients higher than 0.99 for all analytes. Under the optimized conditions, extraction efficiency ranged from 61 to 114 %. Intra- and interday precision ranged from 0.24 to 10.67 %, while accuracy was within a ±15 % interval for all analytes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first time that MEPS was used for the determination of those compounds in biological fluids. It combines a fast and robust MEPS method and GC-MS/MS, enabling the sensitive determination of the studied antipsychotic drugs using a sample amount as low as 0.25 mL.</p><p><bold>PP-494</bold></p><p><bold>Analysis of salvinorin A in human urine using microextraction by packed sorbent and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry</bold></p><p>Ivo Moreno<sup>1</sup>, Beatriz Da Fonseca<sup>1</sup>, Mário Barroso<sup>2</sup>, João António Queiroz<sup>1</sup>, Angelines Cruz<sup>3</sup>, <underline>Eugenia Gallardo</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CICS-UBI-Centro de Investigação em Ciências da Saúde, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilhã (Portugal)</p><p><sup>2</sup>Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal-Delegação do Sul, Lisboa (Portugal)</p><p><sup>3</sup>Servicio de Toxicologia Forense, Instituto de Ciências Forenses - Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, (Spain)</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Salvia divinorum is an herb material traditionally used for curing and divination by the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico. This plant is of forensic interest due to the hallucinogenic nature of the active ingredient, salvinorin A. The aim of this work was the development and validation of a method for the detection and quantitation of salvinorin A in human urine using microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Analyte extraction has been comprehensively optimized, and the influencing factors were screened by means of the factorial design approach. The analyte was extracted using a C18 sorbent, and was detected in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. Urine samples (0.2 mL) were diluted with 0.3 mL of water, and the sample was manually drawn through the sorbent and ejected in the same vial 6 times. The sorbent was washed with 150 μL of 8 % isopropanol in 1 % of ammonia, and elution was performed with 100 μL of 3 % formic acid in acetonitrile:methanol (30:70). To prevent analyte loss during evaporation, 2 μL of 1 % hydrochloric acid in methanol (v/v) was added. The extracts were evaporated to dryness, and were dissolved in 50 μL of methanol. An aliquot of 3 μL was injected into the analytical instrument.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using the factorial design approach, the best extraction conditions were obtained, and all the influencing variables were simultaneously studied. The optimized method was then fully validated according to internationally accepted guidelines (FDA and ICH). The procedure was selective and linear within the studied concentration range, while precision and accuracy were typically below 15 % at all tested concentrations. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection was 20 ng/mL, and extraction efficiency was 84 %.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MEPS has shown to be a rapid (&lt;2 min) and simple procedure for the determination of salvinorin A in human urine, allowing reducing the handling time and costs usually associated to this type of analysis. Furthermore, the fact that only 0.2 mL of sample is necessary make this method a valuable and powerful tool for drug monitoring in human urine in situations where this compound is involved, for instance in forensic scenarios. Moreover, this is the first time that MEPS with GC-MS-MS was used for the determination of salvinorin A in biological fluids.</p><p><bold>PP-495</bold></p><p><bold>Analysis of Methanol and Its Derivates in Illegally Produced Alcoholic Beverages</bold></p><p><underline>Cem Zeren</underline><sup>1</sup>, Zeki Aydın<sup>2</sup>, M.

Methanol poisoning mostly occurs because of the methanol used in production of counterfeit alcohol instead of ethyl alcohol due to its low price or by drinking the liquids containing methyl alcohol. Methanol can naturally be produced in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria, and is ubiquitous in the environment. Methanol intoxication is infrequently encountered in forensic medicine practice. However, sporadic cases due to methanol intoxication as well as epidemic cases have been reported. In this study, we aimed to identify existence of methanol and its metabolites in illegally produced alcoholic beverages used in Antakya region.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> Fifty-six different alcohol samples were collected from the markets and local producers (out of the control). Existence of methanol, formic acid, methyl amine, methyl formate and trioxan were determined by using GC-MS method in the samples.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-six different alcohol samples were included in this study. Methanol was detected in 39 (75 %) of samples. Formic acid was detected in 3, formamide in 1, methyl amine in 6, methyl formate in 10 and trioxan in 2 samples. None of the commercial alcoholic beverages produced under the state control contained methanol and derivates. Percentages of substance in analyzed alcohol are presented in the Table 1. (Table1)</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Methanol intoxication is an important public health and forensic medicine problem because of the epidemic cases. Protective measures should be developed about using of the liquids containing methanol. In addition, alcohol producers and seller workplaces should be regularly audited and criminal sanctions should be increased against the workplaces selling alcoholic beverages containing methanol.</p><p><bold>PP-496</bold></p><p><bold>Death of three neighbors after application of Aluminium Phosphide fumigants in a factory</bold></p><p><underline>Zouhir Hammami</underline>, Wiem Ben Amar, Karama Regaieg, Adnen Ayadi, Zouhir Khemakhem, Sami Bardaa, Malek Zribi, Youssef Nouma, Samir Maatoug</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, CHU Habib Bourguiba, Sfax, Tunisia</p><p>Aluminum Phosphide or rice tablet is one of the most common pesticides which lead to accidental or intentional intoxication and finally death.

The court's solution to the case was founded on essential comparative chemico-toxicological analyses and results from non-biological materials obtained during investigations and from biological fluids taken from the body.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The corpse was subjected to a necroscopic ascertainment, including both macro- and microscopic assessments. During investigation of the crime scene and of the place where the main suspect lived, three tins containing paint solvent were found and sampled. The resulting non-biological findings were then qualitatively analysed for volatile substances by HS-GC-FID and identification of their components by SPME-GC-MS. Fluids and tissues sampled from the body were subjected to a general search for non-volatile organic substances by GC/LC-MS and for volatile substances by HS-GC-FID and SPME-GC-MS. The chromatographic profiles of both biological and non-biological analyses of samples were evaluated comparatively.</p><p><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> Chemico-toxicological analyses on non-biological samples revealed two different hydrocarbon mixtures (corresponding to two typologies of white spirit) and trichloro-ethylene. Macro- and microscopic autopsy ascertainments showed the typical signs of violent mechanical asphyxiation by suffocation. The chemico-toxicological analyses of body samples identified a mixture composed of 50 volatile compounds, and excluded the presence of any other substance. Comparison of chromatographic profiles showed a significant overlap between the mixture of hydrocarbons identified in the body and in the white spirit found. Haematic quantification of 1,2-dichloropropane, composing 4 % of the hydrocarbon mixture, allowed the concentration of solvent in the blood to be estimated at 11.5 mg/L, a toxico-dynamic level which would have incapacitated the victim.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The methodology adopted and the results of the comparative chemico-toxicological analyses, between biological and non-biological samples, were diriment in order to reconstruct the dynamic of the homicide, the role of the homicidal conduct and the employment, never signaled in the literature, of white spirit as an incapacitating agent.</p><p><bold>PP-499</bold></p><p><bold>Counterfeit Drugs for the Enhancement of Sexual Function</bold></p><p><underline>Elif Esra Küçükibrahimoğlu</underline><sup>1</sup>, Neval Berber<sup>1</sup>, Bedia Kaymakçıoğlu<sup>2</sup>, Haluk Ince<sup>1</sup>, Rezzan Gülhan<sup>3</sup>, Mahmut Aşırdizer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Chemistry, Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Marmara University School of Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Depatment of Pharmacology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> Drugs, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, verdanafil are used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

We aimed to draw attention to these uncontrolled products sold in Turkey which create a serious problem.</p><p><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Pharmaceutical compounds seized by legal authorities in the form of tablet, capsule, colored liquid, spray and cream are sent to the Council of Forensic Medicine Department of Chemistry for analysis. Materials received between August-December 2011 were included in this study. Following physical examination, the content of these drugs were analyzed with HPLC, GC/MS and LC/MS/MS techniques.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Seven kinds of tablets and one kind of capsule contained sildenafil or tadalafil only. However, one tablet form contained both sildenafil and tadalafil together along with diclofenac. The type and amount of active drug was mentioned correctly on the boxes in 44 % of the compounds.

This study aims investigate awareness of substance abuse culture amongst university students while documenting their views on the subject.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The survey consisted of 30 questions, 23 were on drug abuse and culture. The remaining questions were regarding demographic data. Surveys were performed with 100 patients, under control of a substance abuse clinic.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Cannabis was most prominent; 93 % admitted using the substance. Ecstasy, heroin and cocaine were 86 %, 65 % and 54 % respectively. Drugs other than ecstasy were 29 % for Rohypnol, 12 % for LSD and 5 % for ketamine. None of the participants used GHB. 86 % of patients admitted using club drugs, however, 62 % participants claimed not to have done since one year; nonetheless 66 % of patients emphasized their continual usage of heroin, despite their therapy. Ecstasy was the most common answer for the question of “If you used multiple club drug in the past, which one was the most common one?”</p><p>Cannabis and ecstasy were deemed to be drugs most commonly used in the transition to higher profile drugs. We asked perceptions of participants about 1-) dependence potential of drugs. The participants denoted heroin at the first order, by a ratio of 92 %. Ecstasy (65 %) was the second most frequent answer; 2-) hazardous potential of drugs, the participants denoted heroin and ecstasy, by the ratios of 95 and 65 %, respectively. 98 % of them had emphasized, “they don’t advise using ecstasy to their family members.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ecstasy is one of the most widely used substances in the subculture and is second to Cocaine as a club drug in the subculture. In terms of other club drugs LSD was most the most frequent answer. In terms of non club drugs, cocaine was the second most frequent answer after ecstasy. Ecstasy users accept that the drug is both dangerous and addictive. In both categories heroin surpassed both drugs. Moreover, all of the users claimed they would not give it to family members. This fact supports the dangerous and addictive connotations that the drug has. When taken into consideration that %66 of users still abuse heroin, we can see the evidence that physically addictive club drugs are easier to quit.</p><p><bold>PP-502</bold></p><p><bold>A Speedball case from Turkey: solved by Systematic Toxicological Analysis</bold></p><p><underline>Zeynep Turkmen</underline><sup>1</sup>, Isil Bavunoglu<sup>2</sup>, Salih Cengiz<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute Of Forensic Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Internal Emergency Department, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Cocaine and heroin are frequently co-abused by humans, in a combination known as speedball.

The wounds are replaced in this case some characteristics of shots at short distance, despite the shooting were carried out at close range distance.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The characteristics of injuries caused by the shots (tests) and ammunition of different calibers were quite varied, especially in the peri-lesional marks around the entry wounds. These steps may help in the primary criminal evaluation performed by professionals with little experience, facilitating their understanding and conclusions. The findings alter the descriptions of the features found in and around the tissues of the injuries, questioning of what is described.</p><p><bold>PP-504</bold></p><p><bold>An unusual nailgun suicide</bold></p><p><underline>Joke Wuestenbergs</underline>, Wouter Van Den Bogaert, Wim Develter, Wim Van De Voorde</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium</p><p>A 56 year old man with known psychiatric co-morbidity was found death in bed. External examination showed a metallic thin object penetrating the sternum with little bleeding on the surrounding clothes. A disconnected nail gun was found in the adjacent room without any blood traces between the body and the nail gun.</p><p>Postmortem imaging and an autopsy were performed to determine whether the victim was able to inflict the atypical ballistic trauma himself and maintained the ability to commit certain acts, like disconnecting the nail gun, afterwards. Imaging showed a slight, at first sight non lethal, hemopericardium and no significant thoracic blood collection. The nail was found penetrating the thorax forming a trajectory in between the heart and the liver through the pericardial sac and the left diaphragm. Autopsy revealed pericardial fibrosis and a hemopericardium of 295 ml. The cause of death was determined to be a bleeding through a small nick in the apical right ventricle into the already fibrotic pericardial sac eventually leading to a fatal cardiac tamponade. Toxicological screening was negative. Further police investigation discovered a similar ‘accident’ on the work floor a few years before, accounting for the pericardial fibrosis.</p><p>Suicide by ballistic trauma is very common, though using a nail gun, especially to the thorax, is less seen. This case reports shows that postmortem imaging and autopsy findings are complementary and crucial to determine the manner and cause of death in this atypical suicide.</p><p><bold>PP-505</bold></p><p><bold>An unusual case of firearm injury: bullet lodged in the tongue</bold></p><p><underline>Selçuk Çetin</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bülent Eren<sup>2</sup>, Okan Akan<sup>2</sup>, Nursel Türkmen<sup>1</sup>, Murat Serdar Gürses<sup>1</sup>, Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Uludag University Medical School, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Bursa Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Firearm-related injuries are a major problem worldwide and one of the central issues in forensic pathology. An unusual presentation of a bullet trajectory can create surgical or medico-legal diagnostic problems. The bullet trajectory is one of the parameters’ which affect the extent of tissue damage in gunshot wounds such as distance from which the gun is fired, bullet structure, size, and velocity.</p><p>Predicting the missile trajectory may also be of help to law enforcement agencies and forensic scientists in determining the type and severity of firearm injury and direction of fire.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We aimed to present a case of interesting gunshot wound.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A 23-year-old man suffered two gunshot wounds, was taken to emergency department immediately after the incident. According to his hospital reports, he was cooperative and fully conscious, the vital signs and neurological examination were normal when he arrived at the hospital. The neck examination was also negative. The carotid artery pulses were present and equal bilaterally. Physical examination revealed two entrance gunshot wounds on the left lumbar region under the lower margin of left scapulae and right gluteal region. An exit wound was defined on the lateral side of the right gluteal region which was located 5 cm distance of entrance wound. Lateral and anterior-posterior cranial X-rays showed a bullet in the tongue without any life threatening impairment.</p><p>A thoracic CT scan and abdominal USG were normal. Following the initial examinations he was hospitalized and the bullet removed from the tongue by a simple surgical operation. He was discharged from hospital on the sixth day of surgery.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite considerable variability of gunshot injuries, their forensic-medical examination include some basic components such as whether there is any life threatening injury, differential diagnostics of the consequences of multiple injuries attributable to each traumatic factor of the shot, and determining models of the weapons and distance of shot by experimental ballistic investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is a rare case report in the literature describing a case of a bullet lodged into the tongue after a gunshot injury without any life threatening vital tissue damage although presence of a long bullet trajectory passing near the various important vital structures.</p><p><bold>PP-506</bold></p><p><bold>The Importance of Radiological Methods in Determination of the Characteristics of Firearm Bullets Inside the Body</bold></p><p>Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş<sup>1</sup>, Sibel Atacan Çağlar<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Harun Akkaya</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ercan Arslan<sup>2</sup>, Bahadır Kumral<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 2nd Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Physics Speciality Dept., Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>To determine the characteristics of bullets which cause firearm injuries is highly crucial.

The graphies of bullets of 3 different 5.56x45 mm, 7.62x39 mm and 7.62x51 mm rifles and 2 different 7.65x17 mm ve 9x19 mm pistols were taken with a distance of 100 cm from the tapes and 90 degrees angle to the bullets by sustaining the beam of light coming through directly. Computed tomography scan was taken for the bullets in the same position. After scanning, the dimensional deviance of the tomographic images and direct graphy of the bullets which had well-known units of measurement had been evaluated. It was established that the deviation ratio of the tomographic images was much more and the calculated values of the direct graphy were most likely close to the real values.

Because the air powered guns own without any certificate, they are bought easily and used without any control. Death was reported by the wound occurred with air-powered guns. A 22-year-old- man brought to the emergency department on his foots by his family’s help who wounded with an air powered gun on soft tissue of right leg, under the knee. An indirect injury of superficial peroneal nerve was determined in examination. It is understood that the injury was occurred with the indirect effect of the pellet according to results of clinical evidence and observation.

Shooting distance helps to clarify how the crime has taken place, as well as that it helps to confirm the statements of suspected person/s and witnesses.</p><p>In the study, after direct firing to the skin from different distances, the particles that were collected from the area around the bullet entrance hole were investigated by the Flameless Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (FAAS) method and it was aimed to detect the relationship between the gunshot residues and the shooting distance in death cases related to gunshot injuries.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> In this study, 5 shots were realized from each distance (0 cm, 5 cm, 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm and 100 cm) to the targets which were cut from shaved calfskin, with 9 x 19 mm parabellum and 7,65 x 17 mm browning cartridge.

Statistical analysis of data were realized by using SPSS 14.0 Packet Program.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> For both caliber cartridges, it is observed that measured lead and antimony levels decrease as the distance increases. It is founded that, as the distance increases, the changes in levels of measured lead are more significant in comparison with the levels of measured antimony.</p><p>For both caliber cartridges, at the same distances, measured levels of lead are founded to be within a wider range in comparison with the levels of measured antimony. High standard deviation values specifically observed in close fire distances are found to be decreasing as the distance increases.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to the evaluation it is determinated that gunshot residue distribution does not show a linear character. No evidence could be founded about the gunshot residue distribution showing a linear character in case the number of shooting was increased.

Also we aim to have a look to the relation between cancer and suicide and draw attention to the elderly suicides.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> The case was a 94-year-old male. His wife and son reported that they heard one gun shot, then found the victim’s corpse in his bedroom.They also told that he did not accept treatment of the cancer for a certain time and have psychological problems.</p><p>In the scene investigation, it was determined that the victim was laying on the ground between the cupboard and bed, an antique revolver was placed next to the victim. There was a blood pool under his head’s left region. On the parquet, a small round defect was seen at the central region of the blood pool which was occurred from beating of the bullet’s tip on the parquet.</p><p>In the external examination of the autopsy, an entrance wound with abrasion ring and smut created by bullet was detected in the right temporal region, and a tear-like exit wound was observed in the left parietal region. A deformed without jacket bullet was found underneath the skin of the site of exit wound.</p><p>Consequently, according to the scene investigation and autopsy findings it was concluded that, the bullet entered into head from the right temporal region. Following its tip exited from the left parietal region skin by forming exit wound, and then hit to the parquet on the ground by causing small round defect. Following, it remained inside of the exit wound in subcutaneous region. The shooting range was contact distance.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Therefore, it is remarkable that the bullet remained under the skin after forming exit wound on the skin and creating small round defect on the parquet due to hitting. According to the assumptions, since the kinetic energy of non-jacketed bullet of the antique revolver was low, its tip pierced the skin, crushed into the ground and became deformed, and then its kinetic energy decreased even more with the impact of such crush, and therefore it lacked the required energy to go out from the skin totally. This case also point out the need of psychiatric support of elder and cancer patients.</p><p><bold>PP-513</bold></p><p><bold>A Bullet That Cannot Be Taken Out Of The Body Because Of Medical Reasons And Three Suspicious Guns: Case Report</bold></p><p>Mustafa Tanrıseven<sup>1</sup>, Ibrahim Arzıman<sup>2</sup>, <underline>Mehmet Toygar</underline><sup>3</sup>, Murat Durusu<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Department of General Surgery, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Department of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p>It is important to obtain the material which serves as evidence of an event for clarifying in forensic cases.

He was wounded accidentally at the entertainment of being a soldier and during sendoff ceremony. He was transferred from Region State Hospital to our emergency service after ten hours of the incident. Vital findings were stable. By entering left anterolateral at lower cervical level, the bullet passed through oblique to the left thyroid lobe, broke the integrity of the wall of posterior trachea and esophagus, hit to the T1 thoracal vertebra corpus and was seen as 11 mm foreign body at anterior of first rib in the computed tomography. A team of general surgery and ENT operated the patient immediately because of the injury of the trachea and esophagus. By the incision in cervical region, the trace of bullet shown clearly and the left thyroid lobe was fragmented, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was intact, but integrity of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve was impaired, there was tissue defect and perforation about 3,5-4 cm at the posterior of the trachea with the perforation field of 3-4 cm of esophagus on the right lateral side. There was no injury with main vascular structures and no significant soft tissue hematoma was seen. Because of the bullet’s proximity to major vascular structures and nerve roots of the region and patient with any motor-sensory deficits, lack of hemodynamic instability, the team decided not to take the foreign body out of the body. Esophagus and trachea were repaired primary and the operation was terminated.</p><p>We learned from local law enforcement officials that three separate guns on the same scale were fired during the incident.

Examinations conducted during early phase and clinical symptoms are evaluated with the sequel symptoms. Traumatic case and clinical picture are scrutinized in terms of relation of casualty. Cases which are defined as migratuar bullet are important in this respect and unstable situations in clinical course and the quality of sequel symptoms requires more detailed examination. Migratuar bullet cases are not common in literature. It is stated in a case that a man, 43, who was wounded by a single migratuar bullet in his frontal body was taken to the emergency department and immediately operated applying craniectomy, decompression and debridement; however, because of its location, migratuar bullet could not be taken out in the operation. It is determined that the migratuar bullet image which was seen in the suprasellar region in the CT of the head scanned on the case date changed its place towards the upper part of 4. ventricle in the CT after 2 years. In the examination conducted by our institution, epilepsy, incontinence, right facial paralysis and dysphasia are identified and when the case is evaluated overall, it is decided that last clinical picture is compatible with organic brain syndrome. Since this case can be a leading factor for the assessment of physician’s liability in the evaluation of the link between permanent sequel symptoms in forensic medicine applications and complications that can be seen in the late phase of patients who have not undergone early phase operations, it is thought to be worth reporting.</p><p><bold>PP-516</bold></p><p><bold>Intradural Extramedullary Gunshot İnjury: Case Report</bold></p><p>Mustafa Aras<sup>1</sup>, Murat Altaş<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Cem Zeren</underline><sup>2</sup>, Hanifi Bayaroğulları<sup>3</sup>, Gökhan Çavuş<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty, Department of Neurosurgery</p><p><sup>2</sup>Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty, Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p><sup>3</sup>Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty, Department of Radiology</p><p>The incidence of a spinal cord injury from gunshot wounds in penetrating trauma continues to increase with the violent nature of society.

Gunshot injuries are one of the foremost fields of post-mortem forensic radiology. MSTC is performed to locate the projectile, to identify entrance and exit wounds, to detect bullets and bullet fragments in the body, to show the bullet course and others inflicted injuries. Also it is possible to do 3D reconstruction of the soft tissue and skeletal injuries. The aim of this study is to determine the differences between data collected by MSCT and data collected by autopsy investigations in the reconstruction of site gunshot entrance wound and the direction of the bullet path. In this study we report two cases of death due to suicidal gunshot injury. In the first case a 80-year-old man was found dead in the bedroom of his apartment with a gun in the right hand. An external examination of the victim showed devastating head injuries. In the second case a 81-year-old man was found dead in his apartment. He did not have any gun in the hand because it was removed from the police. In this case an external examination showed the anatomical site of gunshot injuries. Post-mortem radiological investigation (MSCT) and autopsy examination were performed in these two cases. The determination of entrance and exit wounds was reconstructed from the characteristic fracture pattern with inward or outward bevelling of the bone respectively. In this study MSCT showed an overvalued internal haemorrhage and a precise detection of skeletal injuries and skull fractures. Circumstantial data and autopsy investigation showed cause and modality of death. For this reason radiological approach is very important for reconstruction of gunshot injuries but it does not give any information about modality of death.</p><p><bold>PP-520</bold></p><p><bold>Homicides-Gaziantep (2005–2011)</bold></p><p><underline>Bekir Karaarslan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Adnan Çelikel<sup>2</sup>, Ayşe Gül Bilen<sup>3</sup>, Ömer Lütfi Özkan<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Gaziantep University Medical Faculty, Gaziantep / TURKEY</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty, Hatay / TURKEY</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Specialist of Forensic Medicine Adana -TURKEY</p><p><sup>4</sup>The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Specialist of Forensic Medicine Gaziantep -TURKEY</p><p>In this study, between 2005–2011 retrospectively examining the murders that occurred in the center of the province of Gaziantep, Gaziantep region profiling of the homicide cases and was aimed to shed light on future measures to that can be taken.</p><p>Total 463 cases, 387 percent (83.6 %) were male and 76 (16.4 %) were female.

These can be recognized mainly in the overcrowded prisons and, on the other hand, in the disproportion between the number of prison guards and the number of detainees. Over the years, this two issues have resulted in a steady increase in suicides in the prison population.</p><p>The ratio between the actual number of italian prisoners and the expected actual capacity of our national prisons has reached a total of 144/100. This implies that the 44 % of current detainees are in excess compared to the number provided by the law.</p><p>This causes an inadequate quality life, determined by the sharing of tight spaces and the insufficient number of prison officers with the onset of tensions, protests, fights between prisoners and, sometimes, suicides.</p><p>Although in prison regime the Italian average of suicides is broadly in line with the European Union (11.1 cases per 10,000 prisoners, against an EU average of 12.4), data is still alarming, resulting in an increase compared to the past.</p><p>According to the Permanent Observatory on Deaths in prison, in 2011, the deaths for suicide were only 66, with an overwhelming predominance of men (64) on women, and a predominance of Italians (45) than foreigners (21).</p><p>In the current work we present some cases of prisoners suicide occurred in the last 5 years. These suicides were in line with national trends, in particular, in addition to the total dominance of the male sex, the method most commonly used was mainly the asphyxia by hanging (suffocation is rarer), also in view of the difficulty in prosecuting death through other methodologies under detention (poisoning, firearms, etc.).</p><p><bold>PP-526</bold></p><p><bold>Re-write re-Union rights.

Through family reunion, other members of an extra-community family (applicants), are allowed to get together to their relatives already settled (sponsors) in the Community Country, who ask for their rejoining.</p><p>In 1999 during Tampere's meeting of the EC, it has been established the importance of assuring a firmer integration of persons already settled in member Countries. In 2002 the European Council (EC) has instituted the first rules on immigration fluxes. Afterward a further directive (2003/86/CE) has been issued specifically for rights in family reunion. Minor children (natural or adopted), civil or unmarried partners, dependent ascendants or elderly dependent descendants, may join to the family member already settled in community country. The origin country releases all documents attesting the blood ties with sponsor. The 5th article of such directive, quotes precisely:“If appropriate… Member States may … conduct other investigations that are found to be necessary”.</p><p>In cases involving children, therefore, where proof of the existence of the relationship between the child and the sponsor cannot be satisfactorily established, only DNA test will resolve conclusively the issue.</p><p>In Italy the Migration Agency, founded in 1951, has first requested DNA testing in 2001 to all applicants whose documents have been classified as untenable. First this proceeder has been applied to Somalian citizens lacking of their personal civil registration. Next in 2005, this practice has been extended to all other uncertain applies. The DNA test is completely financed by sponsors, in order to solve unreliable applications and, on the other hand, to deter false reunion requests.</p><p>In 2008 Italy has thoroughly improved its legislation about re-union, by dint of Legislative Decree n. 160, which has besides arranged immigration policy.</p><p>During the past 3 years, a lot of tests have been performed, but it has even came to light an inevitable question: what if minor applicant turn out to be not sponsor's natural child but just legal one?

Box 832, Alexandria, Egypt</p><p>Digital evidence for automatic handwritten signature verification is playing an important biometric role in forensic medicine’s society; since it helps questioned examiner in taking their decision regarding the authenticity of an official documents such as cheques, certificates, contracts, legal and historical documents. However, there exist many challenges in signature verification; first at all, genuine signatures are of some uncertainty that results in some difficulties in decision making. Secondly, signature’s features of different writers become conflict, variable and uncertain. Finally, a skilled forgery has almost the same shape compared to the genuine signature, therefore is more difficult to detect. Unlike other languages, Arabic has unique features; it contains diacritics, ligatures and overlapping. Because of lacking any form of dynamic information during the Arabic signature’s writing process, it will be more difficult to obtain higher verification accuracy. This paper addresses the above difficulties by introducing a novel off-line Arabic signature verification algorithm inspired by recent advances in information technology by which fuzzy modeling integrated with the combined technique of feature extraction is proposed. The key point is using multiple features to capture different aspects of signature individually in order to improve the verification accuracy. Different from state-of-the-art works that adopts the fuzzy set to describe the properties of the extracted features to handle signature’s uncertainty, this work also employs the fuzzy variables to describe the similarity degree of the of the signature’s features to deal with the ambiguity of questioned examiner judgment of signature similarity. Experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed system. It is concluded from the experimental results that the verification system performs well and has the ability to reduce both of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FAR)</p><p><bold>PP-534</bold></p><p><bold>A novel method for improving the credit card fraud detection</bold></p><p><underline>Ashraf Mohammed Elnour</underline></p><p>Department of forgery and counterfeiting researches, Alexandria, Egypt</p><p>As a result of the rise and rapid increase of E-Commerce, use of credit cards for online purchases has dramatically increased and it caused an explosion in the credit card fraud which results in loss of billions of dollars worldwide each year.</p><p>In this paper we identify the different types of credit card fraud and discuss different techniques to detect them focusing on advantages and disadvantages for every method.

Although there is no physical contact between the liquid and the hair sample, the liquids trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium dicyanamide ([P(66614)][DCA]), 1-ethanol-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C2OHMIM][BF4]), 1-ethoxymethyl-3-methylimidazolium triflate ([C3OMIM][OTf]), 1-ethoxymethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C3MIM][Cl]), 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanosulfonyl)imide ([BzMIM][NTf2]), 1-methyl-3-octhylimidazolium tosylate ([OMIM][TSA]), bis(dimethyl)dihepthylguanidinium iodide ([TMGC7][I]) and phenyltrimethylamonium triflate ([PhTEA][OTf]) showed extraction efficiencies above 80 % for the three opiate substances studied. The ionic liquid [TMGC7][I] was used in a real positive sample in order to evaluate if this process also removes drug from the inside of the hair matrix. The results showed that a small amount of the internally deposited drug is effectively extracted and this is more significant for 6-MAM. Nevertheless, additional experiments using a higher number of samples are needed in order to obtain more accurate data on this phenomenon. It was also evaluated if this process induced any morphological changes in the hair surface, and no such changes were observed.</p><p>From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the developed process has removed efficiently the external contamination of hair samples, being as such an environmental friendly process, efficient, economic and useful for application in routine analysis.</p><p><bold>PP-536</bold></p><p><bold>A proposal for the development of the medico-legal institute</bold></p><p><underline>Amr Mohamed Elghazali</underline></p><p>Medico-legal Institute, Ministry of Justice, Egypt</p><p>The medico-legal institute is challenged to take a fateful decision for one of two options. The first is, to keep the bureaucratic structure with the old vertical, conventional management and day-by-day working staff with an "artificial sense of stability"(Nadler&amp;Thshman, 1999). The second is, to restructure the hierarchy and change the professional staff into knowledge workers. "Knowledge workers are the individuals whose work effort is centered on creating, using, and sharing knowledge"(Bennet, 2009). As a governmental organization, the vertical hierarchy could modify and not totally discarded, with practice that is more flexible, lateral coordination communication and cross-functional teams. Flexibility, as it might face some resistance, could approach within the modified vertical structure. "Flexibility does not necessary to be the opposite of structure, but it might make the process of organization with the concept of the network and independent access to information and decision making"(Toffler, 1995, own translation).</p><p>This century demands, yet obliges, for a rapid and efficient responsive organization. Indeed, imposes for a knowledge worker who is highly qualified, innovative and can work autonomously plus in a teamwork. Though globalization is well recognized as a market phenomenon, it is not so far to find such a specific service that is offered by the unique medico-legal institute faces the question of quality trust from the society or the concerned authorities. It is also, not so far, for that service to privatize, replaced by the universities or even shared by foreign experts with the increasing tendency for countries to remove barriers in a marathon pace. "To deal with the global competition, employees have to be able to keep up with knowledge and new ideas to stay in the race"(Wilpert, 2008).</p><p>To change the staff into knowledge workers, the organization should adopt research work &amp; development of the human capital, activate the partnership with the universities, locally plus globally, and motivate "different innovation streams"(Nadler&amp;Thshman, 1999). Only organizations with clear vision for the future, that encourage innovation and codify the concept of knowledge workers, will survive in the 21st century competition. "The education level of employees quantifies their quality and skills, and often used to measure firm`s human capital"(Harison&amp;koski, 2010).

By using current, almost omnipresent technologies such as smartphones or other mobile devices that are widespread among students, it is possible to firmly integrate mobile learning into daily life and to better attract the interest of participating students. Of course, special care must be taken regarding the design of applications used for this purpose. Following these demands, mARble®, an augmented reality powered learning environment for mobile was developed. The use of augmented reality technologies has the potential to significantly enhance the learning experience by adding new levels of experience; instead of simply consuming what is being presented, students can better immerse themselves in the content, thus making them a part of the learning object.</p><p>mARble’s® target clientele are students participating in a forensic medicine course. For this purpose, participants are equipped with smartphones with a preinstalled copy of the application. They can then practice the detection of wound patterns in real-time by placing an appropriate marker on their own skin, pointing the mobile phone towards this marker and evaluating the overlaid image.</p><p>Additional content, e.g. practice questions and tasks as well as additional information for the provided wound patterns is also available in textual form as well as in audio and video clips or pictures. The main objective of mARble® is to elicit synergy learning effects by getting students to interact in a role-playing setting and capturing their attention, thus creating a demanding but also fascinating learning environment.</p><p>Further studies are currently under way to measure the influence these additional experiences have on the individual learning process.

Statistical parameters of forensic importance of 230 autosomal STRs including, the power of discrimination (PD), observed homo and heterozygosity values, polymorphism information content (PIC), probability of match (PM), power of exclusion (PE) and typical paternity index (TPI) were calculated for the loci (460 chromosomes). Markers FGA, D18S51 and D3S1358 had the highest power of discrimination (PD) values while TPOX was the least informative marker, the combined power of discrimination (PD) for the 15 tested STR loci was more than 0, 9999999. The combined MP value was 1 in 7.23211 × 10-18. The Benghazi population was compared with those of other populations at local, regional and global levels.

DNA STR Profiling is used to form the DNA databases of Populations all over the world for identification of humans in forensic investigations. Short Tandem Repeats (STR) are the basic small sequences of DNA which provide the information in the form of a DNA profile which is unique for each individual except identical twins. British Pakistanis is an immigrant population inhibiting major cities of UK, having their origin from Pakistan. According to the 2010 census, their population is nearly 1.2 million and they have adopted the life and culture of the UK. This population is unique among other immigrant populations that they usually restrict marriages to their own close families. Therefore, there is limited genetic diversity due to mixing of alleles within close relatives. Hence, there is high rate of consanguinity in the population that has resulted in the highest rate of autosomal diseases as compared to any other immigrant population in the UK. Furthermore, the vast majority of this population belong to particular areas of origin in Pakistan and live in specific areas in the UK such as Bradford, Birmingham, Manchester, East London etc.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The sample collection was done both by buccal swabs and by FTA blood cards. DNA was extracted by using the QIAGEN DNA Extraction Kit Protocols. After quantification, the DNA was amplified by using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler Kit by Applied Biosystems, and analysed the 15 loci on ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer.

The main field of the X-chromosome markers is kinship investigations, especially investigations of mother/son, father/daughter and complex kinship tests. When the alleged father is not present, the X-chromosome investigation is more accurate because the power of exclusion of X-chromosome STR (X-STR) in these cases is higher. It´s very helpful to establish the relationship between distant relatives and it´s also a very useful tool to relate families in unusual situations like war context, mass disasters and migrations. In the criminal field, the X-chromosome markers are important to identify the contribution of feminine traces in male aggressors or victims.</p><p>Before forensic application, it´s important to study population data and to construct reference databases to document the genetic variation of these specific STR among worldwide populations. X-STR genetic population data still limited, and population data is vital to quantify the evidentiary value of a match in forensic evaluation. Available data such as allelic distribution, null allele frequencies, mutation rates and analysis of linkage, which supports the application of these markers in the forensic field, is increasing.</p><p>As well as it occurs all over Europe, in Portugal, and particularly in Lisboa, immigrant populations are increasing.

Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum, nonselective, systemic herbicide used for control of annual and perennial plants including grasses, sedges, broad-leaved weeds, and woody plants. Severe poisoning results in intestinal hemorrhage and ulceration, acid base disturbances, renal failure, hypotension, cardiac arrest, pulmonary dysfunction, convulsions, coma, and death.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We report a case of suicide poisoning by « glyphosate » in a 36-year-old farmer with no significant medical history but who has an emotional stress because of financial difficulties that had lasted for one month before death.</p><p>We will also conduct a review of the literature regarding glyphosate poisoning.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> We carried in the Department of forensic medicine an autopsy of a 36 year old man who was brought to the emergency department the day before by his family. The initial review emergency had found a patient in coma (GCS = 3) with multiorgan failure cardiac, pulmonary and renal. The death occurred quickly, two hours after admission.</p><p>During the external examination of the body, we have found no traumatic injury. However it showed the presence of blood flow through the mouth.</p><p>At autopsy, we were impressed by the importance of the haemorrhagic syndrome in gastric and intestinal walls, which were even perforated in some areas. Since these manifestations are nonspecific, the toxicological analysis of blood and urine has established the diagnosis by demonstrating the presence of glyphosate at a rate of 4 mg / l.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although glyphosate itself is relatively harmless, its chemical formulations have been used successfully for committing suicide. This is because glyphosate invariably is formulated in a surfactant (polyethoxylated tallow amine), which is quite toxic. Despite a significant mortality, intoxication to herbicides containing glyphosate remains poorly known.</p><p><bold>PP-549</bold></p><p><bold>Accidental Death Due to the Intentionally Usage of Organophosphate: Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Mustafa Dogan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Osman Celbis<sup>1</sup>, Bora Ozdemir<sup>1</sup>, Selim Bozkurt<sup>2</sup>, Mehmet Okumus<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Inonu University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Malatya, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Sutcu Imam University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Kahramanmaras, Turkey</p><p>The use of organophosphates (OP) in agriculture as insecticides is widespread all over the world. Except for this purpose, it is known that OP have been using against pediculosis capitis in human. We report unusual causes of organophosphate poisoning. A 7 years old child and her mother were admitted to the emergency unit due to poisoning after exposure from emulsion of OP that was used for the treatment of head lice. The daughter who was poisoned by the way of inhalation and direct contact brought to the emergency unit with cardiac arrest. Child was revived with cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, but died at the eighteen days of the treatment in intensive care unit. The mother was bradicardic when she admitted to the emergency unit. After the primary treatment, the mother was taken to the intensive care unit. The mother was discharged after the medical treatment in the intensive care unit for 6 days. The hairs of patients were cut, clothes were removed and bodies were washed in order to avoid recontamination. This is important also for avoiding from contamination of surrounding healthcare personnel. Misuses of OP toxicities are not rare and it may be life threatening. Some of accidental poisonings are intentionally misuse for a purpose of treatment.

Besides that, this monitoring serves as one of the bases for creation of anti-drug programs and politics on national and international standard as well. The objective of the study is to present the most up-to-date complex review of all categories of deaths related to the psychoactive substances other than alcohol.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The study included all those deceased who died in relation to psychoactive substances abuse in the regions of Bratislava city and Trnava city districts within a five-year period of the years 2007–2011. All the cases were autopsied by standard method completed with toxicological analyses. The results of regional analysis were compared to the data acquired from other regions of Slovakia.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were reported total 185 fatalities related to psychoactive substances. From this amount 90 cases (49 %) belong to the group of direct deaths (poisonings) and 95 cases (51 %) to the group with other cause of death. Out of the total number of cases, 80 % were related to men and 20 % to women. More than 53 % of the cases were related to the age up to 34 years. In the group of poisonings, the most frequently detected substances were medicaments in 50 %. Opioids themselves or in combination with other substances were detected in 39 %. In the group of the indirect deaths, the most frequent category of death was suicide in 43 %. The most frequently detected psychoactive substances were central nervous system stimulants in 36 % of cases. The number of cases autopsied in Bratislava represented 42 % of the total amount of deaths related to psychoactive substances reported within the years 2007–2010 in Slovakia.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The found numbers of psychoactive substances related deaths reflect the reality that in territory of the Slovakia capital city there is concentrated the biggest number of psychoactive substances consumers and/or abusers.

Faculty of Medicine.Assiut University. Egypt</p><p>The potential protective role of aminoguanidine, gadolinium chloride and oleanolic acid in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity was investigated in rats. Pretreatment of rats with aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg), gadolinium chloride (10 mg/kg) or oleanolic acid (25 mg/kg) protected markedly against hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity induced by an acute toxic dose of CCl4 (2 g/kg) as assessed by biochemical measurements and by histopathological examination. Also, pretreatment of rats with any of these agents elevated the survival rate of rats treated with the toxic dose of CC14. Concomitantly, pretreatment of rats with aminoguanidine, gadolinium chloride or oleanolic acid suppressed CCl4-induced elevation of nitric oxide (NO) production and hepatic and renal malondialdehyde (MDA) level as well as reduction of hepatic and renal intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Similarly, daily treatment of rats with a smaller dose of aminoguanidine (10 mg/kg), gadolinium chloride (3 mg/kg) or oleanolic acid (5 mg/kg) concurrently with a smaller toxic dose of CCl4 (320 mg/kg) for one week protected against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. This treatment also completely prevented CCl4-induced mortality and inhibited CCl4-induced elevation of NO production and hepatic and renal MDA level as well as reduction of hepatic and renal intracellular GSH level and GSH-Px activity. These results provide evidence that inhibition of oxidative stress and NO overproduction may play a pivotal role in the protective effects of aminoguanidine, gadolinium chloride and oleanolic acid against CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage.</p><p><bold>PP-556</bold></p><p><bold>Insulin Resistance and Malathion Exposure Among A Group of Farmers in AL-Sharkia Governorate</bold></p><p><underline>Marwa Ahmed Abass</underline><sup>1</sup>, Hatem M Salem<sup>2</sup>, Nermin A Raafat<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of forensic medicine and clinical toxicology, faculty of medicine, zagazig university</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of internal medicine, faculty of medicine, zagazig university</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of biochemistry, faculty of medicine, zagazig university</p><p><bold>Background and aim of the work:</bold> Exposure to certain environmental toxicants may be associated with increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between chronic exposure to malathion and insulin resistance among farmers.</p><p><bold>Subjects and methods:</bold> The study included 49 non diabetic farmers who handle agricultural insecticides during their field work. All were males with mean age 39 ± 12 years. Another 45 administrative employees at Zagazig University Hospitals, non diabetic males well matched in age were selected as controls. History taking including family history for diabetes, general assessment of blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference and body mass index were done for all participants. Blood samples were withdrawn for measurement of malathion blood concentration and assessment of fasting blood glucose, and fasting insulin for calculation of the Homeostasis Assessment Model for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The range of the exposure period for agricultural pesticides was 15–30 years. 24.5 % had positive family history for diabetes. It was observed that there was a significant increase in the mean values of malathion blood concentration among studied farmers compared to corresponding controls. There was a strong positive correlation between malathion blood concentration, waist circumference and insulin resistance. It was also observed that the increase in the mean values of waist circumference and body mass index was associated with a significant increase in the mean values of malathion blood concentration.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The current results suggested that chronic exposure to organophosphorus malathion pesticides to non diabetic farmers may induce insulin resistance.

She had fever and pain in the right hypochondrium for which she received ibuprofen, ampicillin and gentamicin. Her general condition worsened and she was hospitalized with: malaise, blood pressure 80/40 mmHg, heart rate 65b/min, comatose state, diffuse pain in the abdominal region and macroscopic haematuria. The cardiological examination revealed the following: blood pressure 80/50 mmHg, heart rate 160b/min, ECG - atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diffuse ischemic modifications; Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal sizes, preserved systolic function, no observable valvular pathology, no pericardic liquid, no pulmonary hypertension; atrial fibrillation due to metabolical hydroelectrolytic imbalance (acidosis)</p><p><bold>Diagnosis:</bold> Septic shock.

Selenium is an important trace element needed for normal thyroid function. This trace element acts as an antioxidant in the thyroid and a regulator of thyroid hormone homeostasis</p><p>In our study we evaluated the effect of selenium on thyroid function and histopathological changes induced by subchronic lead acetate exposure.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We conducted the study for eight weeks on fifty adult albino rats of both sexes divided into five groups, each group contain ten rats: negative control group (I), positive control group (II), positive control selenium group (III) in a dose of 0.35 mg/kg bw; po daily, lead acetate group (IV) in a dose of 60 mg/kg bw; po daily and selenium (0.35 mg/kg bw; po daily) + lead acetate (60 mg/kg bw; po daily) group (V). After eight weeks rats were anaesthetized by ether and blood samples were collected to evaluate thyroid function in form of T3, T4 and TSH levels as well as lead level. Animal were sacrificed and thyroid tissue was obtained to estimate lead content in thyroid tissue. Then specimens of thyroid were subjected to histopathological staining with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscope.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Results revealed significant decrease in both T3, T4 levels and increase in TSH level in lead acetate group (IV) when compared with control group (I). An increase in lead content in thyroid tissue was observed in lead acetate group (IV). As regard histopathological results, there was numerous variable sized thyroid acini lined by columnar epithelium and filled with homogenous eosinophilic colloid material showing peripheral scalloping. On the other hand, rats treated with selenium + lead acetate group (V) showed increase in both T3, T4 levels and decrease in TSH level but not returned to normal when compared with lead acetate group (IV). Additionally, lead content of thyroid tissue was significantly decreased when compared with lead acetate group (IV). As regard histopathological results, there was some acini filled with cubical epithelium with no peripheral scalloping.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We concluded that selenium has an ameliorative effect on lead acetate induced biochemical and histopathological changes in thyroid.</p><p><bold>PP-559</bold></p><p><bold>The Protective Effects of Silymarin Against Gibberellic Acid (GA3) Induced Hepatotoxicity in Adult Male Albino Rats</bold></p><p><underline>Shereen Ahmed Elkhateeb</underline>, Manar Hamed Arafa</p><p>Faculty Of Medicine- Zagazig University</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Gibberellic acid (GA3), a plant growth regulator, is widely used in agriculture of many countries including Egypt. However, its potential hazardous effects on human health were relatively unexplored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the Protective effects of silymarin against GA3 induced hepatotoxicity in adult male albino rats.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The study was conducted on fifty adult male albino rats for 6 weeks which classified into five groups. The negative control group (I), positive control group (II) received NaOH; the vehicle 0.1 N, positive control silymarin group (III) received silymarin in a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, experimental group (IV) received GA3 in a dose of 75 ppm (part per million) daily in drinking water for 6 weeks and experimental group (v): received GA3 in a daily dose of 75 ppm and silymarin in a daily dose of 1000 mg ∕kg for 6 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, all rats were anesthetized and blood samples were collected for measuring of serum (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Oxidative biomarker malondialdhide (MDA) and erythrocyte catalase (CAT) levels then, the animals were sacrificed and liver specimens were subjected to histopathological examination.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The results revealed that GA3 sub-chronic toxicity induced a significant increase in serum ALT and MDA level with a significant decrease in erythrocyte CAT enzyme activity in comparison with negative control groups. Histopathological examination using light microscope showed hepatocytes vacuolization, inflammatory cells infiltration and portal tracts inflammation. Moreover, Immunolocalization of BCL2 showed over-expression of this protein. CO Adminstration of silymarin showed a significant improvement as indicated by biomarkers (serum ALT &amp; MDA and erythrocyte CAT enzyme activity) and histopathological finding in comparison to GA3 treated group. The results of this study suggested that silymarin supplement can improve GA3 induced hepatotoxicity.</p><p><bold>PP-560</bold></p><p><bold>Carbon Monoxide Poisonings in Cukurova, Turkey: Five Years Analysis</bold></p><p>Dilek Battal<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Ayca Aktas</underline><sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Ali Sungur<sup>2</sup>, Nursel Bilgin<sup>3</sup>, Tamer Eren<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Toxicology, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>School of Medicine, Department of Biostatistics, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>School of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Turkish Forensic Medicine Council Adana Group Administration, Adana, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication continoues to be one of the most common causes of morbitidy due to the poisoining in Turkey. Human toxicity is often overlooked because CO is tasteless and odorless and its clinical symptoms and signs are non specific. The aim of this study was to present the characteristics of medicolegal autopsies of CO poisoning cases during a period between October 2006 and August 2011 based on data collected from result of toxicological analysis in the laboratory of toxicology in The Turkish Forensic Medicine Council Adana Group Administration.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> This study was based on autopsy records of Morgue Department of The Turkish Forensic Medicine Council Adana Group Administration which were evaluated retrospectively for all carbon monoxide poisoning recorded between October 2006 and August 2011. Cases were analyzed according to the following criteria: origin, age, gender, month, year, presence or not of autopsy report and post mortem blood carbon monoxide determination.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Based on the scene investigation, autopsy examination, and toxicology study, 373 (5.22 %) of the 7141 autopsies were determined to be caused by poisonings between October 2006 and August 2011. 140 (37.30 %) out of the 373 toxicology analysis performed were recorded as acute CO intoxications. Males predominated in accidental CO poisoning with 90 cases (62.9 %) while females represented 50 cases (37.1 %). The highest frequency of CO deaths was found in December and February with 40 cases (28.57 %) and 28 cases (20.00 %), respectively. The highest poisoning frequency was recorded for the age mean 41.58 ± 23.28 years old.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the most important intoxications in Turkey. Acute intoxication is too dangerous because of its speed in addition to the particularities of carbon monoxide (CO) which is one of many ubiquitous contaminants of our environment that requires prevention and control measures indoors and outdoors to insure adequate protection of public health. It was concluded that educational programs for the community, particularly those of low socioeconomic level should be initiated to educate individuals regarding poisoning and the possibility of death as a result of such exposure. Such efforts should help decrease the number of the fatal poisonings in the future.</p><p><bold>PP-561</bold></p><p><bold>Comparison of Therapeutic Drug and Other Intoxications in Istanbul between 2009–2010</bold></p><p><underline>Aykut Taner Guven</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ayse Selcen Guchan<sup>2</sup>, Berna Dogan<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul Bilim University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Forensıc Medicine Instıtute, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In 2009 Ministry of Health hold the exchange rate in order to reduce the drug costs and took a series of measures to take down the drug prices.

The aim of this study is to create a preliminary research for the policies of therapeutic drug discounts whether to take poisoning rates as a criterion.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> According to Istanbul Provincial Health Authority database, the year of 2009 and 2010 statistics were analyzed with the SPSS 17.0 statistical program.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 2009 the first three reasons of poisoning were therapeutic drug poisoning (%37), food poisoning (%35), carbon monoxide poisoning (%7). On the other hand 2010 poisoning statistics were therapeutic drug poisoning (%53), food poisoning (%15) and carbon monoxide poisoning (%20). Other than the carbon monoxide poisoning, therapeutic drug poisoning rates are significantly increased in 2010 than the other common causes of poisoning when compared to 2009, the year that the policies of reduced drug prices was effective.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The rate of antibiotic utilization in the world is %9.9 within the other drugs while this rate is %19.0 in Turkey. It is considered that this is an indicator of uncontrolled utilization of drugs in Turkey.

The sudden death dated on 2009, and followed the urological intervention with nine days. According to the medical file, total extirpation of the urinary vesicle was performed under general anesthesia, and the fourth day after the intervention the patient was put under anticoagulants. Macroscopic and microscopical study of the corpse was performed, and a detailed description with photographing of the findings was duly registered.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The autopsy proved the lack of urinary vesicle due to surgical extirpation, the ureterocutaneostomy, as well as thrombotic formations inside middle-caliber pulmonary arteries.

In 31 % (n = 33) of the 107 cases fault was found; all of the cases where medical malpractice was found were in the area of obstetrics and none of the cases related to gynecology were found to have an element of error. Cases that had an element of error were evaluated from the aspect of profession of the health care personnel at fault, areas of fault, places where fault occurred, situations that resulted in death, cause of death, whether or not an autopsy was done, injury that resulted from fault, intervention that was done, and obstetric and gynecologic risk factors that set the stage for claims. Care standards and breach of standards were examined.</p><p><bold>PP-566</bold></p><p><bold>Obstetric malpractice litigation and cerebral palsy in term infants</bold></p><p><underline>El Akri Abdelhafid</underline>, Sestier François</p><p>Program in Insurance medicine and medicolegal expertise,Montreal university.CANADA</p><p>Despite the recognition by many researchers that cerebral palsy (CP) is rarely related to obstetric malpractice, there are many instances where obstetricians face litigation when a child is diagnosed with cerebral palsy following a difficult delivery.

In addition, we estimated the cumulative career risk of facing a malpractice claim for physicians in high- and low-risk specialties..</p><p>We obtained physician-level data on malpractice claims from a large, physician-owned professional liability insurer that provided coverage to physicians in Quebec.The data included records on closed malpractice claims for 12,916 physicians who were covered for at least one policy year from 2001 through 2010. The number of physicians grew steadily from 9,443 in 2001to 13,766 in 2010. We identified 24 specialties that had at least 500 physicians represented in our sample. Physicians belonging to other, smaller specialties were grouped together in an “other specialty” category. Across specialties, there were 113,738 physician-years of coverage, with an average duration of coverage of 4.1 years (range, 3.6 in pediatrics to 5.3 in thoracic–cardiovascular surgery). The most common specialties in our data were anesthesiology, family general practice, and internal medicine.</p><p>For each specialty, we began by calculating the proportion of physicians who faced a malpractice claim in a given year. We distinguished between claims leading to indemnity payments versus overall claims (those with a defense cost but not necessarily a payment). In sensitivity analysis, we adjusted for physician age, year, and state to examine whether these adjustments would affect our reported estimates.</p><p>There are few recent estimates on the likelihood of malpractice claims and the size of payments according to physician specialty. Using physician-level malpractice claims from a nationwide liability insurer, we found substantial variability across specialties in each of these descriptors of liability risk. Specialties in which the largest proportion of physicians faced a claim were not necessarily those with the highest average payment size. For example, physicians in obstetrics and general surgery — both fields that are regarded as high-risk specialties — were substantially more likely to face a claim than pediatricians and pathologists, yet the average payments among pediatricians and pathologists were considerably greater. The same pattern was noted in a national analysis that was performed more than two decades ago</p><p><bold>PP-568</bold></p><p><bold>The “Giustacausa” Association: permanent researcn centre and an “observer” of medical malpractise.

On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the intervention zone, these kind of malpractices are less encountered in thoracic surgery when compared to other zones. The case is a male patient, who has been treated wrongly by COPD diagnosis for long time due to a forgotten foreign body in the thorax after bypass surgery.</p><p>The case was taken to a coronary bypass surgery as a result of coronary angio in the hospital where he admitted with complaints of chest paint. He was discharged from the hospital after the surgery. The following two years after the surgery, he had many medical applications with complaints of cough and back pain and he was treated by COPD diagnosis. After 2,5 years he applied to the hospital where his thoracic computerized tomography was scanned. In his report, a mass lesion including heterogenous, hypodense and hyperdense zones with approximately 10x7x7 cm dimensions. These were confined from anterior and posterior by prominent postoperative metallic hypertonicities in the left ventricle posterior coordination. In the same hospital, in the echo test done by the cardiology department, a bulk image involving cystic and heterogenous structures with 7,5 – 4,5 cm diameter was located. The case was taken into another surgery with foreign body in the thorax diagnosis.

Postoperative hematoma often may be fatal and its incidence varies between 0.1-1.1 %. Some causes of post-thyroidectomy hemorrhage are slipping of the ligature on major vessels, reopening of the veins cauterized, retching and bucking of the patient during recovery, Valsava maneuver, increased blood pressure and oozing from the cut area of the thyroid.</p><p>In the case here presented, a man was admitted to a Surgery Thoracic Unit with diagnosis of thyroid goiter, with consequent enlargement of the thyroid compressing adjacent anatomical structures. The possibility of malignancy and the compressive action impose surgical excision as primary treatment. The aim of this presentation is to report a post-thyroidectomy hematoma that was not corrected diagnosed e treated by physicians causing patient’s death.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> A 41-year-old man was underwent total thyroidectomy; the surgery was difficult because of the enlargement of the organ. Haemostasis was achieved, and two suction drains were kept before closure. The first day after intervention, the suction drains contained 100 ml of blood bilaterally, and physicians observed edematous succulence of the cervical tissues. The day later he complained neck pain, restless, pain during swallowing, upper limbs paresthesias, increasing cervical succulence. Nevertheless doctors only removed stitches and evacuated blood clots reassuring the patient about the absence of complication.</p><p>Only after two days he was finally sent to operating room. While doctors were proceeding to decompress the hematoma, arterial blood pressure and heart rate decreased. The man died shortly after, despite medical resuscitation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At autopsy, we found diffuse hemorrhagic infiltrations of neck’s muscles and in particular of sternocleidomastoid. The hemorrhage extended from the mandible to the sternal manubrium and clavicles.</p><p>Histological examination revealed out macrofollicular and colloid cyst thyroid structure with marked congestion of intraparenchymal vessels, fragmentation of myocardiocytes, pulmonary edema, and congestion of other organs.</p><p>The cause of death was indeed attributed to extrinsic compression of the upper airways by the hematoma of the neck.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hematoma is the most serious complication of thyroid surgery that can be fatal in few cases. However, physicians can manage this potentially lethal complication by several treatments such as careful haemostasis, paying to signs of respiratory distress, and monitoring in the recovery room.</p><p><bold>PP-574</bold></p><p><bold>Medicolegal Evaluation of Informed Consent Forms Used in An Eye Clinic in A Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul</bold></p><p>Kubra Agus<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Ahsen Kaya</underline><sup>2</sup>, Haluk Ozsari<sup>3</sup>, Coskun Yorulmaz<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istanbul University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Postgraduate Student of Health Care Management, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Istanbul University, The Institute of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Nowadays, patients are becoming more and more responsible partners in their health care. If a patient is an adult and able to make his/her own decisions, he / she is the only person who can choose which his/her doctor recommended about his/her treatment. An informed consent recognizes the patient’s need to know about a procedure, surgery, or treatment, before the patient decides whether or not to have it. An informed consent includes the purpose, benefits, risks and other options of the test or treatment. When the patient signed the informed consent form, it shows that the patient understood the information about his/her medical process. The aims of this study are to analyze the informed consent forms in medico legal aspect and to determine if they are accordance with Turkish Laws or not and if there is any need for revision of forms or not.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> For this study, ethics permission document and corporation permission from Istanbul Provincial Directorate of Health were taken. Patients’ records, which were belong to patients, who were operated in an eye clinic in a Training and Research Hospital between 01 May 2011 and 31 July 2011, were analyzed retrospectively. Data about informed consents were statistically analyzed using SPSS programme (version 14.0).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In this study, 250 patients’ informed consents were analyzed. 154 (61.6 %) males and 96 (%38.4) females, having the age range 1 to 92 years, were studied. Related to patients aged 18 and over, it was seen that 168 patients (78.1 %) had signed the informed consent forms by themselves, but there wasn’t any signature on 31 (14.4 %) patients’ informed consents forms. For patients aged under 18, there is only one informed consent form without signature. There were no signatures of the doctors on 23.6 % (59) of the forms. Also, it was seen that 6.4 % (16) of the forms were not compatible with the operation on the informed consent form be signed.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Informed consent is not an old concept for Turkey. Nowadays, informed consent forms are being used but, the importance and the components of the forms have not been clear for Turkey, yet. Informed consent is a very important medicolegal risk management tool. With this tool, physicians can minimize their juridical and criminal risks. Because of these, studies about informed consent must be developed and educations, seminars must be given to health professionals about this ethical duty and also about this legal procedure.</p><p><bold>PP-575</bold></p><p><bold>Medical liability in general surgery.

In Portugal, there are few studies about medical liability, namely in a forensic perspective. General surgery (GS) is the third most common medical area implied. Our aims were to evaluate the current situation on medical liability in GS, the reasons for claims, the medico-legal conclusions, and the association between them and the judicial outcome.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We analyzed reports from the Medico-Legal Council of the National Institute of Legal Medicine of Portugal (CML) related to GS, during 2001–2010. Judicial outcomes of each case were required from the Public Prosecutor Office (PPO) and court. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test and the significance level considered was less than 5 %.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Alleged cases of medical liability in GS represent 11.2 % of the total of cases analyzed at the CML. We estimated that in Portugal 4:100.000 surgeries are subject to litigation. The majority of complaints were due to patient’s death (75.4 %). Surgeries were involved in 55.2 % and the most involved was laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In 76.1 % of the cases the CML considered that there was no violation of leges artis; in 55.2 % did not admit causality nexus between the medical practice and the alleged harm. The PPO prosecuted 8 doctors in 3 cases (6.4 %), being only 1 convicted. The CML reports are an important technical-scientific tool for judicial decision; its reports significantly influenced the prosecutor decision (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The first step to really understand the Portuguese medical liability situation has already been given, with the creation of the CML. It allowed courts to ask for technical-scientific reports from a competent and reliable institution, gifted from the technical and knowledge skills necessary to deal with medical litigation. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go, the exact problem still lies in the pyramid basis - doctors behavior. In the future, new studies should be performed regarding error or technical misadventures in surgeries involved in medical litigation as in the Harvard Medical Practice Study and American College of Surgeons Study. The comprehension of adverse outcomes and the reasons behind them, should, in a behavioral and technical perspective, help health care professionals and health system prevent error and as a result decrease medical litigation.</p><p><bold>PP-576</bold></p><p><bold>Patient Complaints Management: Approach of Istanbul Health Directorate Oral and Dental Health Department</bold></p><p><underline>Sebahat Türkmen</underline><sup>1</sup>, Anıl Özgüç<sup>2</sup>, Abdullah Coşkun Yorulmaz<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istanbul Health Directorate Oral and Dental Health Department, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Forensic Scienes, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The World Medical Association defines malpractice as “the physician’s failure to conform to the standard of care for treatment of the patient’s condition, or lack of skill, or negligence in providing care to the patient, which is the direct cause of an injury to the patient.” Dentists, like other doctors, can face punitive and legal consequences if patients are not satisfied with the dental treatment. The aim of this study was to describe patient’s complaints and requiring about private and public dental clinics to Istanbul Health Directorate Oral and Dental Health Department.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> It was conducted a retrospective study. The period was from May 2009 through May 2011, based on the complaints in dental malpractice claims and requiring about Dental Health Care System in İstanbul. The documents were studied in relation to details of the complaint, the location of the event, medical application, age and gender of the patient, gender of the dentists and the reasons for fault.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> During these 2 years, 416 application was found, 8 patients or relatives had a complaint more than one. In all cases, 354 patient with known gender was found. 240 male (67,7 %) and 114 female complainant determined, 141 dentists was complained, 56 male (49 %), 85 female (51 %) dentists performed the dental treatmant. In all cases, complaints were in fixed to related 223 claims (67,5 %) from public hospitals and dental health center,96 claims (29 %) from private sector and 11 claims (3.5 %) from university hospital. The rest of claims defined personal application for help such as difficulties in reaching services and management problems. İn all applications, 92 claims (22,5 %) identified dental malpractice. The majority of complaints were in fixed prosthodontics (n = 35,38 %) and oral surgery (n = 11, 11 %). There were 3 informed consent in written form and in 4 cases verbal informed was found.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Like all other medical staff, dentists are under the obligation to comply with the legal rules in the country they practice. Present medical and technological developments force dentists to perform risky treatments and the compensation cases brought against dentists in malpractice cases put too much pressure on them. Receiving complaints is a strong marker for increased medicolegal risk management episodes and should prompt early corrective action. This study showed importance of dentist’s communication skills during treatment procedure. Dental and oral health care facilities should be built again in terms of complaints management.</p><p><bold>PP-577</bold></p><p><bold>Varese hospital accident assessment committee.

Drainage of the fistula can be into a dural sinus or directly into cortical veins. Rarely, DAVFs drain exclusively into perimedullary veins. This retrograde drainage causes congestion in the perimedullary venous system with edema and progressive loss of cord function. Knowledge of the existence of these disorders with the pathophysiologic mechanisms is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic delay.</p><p><bold>Case report:</bold> A 67-year-old man presented in a hospital with progressive difficulties in walking and bladder retention. Neurologic examination revealed paresis of both lower extremities. MR imaging showed central myelopathy and edema from C6 to T8 and dilated posterior medullary veins. Spinal angiography showed no abnormalities. The diagnostic impression was inflammatory demyelinating disease and the patient was treated with corticosteroids. Three days later, the patient had become paraparetic and was referred to other institution. A neuroradiologist’s detailed review of the brain MR imaging revealed abnormal vascular structures around the lower brain stem and cervical cord. An intracranial DAVF was suspected and cerebral angiography showed a dural fistula at the skull base supplied by the neuromeningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery and draining into the posterior medullary veins. Following neurosurgical referral, the arterialized draining vein was clipped just beyond the arterial feeders. At that time, the patient was wheelchair-bound and dependent for daily activities.</p><p><bold>Discussion/conclusion:</bold> Intracranial DAVF is a rare disease and prompt diagnosis is important because of its potentially life-threatening clinical course. However, the early and proper diagnosis of this rare vascular malformation is challenging because the clinical manifestations are related to the anatomical distribution of the draining vein, not the fistula site.</p><p>Patients with progressive myelopathy are commonly suspected to be affected by a spinal arteriovenous malformation rather than an intracranial DAVF, so will usually have spinal angiography. However, angiographic studies must include the cranial vasculature when spinal studies are normal or if the abnormality on MRI is maximal in the upper spinal cord.</p><p>In this case, exclusively medullary angiography was performed missing the diagnosis of the intracranial DAVF with perimedullary venous drainage. Hence, from a medico-legal point of view, the diagnostic delay is likely to be responsible for the severe neurological evolution of the patient.</p><p><bold>PP-579</bold></p><p><bold>To Be A Medical Expert In Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Abdullah Coşkun Yorulmaz</underline><sup>1</sup>, Yusuf Tunç Demircan<sup>2</sup>, Mesut Sönmez<sup>3</sup>, Anıl Özgüç<sup>2</sup>, Ezgi Besen<sup>2</sup>, Nihal Kocaaslan<sup>2</sup>, Kadir Daştan<sup>2</sup>, Çimen Akgün<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical School,Istanbul University,Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Forensic Scienes, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Second Orthopedy Department, Şişli Etfal Training and Research Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>İntroduction and purpose:</bold> Just as it is seen clearly in the world, as well as in Turkey, there are an increasing number of malpractice cases and a parallel growing need for medical expert support. The focus of the discussions centers on who will be the expert, and on how they will be chosen. Due to this reason, this work focuses on the utilization of expert system used for the solution of the arguments for medical malpractice in Turkey and the problems faced in this area.</p><p><bold>Materials-method:</bold> The units where the patient complaints are filed in Turkey and the legal procedures of having an expert witness during the trial process was evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The units which are affiliated with the Ministry of Health, and which are somehow responsible for management of patient complaints, utilizes the medical doctors and dentists as a expert within their own structure. Also Medical Associations and Dental Associations may also appoint expert within their disciplinary regulations.</p><p>It is seen that for solving civil and criminal cases, during the trial process, a high volume of expert service is procured from the Council of Forensic Medicine’s 1st and 3rd Specialized Boards and from the High Council of Health. The courts have started to request an ever increasing number of expert witnesses from the forensic medicine departments of universities or from other relevant departments. Moreover, it is seen that the lawyers also request a high number of expert from specialist societies and from universities.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Regardless of this intense demand, besides those forensic medicine specialist and the limited number of clinicians with a doctorate degree in Forensic Science, there is no expert who has received a formal expert witness training. However, especially in situations where cross examinations are discussed in all aspects; it is required for the judges to be knowledgeable about medical malpractice cases as well as the expert witnesses to be attentive of scientific and ethical rules, and also for them to be aware of legal processes. This requirement can only be realized with a standard education. The evaluation of the qualification in being an expert and the evaluation of ethical values can be performed by having a specified education as a foundation.

In the cases of difficult intubation in tiroid surgery, perforation of the esophagus can be seen rarely. We want to discuss etiology of the perforations after difficult intubation in tiroid surgery with the scope of this case.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> 56-year-old male patient, diagnosed with multi-nodular goiter and tiroid surgery was decided.</p><p>Evaluation of the patient before surgery was recorded. It was decided as a difficult intubation. He was taken to the operating room and monitored. Following anesthesia, he was intubated. Process was failed at first attempt. Second and third attempts were performed with the help of guide and at the third attempt, intubation tube was inserted. After surgery, the patient was sent to the service, waking up without complications. In first day after operation with oral feeding, food residues were came from drainage. The patient was referred to another hospital with suspected esophageal perforation. Neck CT shows an emphysema under the skin, given oral contrast material were seen at the level of the carina in the esophagus and a defect in the anterior wall of the trachea and a tracheal-esophageal fistula were seen. Endoscopy with general anesthesia was planned. Tracheostomy was performed because of intubation failure. Tracheal perforation was confirmed at this time. Endoscopy showed dense edema 4–5 cm throughout the pharyngoesophageal junction. The patient was discharged after 10 days of treatment.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Trachea and esophagus rupture have been reported during Goiter surgery in literature. In this case, because of 3 difficult intubation attempts with usage of guide were led to rupture of esophagus. Complication of this type can be seen in cases of difficult intubation. The esophagus and the trachea were perforated together in this case. Esophageal intubation and thyroid surgery can cause this complication. So, it was difficult to distinguee etiologic factor of this complication in such a malpractice case. It was decided in this case that because of edema 4–5 cm throughout the pharyngoesophageal junction, intubation was the reason of oesophageal perforation and tiroid surgery was the reason of tracheal perforation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> During difficult intubation in tiroid surgery, tracheal and esophageal perforation is not the only etiologic factor of the goiter surgery. It was considered that esophageal perforation may be seen after intubation as a complication.</p><p><bold>PP-581</bold></p><p><bold>Knowledge of Medical Student About Medical Law: A Survey of Cerrahpaşa Medical School</bold></p><p><underline>İsmail Şimşek</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ahmed Serkan Emekli<sup>1</sup>, Mehmet Köstek<sup>1</sup>, Yasin Güçtekin<sup>1</sup>, Büşranur Ağaç<sup>1</sup>, Okan İnce<sup>1</sup>, Anıl Özgüç<sup>2</sup>, Hatun Hanzade Doğan<sup>3</sup>, Abdullah Coşkun Yorulmaz<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cerrahpaşa Medical School, İstanbul University, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Forensic Scienes, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Medical History and Ethics, Cerrahpaşa Medical School, İstanbul University, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpaşa Medical School, İstanbul University, İstanbul,Turkey</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Medical applications are being held within legal limitations. Physicians have to know and do their applications under these limitations. The health personel’s legal responsibilities during their occupational applications can be an issue under the circumstances of disobedience to the existing legal rules, ethical principals and standard diagnostic or medical procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of medical students on medical errors, physicians legal responsibilities and the effect of education on knowledge.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> It was invited 673 students, studying at Cerrahpasa Medical School. Over 10 % of the sample was contacted from each class.

With increased popularity, demand for tattoo removal procedure is also increasing. The type, color, area of application, age and skin properties of the person must be taken into attention for determining the wavelength of the laser, dosage of energy, adjustment for spots and number of sessions. Tattoo consists of pigment particles which are implanted into the dermis. These particles differ in size, composition and skin depth. The variation in the pigments' constitution cause chromophore changes with different absorption spectrums. This complex interaction factors cause the laser treatment's efficacy in a negative way and also the targeting rate of pigment chromophores by the laser decrease. Laser method for tattoo removal is achieved by the photo acoustic destruction of small particles, which are eliminated either by rephagocytosis of mononuclear cells via the vascular or lymphatic system, or elimination via the epidermis. After the concept of selective thermolysis came out, q-switched laser has been accepted as the gold standard for tattoo removal. The side effects of laser tattoo removal includes; necessity for multiple treatments, the risk of hypo-hyperpigmentation, bleeding after the procedure, blister formation, infection and tissue changes. Another side effect is hypersensitivity. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction against the tattoo pigments can take place in a period of days to weeks. Thus prophylactic steroid and antihistaminic treatment is a necessity.</p><p><bold>Cases:</bold> In our study, we will discuss 4 cases which came into the interest of the 3rd Council in the first half of 2012. We will discuss whether hypertrophic scar formations that appeared after the removal of their tattoos in different body parts by IPL or laser methods is a complication or a medical malpractice case. We will discuss whether there is a way to prevent these conditions and the importance of informed consent.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Like in every laser application, in tattoo removal, the device, wavelength and method is of great importance. However maybe the most important of all is the difference in personal characteristics (genetic factors) and reactions to laser trauma. Thus, knowing that scar tissue will stay forever and tattoos can not be removed totally, we believe the first application must be made in a relatively smaller area and initial response must be waited so that treatment can be advanced after reinforming the patient in a customized way regarding the initial response</p><p><bold>PP-586</bold></p><p><bold>An urethral “burn” after prostatectomy</bold></p><p><underline>Maurizio Scarpa</underline>, Eloisa Maselli, Sara Sblano, Alessandro Bonsignore, Biagio Solarino</p><p>Section of Legal Medicine, University of Bari, Italy, Piazza Giulio Cesare 11, 70124 Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The goal of this presentation is to report an uncommon case of paramedical liability during prostate transurethral resection.</p><p>Through this work, the forensic science community will consider how a surgery procedure mistake could lead to dramatic impairments, upsetting life from a psycho- social standpoint.</p><p>This case deal with a complication occurred during prostate transurethral resection.

After this negligent activity performed by paramedics, the patient suffered of urethral stenosis, bladder functional deficit and ureters stenosis in their terminal portion. In the following two years the patient was admitted to many hospitals and underwent another surgery procedure second Mainz II (sigmoid-rectum pouch). This surgery determine that the patient, for the rest of his life, will have the passage of urine per anus. The continuous infections caused left kidney faulty so it was finally removed.

Even though modern diathermy equipment is considered to be safe, accidents still do happen. These accidents particularly occur if the operation performed under emergency in which the patient’s clinical condition is urgently fatal and the members of the team could only focus to the surgical area. The false steps in monopolar diathermy application cause a situation called the diathermy burns. In this report we present the case who had acute chest pain due to rupture of aortic aneurism. While he was taken into operation urgently, cardiopulmonary arrest developed. He had resuscitated intra operatively and operation completed. After this operation burn on the anterior surface of the right hand, elbow and the distal forearm has noticed.

It can mimic plastrone appendicitis. Diagnosis can be made with preoperative USG and CT or histopathological examination of the surgically removed tissue. Because mucinous cystadenoma is related to malignities of the colon and ovary, CT, USG and colonoscopic evaluation of the patient is very important. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the perforation of mucinous tumors, with high mucin peritoneal implants and ascites formation. Which can be created by benign and malign mucinous tumors.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Our case which came to the attention of the 3rd Council regarding malpractice, is a male born in 1975, who had right lower abdomen pain which lasted for two days and was operated with an acute appendicitis pre-diagnosis at the hospital. Four days after the operation, he was discharged with full recovery. As he stated in his complaint, his pathological results were not evaluated and thus he was not informed about it. two years after the operation he went to a doctor with the malaise and weight loss and he was diagnosed with peritoneal thickening and widespread ascites in the abdomen with abdominal CT. Because he had an appendectomy history, pathology report of the appendectomy material was asked from the hospital he was operated and in the conclusion of the report the diagnosis was mucinous cystadenoma. Further investigation showed pseudomyxoma peritonei in the patient.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The appendectomy specimen, like all surgically removed materials, is sent to the pathology laboratory. However in some cases mimicking appendicitis, post-op evaluation of the pathological report is of great importance for the prognosis of the patient. What matters is, the approach of the surgeon after the result of the pathological evaluation of the material, which is mucinous adenocarcinoma, like our case. There are opinions that state surgery is sufficient for cases which are still mucinous cystadenoma and the importance of controls within short periods. In our case, which showed rapid advance and transformed to psedomyxoma peritonei from mucinous cystadenoma in two years, we will discuss the effects of lack of clinical follow up and informing the patient on the results. We will discuss the approach of the surgeon in a medico legal way. We would like to highlight, that there can be different pathological diagnoses besides appendicitis and the importance of the evaluation of these results on the prognosis of the patient.</p><p><bold>PP-589</bold></p><p><bold>Forensic Evaluation of a Suicide Case Under Antidepressive Treatment: A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Ömür Şanyüz</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kubilay Kınoğlu<sup>1</sup>, Zeynep Orhan<sup>1</sup>, Hacı Murat Emül<sup>2</sup>, Ayfer Altınok<sup>1</sup>, Seyfullah Şahin<sup>1</sup>, Ibrahim Üzün<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Psychiatry, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Major mood disorders, which were untreated or treated ineffectively, are the main clinical causes of suicidal behavior. Most of the patients are in a major depressive episode and less frequently in dysphoric mania at the time of the suicide attempt. However in euthymia, this ratio is practically very close to zero. The observations about this subject shows that as the suicide may be due to the ineffectiveness of the treatment, it may be also due to the intensity of the treatment. Like the other branches of medicine, in psychiatry, physicians must be aware of the iatrogenesis risk when prescribing potent drugs for depression to the patients with family history of suicidal behavior.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> We report the case of an 18 year-old female patient who was diagnosed with depression and prescribed antidepressant drugs. After 15 days, she went back to the psychiatrist for a follow-up examination. The psychiatrist increased the antidepressant dose and told the patient not to miss her follow-up examinations. After this appointment the patient didn’t go to see the psychiatrist again and 4 months later she jumped from a high building. Family members made a complaint about the treatment of the psychiatrist. The case file was sent to the 1st Specialty Board of the Council of Forensic Medicine for an assessment of the malpractice claim.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> In this presentation, we discuss the key points, the physicians must be careful about, during the treatment and follow-up of depression diagnosed patients, if the antidepressant treatment can be blamed as a cause of suicidal behavior alone, the responsibilities of the physician and the family about the patient’s follow-up and the effects of lack of follow-ups on the treatment of the patient.</p><p><bold>PP-590</bold></p><p><bold>Sudden deaths due to aortic aneurysm dissections; (Qestions of Malpractice)</bold></p><p><underline>Ebubekir Burak Çelik</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kenan Kaya<sup>1</sup>, Ahmet Hilal<sup>1</sup>, Necmi Çekin<sup>2</sup>, Mete K Gülmen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Çukurova University, Adana, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Adli Tıp Kurumu Adana Grup Başkanlığı, Adana, Turkey</p><p>Cardiovascular system-induced deaths constitute largest part of sudden unexpected deaths and they constitute important part of daily strivings of the judicial process.

The prognosis was about six months, but the patient requested surgery even though she was aware that she could die. She underwent a bilateral ovariectomy and exeresis of neoplastic presigmoidal tissue. Approximately 5 hours later, she went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. Within 1 hour she had another cardiac arrest and died. The patient’s family filed a lawsuit and a forensic autopsy was ordered by the Prosecutor. The major autopsy findings were: 200 cc of hematic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, small laceration on the anterior margin of the lower pole of the spleen, partial tear of the falciform ligament of the liver, pancreatic cancer, hepatic and pulmunary metastases. The medico-legal conclusions were the following: patient’s death was caused by the laceration of the spleen and the falciform ligament; both lesions occurred during surgery; the surgeon negligently injured the patient during the laparoscopic exploring of the pancreas; he failed to adequately identify and treat the injuries. Consequently, the Prosecutor press charges against the doctors.</p><p>However, we believe that the cause of death was probably the neoplastic disease, also spreading to the lungs: the patient was not able to tolerate the. We believe that ovariectomy had been an uncomplicated procedure and that the small amount of hematic fluid found in the peritoneal cavity was due to the inevitable bleeding. We hypothesize that the small laceration of the spleen and of the falciform ligament could have been caused by mechanical resuscitation attempts (external cardiac massage) because the surgery did not involve, either directly or by proximity, the spleen and the falciform ligament. In fact, the autopsy revealed fracture of the sternum bone with hemorrhagic infiltration of intercostal muscles of the third and fourth rib.</p><p>Intra-abdominal injuries following cardiopulmonary resuscitation are not always directly related to the cause of death.

Preoperative exams revealed: sinus tachycardia, slight leukocytosis, minimally augmented C reactive protein. The surgical intervention was performed under general anesthesia, inducted using sevoflurane. At the end of the tonsillectomy, a local hemorrhage required a further surgical intervention, preceded by propofol and sevoflurane administration. After controlling the hemorrhage, the child developed a sudden inotropic agents-resistant bradycardia. A prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation allowed the heart to restart beating after about 10 minutes. Nevertheless, the boy entered coma and after few days died.</p><p>An autopsy was requested to understand the cause of the death and to evaluate the medical management of the case. The forensic doctor excluded this was a case of medical malpractice, nonetheless was unable to certainly identify the cause of the death; however he. As a consequence, the prosecutor ordered a second autopsy, performed by another forensic doctor. This exam established that the cause of the death was a cardiac arrest secondary to hypovolemia caused by the additional dose of anesthetics and enhanced by the post-operative hemorrhage. Because of these two contrasting conclusions, the Prosecutor required a third evaluation of the case. The histology revealed an hidden infective myocarditis etiologically related to the chronic tonsillitis and capable of causing the bradycardia.</p><p>Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart muscle frequently resulting from viral infections and/or post-viral immune-mediated responses. This pathology is characterized by diverse clinical presentations and by the lack of safe, accurate and non-invasive diagnostic tests, thus a preoperative diagnosis would have been very difficult. Furthermore, the pharmacological therapy resulted inefficient against the bradycardia affecting the already weakened myocardium. As a consequence the existence of a medical error in patient’s healthcare can be excluded. This case emphasizes the importance of an accurate evaluation not only of the medical clinical history, but also of the autoptical and histological evidence. In fact, a misinterpretation of the data may lead the pathologist to a wrong diagnosis and, most importantly, a case of natural death can mutate in penal or civil liability for doctors.</p><p><bold>PP-593</bold></p><p><bold>Malpractice in Surgery: analysis of verdicts of the Civil Court of Rome</bold></p><p><underline>Valeria Marino</underline><sup>1</sup>, Alessandra Lazzaro<sup>2</sup>, Francesco Russo<sup>2</sup>, Luigi Tonino Marsella<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Public Health and Cell Biology, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Surgical Sciences, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Biopathology-Service of Legal Medicine and Social Security, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Claims due to alleged malpractice increased steadily over the years and surgeons are at increased legal risk because of invasive therapeutic procedures.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> the aim of this study is to analyze the civil causes of damage compensation for claims due to alleged malpractice in general surgery and to evaluate the results of the legal processes.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> we retrospectively analyzed the verdicts issued by the Civil Court of Rome in the period between 2001 to 2003, concerning medical professional liability cases related to General Surgery, focusing on the mini-invasive and abdominal surgery. The documentation is provided by the Observatory on Medical Liability (O.R.Me). We considered several parameters: number of legal actions, worker categories and surgical procedures mainly associated with cases of medical malpractice, informed consent and economic compensation of claims.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-eight complaints were filled against general surgeons and 62 % of the rulings were accepted, 31 % were rejected and 7 % were partially accepted. Among the accepted and partially accepted verdicts, in 37 cases (77 %) the surgeons were condemned for surgical-therapeutic errors, in 10 cases (21 %) for clinical-diagnostic errors and in 1 cases (2 %) for both of them. The majority of legal actions were for elective surgery (88 %) and only 12 % were for urgent surgery. The subject most sued was the operating surgeon (62 % of cases) followed by the whole surgical equipe (13 % of cases). The equipe was sued in 9 judgments and only in 1 case it was acquitted. In particular, colorectal surgery was the most susceptible to claims (20 %), followed by abdominal wall surgery (16 %) and HPB surgery (14 %). Moreover a defect in informed consent was reported in 18 % of cases. Civil processes had an average length of 4,5 years and, in addition to procedure expenses, a total of 4.948.456,60 euros were spent on patient compensations.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> the study showed that the general surgery is very susceptible to claims because of the invasive procedures; in fact the surgical-therapeutic errors were the most common reasons for claims. As evidenced by the average length of the legal processes, the Italian civil procedural system can not quickly resolve court cases, causing an increase in expenses for the sued subjects and for the insurance companies.</p><p><bold>PP-594</bold></p><p><bold>Analysis of sleep profiles, alert and attention of intensivist physicians comparing to doctors who works in office</bold></p><p><underline>Leandro Duarte De Carvalho</underline>, Déborah Lobato Guimarães, Daniel Costa Marrara Pirfo, Fernanda Armond Castro, João Pedro Rodrigues Pereira, Caroline Cândida Carvalho De Oliveira</p><p>Medical Sciences Faculty of Minas Gerais</p><p><bold>Introduction and justification:</bold> Some doctors practice in personal clinics or medical offices, while others chose to work in shifts at public or large hospitals. The profession requires high degree of alertness and attention because they have to make conscious and effective decisions, often immediate. The medical act may be influenced by the doctor’s state of humor and/or stress level. Given the importance of such decisions, the questions are: Whether the physiological and psychological state of the doctor influences the medical act? Does it depend on the medical area of expertise? Are there any significant changes in alertness and attention?</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the possible occurrence of physiological and psychological changes in the physician that works in Intensive Care Unit (ICU): sleep, alertness, attention, mood states, blood pressure, and heart-rate. And to compare them with the same changes in the physician that works at medical clinics/ offices. Methods and material: A total of 40 physicians were divided into two groups: physicians of the ICU and those who practice in their own medical office. Both set of samples filled standardized questionnaires: Sleep Habits, emotional status, cancelling icon test and Stroop Color Word Test. Results analysis: The sleep habits revealed qualitative information about sleep. The emotional states were characterized by their prevalence in the beginning and end of shift. The levels of alertness and attention were measured by the errors and time taken for both the tests.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results indicate a correlation between high workload and the level of alertness and attention of the physician. A further study and attention to this set of doctors is recommended.</p><p><bold>PP-595</bold></p><p><bold>Analysis of 25 years of malpractice claims in Anaesthesia</bold></p><p>Josep Benet Travé, Jaume Roigé, Adriana Bataller, Esperanza L Gómez Durán, <underline>Josep Arimany Manso</underline>, Miquel Vilardell</p><p>Professional Liability Service, Barcelona's Official College of Physicians, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Patient safety and professional liability are both important worldwide concerns. Anaesthesia deals with complex clinical situations and adverse events can result in serious injuries or fatal cases, therefore those events need to be thoroughly studied and claim analysis has been pointed as a useful tool.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We aimed to identify the most important safety and liability areas at high risk in Anaesthesia. A total of 7535 malpractice claims handled by the Praxis Area of Barcelona’s Official College of Physicians between 1986 and 2011 were analysed. The subgroup of files concerning Anaesthesia were reviewed and analysed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Between 1986 and 2011 we registered 7.535 malpractice claims (mean of 290 claims per year, minimum 89 claims in 1986 and maximum of 387 in 2003). Anaesthesia accounted for a 4,4 % of the total amount of claims during the study period (mean of 13 claims/year). 53 % of the procedures were related to private medicine (not the public National Health System). Most procedures were solved by the courts (62 % of claims – 35 % civil law, 65 % criminal law-) and out-of-court procedures accounted for the 38 %. In most cases (75.7 %), claims against anaesthesiologists were unsuccessful.</p><p>Most frequently reported basis of allegation were:</p><p>– Intubation techniques. Mainly dental damage (53 cases), with a low percentage of courts involvement (19 %) but with a high percentage of compensation payments (86 %).</p><p>– Anaesthetic techniques. 32 cases claiming peripheral nerve injury (72 % of court procedures, 26 % of compensation payment) y 30 cases of spinal cord injury (70 % of court procedures, 43 % of compensation payment).</p><p>– Anaesthetic induction. 59 cases of death (80 % of court procedures, 18 % compensation payments) and 23 cases of coma (65 % of court procedures and 44,4 % compensation payments).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Anaesthesia accounted for a 4,4 % of the total amount of claims, but professional liability was found to exist in only a 24.3 % of the claims. Percentage of compensation payments was remarkably high in “dental damage” category. Understanding these specific basic elements of medical malpractice in Anaesthesia may help the physicians to better manage the impact of malpractice concerns on their practice decisions and to improve patients’ safety.</p><p><bold>PP-596</bold></p><p><bold>Specialty scenario in malpractice, Barcelona, Spain</bold></p><p><underline>Josep Arimany Manso</underline>, Josep Benet Travé, Ramon Torne Escasany, Esperanza L Gómez Durán</p><p>Professional Liability Service, Barcelona's Official College of Physicians, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Patient safety and professional liability are important concerns nowadays. Jena et al. (NEJM, 2011)1 reported the 15-year results of a malpractice study using a professional liability insurer’s claims database from the U.S. Authors’ results match patterns reported in previous U.S. national studies2-3, but the analysis of the U.S. scenario may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. Spanish seem to be not so immerse in the malpractice crisis but its malpractice scenario remains largely unknown.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using physician-level malpractice claims from a large professional liability insurer in Catalonia (24,063 physicians), we provide a glance into Spanish malpractice scenario among physician specialties. We included in the study every claim between 1986 and 2011, analysing a total amount of 7,535 claims.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Traumatology and Orthopaedic Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, General Surgery and Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery were the most frequently claimed specialties. Across specialties, an average percentage of 16.8 % of claims ended up in professional liability. Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery accounted for the highest rate of compensation payments (29.3 %), followed by Angiology and Vascular Surgery (27.8 %), Oral and maxillofacial surgery (25.6 %), Pathology (23.8 %) and Neurosurgery (23.2 %).</p><p>Among those that resulted in an indemnity payment, Jena’s study mean indemnity payment was $274,887, whilst ours was far lower (€70,337). Pediatrics, Anaesthetics, Neurosurgery and Obstetrics and Gynaecology had the higher average payments. As reported in Jena’s sample Obstetrics and Gynaecology accounted for the most extreme awards, exceeding €700,000.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Frequency of claims, rate of payment, mean and maximum amount of compensation payment vary widely among specialties. We concur with the conclusions by Jena et al. that certain specialties, such as Obstetrics and Gynaecology, have both a high risk of claim and face high payments.</p><p><bold>PP-597</bold></p><p><bold>Management of Patient Complaints and Medicolegal Consultation at the Memorial Healthcare Group</bold></p><p><underline>Esra Çiğdem Cezlan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Hanife Eregez<sup>1</sup>, Sema Akgün<sup>1</sup>, Hüseyin Hakan Bilgen<sup>1</sup>, Ayşegül Ergin<sup>1</sup>, Arzu Aslan<sup>1</sup>, Seda Yalçın<sup>1</sup>, İrem Doğruöz<sup>1</sup>, Kevser Davut<sup>1</sup>, Abdullah Coşkun Yorulmaz<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Memorial Health Group,İstanbul,Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>İstanbul University, Department of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpaşa Medical School, İstanbul, Turkey.</p><p><bold>Introduction and objective:</bold> The Patient Relations Department of Memorial Healthcare Group was first established in the year 2000 to address the requirements of the Patient Rights Regulation and provides an effective Patient Complaints Management service which is monitored by a dedicated automation system since 2009. The Patient Relations Management process has been designed based on ISO 10002, ISO 9001, and JCI hospital standards. Medicolegal Consultation has been included in the Patient Relations Management process in 2011 and Medical Malpractice Risk Management approach has been adopted. This study aims to evaluate the impact of Patient Complaints Management and Medicolegal Consultation process on patient rights and staff satisfaction.</p><p><bold>Materials-method:</bold> Any data related to complaints filed at the Patient Relations Department between 2009 and 2011 were included in the analysis. The demographic data of the involved patients and the reasons of complaints were analyzed separately.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The total number of complaints received since 2009 is 4411, 2932 of which are out- and 1473 of which are inpatients. 2520 complaints were filed by the patients and 1891 by the family members. The breakdown of the cases according to payers is as follows: Private Healthcare Insurance Companies and Banks 2732, self-payers 1177, the Turkish Social Security Institution (SGK) 357, and others 145. The total number of malpractice claim incidents by doctors/nurses/healthcare professionals is 335. Based on the results of our analysis, 1265 of the complaints that were filed appeared to be justified.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The complaints of dissatisfied patients provide useful tools for monitoring the effectiveness of medical care delivered in the private hospital. To facilitate responsiveness to individual complaints and to also capture valuable feedback information, a standardized approach is recommended. The complaints reported to the Patient Complaints Management Service could be used more effectively in health care and be regarded as important evidence when working with quality improvement. Also adverse events, patient complaints and potential litigation are among the most stressful events in a medical career. Providing management of patient complaints and medicolegal consultation system can help physicians faced with these challenges.</p><p><bold>PP-598</bold></p><p><bold>The alleged malpractice cases among nurses and midwives in Turkey</bold></p><p>Burcu Elbüken<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Nesime Yaycı</underline><sup>2</sup>, Mehmet Akif Inanici<sup>2</sup>, Safa Celik<sup>3</sup>, Sinem Yıldız<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Health Sciences, Forensic Nursing MSc Program, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Medical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> It is aimed to describe the alleged malpractice cases among nurses and midwives as a function of malpractice type, prevalence, evaluation of faulty by The Supreme Council of Health.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> The Supreme Council of Health files between 2002–2008 which are related to alleged malpractice cases about nurses and midwives in Turkey are investigated. One of the researchers visited the Ministry of Health in Ankara with the written permission of both Marmara University Ethical Committee and the Ministry of Health. She investigated the related files and documented them in a classified manner. SPSS 16.0 executes statistical analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The total number of reviewed cases is 1392 and, 219 of those are related to nurses and midwives. Those 219 cases include 308 professionals. Alleged crimes in these cases as follow: %52.9 (n = 163) is death due to malpractice, 22 % (n = 68) is giving offence, 19.5 % (n = 60) is breach of duty and 5.5 % (n = 17) is professional misconduct. The reason of the allegations are 68.5 % (n = 211) mistakes in standard patient care, 22.7 % (n = 70) medication errors, 3.6 % (n = 11) violation of patient safety, 1.6 % (n = 5) errors in using health equipment and 3.6 % (n = 11) errors in sending the patient to appropriate clinics. According to the Council 34.8 % (n = 71) of the professionals are found faulty. While mistakes in standard patient care are widespread among nurses (55.5 %, n = 10), in midwives the most frequent faulty are medication errors with 49 % (n = 23). The most common medication error is IV injection (47.1 %, n = 8).</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> It is important to understand the types of malpractice among health care providers, because the implications of that kind of studies can be used to renew the health sciences curriculum. For nurses and midwives, the chance of being named in a malpractice lawsuit still remains relatively small. However, with the increased demands that have been placed on nurses and the number of adverse medical events that occur in the hospital setting, the risk clearly is increasing. Utilizing good nursing care and employing critical thinking will significantly decrease the likelihood of being named in a malpractice lawsuit. These skills combined with a good documentation technique are the best approach to use to avoid an adverse legal outcome in the event that a nurse is sued.</p><p><bold>PP-599</bold></p><p><bold>Electrocombustio of the penis with inability of conceive functions due to improper circumcision</bold></p><p>Svetlozar Spasov Spasov, <underline>Marin Kostadinov Baltov</underline></p><p>Electrocombustio of the penis with inability of conceive functions due to improper circumcision</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In certain ethnic groups a circumcision is a common procedure done to young male children.

One hour after the end of surgery his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, HR: 90 bpm and SaO2 98 %. But 2 hours later the patient had a hypotensive episode associated to chest pain and a decreased oxygen saturation. The ECG did not show any acute cardiac pathologies and the most important hematochemical parameters were in the normal range.</p><p>Three hours after the operation for a new hypotensive episode and hemoglobin decrease (11 g/dl), the patient was transferred for emergency angioCT that revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma resulting from the injury to the left common iliac artery.</p><p>Urgent laparotomy was performed; a large retroperitoneal hematoma was found and evacuated. A 10-cm tear of the left common iliac artery was identified.</p><p>There was another tear at the left common iliac vein, in the confluence with the vena cava, which was sutured with Prolene 4–0 and some metal clips. For the bad general conditions of the patient, they performed an arterial ligation of the stumps. Three hours after the end of laparotomy, for a worsening of general conditions, the patient died.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The autopsy showed in the abdominal cavity a copious hematoma (1650 ml) and a large retroperitoneal hematoma in left renal loggia.</p><p>The common left iliac artery appeared interrupted in two stumps, sutured with blue thread; the left common iliac vein, in the confluence with the vena cava was sutured with Prolene 4–0 and there were some metal clips.</p><p>At the level of L4-L5 vertebrae, there was a laceration of the anterior longitudinal ligament and of the annulus fibrosus.</p><p><bold>Discussion and conclusions:</bold> Intraoperative injury of the great vessels is the most serious intraoperative complication of lumbar discectomy and can be fatal.

Health personel has a declaration liability of the forensic incidents according to the article 280 of the Turkish Penalty Code. Similarly, according to the article 159 of the Penalty Judgement Code, Turkey, if there is a doubt about the death occured from unnatural reasons, physician must declare this death to attorney generalship and in this situation the corpse can be buried by prosecutor’s permission Therefore, physicians have declaration liability of forensic events/deaths to the attorney generalship in Turkey. However physicians can not perform this liability sometimes because of inexperience or lack of education. Studies performed in Turkey showed that physicians haven’t got enough knowledge about their legal liability. In the study, it is aimed to present a physician case, who was treating a case hitted by a cow and arranged to her a burial certificate following her death without decleration this case to the attorney generalship, thus paying attention to the physician’s liability concerning declaration of legal event.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> A 62-year-old woman case was hitted by her cow during a motor vehicle accident which was walking near to her. Then she was brought to the hospital. Subarachnoidal hemorrhage, basis-cranium fracture, pneumocephalus, L1-vertebra burst fractur, pelvic fracture were determined in CTs. After an operation for pelvic fracture, her follow and theraphy had gone ahead in intensive care unit. Although all of the treatment, she had died in 8th day of the event. At the same day, her physician had arranged to her a burial certificate then she had been buried. In the following days, the prosecuter has wanted the the physician to arrange medico-legal report for the victim. When the prosecuter has learnt that the victim had died and buried, s/he has started an inquiry concerning the physician. He has told in his statement that because the case was injuried by the cow, hence her injury was not from a traffic accident, he didn’t declare it. Legal and medical docements were investigated in the First Speciality Board of Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Justice and it was concluded that the case’s death was due to trauma so it must be declared to the attorney generalship. Because the physician had arranged the burial certificate, he was faulty.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Regular education program for the physicians concerning their legal liabilities is necessary and useful for prevent such legal falses.</p><p><bold>PP-603</bold></p><p><bold>Quelles nouveautés en matière de responsabilité de l’obstétricien face à une paralysie obstétricale du plexus brachial</bold></p><p><underline>Benzarti Anis</underline>, Ben Khelili Mehdi, Allouch Mohamed, Gloulou Fatma, Hamdoun Moncef</p><p>Department of forensic, Charles Nicole Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia</p><p>La responsabilité de l’obstétricien a-t-elle était injustement était retenue dans certaines affaires de responsabilité où la disproportion foeto-pelvienne était évidente ?</p><p>La réponse à cette question est malheureusement oui, puisque de nouveaux facteurs indépendants de l’obstétricien ont été individualisés.</p><p>Quels sont ces nouveautés, y-a-t-il des moyens pour les prévenir où est-ce tout simplement un aléa imprévisible de l’accouchement?</p><p><bold>PP-604</bold></p><p><bold>Two Malpractice Cases On Tubal Ligation</bold></p><p>Sümeyra Yılmaz, Mücteba Gülden, Metin Gülçeşme, <underline>Ahmet Sadi Çağdır</underline></p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p>There has been an increase in the number of files suited for the malpractice claim in Turkey recently. The most of the malpractice suits are related to obstetricians and gynecologists. Council of Forensic Medicine (ATK) is the supreme expertize on malpractice cases in Turkey. It is appointed to deliver an opinion on the files which are sent by the courts. One of the six boards of ATK, the third specialization board presents opinion on the malpractice files.</p><p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A pregnant woman, who was born in 1972, had a ceasarean operation and a tubal ligation by her on own will. However, the patient got pregnant again and had an abortion. The patient suited the doctor because of her pregnancy in spite of the tubal ligation. On this case, ATK 3rd specialization board accepted that the pregnancy in spite of tubal ligation was a complication and found the doctor inculpable, and presented this dictum to the court.</p><p><bold>Case 2:</bold> A woman, who was born in 1978, made an agreement with a doctor to have a tubal ligation in the course of her ceasarean operation. The tubal ligation was recorded in the operation notes. But the patient discovered that she become pregnant again after 8 months. The patient did not want an abortion and gave birth to a living baby with a ceasarean operation. Then suited the doctor. In this case, ATK 3rd specialization board found the doctor culpable because of the fact that the tubal ligation was not carried out in the course of the operation.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The number of malpractice suits has been increasing in Turkey. Medical doctors should be aware the ways of defending themselves. Emphasis on caution and care in the patient-doctor relationships would extenuate the malpractice cases. Determination of nursing standards and administration of disclosure requirements are the other factors which would extenuate the number of legal problems between the patient and doctors.</p><p><bold>PP-605</bold></p><p><bold>Large Vessel Injury Following Lumbar Disc Surgery</bold></p><p>Kubilay Karabacak<sup>1</sup>, Gencer Genc<sup>2</sup>, <underline>Cemal Onur Noyan</underline><sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Maresal Cakmak Military Hospital, Erzurum, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Neurology, Maresal Cakmak Military Hospital, Erzurum, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Psychiatry, Gumussuyu Military Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Large vessels are adjacent to the vertebrae anatomically.

These results remained statistically significant after controlling for possible intervening factors, such as the missing person’s gender.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study assesses the implications of these racial/ethnic differences for law enforcement policies and procedures.</p><p><bold>PP-607</bold></p><p><bold>The Control Region Data of Mitochondrial DNA in Chinese Population in Sichuan Province of China</bold></p><p>Yu You Yang, Feng Song, Zheng Ren, <underline>Yi Ping Hou</underline></p><p>Institute of Forensic Medicine, West China School of Preclinical and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Forensic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis was a complementary technique to forensic nuclear DNA and trace evidence analysis. Many studies dealing with the control region (CR) polymorphisms of mtDNA were published, most of which focused on the first two hypervariable segments, whereas there was yet another section also including notable variation. There was a lack of mtDNA data in Chinese population in Sichuan province, China. Analysis of mtDNA in this study was to cover the entire control region of mtDNA in a Chinese population sample in Sichuan province, China.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The blood samples were collected from 200 unrelated individuals residing in Sichuan province, China. The mtDNA was extracted by alkaline lysis with SDS method, which was proved to be convenient, effective and highly productive. Two pairs of PCR primer were designed for amplification of the CR with 1122 bp. There was a small overlap between the two amplicons, which might help the sequence assembling. The PCR products were purified for sequencing. Sequencing reactions were carried out using the amplification primers as sequencing primers. PCR products were sequenced on both strands, thus each CR position was covered twice. Proper contamination prevention and quality assurance procedures were applied. Software-assisted basecalling and alignment to the revised version of Cambridge Reference Sequence were accompanied by a thorough visual inspection of sequence traces.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Sequence alignment showed that more than 160 haplotypes were found, among which more than 140 haplotypes were unique, while the other 20 haplotypes were shared by two or more individuals. Genetic diversity (GD) was estimated to be 0.998.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The fact that the region between hypervariable segments also had many polymorphic sites demonstrated that it was worthwhile to analyze the entire control region, including non-HV sequences. The screening method for the control region of mtDNA presented here provided a reliable and cost-effective supplementary technique for routine applications, especially forensic database study. This study provided a sound basis for forensic casework and the data can well supplement the Chinese mtDNA database.</p><p><bold>PP-608</bold></p><p><bold>Identification of a Burned Man</bold></p><p><underline>Neslihan Alpay Aral</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bilgin Kütükcü<sup>1</sup>, Alper Uz<sup>1</sup>, Kadir Demircan<sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Department of Biology, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In forensic cases, it is very important to identify victims as soon as possible. Fingerprinting and DNA analysis are effective methods in forensic identification. These methods are useful if comparative informations are available. It is difficult to identify highly damaged or decomposed bodies by fingerprinting. So, DNA analysis plays much more important role in identification of victims.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Five person died in a burning vehicle. Their corpses were unrecognizable. Biological samples of their relatives were examined for identification.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> DNA was isolated from blood samples of victims by using QIAmp® DNA Mini Kit and Qiagen Biorobot EZ1 workstation with the EZ1 DNA Blood Kit. PCR amplification of 15 STR loci was performed by using AmpFlSTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplification Kit. The amplified products were genotyped on ABI 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Autosomal STR and gonosomal Y-STR DNA profiles of four corpses were compared with their relatives and positive results were detected. But the fifth corpse (13, 29) was not matched with the alleged brother (14, 30) in two Y-STR loci (DYS389-I, DYS389-II). Then we studied the biological samples of his mother and second brother. The resulting Y-STR DNA profiles of two brothers were the same (14, 30). But we saw allele transition of 15 autosomal STR loci from biological mother to two brothers and fifth corpse. Since the absence of the biological father, we couldn’t be sure about that it was a mutation or not.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To avoid longer processes in identification studies, especially biological mother, father or child should be preferred for DNA comparisons. Only brother or sister is not enough for exact identification.</p><p><bold>PP-609</bold></p><p><bold>Gender Differences among Individuals Classified as Missing-Unknown in Missing-Person Reports</bold></p><p><underline>Stephen Morewitz</underline></p><p>California State University, East Bay</p><p>Researchers are analyzing the role of demographic, social, and behavioral factors that may influence how law enforcement professionals classify missing-persons reports. The gender of missing persons may influence whether their missing-persons reports are classified as missing-unknown, which means that law enforcement does not know the circumstances of the case. The present investigation is part of the Missing Persons Project, which is based on a random sample of 997 missing-persons reports that were filed between 1991 and 2004 and published on the North American Missing Persons Network and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children websites. This investigation tests the null hypothesis that the missing persons’ gender is not associated with whether their missing-persons reports are classified as missing-unknown. Each missing-person report was coded using a protocol that contains 291 variables. The coded data were entered into a data file and Chi-Square and logistic regression were then performed using Systat 9 for Windows program (1999). The null hypothesis was rejected. Missing males (19.7 %) were more likely than missing females (13.8 %) to be classified as missing-unknown (Chi-Square = 6.21, df = 1, p &lt; .01). These results remained statistically significant after controlling for possible intervening factors, such as the missing person’s race.

Several lines of evidence indicate proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors and proteinases are involved in thrombus formation and resolution, In the present study, we tried to find out the dynamics of intrathrombotic IFN-γ, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 and established the histopathological markers for the age estimation of venous thrombi using the murine model with stasis-induced DVT.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Male BALB/c mice were anesthetized by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and, via a laparotomy, the inferior vena cava (IVC) was ligated with 3–0 silk suture. From 1 to 21 days after the IVC ligation, the IVCs were harvested, and subjected to histopathological analysis, immunohistochemical analysis and a double-color immunofluorescence analysis (n = 5 per group). In the separate set of experiments, the intrathrombotic gene expression of Ifng, Mmp2, Mmp9 and Vegf was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (n = 5 per group).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Intrathrombotic Ifng mRNA could be detected in thrombi and its expression was elevated progressively as thrombi aged. Moreover, double-color immunofluorescence analyses detected IFN-γ mainly in F4/80-positive macrophages. Immunohistochemically, F4/80-positive macrophages could be detected in the whole course of thrombi after IVC ligation. Similarly, intrathrombotic MMP-2- and MMP-9-positive cells were observed during the whole course of thrombi, and they also could be detected in the F4/80-positive macrophages on double-color immunofluorescence analyses. Intrathrombotic recanalization was presumed to be essential for thrombus resolution. The number of intrathrombotic von Willebrand factor-positive channels was increased progressively as thrombi aged. The Mmp2, Mmp9 and Vegf mRNA was consistently detected in the 3- to 14-day-old thrombi. The peak of Mmp9 gene expression was at 10 days, whereas the gene expression of Mmp2 and Vegf was elevated progressively as thrombi aged.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our previous study, the activation of the IFN-γ/Stat1 signal pathway suppressed PMA-induced Mmp9 and Vegf gene expression in peritoneal macrophages. Indeed, IFN-γ protein was immunohistochemically detected in venous thrombi obtained from human autopsy cases. These observations demonstrated that the dynamics of intrathrombotic IFN-γ would be applicable for thrombus age determination.</p><p><bold>PP-612</bold></p><p><bold>Pathophysiological role of TNF-Rp55 on murine deep vein thrombosis model</bold></p><p><underline>Mizuho Nosaka</underline>, Yuko Ishida, Yumi Kuninaka, Mariko Kawaguchi, Akihiko Kimura, Toshikazu Kondo</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the major causes in pulmonary thromboembolism from both clinical and forensic aspects. We explored the pathophysiological roles of TNF-α-TNF-Rp55 axis in the formation and resolution of venous thrombi using murine model with DVT.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> WT and Tnfrp55−/− mice (8- to 10-wk-old) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and, via a laparotomy, the inferior vena cava (IVC) was ligated with 3–0 silk suture. At 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days after the IVC ligation, mice were euthanized and thrombi with vessel walls were harvested, and subjected to further analyses (n = 5 per group). The numbers of intrathrombotic neutrophils, macrophages, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were immunohistochemically examined and enumerated. In the separate set of experiments, the intrathrombotic gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and fibrinolytic factors was analyzed from thrombi by real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, the blood flow within and around the thrombosed IVC was investigated by the laser tissue blood flow meter. We performed in vitro analysis to validate these results. We harvested the intraperitoneal macrophages of WT and Tnfrp55−/− mice. And the cells were stimulated with TNF-α (500 U/ml) for 24 hours, the cells were subjected to real-time RT-PCR.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Upon the IVC ligation in WT mice, venous thrombi developed progressively until 5 days, and remained similar sizes at 10 days. Concomitantly, intrathrombotic TNF-α contents were elevated progressively with an increase of post-ligation intervals. When Tnfrp55−/− mice were treated in the same manner, thrombus size was similar to that in WT mice until 5 days after the IVC ligation, but it was apparently larger at 10 and 14 days, compared with WT mice. The gene expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was lower in Tnfrp55−/− mice than in WT mice. There were no significant differences in number of F4/80-positive macrophages and MPO-positive neutrophils between WT and Tnfrp55−/− mice. We examined the effects of TNF-α on gene expression of Mmp2 and Mmp9 in WT and Tnfrp55−/− mouse-derived intraperitoneal macrophages. Subsequently, TNF-α significantly enhanced the gene expression of Mmp2 and Mmp9 in WT mouse-derived peritoneal macrophages.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The absence of TNF-Rp55 have a detrimental role in the thrombus resolution by suppressing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, and TNF-α-TNF-Rp55 axis may be a good molecular target for the treatment of DVT. The present study also demonstrated that the pathophysiological detection of TNF-α-TNF-Rp55 axis was useful for estimation of venous thrombus age.</p><p><bold>PP-613</bold></p><p><bold>The proteome in mouse skeletal muscle after repeated alcohol administration</bold></p><p><underline>Masahide Mitsuma</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kazuya Ikematsu<sup>2</sup>, Yoriko Shinba<sup>1</sup>, Shuuji Kozawa<sup>3</sup>, Takahiro Umehara<sup>2</sup>, Ichiro Nakasono<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Nagasaki University, School of medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Legal Medicine, Division of Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world. Repeated administration of alcohol causes various physical or mental disturbances. There are many reports concerning skeletal muscle impairments related to alcohol, such as striated muscle dissolution and muscle atrophy. Although the mechanism of the relation between alcohol and the muscular diseases has not been cleared yet, it is suspected that repeated administration of alcohol might change some specific proteins in skeletal muscle. So, we investigated the proteome in the skeletal muscle after the repeated alcohol administration in mouse.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Mouse was treated with 3.5 g/kg ethanol (n = 4), and saline as control (n = 4), once daily for 4 weeks. The iliopsoas muscle was collected at 24 hours after the final injection, and protein was extracted. The samples were labeled with fluorescent dye Cy3, and each was added to the all mixed samples labeled Cy5, as reference with CyDye DIGE Fluor Labeling kit for Scarce Samples. Both were applied for two-dimensional electrophoresis (pH 4–7, 18 cm IEF and 20 cm length 12 % SDS-PAGE), and then the spots in alcohol group were compared with those in control using DeCyder 2D Software ver 7.0.</p><p><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> In all samples, over about 1850 spots could be detected with the software. After comparing these spots of the two groups, the density of 2 spots increased in only alcohol treatment, and the calculated ratio with the software of the average density of the spots were 1.67 and 1.14 times compared with those of the control. On the other hand, those of 4 spots decreased and the densities were −1.40, -1.24, -1.23, and −1.22. Our results suggested that the repeated alcohol administration might change the expression of protein in skeletal muscle. We intended to identify these proteins and clarify the patho-physiology about muscle disturbance after repeated alcohol administration.</p><p><bold>PP-614</bold></p><p><bold>Expression of Sstr4 and Stx11 in mouse pituitary after chronic stress treatment</bold></p><p><underline>Yuki Abe</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kazuya Ikematsu<sup>2</sup>, Keita Shingu<sup>1</sup>, Takahiro Umehara<sup>2</sup>, Ichiro Nakasono<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Recently, death from overwork has been paid a great deal of attention as one of the serious society problems in Japan. The people who died from overwork must suffer from chronic stress. It is important to diagnose chronic stress to demonstrate the death from overwork in forensic practice. Unfortunately, forensic pathologists did not have any useful tool or maker to do it. Although stress induces glucocorticoid (Gc) secretion from adrenal glands, there is huge variance in blood of dead body due to the stress of agonal stage, and the hormone could not be available for forensic practice.</p><p>We already reported that the Somatostatin receptor 4 (Sstr4) and Syntaxin 11 (Stx11) increased after high-dose Gc treatment in pituitary adenoma cell (Kwashima et al. 2010). We assumed that these mRNA might increase after long-term stress, as chronic stress must be high Gc state. So, we investigated the both mRNA expression after chronic stress in mouse pituitary.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> The restraint to mice was utilized as stress model. The mice were treated only once as single, or once a day for one week as chronic. No restriction were employed as control. They were euthanized at 60 min after the final treatment and pituitary was collected. The level of Sstr4 and Stx11 mRNA from the gland were measured with q-PCR method.</p><p><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> There was no significant difference of Stx11 with single and chronic treatment between the stress treatment and control. On the other hand, Sstr4 showed the significantly increase after the chronic treatment but not with the single. We considered that Sstr4 might increase expression by chronic stress.</p><p>So, we concluded that the evaluation of Sstr4 mRNA might be useful to diagnose the chronic stress for forensic practice.</p><p><bold>PP-615</bold></p><p><bold>FAS ligand expression in mouse skeletal muscle, spleen and thymus of mouse after chlorpromazine</bold></p><p><underline>Takanori Mizuno</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kazuya Ikematsu<sup>2</sup>, Takahiro Umehara<sup>2</sup>, Takanori Koyama<sup>1</sup>, Ichiro Nakasono<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><sup>2</sup>Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is widely used as anti psychotic drug. CPZ might lead to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) as side effect. NMS manifests muscle weakness, rigidity and rhabdomyolysis to death. As almost all studies about NMS aimed at brain, there were few studies about skeletal muscle where the disturbance occurred at NMS. We already reported that FAS, which induced apoptosis, expression changed after single CPZ administration but not at 4 weeks treatment in skeletal muscle. The cascade to apoptosis via FAS was activated after FAS ligand bound to FAS. FAS ligand expressed on mainly lymphocyte. The aim of this study was to investigate the mRNA expression of FAS ligand in skeletal muscle, spleen and thymus of mouse.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Mice were administrated with 7.5 mg/kg CPZ and euthanized at 0, 2, 4, 12 or 24 hour later. Saline was used as control. RNA was extracted from iliopsoas muscle, thymus and spleen. We examined the mRNA level with quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR).</p><p><bold>Results and discussions:</bold> FAS ligand expression in spleen significantly elevated at 2 and 4 hour, on the other hand the expression in thymus elevated from 2 to 24 hour after CPZ administration. There were no increases in iliopsoas muscle at any time. Our results clearly suggested that the strong inducer of apoptosis, FAS ligand, must increase immune organ including spleen and thymus. A lot of lymphocytes exist in spleen and thymus and FAS ligand mainly expresses on the lymphocyte surface. So we assumed that the cells expressed FAS ligand at early stage after CPZ administration. In addition, we previously reported that the expression of FAS elevated on iliopsoas muscle and heart from 2 to 12 hour after CPZ administration. Thus, CPZ administration could affect not only muscle but also immune system, and apoptosis might happen in various organs. Next step, we will clarify the protein expression of FAS and FAS ligand and demonstrate the morphological apoptosis in various organ.</p><p><bold>PP-616</bold></p><p><bold>Expression of Ucp1, Pgc1α, Creb3 and Dio2 in the brown adipose tissue in a rat model of fatal hypothermia with alcohol</bold></p><p><underline>Takahiro Umehara</underline>, Kazuya Ikematsu, Yoshiaki Hama, Ichiro Nakasono</p><p>Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Diagnosis of fatal hypothermia is considered to be difficult in forensic practice because of the lack of any specific pathological findings. The mechanism that induces abnormal behavior such as undressing or hiding during the state of hypothermia has not been clarified. Additionally, alcohol is frequently detected in blood of the case of hypothermia. In order to examine pathophysiology of fatal hypothermia and influence of alcohol on fatal hypothermia, we constructed a rat model of fatal hypothermia with alcohol, and investigated the expression of Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (Pgc1α), cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 (Creb3) and Deiodinase, iodothyronine, type Π (Dio2) in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), which plays major role in cold-induced thermogenesis in rodent.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Rats were oral administrated with 20 % alcohol (3 g/kg) or water as control (n = 7). After administration, rats were immediately treated on ice at cold room (4°C) or room temperature (22-24°C) as control. We regarded the cold exposed rat with alcohol as a model of fatal hypothermia. The rat belonging to cold without alcohol, room temperature with or without alcohol, was euthanized at the time from the alcohol administration to death of the cold exposed rat. Total RNA was extracted from BAT and measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR.</p><p><bold>Results and discussions:</bold> Surprisingly, the expression of Pgc1α and Dio2 were significantly increased under the conditions of only cold exposure with or without alcohol, not did at room temperature with both treatments. The expression of Ucp1 was significantly increased under the condition of alcohol administration at room temperature compared to the conditions of cold exposure with or without alcohol and water administration at room temperature. Dio2 is expressed by brown adipocytes in order to make thyroid hormone the activate metabolism of BAT. Ucp1 expression depends on activation of Pgc1α and Creb3, which are transcription factors at the upstream of Ucp1. However, our findings suggested that the expression of Ucp1 must not follow after the Pgc1α elevation. In conclusion, our study implicated that Pgc1α and Dio2 had possibilities to be the diagnostic marker of hypothermia.</p><p><bold>PP-617</bold></p><p><bold>The investigation of microRNA-21 expression in Viral myocarditis and forensic applications</bold></p><p><underline>Hongfei Xu</underline><sup>1</sup>, Yujie Ding<sup>2</sup>, Yiwen Shen<sup>1</sup>, Ziqin Zhao<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Medical Cosmetology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University,Nantong,China</p><p>Viral myocarditis(VMC), known as one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, is a serious threat to people's lives and health, and causes a high rate of sudden unexpected death especially among young people. Problem is that some atypical death cases caused by VMC have no clear clinical symptoms and histopathological manifestation as well as comprehensive examination records, and thus an objective and detective indicator is necessary and demanding. Based on our many years of research in this subject caused by sudden death, we make the VMC models and through the production of primary cardiac cell culture, we investigated miR-21 expression and its potential role in the mice model of viral myocarditis(VMC). The expression level of miR-21 and its target gene SPRY was measured by realtime PCR and western blotting, respectively. The miR-21 expression levels were significantly increased in cardiac myocytes from VMC compared to control samples (relative expression: 10 ± 2.5 vs. 31 ± 7.6, P&lt;0.05). Among the target genes of miR-21, SPRY1 protein expression was significantly reduced in VMC mice while there was no significant difference in the its mRNA levels in the study groups. Our results revealed an inverse correlation of expression between miR-21 and SPRY1 protein in VMC samples. The identical potential binding site was found for mouse miR-21 and SPRY 3’-untranslated region. Moreover, overexpression of miR-21 in myocardial cells was accompanied by a selective decrease in expression of the protein SPRY1, but without changing its transcript level. Together, our results indicate that miR-21 is involved in VMC by post-transcriptional repression of SPRY1, which will help enrich our cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology of understanding of the mechanism of sudden cardiac death caused by VMC.</p><p><bold>PP-618</bold></p><p><bold>Effects of wound on circadian rhythm of skin tissue</bold></p><p><underline>Akihiko Kimura</underline>, Mizuho Nosaka, Yuko Ishida, Yumi Kuninaka, Toshikazu Kondo</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Wakayama Medical University</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Wound examination is one of the most important tasks for forensic pathologists. The evaluation of relationship between wounds and death, and wound age estimation are essential for forensic practice. Basic biological knowledge of skin tissue seems to be very important for accurate diagnosis of skin wounds. Recent studies on biological clock in mammal show that biological clock exists in most tissues and is involved in their homeostasis. However, biological clock in skin tissue is still to be investigated. In this study, we clarified biological clock in intact and wounded skin tissue.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> All mice were bred and housed at a constant temperature (23 ± 2°C), with a 12-hr light/dark cycle (light on at 8:00 and off at 20:00). For control skin tissue samples, mice were anesthetized at interval of 2 hr (0:00 to 22:00) with i.p. administration of pentobarbital. After shaving and cleaning with 70 % ethanol, the dorsal skin was picked up at the midline and punched through 2 layers of skin with a sterile disposable biopsy punch (4 mm diameter), and the collected skin tissues were subjected to gene and protein expression analysis with RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. For wound tissue samples, skin tissues around the initial wound were collected with biopsy punch (8 mm diameter) at 0.5-24 hr after wounding.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Significant circadian expression of clock genes (Per1, Per2, Bmal1 and Rev-Erb 1 alpha) was observed in control skin tissue, which was essentially consistent with clock gene expression pattern in the kidney, liver and heart previously reported by us. Circadian protein expression of LC3-II, a marker of autophagosome formation, and sequestosome-1 (P62), a protein degraded by autophagy, was also observed in the skin tissue, indicating that autophagy exhibits circadian rhythm in the skin tissue. In the wounded skin tissue, circadian clock gene expression was significantly attenuated, however, still oscillated in low amplitude, which was observed 3 hr after wounding. LC3-II protein expression was significantly reduced in the wounded skin tissue. In contrast to LC3-II, P62 and HO-1 protein levels were significantly increased 3 hr after wounding.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Skin tissue exhibit robust circadian rhythm. Wounding has significant effects on circadian clock in the skin tissue. It may possible to estimate time of death by clock gene expression in the intact skin tissue. Moreover, changes of the molecules regulated by circadian may contribute to wound age estimation.</p><p><bold>PP-619</bold></p><p><bold>Identification Of The Structural Proteins In Active GABA NEUROTRANSMITTER (CNS Drugs) By Bioinformatics Models</bold></p><p><underline>Zahra Abbasi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Shahzad Ahmad<sup>2</sup>, Rouhollah Abbasi<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Genetics and plant breeding, BHU, Varanasi, India</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Farensic Science, OU, Hyderabad, India</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of psychology, ATU,Tehran, Iran</p><p>GABA (Gama Amino Butyric Acid) is the major inhibitory amino acid s transmitter of the human central nervous system which is present in construction of the Cerebral Cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia.

Y-chromosome Azoospermic Factor (AZF) region study is one of the strategies to diagnose it. This study aimed to characterize the AZF region microdeletions by Y-STRs and STS studies and its possible impact in forensic casework.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Selected samples from fifty-two patients studied for male infertility, collected under informed consent, were characterized at molecular level with specific STS for the presence/absence of the three AZF regions: AZFa – DFFRY3, DBY; AZFb – sY1227, sY1224, sY134, sY119, sY134, RBMY1, sY143; AZFc – sY1192, sY254, RRM3, sY1291, sY283, sY1201. AmpFℓSTR® Yfiler® kit was used to obtain a 16 Y-STR profile.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All samples were concordant in forensic and molecular studies, although with different scenarios: a) a normal Y-STR profile and no deletion with STS in the AZF region were revealed in about 32 % of the studied samples; b) the majority of samples, about 51 %, revealed also a normal Y-STR profile, but with a complete or partial deletion(1 or 2 STS) in the AZFc region; c) deletion in DYS385, DYS392, DYS448 and in AZFb + AZFc were detected in 3 samples. Four samples have the following different scenarios: d) deletion in DYS385, DYS392, DYS448 and in AZFb; e) deletion in DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS385, DYS438, DYS439, DYS458, DYS635 and in AZFa; f) deletion in DYS448, in STS sY1197 and in AZFc; g) deletion in DYS390, DYS392, DYS385, DYS448, GATAH4 and in AZFb + AZFc region. All Y-STRs studied for forensic casework are localized, essentially, in the AZFa or AZFb regions, although DYS448 is located in the distal AZFb region and DYS390 and GATAH4 are localized between AZFa and AZFb regions. Deletion in the AZFc region does not affect results in forensics.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The knowledge of Y-chromossome microdeletions is important in Forensic Genetics as this can be encountered in current casework without possibility to perform clinical studies. So, it is crucial to know how to interpret the results obtained in Y-STR microdeletions samples, according to Y-chromossome structural alterations. As Y-STRs used in Forensic Genetic Laboratories are located in the AZF region, associated to male infertility, this can raise some ethical problems in Forensics.</p><p><bold>PP-621</bold></p><p><bold>The frequencies of clinically important alleles of CYP2D6 gene in a Turkish population</bold></p><p><underline>Ayse Serin</underline>, Husniye Canan, Behnan Alper, Mete Korkut Gulmen</p><p>Cukurova University Medical Faculty Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p>CYP2D6 is a polymorphic genetic site, responsible for the metabolism of several important drugs in clinical use. The genetic polymorphism at this site influences the expression and function of the CYP2D6 protein and its enzyme activity. These changes may result in its ability to metabolize drugs that can lead to severe toxicity or therapeutic failure. In forensic medicine, it is important to examine postmortem CYP2D6 allele heterogeneity in relation to the drugs responsible for fatal poisoning cases to discriminate them as accidental or undetermined.</p><p>CYP2D6 activity can be predicted by genotyping the most common CYP2D6 alleles. Regional differences in the frequency of CYP2D6 genetic variants leading to population-specific drug metabolizing enzyme activity patterns are observed.</p><p>The aim of this work is to describe the distribution of the some genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 responsible for poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM) and ultra rapid metabolizers (UM) genotypes in a Turkish population.</p><p>We analyzed allele and genotype frequency distribution of CYP2D6*3, *4, *5, *6 and *10 variants of 100 unrelated healthy individuals by using TaqMan Drug Metabolism Genotyping Assay and TaqMan Copy Number Assay in Taq Man Real-Time PCR.</p><p>The allele frequencies for CYP2D6*3 (A2549del), *4(G1846A), *6 (T1707del) and *10 (C100T) were 1 %, 10 %, 2.5 % and 14.5 % respectively, while allele frequency of CYP2D6*5 (whole deletion of the gene) was found in 3 % of the subjects tested.</p><p>In this study with 100 subjects, EM genotype frequency (all genotypes not showing any of the mutations of interest were classified as EM) was found 63 %. Among the remaining 37 subjects, total PM genotype frequency was found 4 %, while IM genotype frequency was found 12 %. CYP2D6 gene duplication was found 4 % in this study.</p><p>Our results show that the frequencies of the common defective allelic variants and gene duplication of CYP2D6 in Turkish populations are similar to those reported for several other Turkish populations living in different cities (such as Bursa, Ankara, Istanbul) and some European Caucasian populations.</p><p>In conclusion, 4 % Turkish people who have two nonfunctional defective allele causing PM phenotypes is a high risk group and 12.5 % Turkish people who have two decreased functional defective allele or one normal and one non functional defective allele causing IM phenotypes are also in the risk group.

HPV is recognized as the primary etiological agent of cervical cancer worldwide. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the presence and genotypes of HPV in sex workers using cervical specimens.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> A hundred and thirty-seven sex workers from Ankara brothels that referred to Ankara Municipality Hospital, Department of Venereal Diseases for routine examination voluntarily participated to the study. After the informed consents are received, the study group was interviewed face to face to obtain information about the socio demographic data. Cervical specimens were collected from the cases, investigating the genotypes of 21 types HPV DNA.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> HPV DNA was found positive in 53 of the specimens following the DNA extraction in the swab specimens collected from the prostitutes. Of these specimens, the genotypes of the low cancer risk group were found in 7 cases, indefinite risk group in one case and high-risk group in 38 cases, while genotypes of various risk groups were detected in 7 cases. Of the specimens with various risk groups accompanied, genotypes of indefinite and high-risk group were found in 4 cases, low and high-risk group in 2 cases and, each three risk groups in one case. No DNA was obtained belonging to any type of HPV in 84 participants.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Women working in brothels are at high risk for venereal diseases. This issue should be emphasized to protect both sex workers’ health and the health of the community. It is noteworthy that the genotypes of HPV identified in sex workers are particularly high-risk types with carcinogenic effects. Therefore, informing training activities should be organized for women working in brothels and protective measures should be implemented.</p><p><bold>PP-623</bold></p><p><bold>Chimerism.

Today there is a new concept: chimerism necessarily has to be taken into consideration when it comes to genetic profiles with forensic interest.Unexpectedly,sometimes, when different samples from the same person are analyzed, it is possible to conclude that these different samples seem to be originated from two different persons! However, taking into account contextual information and data from complementary genetic analyses, the most likely hypothesis isthat the deceased was a chimera! Nowadays it is imperative to the analysis of two traces so that the chain of custody can be preserved.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Samples of differenttraces, blood andsaliva wereanalyzed byPCRby analyzingdifferent markersin order to obtainagenetic profileof individuals studied.

For that purpose, two different biological traces were analyzed in those samples, blood samples as well as oral swab. These traces were collectedbefore andafter surgery, and also at different times after surgery in order to determine target effects.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Thus far, the challenge that chimeras pose to the simple alignment of genome-body-person has been limited both by relegating chimeras to freak show status and liberal institutions demands that individuals must be singular. Our results clearly show new information of those phenomena’s, such as transplantation results in microchimerism case studies, with the medical legal implications arising therefrom. Both crime investigations and paternity testinghave to take into account: these new data shows to establish genetic profiles and the conclusions arising from them! The DNA profiling can no longer be dissociated fromthis newemerging conceptthat hasdirect consequences onmedico-legalconsiderations.

It has been suggested that CYP2D6 gene involvement in the impact on suicidality may be due to unsuccessfully outcome of antidepressant therapy in ultrarapid metabolizers. An alternative explanation is based on CYP2D6 role in the metabolism of endogenous brain substrates which could affect psychological functioning (personality, cognitive functions and vulnerability to psycopathology). Actually, previous studies showed a high frequency of CYP2D6 duplication/multiduplication among suicide cases and attempters. The present preliminary study investigates CYP2D6 polymorphism in autopsy samples from suicide cases evaluating the enzymatic activity based on the number of active alleles. Data were compared with those previously published.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Blood or buccal swabs from suicide cases (33 out of 57) were analyzed. Whole CYP2D6 gene has been amplified by Long-PCR, and 11 relevant SNP positions were detected by minisequencing in order to identify the most common alleles showing different enzymatic activity. Samples were separated on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer and quantitative information derived from electropherograms was employed to establish the phase of gene duplication in heterozygous individuals. Phenotypes were predicted according to the number of active alleles and individuals were grouped in four enzymatic activity classes. Results were compared with published data using Fisher’s Exact test performed by RXC software. p-Values &lt; = 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our preliminary results are in agreement with previously published data showing that the number of individuals carrying more than two active CYP2D6 genes is higher compared with those died for natural causes.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite the limited number of tested individuals in our preliminary study, also due to the DNA quality in forensic samples, the higher number of ultrarapid metabolizers in suicide cases seems to confirm an association between CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism and suicide. Further studies increasing the suicidal sample are needed to verify the data and to look for an explanation.</p><p><bold><underline>MISCELLANEOUS</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-625</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluatıon Of Perıoperatıve Anestesia Related Deaths According To Records Of Forensic Medicine Institute</bold></p><p><underline>Aysegul Ertan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Huseyin Oz<sup>2</sup>, Zerrin Erkol<sup>3</sup>, Ziya Salihoglu<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Instute of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Department of Anesthesia and Reanimation</p><p><sup>3</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Medical Faculty, Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p>In this study, We aimed evaluation of perioperative anesthesia-related deaths according to records of forensic medicine institute</p><p>Reports of Council of Forensic Medicine, between 2006 and 2011 were analyzed retrospectively.

With the availability of increasing num¬bers of completely sequenced genomes, it is now possible to make DNA chips in which all the genes of an organism are repre¬sented, and to simultaneously assess the ex¬pression of all these genes. Gene expression profiling, can be used to determine the function of particular genes during a particular state. By assumption, genes that share common regulatory patterns also share the same function. Therefore, extrapolation of function based on common changes in expression remains one of the most widespread applications of DNA chip.

On the other hand, a relatively important rate of of pregnant women, 4 % to 7 %, uses anti-asthmatic drugs. Stillbirth, neonatal mortality and/or perinatal mortality are the most dramatic perinatal pregnancy outcomes for children and families. However, the effect of asthma and the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) during pregnancy on these perinatal outcomes have been inadequately evaluated. Most studies that have evaluated these associations suffer from a lack of statistical power and/or a lack or an inadequate adjustment for potential confounding variables. The objectives of this thesis were to evaluate the risk of perinatal mortality among asthmatic women compared to non-asthmatic women. This thesis also aims at evaluating whether or not asthmatic women exposed to ICS during pregnancy are more at risk of perinatal mortality than asthmatic women who are not exposed to ICS as well as estimating the risk of perinatal mortality as a function of the daily dose of ICS taken by the mother during pregnancy. From the linkage of three of Quebec’s administrative databases, From this cohort, two cohorts of pregnancies were constructed.Firstly, we observed that asthma during pregnancy may increase the risk of perinatal mortality due to an increased risk of low birth weight and premature delivery among asthmatic women,However, after adjusting for cigarette smoking, the relative risk of perinatal mortality decreased to 12 % and did not remain statistically significant. Finally, no significant increased risk of perinatal mortality among asthmatic women exposed to ICS during pregnancy (any doses) as compared to asthmatic women who were not exposed to ICS during pregnancy was observed.However, the use of more than 250 ug/day of ICS was associated with a 52 % increased risk of perinatal mortality, but the association was not significant,This increased risk may be explain by an inadequate adjustment for asthma severity and control (asthmatic women who used more than 250 ug/day of ICS may have more severe and uncontrolled asthma). The conclusions of our work which is rather reassuring can contribute to a better management of asthma during pregnancy, assist physicians in prescribing ICS during pregnancy and reassure pregnant women with asthma and pregnant women who should use ICS.</p><p><bold>PP-635</bold></p><p><bold>Flotation–separation of toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions using thiosemicarbazide derivatives as chelating agents</bold></p><p><underline>Tarek A Yousef</underline><sup>1</sup>, Shaban E Ghazy<sup>2</sup>, Gaber M Abu El Reash<sup>2</sup>, Ola A Al Gammal<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Toxic and Narcotic Drug, Forensic Medicine, Mansoura Laboratory, Medicolegal Organization, Ministry of Justice, Egypt</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Chemistry, Faculty of ScienceMansoura University</p><p>This investigation presents thiosemcarbazide derivatives as organic chelates (which are not pollutant for water media and may have biological importance) for the separation of about 100 % of Hg2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+ ions.

The procedure is free from interferences, is not affected by raising the temperature up to 65°C (which enables its application to hot wastewater treatment without the need for cooling) making the process economical. It is also successfully applied to the recovery of Hg2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+ ions spiked into different environmental water samples.

The present study investigated homicide-suicide (H-S) as a rare and specific form of suicide in the southern half of the city of Osaka with regard to the incidence, and social and forensic issues.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> H-S was defined as a case of multiple victims found together, in which one committed suicide after murdering the other(s). Cases without reliable circumstantial evidence were excluded. Forensic autopsy cases over a 16-year period (1995–2011) at our institute, covering the southern half of Osaka city and surrounding areas (a population of about 1.6 million), were retrospectively reviewed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The total number of forensic autopsy cases during this period was 2,737 (171.1/year), including homicide (n = 373, 23.3/year) and suicide (n = 205, 12.8/year). Among these cases, 18, involving 38 deaths, met the above-mentioned definition of H-S; 18 were identified as offenders, and 20 were murder victims (1 and 3 victims in 17 and 1 cases, respectively). The majority of offenders were male (n = 14, 78.0 %), and the age was 33–91 years (median, 63.5), while murder victims were mostly female (n = 13, 65.0 %), and the age ranged from 2 months to 85 years (median, 38.5); most murder victims were children (n = 9, 45.0 %) and spouses (n = 8, 40.0 %). Motives for H-S were heath problems (n = 10, 55.6 %), poverty (n = 2, 11.0 %) and jealousy (n = 1, 5.6 %), but were otherwise unknown (n = 5, 27.4 %). The most common causes of death were strangulation/smothering for murder (n = 11, 55 %), followed by drowning (n = 4) and sharp instrument injury (n = 2), and hanging for suicide (n = 10, 55.6 %), followed by sharp instrument injury (n = 3) and drowning (n = 2). Some offenders had a clinical history of depression (n = 3) and physical illness (n = 2). Most children killed by their parents (n = 6, 66.7 %) were mentally or physically handicapped. The most frequent site of H-S was their homes (n = 13, 72.2 %); most victims were found within 2 days of death (n = 16, 83.3 %) often by their family members (n = 8, 44.4 %) and acquaintances (n = 3, 16.7 %). A farewell note was found in 11 cases (66.7 %). H-S was more frequent in newly developing areas (n = 14/18, 77.8 %).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> H-S was infrequent, and most cases occurred in newly developing areas, involving intimate family members. Family health problems, including handicapped children, was the most frequent motive; adequate health care is therefore important to prevent H-S.</p><p><bold>PP-638</bold> (Omitted)</p><p><bold>PP-639</bold></p><p><bold>Diversity of airborne fungi in a forensic pathology service: a preliminary study</bold></p><p>Hugo Paiva De Carvalho<sup>1</sup>, António Portugal<sup>1</sup>, Nuno Mesquita<sup>1</sup>, João Trovão<sup>1</sup>, Beatriz Simões Da Silva<sup>2</sup>, <underline>Duarte Nuno Vieira</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CFE - Center for Functional Ecology, Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>CENCIFOR - Center for Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal and INML - National Institute of Legal Medicine, Portugal</p><p>Forensic Mycology is a recent field of Forensic Sciences and has been proved to be a very useful tool. Since fungi have such a crucial role, it became important to assess the airborne fungi inside a Forensic Pathology Service. In this study, we collected fungal air samples, in three different areas: in the refrigerated chambers room (RCR), inside the refrigerated chambers (RC) and in the autopsy room (AR). PDA and MEA media were used for fungal isolations. Fungal isolates were subject to morphological and molecular identification. In addition, we also calculated the Shannon-Wiener index along with Species Evenness, to determine species diversity. Our results showed that with PDA medium we obtained more isolates than with MEA, with a total CFU amount of 67 CFU/m3 in RCR, 62 CFU/m3 RC and 22 CFU/m3 in AR, for PDA, and 63 CFU/m3 in RCR, 57 CFU/m3 in RC and 15 CFU/m3 in AR for MEA. Penicillium was the more frequent genus, appearing in all sampled places with the two tested media. In general, species diversity and species evenness were higher in the refrigerated chambers room and inside the refrigerated chambers than in the autopsy room. The autopsy room, in spite of being a closed room, is frequently cleaned and disinfected, on a daily basis, and this can explain its low diversity. Since we have done only one sampling in the spring season, more season samplings should be done to compare these results with the ones taken in fall or winter.</p><p><bold>PP-640</bold></p><p><bold>causation and accountability of a forensic case of traumatic diabetes mellitus and review of the literature</bold></p><p><underline>Sellami Sellami Lakhdar</underline></p><p>faculty of médecine,badji Mokhtar university annaba algeria</p><p>Diabetes mellitus traumatic cannot be established beyond doubt by scientific evidence.</p><p>It rests upon assumptions which forensic requirements are:</p><p>- The absence of prior diabetic;</p><p>- The sudden onset of diabetes mellitus;</p><p>- The causative trauma is exceptionally pancreas, usually is emotional;</p><p>- Diabetes must be sustainable;</p><p>- The onset diabetes can never be regarded as attributable to intercurrent trauma.</p><p>The author proposes the presentation of a forensic case, for an adult, aged 18 years, with no known medical history, a victim of assault and battery, point of impact to the abdomen.</p><p>We were required to establish the causal link between diabetes mellitus and trauma in question.</p><p><bold>PP-641</bold></p><p><bold>Hemoperitoneum Due to Rupture of a Subserosal Vein Overlying a Uterine Leiomyoma</bold></p><p><underline>El Akri Abdelhafid</underline>, Chagnon Françoise, Naslafkih Abdelouahed, Sestier Francois</p><p>Program in Insurance medicine and medicolegal expertise,Montreal university.CANADA</p><p>Uterine leiomyoma is the most common tumor in women of reproductive age, but rarely does it lead to fatal hemoperitoneum.

Thus earthquakes, floods, landslides, and other natural hazards continue to cause thousands of deaths and hundred thousands of injuries each year in Turkey. After a mass disaster, due to the large number of corpses or casualties, identification process needs to be done by multidisciplinary organized teams. In Turkey, there are several search and rescue groups that do effective and successful operations nationally/internationally but they are lack of statutory organization among them. Besides rescue and relief efforts, identification of the dead victims is one of the most important jobs in disaster management. Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) is the internationally accepted term to describe the processes and procedures for recovering and identifying victims and human remains in multiple fatality incidents. The aim of this research is to emphasize the deficiency of DVI that symbolize Turkey and the awareness of DVI organization in such a high disaster prone country. Also the formation of DVI organization, the essential sub groups and the intergroup coordination will be mentioned based on the current status of Turkey.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> The statistical data of natural disasters and victims at last 30 years are obtained from four national and international databases included Turkish State Meteorological Service, Turkish Republic Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, The International Disaster Database and The National Disaster Archive of Turkey.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> According to the results of natural disaster reports at last 30 years, thousands of people died and millions of people affected by natural disasters. The most effective natural disaster in Turkey is considered as earthquakes effect settlements, also trigger the other natural disasters such landslides or floods and cause huge economic and social losses. In the event of any mass fatality incident, despite the cause, disaster victim identification must be undertaken. It is crucial to establish an official DVI Organization to improve the rescue/recovery and identification process of victims.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Turkey is one of the most prominent countries likely to experience the greatest increases at climate extremes in the 21. century. This situation comes out the significance of DVI organization in natural disaster management. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to the success of operations with input from representatives of all major professional groups. It is important to ensure that all forensic professionals are trained in this area as it is preferable.</p><p><bold>PP-646</bold></p><p><bold>Workplace violence, resilience and health outcomes</bold></p><p><underline>Bartolomé Llor Esteban</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kathrin Waschgler<sup>1</sup>, José Antonio Ruiz Hernández<sup>1</sup>, Aurelio Luna Maldonado<sup>1</sup>, Laura Llor Zaragoza<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>External Service of Forensic Sciences and Techniques, Murcia University, Murcia, Spain.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Developmental Psychology and Education, Murcia University, Murcia, Spain.</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The literature supports the view that nurses are more likely to experience aggression from patients to whom they provide direct care, or from visitors, relatives or friends, rather than from other members of the multidisciplinary team or intruders.</p><p>However, not all nurses present negative health outcomes as a result of violence in the workplace. This may be due to personal resilience, the ability of an individual to positively adjust to adversity.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of resilience between the perception of violence and its consequences on the psychological health of nursing staff. We hypothesized that high levels of resilience would buffer the negative consecuences on well-being after percieving high levels of violence. Nurses with low resilience levels would show an affected psychological well-being.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The research questionnaire, administered to a total sample of 1,489 nurses from 11 public hospitals of the southeastern region of Spain (Murcia), included the General Health Questionnaire - GHQ-28, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Hospital Aggressive Behaviour Scale- HABS-U. Based on data from 922 nurses, descriptive analysis was performed. Then we examined the modulating effect of resilience through hierarchical regression analyses.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found that nurses with low levels of resilience manifest lower levels of psychological well-being when they perceive more violent behaviours at work.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results indicate that nursing staff increased exposure to violence means lower levels of psychological well-being. But resilient subjects have lower levels of those consequences. We conclude that resilience is a potential moderator variable between the perception of violence and negative health outcomes in nursing staff. Therefore resilience-building programmes should be incorporated into nursing education in order to counteract the negative consequences on the personnell's health and to increase good performance.</p><p><bold>PP-647</bold></p><p><bold>Biological Traces in Gun Barrels – From Model to Reality</bold></p><p>Cornelius Courts, Christian Schyma, <underline>Burkhard Madea</underline></p><p>Institute of Legal Medicine, The University of Bonn, Stiftsplatz 12, 53111 Bonn, Germany</p><p>Traces of backspatter in gun barrels after homicidal or suicidal contact shots may be a valuable source of forensic evidence. Yet, a systematic investigation of the persistence and durability of victim DNA from biological traces in gun barrels was lacking.

In other mammals with UOX, UA is further oxidized to allantoin (Alla) as the final product of purine metabolism. Based on these facts, we report a reliable method for identification of human urinary stains by the UA/urea nitrogen (UN) quotient, which is used as an indicator of the concentration of urinary components. From the results obtained, we have found that some New World monkeys excrete urine containing high levels of UA. Above all, urine from tufted capchin monkeys contained high levels of UA compared to those from humans and apes. In this paper, Alla and UA concentrations in plasma samples from humans, non-human primates, rats and guinea pigs were determined, and the Alla/UA quotients were compared among the mammals. The Alla/UA quotients for 16 humans and 6 apes were less than 0.1 and under 0.14, respectively. The Alla/UA quotients for 27 Old World monkeys were 0.7-2.0 while those of 5 prosimians, 5 rats and 5 guinea pigs were 1.2-3.0. For the New World monkeys, 5 common squirrel monkeys, 13 night monkeys, 9 cotton-headed tamarins and 8 common marmosets, the Alla/UA quotients were 0.9-1.8, 0.15-1.7, 0.2-1.3 and 0.2-1.0, respectively; some subjects in the latter three groups showed values similar to those in humans and apes. Alla/UA quotients from 11 tufted capuchin monkeys were 0.05-0.15, which was nearly the same as the quotient values of humans and apes. These results suggest that unlike humans and apes, tufted capuchin monkeys and some night monkeys, cotton-headed tamarins and common marmosets lack UOX activity in the liver.</p><p><bold>PP-649</bold></p><p><bold>Identification of human urinary stains by the quotient of uric acid/creatinine and hplc chromatogram</bold></p><p><underline>Masaya Fujishiro</underline>, Susumu Nittono, Masahiro Kito, Takeyuki Ohtawa, Xiao-Pen Lee, Keizo Sato</p><p>Department of Legal Medicine, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan</p><p>Human and great apes do not possess urate oxidase (uricase); hence, uric acid (UA) is the main end product of purine metabolism in these species. Based on the facts described above, a single determination of UA has been widely used for identification of human urinary stains. However, Dalmatians excrete a lot of UA because reuptake of UA in urinary tubuli is disturbed in the dogs. Fecal stains of birds usually contain a large amount of UA since it is the final product of protein metabolism of them. Therefore, the single determination of UA is not reliable for identification of human urinary stains. To establish a more reliable method, creatinine (Cre) was chosen as an indicator of the concentration of urinary components. Simultaneous determinations of UA and Cre in experimentally prepared stains of human and animal urine, human body fluids along with feces of birds were performed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The quotients UA /Cre in human urinary stains were 0.61 – 2.19 (mean ± standard deviation, 1.06 ± 0.32), whereas those in other mammals including Dalmatians were under 0.44, and those in fecal stains of birds were over 15. Stains of other human body fluids tested gave extremely small peaks of UA and Cre on HPLC chromatograms, and the quotients were over 4.0. From the results obtained, it would seem to be reasonable to assume that human urinary stains give values of between 0.5 and 2.5 of the quotients UA/Cre, and that stains with such values are urinary stains of humans or great apes. The present method requires only a small amount of stains, approximately 5 by 5 mm and conventional HPLC. Since this method is simple, reliable and inexpensive, it would seem to be useful for forensic science practice.</p><p><bold>PP-650</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Foreigner Autopsies Performed in Izmir Between 2006 and 2011</bold></p><p><underline>Gülden Sözer</underline>, Esra Gürlek Olgun</p><p>Morgue department of council of forensic medicine,Izmir,Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The health and safety of international visitors is an important issue for Turkey as for the other countries.

As a consequence, there is an inherent need for a simple, robust workflow to collect and process samples for genetic database analysis.</p><p>EasiCollect is a novel, simple to use, one-piece sample collection device that has been designed to harvest buccal cells reproducibly and achieve consistent transfer to FTA® matrices. Once samples have been transferred, the chemically modified FTA matrix effects simultaneous lysis and preservation for long term storage and future testing. In addition, the FTA Card in the EasiCollect device is compatible with manual and automated punching systems to facilitate all laboratory throughput requirements.</p><p>In the current study, we demonstrate that the EasiCollect can be applied to a variety of DNA database sample processing workflows. High quality DNA can be extracted from, or processed on (Punch-In) the indicating FTA Card for conventional STR genotyping. Alternatively, EasiCollect can be integrated into a ‘Direct’ STR genotyping workflow to provide a simple system with minimal sample processing and high 1st pass full-profile success rate.</p><p><bold>PP-653</bold></p><p><bold>The evaluation of occupational accidents resulting in death</bold></p><p><underline>Metin Picakciefe</underline><sup>1</sup>, Yucel Arisoy<sup>2</sup>, Fatih Sen<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Mugla University, Mugla, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, 9 Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Council of Forensic Medicine, Izmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Abstract:</bold> In this study, the sociodemographic features, the features related to working conditions and the autopsy results of the autopsied people in the Council of Forensic Medicine, Izmir dying from ocuupational accidents have been examined. The population of the retrospective study consists of 208 autopsied people in the Council of Forensic Medicine, Izmir-Turkey. The autopsy files of 6618 autopsied people the period between 2002–2006 in the Council of Forensic Medicine were examined and 208 people (3.1 %) of the whole population were found to have died from occupational accidents. The autopsy report, autopsy record, letter of autopsy request from Public Prosecution Office, incident scene investigation –record of examination of the dead, hospital documents (if any) and whether the person had a occupational accident have been evaluated. The data was evaluated by SPSS 15.0 package program.</p><p>97.6 % of the people dying from occupational accidents were men with an average age of 38.0 ± 12.5; 27.9 % of them were below 29, 44.2 % of them were between 30 and 44, 27.9 % were 45 and over. Of the occupational accidents leading to death took place, 22.5 % occurred in winter, 24.5 % in spring, 29.8 % in summer, 23.2 % in autumn; 11.1 % on Monday, 12.5 % on Tuesday, 13.0 % on Wednesday, %19.7 on Thursday, 14.9 % on Friday, 15.9 % on Saturday, 13.0 % on Sunday; 23.8 % between 08.00-12.00, 43.2 % between 13.00-17.00 and 33.0 % between 18.00-07.00. 36.8.0 % of the occupational accidents resulting in death were due to falling down from height. 28.3 % of the people dying from occupational accidents died as a result of body trauma. 26.4 % of the people dying from occupational accidents worked at construction sites. Among the people dying from occupational accidents, 88.5 % had no alcohol substances and 90.9 % had no soporifics-drugs in their blood, 87.5 % had no toxic substances in their internal organs. As a conclusion, it is remarkable that the rate occupational accidents causing death is higher among men, in the field of construction, in summer, in the afternoon and that they often result from falling down from height.</p><p><bold>PP-654</bold></p><p><bold>Two New Quintet miniSTR Multiplexes in The Aanalysis of Formalin Fixed Tissues</bold></p><p><underline>Yan Liu</underline>, Li Li, Shumin Zhao, Zhenmin Zhao</p><p>Shanghai Key Laboratory of Forensic Medicine, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Ministry of Justice,</p><p>Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue blocks or stained sections are important personal archival materials saved by pathology department of hospital or institution of forensic medicine, they were frequently submitted as a kind of vital evidence material to DNA detecting for the purpose of individual identification. It is accepted that available DNA extracting from these kinds of specimen very difficult because of the DNA degradation and low copy. MiniSTR typing has been proved a useful tool for degraded DNA sample due to the smaller amplicons. However, such shorter amplicons in similar length from different loci will easily overlap on electrophoresis and only be distinguished from one another by keeping one locus in each dye lane. This is particularly unfavorable for degraded DNA from a limited forensic specimen because more systems of amplification have to be required in order to get more information about MiniSTR loci. This research constructed two new quintet miniSTR multiplex in which 9 miniSTR loci and a amelogenin gene were included and assessed their availability in degraded DNA analysis with humen tissues immersed in unbuffered formalin by different fixed duration.</p><p>The candidate primers of MiniSTRs from references and the primers of amelogenion designed with premier3 were crosschecked against one another by software FastPCR6.0 for compatibility. Compatible 9 MiniSTR markers less than 150 bp integrated Amelogenin maker (91 and 97 bp) were finally selected to assemble two quintet multiplexes: D12ATA63, D2S1776, D1GATA113, D4S2408, D17S974 and D20S482, D3S3053, amelogenin, D6S474, D9S1122. The overlapped loci were distinguished from each other by labeling four fluorescence dyes (FAM, HEX, TAMERA and ROX) on forward primers, respectively. The PCR parameters were subsequently optimized with 59°C annealing temperature, 30 cycles and primer concentrations with a range of 0.1-0.6uM, which made a balance peak heights within and between the loci. The electrophoresis was fulfilled under POP4 on 3100-Avant and the typing data was validated by standard DNA 9947A and 007.</p><p>Various human tissue samples of 3 cm3 from autopsy were immersed in unbuffered formalin under room temperature and sampled timing. The DNA was extracted by DNeasy tissue kit (QIAGN). the last elution volume of 100 μL DNA solution was quantified and qualified by Real-Time PCR. Concentration 1–2 ng/μL of DNA was amplified and genotyped by two new quintet miniSTR multiplex.

In Study 1, the aim was to assess the reliability and validity of the Attitudes towards Crime Questionnaire (ATCQ) which was originally developed by the authors. A sample of undergraduate students (N = 355, Mage = 21.5, SD = 1.98) participated in the study. Validity of the scale was tested with factor analysis and rotated component matrix indicated 4 factors. The resulting four subscales were; 1) Nature/structural Subscale, assessing beliefs in stable nature of criminality, 2)Nurture/environmental Subscale, assessing external attributions of criminality, 3) Trust in Justice Subscale, assessing trust in criminal justice system, 4) Cooperation Subscale, assessing willingness to cooperate with the police. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for each subscale indicated high reliability (.71,62,64,80, respectively). Results showed that ATCQ is a valid and reliable research tool to be used in future studies. In Study 2, the aim was to explore the correlates of attitudes towards crime, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of the public opinion about criminality. A sample of 423 undergraduate students (Mage = 21.6, SD = 2.04) were used. Nearly half of the sample group was from universities in Istanbul (45 %). Data on attitudes towards crime were gathered with ATCQ. Results revealed that mean Nature/structural scores were found to vary as a function of living/studying in Istanbul, t(420) = −3.700, p &lt; .001, presence of a relative who has committed crime, t(413) = −2.579, p &lt; .05, presence of an acquaintance who has committed crime, t(413) = −3.890,p &lt; .05, suspiciousness, t(409) = −2,192,p &lt; .05, own criminal victimization, t(412) = −3.161,p &lt; .01, having one’s own room (as indicator of socio-economical status), t(418) = 3.065,p &lt; .01. Mean Nurture/environmental scores was found to vary significantly as a function of presence of a close family member who has committed a crime, t(413) = −2.747, p &lt; .01, and presence of a family member who work for the law enforcement, t(413) = −2.060, p &lt; .05. Mean Cooperation with the law enforcement scores was found to vary significantly as a function of presence of a close family member who has committed a crime, t(413) = −2.738, p &lt; .01. Findings were discussed in line with the literature on attitudes towards crime and punishment. Public attitudes about crime and criminogenic factors were thought to affect the policies that governments endorse for crime control and crime prevention. The alternative treatments like probation or parole, which are topics of current debate in Turkey were known to require public support. Therefore, public’s opinion on crime and criminality has to be known by the governments in establishing alternative treatments for the criminal.</p><p><bold>PP-656</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of The Publications of Turkish Forensic Medical Specialists Covered By Sci Between 2005–2009</bold></p><p>Yasemin Balcı<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Kenan Karbeyaz</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department Of Forensic Science, Mugla University, Faculty Of Medicine, Mugla, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>1Council Of Forensic Medicine, Eskisehir Branch Manager, Eskisehir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Besides producing information and working for the development of science, sharing and presenting the information obtained is also necessary.

Several causes become evident when analyzing the factors involved in musculoskeletal pathology, although it is necessary to understand the relative contribution of these factors in the causal chain in order to establish effective prevention policies.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Cross-sectional study which aims to determine the influence of psychosocial factors in the development of neck and shoulder MSDs. The study was carried out on a total of 707 health workers in La Rioja (Northern Spain), who were given three questionnaires: an initial questionnaire, drawn up and validated in this study, which contained individual and sociodemographic details and information on working conditions, a second questionnaire based on the ERI (Effort-Reward-Imbalance) model, and finally a Standardized Nordic Questionnaire.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> The estimated prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck and shoulder was 73.55 %, predominantly in the neck.

In question form first part is demographic characteristics and second part contains 50 questions designed to evaluate the knowledge about personal safety and crime scene investigation, collection and preservation of evidence. A question form is employed a five-point Likert scale with multiple choices was developed according to various resources. The score of the question form was identified with giving one score for each right answer. Each of the members’ score were calculated accordingly. 50 multiple choices questions were divided into two groups as questions about security (16 questions) and evidences (34 questions) and the score of these groups calculated additionally. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. Values of p &lt; = 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The questionnaire was administered to the 236 first responders, who work in “112 Emergency Ambulance Service” and private ambulance in Istanbul. The answers of the questions encoded into SPSS statistic program and analyzed. %62.4 are female and %37.6 are male. The mean age is 25.84 ranging from 19 to 40 years old. %63.9 of participants didn’t take in-service education for crime scene and %53.4 didn’t have crime scene course in their education. Their mean score was 28.78 over 50. The highest mean score was seen in the group of post-graduates and doctors. The mean score of the questions about security was 4.16 over 16. The mean score of the questions about evidences was 24.5 over 34.</p><p><bold>Discussion and conclusion:</bold> First responders knowledge on personal safety, crime scene investigation, collection and preservation of evidence were not at the preferred level. Data obtained from the question form about personal safety, collection and preservation of evidence reinforces the educational gap of first responders on crime scene course. The theory to “not touch anything” at the crime scene, is not an option for first responders. As the attempt to save life is the first responders highest priority and requires physical intervention, the alternative to “not touching” is teaching first responders to recognize perishable forensic evidence, and basic preservation techniques, and define a medico-legal protocol to save the evidence until it can be recovered at the hospital.</p><p><bold>PP-659</bold></p><p><bold>The relationship between sociodemographic characteristics, working life characteristics and work-related accidents of nurses in Mugla State Hospital, Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Metin Picakciefe</underline><sup>1</sup>, Elif Sungu<sup>2</sup>, Azime Erdemir<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Mugla University, Mugla, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>School of Health Sciences, University of Mugla, Turkey</p><p><bold>Abstract:</bold> According to Social Security Institution statistics in Turkey, 72 963 work-related accidents had happened and 866 of those resulted in death. In this study, the relationship between the characteristics of sociodemographic and working life and the possibility of experiencing a work-related accidents that nurses, who have been working at Mugla State Hospital, face with has been investigated. A cross sectional analysis has been conducted in which 225 nurses were selected. Of the 225, 200 nurses participated, yielding a response rate of 88.8 %. In the study, a questionnaire, which had been developed by the researchers and had sociodemographic and work life related variables, had been used. Fisher’s Exact Test and Pearson Chi-Square Test were conducted using the program SPSS 15.0. 48.6 % of the nurses are between the range of 31–39 years old and 71.5 % have never got any education about work-related accidents after the graduation. Moreover, 78.0 % of those nurses had seen sharp tools, 26.0 % of them blood and body fluid, 19.0 % had experienced a fall off at the workplace and 18.0 % had faced with a violence. At a sharp tool accident, 53.3 % of nurses had mentioned that there were no protection used and 88.5 % of them had said that they had not reported the accidents. A dispersed treatment room (p = 0.003), not using gloves (p = 0.000) and insomnia (p = 0.009) result in facing with a sharp tool; slippery flor (p = 0.000), not enough lighting (p = 0.000) and not being experienced (p = 0.000) resultin fall offs and increase the risk of experiencing incidences on-the-job statistically significantly. The most important results of experiencing a work-related accidents that nurses had faced with are not being educated on the subject.

The meninx were observed to be extensively greenish in color and the CSF sample purulent. The lungs were extracted. The right lung and the left weighed 790 g and 705 g respectively. It was found that the left and right lungs were stuck to the ribs to the degree that they could be detached by hand, that their surface was tight and wet, that they were anthracotic in appearance and that greenish, foamy liquid emerged when they were squeezed. No macroscopic pathology was observed in the other organs.

A cross sectional analysis has been conducted in which 130 primary health care workers were selected. Of this selected group, 119 (91.5 %) participated in the study. In this study, a questionnaire, which contains the variables of the characteristics of sociodemographic and work conditions and the selected variables from Leymann’s “Mobbing” Typology, has been used. Fisher’s Exact Test and Pearson Chi-Square Test were conducted using the program SPSS 15.0, p &lt;0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. 83.2 % of health workers are women, 42.9 % are midwives, 27.7 % are nurses, 14.3 % are doctors, 5.9 % are civil servants, 5.0 % are health officers, 3.4 % are laboratory officers and 0.8 % are dentists. 31.1 % of health workers have faced with “Mobbing” within a year and the frequency of experiencing “Mobbing” of those 48.6 % of them is 1 to 3 times per year. 70.3 % of those who apply “Mobbing” are senior health workers and 56.8 % are men. After “Mobbing” has been reported, in majority (66.6 %), the institution has not taken any precautions. There has not been found any significant relationship among the groups in terms of age, gender, marital status, education status, institution that they work for, occupation, average monthly income and total and daily working hours.

Thus; in our country and in many places at world, ready to eat (RTE) food producing manufactures are opened which serve for cheap and easy reaching foods for many self-employed or official institutions. In our country; RTE foods were controlled according to Turkish Food Code (TFC) Microbiological Criteria Declaration. The aim of this study was to determine the microbiological quality of some RTE foods which are comsumped in Istanbul, and to evaluate these foods in aspects of forensic sciences and public health of their risks.</p><p><bold>Materials-methods:</bold> The samples were collected from May 2009 to May 2010 in Istanbul, Turkey. 750 samples transferred from 14 different RTE manufactures to Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency; coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp. ve Listeria monocytogenes are examined according to the existence of microorganisms.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the analysis of 750 samples 2.4 % E.coli, 4.8 % coliform bacteria at 709 searched samples and 6.4 % S. aureus within 718 searched samples are detected.

The descriptive characteristics of children and adolescents which attended to this research were defined. For each scenario, the rates of “expected responses” were determined for each question. The relationship between the obtained values and the ages of students were compared with "Chi-square test”. The test of “Student’s-t”, “Mann Whitney-U test”, “Bonferroni test” and “Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance” were used for the other statistical analyses.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> It has been found that from 1.8 % to 36.9 % of the students do not have the ability to identify `the right or the wrong`, or to perceive the legal meaning of act; from 2.9 % to 67.1 % of the students do not have the ability to perceive the legal consequences of act. It was foreseen that these percentages have increased when the dimension concerned with ability of managing behavior have been extended. Moreover, the differences in the students` responses to criteria on the perception of the legal meaning and consequences of act are not significant between 10 and 18 years old children. The socio-cultural and socio-economic factors do not seem to affect the perception of the legal meaning and consequences of act.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> As a conclusion of this study, it is recommended that the ability of perception and of managing behavior of the legal meaning and consequences of act for attributed crimes in every child under 18 years old should be evaluated in the special units including child psychiatrist, sociologist, forensic scientist, pedagogue, psychologist, social worker, together judge had pedagogical formation of special child courts.</p><p><bold>PP-665</bold></p><p><bold>A Retrospective Review of the Fatal Occupational Accidents Encountered in Construction Sector and Autopsied Between 2004 and 2010 by the Morgue Department of Council of Forensic Medicine</bold></p><p>Onur Eyisoy<sup>1</sup>, Sermet Koç<sup>2</sup>, Bülent Şam<sup>2</sup>, <underline>Harun Akkaya</underline><sup>3</sup>, Ahmet Musmul<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Branch Office, Gaziantep, Turkey.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Morgue Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 2nd Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>4</sup>Eskişehir Osmangazi University Biostatistics Department, Eskişehir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Fatal occupational accidents are encountered in every sector that constitutes even minimal risks, construction sector accommodates the highest rate of occupational deaths, due to the significant number of risks caused by construction works. This study intends to evaluate fatal occupational accidents, in terms of risky situations, that have occurred during construction works, and underpin the forensic procedures to follow in such cases, while contributing to other studies conducted on occupational safety.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> The study analyzes fatal occupational accidents, autopsied between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 by the Morgue Department of Council of Forensic Medicine, and which were identified to have taken place in the construction sector, as indicated in postmortem examination protocols. With regards to analysis, it has taken into consideration several factors such as demographic characteristics, accident manners and causes of death, as well as toxicological examinations, and compiled some statistical data.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 1045 (3,71 %) forensic cases out of 28116 analyzed stand for fatal occupational accidents. 447 (42,8 %) of 1045 fatal occupational accidents resulted in death in constructions. 446 of the cases are male, and the average age is 34,9 ± 11,7 varying between 13 the youngest, and 74 the oldest. It is concluded that accidents happened mostly on Mondays (17 %), while the rate of fatal accidents increased in summer (32 %). Falling down from height has been determined to be the accident manner involving the highest risk (60 %). General body trauma tops the list of cause of deaths (72 %), 215 are recorded to be immediate deaths. 10 cases demonstrated various levels of alcohol in blood, and 1 isolated amphetamine in blood and urine. The blood alcohol level of 5 of the cases, diagnosed to contain alcohol in blood, is over 100 mg/dl.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Construction works in Istanbul have gained a steady momentum in the last few decades. In parallel to this, increased number of fatal occupational accidents in construction sector is becoming an expected phenomenon. For realization of swift measures in this field; safety at work and risk assessment implementations should be well-structured, employers and employees should be efficiently provided with raised awareness and punishments of those, who exhibit a negligent attitude, should be deterring.</p><p><bold>PP-666</bold></p><p><bold>Heteropaternal Superfecundation: A case report in Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Ozlem Bulbul</underline>, Fulya Eylem Yediay, Gonul Filoglu, Havva Altuncul</p><p>Institute of Forensic Science, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse.

According to the Turkish Penal Code (TPC), the first paragraph of Article 32, security measures were performed after the decision of lack of criminal responsibility to the person who can not recognize the legal meaning and consequences of his/her act because of mental illness and have decreased ability to direct the behavior of this act. According to the second paragraph of Article 32 of TPC, the reduction in punishment is performed in the cases that eliminate the freedom of consciousness and action significantly rather than completely due to mental illness or weakness (1,2).

Deaths occurred by home accidents; poisonings, blunt traumas, burns, asphyxia were investigated in four main groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> When analyzing the causes of deaths of cases that take place in research group, poisonings were seen to be primary reason of death depended on home accidents. At the study, carbon monoxide poisonings were found as the most frequent home accident reason; fire burns and blunt traumas by falling from high were seen to follow it. When deaths occurred by home accidents are being assessed from gender distribution; male deaths are significantly more than female deaths at home accidents. The most frequent age group depended on home accidents that take place in our study group were seen to occur in 0–3 ages. Majority of cases is determined to die at home scene of accidents (%61.4). At the study it is determined that home accidents and deaths depended on it happen on winter months take the first place, and deaths intensify especially on January and December, and on summer the death rate decreased to the least level. The increase of accident frequency at the periods that were spent awake and active at home draws attention. While it is determined that men carry more accident risk at window side, balcony, bedroom, corridor-stairs, garden-terrace-roof of home; women have more accident risk at the kitchen and bathroom.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> At the study that is presented, within the scope of defined risk factors and precautions, in order to overcome the deaths depended on home accidents we reach that, to support projects towards safe home and safe house ware, and the medicines used at home, chemicals and kitchen tools, and accelerate the legal regulations related to it, to increase efforts towards training of nurses, old, children and parents, to provide inspection of home by home safety supervisors are all required.</p><p><bold>PP-671</bold></p><p><bold>Stain Detection by Using Single Buffer in Sexual Assault Cases Stain</bold></p><p><underline>Agah Serkan Hüner</underline>, Hakan Uygun, Bestami Çolak, Ömer Müslümanoğlu</p><p>Adli Tıp Kurumu Başkanlığı, Biyoloji İhtisas Dairesi, İstanbul</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Especially for stains having more than biological source, by using single buffer;- to run all steps in trace samples (serological, microscobical, differential lysis, DNA analysis)- to prevent sample loss-to reduce contamination risk-to prevent false positivity evaluations-to run DNA of sample previous examination of which was carried out and stain origin of which is determined.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Dilution of stain containing blood, saliva and semen in single tube by RSID Universal Buffer, from this diluted mixture; 1-Previous examination; Amylose-RSID Amylase Card Test, Blood-Seratec Hemdirect Card Test,Semen-Seratec PSA-RSID Semenogelin Card Test, Microssobical Sperm Examination.2-DNA Analysis: After previous examanitaion, by using the same diluted mixture, M48 isolation after cellular differantiation by differential lysis method with the same buffer + Realtime PCR (quantitaion) + PCR Amplification (Identifiler) + 3130 XL Electrophoresis</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Card tests (RSID Amylase, Seratec Blood, Seratec PSA and RSID Semenogelin), which were used in previous examination of stain sample containing blood, semen and saliva with single buffer in single tube gave positive result, so did microscobical sperm evaluation.

What proves this is the statistics of the state Police Department. In the year 2003 the number suicides was 170. The next year (2004) the number was increased by 173 suicides which raises the number. In 2005 the number increased a lot. The number of suicides went to 214 which is a lot of suicides for only a year. The files about the suicides are a lot and really detailed about the problems that made these people commit suicide. In 2006 the number of suicides was 210 victims. According to the State police the age of the people who committed suicide in all these years is various. In my presentation these files (the circumstances of these suicides) will be separated and divided in age, sex, estate, the place where these people live(village or city) and the metal problems that these people had. In 2007 the statistics showed that there were 216 suicide cases. And finally in 2008 the number was highly increased by 300 cases of suicide. As we can see the number of suicide cases has been extended every year more. According to the “ Top 20 causes of death in Albania” suicide is listed as the 18nth cause of death leaving behind other causes as asthma or liver cancer. But it is obvious that it is very important to take this cause of death seriously. The State Police says that there have been tentative’s of preventing these suicides but very few were stopped. The media also is a big helper of what I am trying to do. To convince people that suicide is not the way of making things better. There are people that can help and a shoulder you can lean on. In this project I will also include the suicidal behaviors that people do so that everyone can help them get through this phase of life. There are signs such as stress, depression, drug or alcoholic dependence, personality disorders and schizophrenia.</p><p>Key words: Suicide, Presentation, Statistic, Depression, Suicidal behaviors.</p><p><bold>PP-676</bold></p><p><bold>Genetic parameters at five new European Standard Set STR loci (D10S1248, D22S1045, D2S441, D1S1656, D12S391) in population of eastern Croatia</bold></p><p><underline>Goran Curic</underline><sup>1</sup>, Vedran Gasic<sup>2</sup>, Vera Pluzaric<sup>3</sup>, Danijela Smiljcic<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>DNA Laboratory, School of Medicine, J.

Five new loci (D10S1248, D22S1045, D2S441, D1S1656, and D12S391) were added, aiming to facilitate comparison of DNA profiles between databases of different European countries. For estimating DNA profile rarity it is essential to know allele frequency data in the population. Population study on these new European Standard Set of STR loci (ESS loci) has been performed for several countries (including Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Maghreb, Poland and USA). Because of an urgent need for estimates of allele frequencies needed in everyday work on kinship analysis and identifying skeletal remains, we carried out population study in sample of eastern Croatia. We compare results with other populations’ data and also compare genetic profiles obtained with different forensic kit amplifying the same genetic markers.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Blood samples of 217 unrelated individuals from population eastern Croatia were genotyped using AmpFlSTR® NGM kit. Allele distribution and other genetic parameters for fifteen short tandem repeat (STR) loci, including five loci recently added to European Standard Set (ESS) of STR loci (D10S1248, D22S1045, D2S441, D1S1656, and D12S391) were determined. Duplicate analysis was performed in 96 samples, using AmpFlSTR® Identifiler kit.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The allele frequencies and population statistic parameters for the 15 STR loci in population of eastern Croatia were established. Power of discrimination was the highest for the two new ESS loci, D1S1656 (0.97254) and D12S391 (0.97339). Comparison of allele frequencies of five new ESS loci in our sample with previously published population data showed significant difference on D2S441 in Maghreb population and on D1S1656 in American Caucasian population. Comparison of allele frequencies of standard ten STR loci with all neighboring countries’ published population data showed significant difference only with Albanian population (on three loci: D2S1338, D18S51, and TH01). Discordant genotypes were observed in 5 (5.2 %) samples at single locus when amplified both with AmpFlSTR® NGM kit and AmpFlSTR® Identifiler kit.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> New ESS STR loci are highly polymorphic and short, and therefore very useful for challenging forensic samples.

Small pieces of each stain were collected after 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 and 90 days, in both summer and winter assays. Clay soil was chemically characterized and graphical registers, of temperature and rainfall of the 31 days that precede each the collection, were obtained from the closest meteorological station.</p><p>Positive controls (blood stains of each individual) were made in all type of fabrics.</p><p>DNA extraction was performed using Chelex 100 method, QIAamp®DNA Investigator kit and DNA IQ™System kit.

Complete genetic profiles were obtained with AmpFℓSTR®MiniFiler™ for samples buried for 7 days during winter and for 90 days during summer, which reflects the higher degradation during winter due to the increased moisture content of the soil.</p><p><bold>PP-679</bold></p><p><bold>Comparison of two different statistical approached for eye color prediction</bold></p><p><underline>Ozlem Bulbul</underline><sup>1</sup>, Theresa Gross<sup>3</sup>, Yari Ruiz<sup>2</sup>, Chris Phillips<sup>2</sup>, Ana Freire Aradas<sup>2</sup>, Havva Altuncul<sup>1</sup>, Gonul Filoglu<sup>1</sup>, Angel Carracedo<sup>2</sup>, Peter Schneider<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Forensic Sciences, Istanbul University, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain</p><p><sup>3</sup>Institute of Legal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne, Germany</p><p>The prediction of externally visible characteristics (EVCs) is a growing field in forensic genetics and is potentially very useful to the investigation where suspects are not found. In particular eye color is an investigative tool that gives reliable results for prediction of blue and dark brown eye color with over 90 % predictive precision(Walsh et al., 2011). The use of the IrisPlex system to predict eye color is one such tool. This system uses six single nucleotide polymorphisms located in six different genes. We tested two different statistical approaches for eye color prediction. First we used the six IrisPlex SNPs with the USC "Snipper" web portal (<ext-link xlink:href="http://mathgene.usc.es/snipper/" ext-link-type="uri">http://mathgene.usc.es/snipper/</ext-link>) to determine eye colour likelihoods using subjects with blue, intermediate and brown eye color as references in Turkish and German samples. Furthermore, the predicted eye color was calculated based on sample genotypes using the “Interactive macro for IrisPlex eye color prediction modeling” by Walsh et al. The IrisPlex prediction results are reliable for blue and brown eye but not green eye color. The Snipper web portal was found to predict intermediate eye color with higher likelihoods compared to the original analytical approach. Nevertheless, intermediate eye color shows detectable differences in predictive performance between the two approaches. Further research is required to increase the likelihoods of green eye color prediction by including additional informative SNPs.</p><p><bold>PP-680</bold></p><p><bold>Optimisation of the 8 Mitochondrial SNPs Using Minisequencing Technique</bold></p><p><underline>Ozlem Bulbul</underline>, Arzu Duvenci, Ilksen Tavacı, Yasemin Demirbaş, Omer Karatas, Fulya Eylem Yediay, Gonul Filoglu, Havva Altuncul</p><p>Institute of Forensic Sciences, Istanbul University, Turkey</p><p><bold>Backround:</bold> The use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) typing in degraded and insufficient samples is rapidly increasing in forensic science.

Father-daughter and brother-sister incest cases occur more frequently than other types and they especially receive more attention in communities.</p><p>Paternity tests have routinely utilized in forensic genetic laboratories but abnormal allelic inheritance patterns have been encountered in some rare events. Aberrant STR profiles can be resulted from both technical and biological processes including allele drop-out due to primer binding mutations, mutations due to DNA polymerase slippage errors, somatic tissue mutations, aneuploidies (trisomy, monosomy etc.), deletions, duplications, copy number variations and gene conversions.</p><p>In this study, we are reporting paternity test results of a brother-sister incest case. Mother and father had the same 16, 17, 18 tri-allelic pattern of D3S1358 locus. The baby had homozygote pattern of the parent’s 17, 18 alleles. So, final tetra allelic pattern of D3S1358 locus for baby was 17,17,18,18.</p><p>To our knowledge, this case is the first presentation of a baby that has tetra allelic pattern resulted from brother-sister incest relationship and both parent’s have the same tri allelic pattern.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of mother, father and baby. Both AmpFI STR Identifiler kit (Applied Biosystems) and Investigator ESSplex kit (Qiagen) was used to amplify microsatellite markers including D3S1358 locus.

All alleles had equal intensity suggesting that genetic abnormality was a result of duplication event (Type 2). The baby had only 17, 18 alleles on D3S1358 locus and these alleles interestingly had similar intensity of other homozygote STR loci of baby. So, this pattern assumed that baby had tetra allelic 17,17,18,18 pattern of D3S1358 locus.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Genetic aberrations can be problematic when scientists interpret forensic genetic STR data. Forensic geneticists have to be aware of these rare abnormalities. To our knowledge, our case is the first presentation of a baby that has tetra allelic pattern resulted from brother-sister incest relationship and both parent’s have the same tri allelic pattern.

Locus-out, drop-out, heterozygous imbalance can be observed limiting analysis of DNA profiles. In order to eliminate such limitations while interpreting DNA profiles, thresholds (stochastic, analytical) and heterozygous ratios have to be determined for every single laboratory.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In our study, the DNA profiles of the 115 crime scene samples were evaluated. We determined the threshold for the amount of DNA in which drop-outs and/or locus-outs occurred. Stochastic threshold and heterozygous balance of our study were determined. In order to evaluate the relationship of different mixtures ratios and DNA quantity, three different mixtures of 4 reference DNAs were prepared in the ratios of 70 %: 10 %: 10 %: 10 % (K1); 52 %: 16 %: 16 %: 16 % (K2) and 25 %: 25 %: 25 %: 25 % (K3), respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The stochastic threshold value was determined as 127 RFU. Locus-out was observed in 23.9 % (n = 440), and drop-out in 4.4 % (n = 100) of examined 1840 loci. Drop-out ratios interestingly increased when 0.35 ng or less amounts of template DNA used. Drop-outs were especially occurred more in TPOX, CSF1PO, and D8S1179 loci, whereas less in the Amelogen (1.4 %), D16S539 (2.6 %), D5S818 (2.6 %), and THO1 (3.5 %) loci. Heterozygous balance was calculated as 81 % based on peak height ratio, and as 82 % based on peak area ratio. Heterozygote balance was observed to be influenced more below the concentrations of 0.31 ng of DNA. The peak height ratios and peak area ratios were observed to be increased more in the mixture of K2. In K1 mix, 0,5 ng and 0,1 ng samples had remarkably high rates of drop-outs as compared to the other mixtures. Drop-out rates were highest in the 0.1 ng K1 mixture. In this group, FGA locus had the highest drop-out rates of 83 %. VWA and TPOX had the lowest drop-out rates of 25 %. FGA locus in the 0.1 ng K1 mixture had the highest drop-out ratio than the other 0.1 ng mixtures. In addition, there were no drop-outs observed in the CSF1PO, TPOX, D3S1358, Amelogenin loci of the 0.1 ng K2 mixture and TPOX, CSF1PO, AMELOGENIN loci of the 0.1 ng K3 mixture.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Forensic genetic laboratories should establish their own stochastic threshold and heterozygous balance threshold, especially when analyzing LCN DNA and the evaluation of the profiles of mixed samples in order to prevent misleading interpretations.</p><p><bold>PP-687</bold></p><p><bold>Sequencing Analysis of HV1 and HV2 on the Mitochondrial DNA in Turkish Population</bold></p><p><underline>Havva Altuncul</underline>, Fulya Eylem Yediay, Omer Karatas, Akın Katoglu, Ozlem Bulbul, Gonul Filoglu</p><p>Institute of Forensic Sciences, İstanbul University</p><p>Identification and paternity testing are important issues in forensic genetics.

The existence of a struggle or a resistance between the two persons was assumed. In order to talk about struggle, the altogether evaluation of various evidence is a medico-legal necessity. To accept the existence of a struggle, not only the presence of cells containing the perpetrator’s DNA found under the fingernails of the victim but also tissues should be present. Even in this condition, the debris from under the fingernail is not sufficient, superficial injuries on the perpetrator’s body caused by the victim should be found in order to support this diagnosis.

Users often develop skin abscesses, Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and endocarditis. Right-sided endocarditis is common in intravenous drug users because of nonsterile injection into the venous system. In 75 % of cases of intravenous drug abuse endocarditis, no underlying valvular abnormalities are noted and 50 % of these infections involve the tricuspid valve. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. Although infective endocarditis is not the most frequent infection occurring in intravenous drug users, health care providers should always consider it as possible diagnosis when treating patients with a history of substance abuse.</p><p>In our case report we present the case of a 23 year old male who was admitted to the emergency department after intravenous Methylene-dioxypyrovaleron (MDPV) use.

The amplification reactions were carried out using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR reaction was repeated three times to confirm the result, as recommended by Gills et al. Electrophoretical analysis were performed using the ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer and GeneMapperID-X. v1.1 software.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> Although the two genetic profiles were obtained from the same bloodstain, they differed for six markers. For a portion of trace all six loci have provided homozygote profile while for the other they showed heterozygote profile. We established that allele drop out involved the six homozygote STRs.</p><p>Prüm Treaty facilitates the exchange of DNA profiles between the databases of the EU states. The genetic profiles stored in the databases are obtained both by individuals suspected of a crime by both biological traces found at the crime scene. It is evident that the genetic profiles inserted in the database must adhere to stringent quality checks. Here, we have reported a particular case where we have obtained from the same bloodstain two apparently different genetic profiles, probably due to allele drop-out events.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the stains are recovered at the crime scene it is not always possible to perform more than one sampling from a stain and to have the reference sample to avoid any apparent errors in the determination of the genetic profiles.</p><p><bold>PP-693</bold></p><p><bold>Inhibitory Effects of Microorganisms on Semen DNA</bold></p><p><underline>Filiz Ekim Cevik</underline>, Huseyin Cakan, Kasım Guven, Gulten Rayimoglu, Gonul Filoglu</p><p>Istanbul University Institute of Forensic Sciences,Istanbul,Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In forensic sciences, Semen is an important biological evidence for particularly sexual assault. Semen is sterilized and is contaminated as a result of infection originating from the individual him/herself out of the body, or with the microorganism in the environmental conditions they are in. In the forensic researches, one may be obliged to study with semen samples contaminated through different microorganisms taking place in scenes and tarried for a long time.</p><p>In our research, the inhibitory effect of microorganisms on DNA in the semen samples exposed to different environmental conditions by contaminating with microorganisms (bacteria/yeasts) on fabrics with semen samples on it, have been searched.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> In Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Urology Clinic, 8 different fabrics were stained through semen samples obtaining from 16 people. These stains were kept for 1,3 and 6 months at 2–4°C, 22-24°C and 37°C after contaminating the stains 3 different microorganisms ( E.coli, S.aureus and C.albicans) DNA Isolation of semen samples were performed through QIAamp®Mini kit (QIAGEN) Then, 16 STR locus associated with Y chromosome by using AmpF/STR Yfiler PCR Amplification Kit. Electrophoresis of PCR products were performed on ABI PR1SM® 310 device, by selecting DS-33 Matrix Standard, GS POP-4 and C Filter. Peaks obtained as a result of electrophoresis were analyzed on GeneScan 3.7 program.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> As a result of DNA analysis of Semen stains contaminated through different microorganisms and kept under different heat conditions, it is detected that DNA profile was detected in the majority of the samples kept in the fridge and this is followed by room temperature and incubator.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> In DNA analysis contamination and particularly contamination through microorganisms are important problems. Microorganisms do not affect the quantity of DNA much but the quality. As a result of diffractions in the DNA, full profile may not be obtained. This event occurs remarkably in the samples in trace amount. In this study, 16 STR locus have been worked on semen samples in different environmental conditions and contaminated different microorganisms and according to this various results were obtained from the samples that were kept in fridge, incubator and at room temperature. Therefore, it is revealed that even semen samples obtained from the scenes in different times and temperatures are exposed to different conditions, they may be used in forensic samples by working on them through suitable techniques and methods.</p><p><bold>PP-694</bold></p><p><bold>MtDNA control region sequence polymorphisms in a Turkish population</bold></p><p><underline>Ayşe Serin</underline>, Husniye Canan, Behnan Alper, Mete Korkut Gulmen</p><p>Cukurova University Medical Faculty Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p>The forensic application of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) typing requires large and regionally well-defined databases. To create the database for forensic identification purposes in Turkey, the whole mtDNA control region sequences were determined in a population of 100 maternally unrelated Turkish people living in or around Cukurova region in Turkey, using a fluorescent-based capillary electrophoresis sequencing method.</p><p>In whole control region, 161 polymorphic sites were noted. Nucleotide substitution rather than insertion/deletion was the prevalent pattern of variation. Sequence comparison of the control regions led to the identification of 100 mitochondrial haplotypes, in which 98 types were observed in only one individual and the other one type was shared by two individuals. Gene diversity was estimated to be 0.999.</p><p>The genetic characterization of these relevant data sets is fully consistent with other published mtDNA genetic variation. The sequence diversity observed in this data set makes it a valuable tool for forensic applications, especially when nuclear DNA is not available.</p><p><bold>PP-695</bold></p><p><bold>Mutations observed at 16 autosomal STR loci in cases of paternity/maternity testing</bold></p><p><underline>Husniye Canan</underline>, Ayse Serin, Behnan Alper, Mete Korkut Gulmen</p><p>Cukurova University Medical Faculty Department of Forensic Medicine</p><p>Knowledge about mutation rates and the mutational process of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) loci used in paternity testing and forensic analysis is crucial for the correct interpretation of resulting genetic profiles.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the mutation rates in paternity/maternity testing data were collected from 270 confirmed paternity/maternity cases for autosomal STR analysis during 2006–2011 years period. The parenthood in each of these cases was highly validated (probability &gt; 99.99 %). Paternity/maternity testing were routinely carried out using AmpFlSTR PCR amplification kit and if necessary, Y-STR was added for male offsprings. Maternal and paternal meioses were studied and the average mutation rates concerning several types of mutations were determined. We identified 10 mutations at 5 STR loci. Single-locus mutation was observed in 8 cases, and mutation at two STR loci was observed in 1 case. The observed mutational loci include VWA, D13S317, D8S1179, D16S539 and D18S51. No mutation was observed in eleven loci of sixteen researches. Of the mutations 7 were paternal source and 3 were maternal source. The highest mutation rate was observed with 3 mutations at vWA and D13S317 loci.</p><p>The observed mutational features for STRs have important consequences for forensic application such as the definition of criterions for exclusion in paternity testing and the interpretation of DNA profiles in identification analysis. In order to enrich the reference data of STRs mutations which are valuable for forensic application, we suggest the establishment of such database and ask the whole forensic community for data contribution including Turkey.</p><p><bold>PP-696</bold></p><p><bold>Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Drug related Crimes; Between 2007–2009 Data of Adana City</bold></p><p>Özge Altınkaya<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Ahmet Hilal</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Adana Pollice College</p><p><sup>2</sup>Cukurova University Departmant of Forensic Medicine</p><p>Drugs affect not only the person using them, but also the social order in which s/he or other people live.

This is systematic and based on a scientific method. However, in most cases, investigation of crime scene for once is not sufficient. The crime scene must be investigated for a second time in order for evidences to be interpreted correctly. The purpose of study is to make a contribution to solution of crimes by re-evaluating physical and biological evidences in the light of scientific data through restructuring crime scenes over two cases.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> Two cases sent to I.U. Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty Department of Forensic Medicine for detection of medico-legal findings in terms of determination of origin were evaluated.</p><p>1. A couple making acquaintance and coming closer on the same day passes the day and night together. The next day, young woman is found to have died as a result of general body trauma outside the building. He’s found suspected and arrested for murder as a result of DNA analyses of biological samples taken from various parts of body of the woman and fingerprints obtained from different surfaces in the crime scene.</p><p>2. A newly married couple arrives at a hotel to spend their honeymoon. Towards morning, young woman is found to have died as a result of general body trauma outside the building. It is asked to relevant authorities whether stain found on the bed sheet in the room in the crime scene investigation is a blood stain, and it is decided through spot and Hem-Direct preliminary tests that it’s a blood stain. Husband of the woman is arrested for committing a murder by thinking, through DNA analyses made on the bed sheet where the stain was found, that the trauma experienced by the woman was caused by oppression in the bed.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> In both cases, the fact that experts evaluating physical and biological evidences obtained from the crime scenes in the laboratories don’t see the crime scenes at all or details about the crime scenes aren’t reported to them leads these experts to make just a mechanical evaluation. The fact that no multi-disciplinary team work can be carried out in the crime scene, units working in this field have poor written and verbal communication skills and they don’t perform a collective and integrated work causes courts to make wrong decisions and, accordingly, justice to lag.</p><p><bold>PP-698</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of 100 cases of age determination admitted to Çukurova University Department of Forensic Medicine</bold></p><p><underline>Kemal Çağdaş Yıldırım</underline>, Kenan Kaya, Ebubekir Burak Çelik, Mete K Gülmen</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Çukurova University, Adana, Turkey</p><p>Estimation of age is very important part in forensic medicine practise.

For this reason a variety of techniques are used in examination of sample types of animal hairs. The simplicity, cost and time effectiveness of PLM make it a useful tool and have allowed it to become one of the most widely applied techniques in the examination of animal hairs. In this study, conducted on 30 different samples, a polarized light microscope was used to compare the surface morphology, diameter and internal structure of animal hairs.

Color and elemental analyses were conducted on 35 samples using a UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer for color analysis, and XRF and SEM-EDS apparatus for the elemental analysis. An attempt was made to differentiate between the apparatus, and to determine whether there is a correlation between the apparatus and the observations of the study. It was concluded that reliable results in recognizing and differentiating glass can only be obtained by examining several oxides, (Al2O3, Fe2O3 and SO3) together.

Both sides need support in this care relationship. When this support can not be met adequately on time, elder abuse and neglect come up. Although a significant portion of elder abuse is not reported or detected, about 4 to 10 % of elderly is estimated as suffering from abuse or neglect. Elder abuse is a problem all around the world, especially in the last decade. Although there are studies related to health problems of elderly, there are limited number of studies on neglect and abuse of the elderly due to the sentimentality of the topic. Neglect and abuse issues encountered during the elderly period of life have different evaluation methods used in the studies. These differences cause difficulties in terms of comparisons of the study results. In the literature there are scales developed for this subject.

Silica is a common, naturally-occurring crystal. It forms dust during mining, quarrying, tunneling, and working with many metal ores. Silica is a main part of sand, so glass workers and sandblasters are also exposed to silica. But it is not common to affect handicraft workers. We report a case of pulmonary silicosis in a handicraft worker without proper use of personal protective equipment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Case report and review of literature.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A 50 year old female patient came to the clinic with dry cough. She reported working with glass craft including sandblasting, a technique used for decoration of the pieces. On physical examination she had coarse breath sounds and some inspiratory wheezing in the upper chest. Laboratory tests were normal as well as pulmonary function tests. Chest radiography showed small dense nodules in the lung apices, and high resolution chest computed tomography showed the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules less than 1 cm, compatible with diffuse nodular infiltrates, fibrotic changes, distortion and coalescence more pronounced in the upper lobes of both lungs. Transbronchial lung biopsy showed histiocytic infiltration micro-nodular pulmonary fibrosis. Through these finds we established the diagnosis of pulmonary silicosis, related to handicraft activity with sandblasting.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Silicosis is the most common occupational lung disease worldwide, it occurs everywhere but is especially common in developing countries such as Brazil. Although it is common in sandblasters, we found no reports in the literature of domestic workers with silicosis. The problem is that because they do not have occupational guidance, these workers can go for years without knowing the risk they are suffering. There must be some way to warn and educate these handicraft homeworkers to avoid the risk of severe disease.</p><p><bold>PP-704</bold></p><p><bold>Bill Of Exchange Forgery With The Signature That Was Achieved By Making Gap Like A Window; A Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Ferruh Baklacıoğlu</underline>, Esat Şahin, Mehmet Cavlak, Muhammed Nabi Kantarcı, Bahadır Kumral</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p>In this case from the Document Examination Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine; we noticed the importance of detailed examination of document, the conditions that need attention by document examiner and people who draw up a document, in forensic document forgery.

The linguistic context of the assault towards transgender people and of the death resulted events has a different tone of language. In assault cases, use of adjective is minimal, revelation of the legal (masculine) name of the victim is absent, and the sex profession of the victim is not mentioned. On the contrary, in death resulted events, use of adjectives is very common, legal (masculine) names and profession of the victims are revealed, brutalization and narration of the crime is frequently used as a reader magnet.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The mass media approaches to transphobic hate crimes with images and language that are openly derisive, sensationalistic. This unfair and unbalanced news further degrade the victim. Except for a handful of high-profile cases, hate crimes against transgender people remain largely ignored badly reported by the mass media. Therefore we are thinking that it must be designed a model research to analyze if there is any correlation between transphobic hate crimes and linguistic approach of mass media.</p><p><bold>PP-707</bold></p><p><bold>The Objectivity of Forensic Experts and Structuring Forensic Sciences</bold></p><p><underline>Çimen Akgün</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ayşe Selcen Güçhan<sup>1</sup>, Abdullah Coşkun Yorulmaz<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Instıtute of Forensic Sicience, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpaşa Medical School, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> There is a period when forensic sciences’ services in Turkey were examined under spotlight from every angle. The questions such as “By whom and how these services will be provided?”, “How will 'independence' and 'objectivity' be insured?” are at the focus of intense debate. This topic and a search for new model regarding forensic science’s structure are on agenda, not only in Turkey but also worldwide. In addition, terminology confusion of "forensic medicine" and "forensic science" is an ongoing debate. This study is planned to inquire the factors affecting experts’ objectivity and their results.</p><p><bold>Material method:</bold> The participants who work in the forensic sciences field were asked to answer a survey of 56 questions. The identity information of the participants was not gathered. In the survey, participants’ opinions about topics such as “work load, corporate experience about specializing, the corporate, politic and media effects that they are feeling while performing their jobs, their evaluation of their profession on inter-countries level and non-governmental organizations they’re affiliated to and its effect to their jobs” were questioned.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> 64 % of the participants have a bachelor’s degree in medicine. 2 % is bachelors of laws and 1 % has psychology degree. 65 % of those who have completed a master's degree graduated from forensic science field. 16 % of the participants don’t have a post-graduate degree. 52,5 % of those who provide expert opinions stated that they only deliver written expert opinion, 18,6 % noted that some of their expert opinion is written. 31,4 % of those who provide oral expert opinion expressed that they served as expert in court 1–10 times, 6,8 % 10–20 times and 10,2 % more than 20 times. 44,1 % of the participants informed that new regulations in The Code of Criminal Procedure affected the expert practice of the organization they work for. 16,1 % expressed that new regulations didn’t affect expert practice and 39,8 % stated that it partially affected.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The experts have variable opinions on the effects of forensic science structuring on experts depending on the organization they work for; a difference was detected (p &lt; 0,05). It is observed that the ratio among the members of The Council of Forensic Medicine on those who think that ‘forensic science structuring has an impact on the experts and those who disagree is very close.

Despite increasing concerns about violence at work, unfortunately it may not be identified as a real and noteworthy problem until there is a critical incident with casualties. Therefore, underreporting is the norm.</p><p>The WHO stands that violence in the health care sector may constitute almost a quarter of all violence at work and that altogether it may affect more than half of health care workers. Comprehensive data on the incidence of violence in the Spanish health care sector do not exist. The patterns of violence in Spain health care system remain largely unknown and inferences still have to be drawn mainly from the international literature.</p><p>Outside our borders, a range of different strategies and procedures to reduce the incidence of violence has been implemented. The National Health Service in the UK adopted in 1999 a comprehensive zero-tolerance policy. Any comprehensive violence prevention strategy requires a range of organisational and administrative elements to help control the risks. In Spain different governmental and institutional strategies have been launched.</p><p>The Barcelona’s Official College of Physicians (COMB) participates in and contributes to different initiatives and mechanisms to reduce and eliminate the risks associated with work-place violence.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the analysis of the COMB’s activity since 2003.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The COMB, a pioneer in Spain, launched in 2003 the Observatory of Physicians Security and contracted a compulsory insurance that covers any claim related with physicians who suffer violence at workplace. In 2004, the COMB conducted a survey among its members in which one third of physicians reported having experienced a violent episode during his/her career, being more frequent verbal aggressions (44 %) than physical aggressions (28 %) and threats (26 %) and predominantly in the Emergency Department (45 %). According to these data, the COMB developed a guide to prevent and manage violence against physicians at work. Since them the COMB has been helping physicians in this area although it wasn’t until 2010, that the Violence against Physicians Unit (UIVCM) was created. Its aim was to perform comprehensive advice, both at law and in security. The UIVCM works closely with public prosecutors and police.</p><p>The reported data contributes to the understanding of patterns of violence at work against physicians in Spain.</p><p><bold>PP-709</bold></p><p><bold>DNA Evidence on the Mask</bold></p><p><underline>Bilgin Kütükcü</underline><sup>1</sup>, Neslihan Alpay Aral<sup>1</sup>, Suna Aral<sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>2</sup>, Kadir Demircan<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Department of Biology, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> DNA analysis is a powerful tool because each person's DNA is unique (with the exception of identical twins). Therefore, DNA evidence collected from a crime scene can implicate or eliminate a suspect, similar to the use of fingerprints. DNA evidence has become an increasingly powerful tool for solving crimes. New technologies are more widely used. The crime scene investigators are learning to use DNA evidence more effectively. For years, law enforcement officials have used DNA to solve violent crimes, such as homicide and sexual assault. Collecting DNA in property crimes, such as robberies dramatically increases the number of suspects identified.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> This case is about an armed robbery. Investigators found a mask, made of cotton fabric in the crime scene. The mask was sent to Council of Forensic Medicine, Group Presidency of Ankara to investigate any hair or biological residue on the mask and match it with the suspect.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We found two saliva stains and three hair strands on the mask. DNA was extracted from the stains and one of the hair strands. PCR amplification of 15 STR loci was performed by using AmpFlSTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplification Kit.

It results an incorrect gender identification. Several studies have reported mutations in the Y homologue of the amelogenin gene which can cause typing of males as females. Failure to amplify Y homologue can result unintended consequences in cases of criminal investigations.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Four cigarette butts from the crime scene, were sent to Council of Forensic Medicine, Group Presidency of Ankara to do DNA testing.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> DNA was extracted from the cigarette butts using Qiagen BioRobot EZ1 workstation with the EZ1 DNA Tissue Kit. DNA was quantified by Quantifiler® Duo DNA Quantification Kit using ABI Prism® 7500 Real-Time PCR System. PCR amplification of 15 STR loci and a gender determination were performed by using AmpFlSTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplification Kit. PCR amplification of 16 Y chromosomal STR loci was performed by using AmpFlSTR® Y-filer® PCR Amplification Kit. The amplified products were genotyped on ABI 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Male quantitation values of the butts were higher than the human quantitation values (male/female ratios were high). Normally the expected profile is male. But interestingly two different female DNA profiles were obtained from the butts. PCR was performed with another Kit (Powerplex® 16, including amelogenin locus), but Y chromosome peak was not observed. We suspected that there could be an amplification failure in that locus. Therefore we applied Y chromosome STR analysis. Consequently we obtained identical Y chromosome STR profiles from four butts.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Quantification of human and male DNA should be done in samples found in the crime scenes. In this manner we can confirm the gender of the person by the quantification methods. It provides convenience to investigators while searching the suspects.</p><p><bold>PP-711</bold></p><p><bold>Amplification failure in DNA Profile</bold></p><p><underline>Neslihan Alpay Aral</underline><sup>1</sup>, Bilgin Kütükcü<sup>1</sup>, Suna Aral<sup>1</sup>, Cem Ertuğrul<sup>1</sup>, Kadir Demircan<sup>1</sup>, Mustafa Karapirli<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Department of Biology, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> DNA testing has become the most accepted method to determine identity within the legal and forensic communities.

In a metropolis, municipal police officers have to cope with many environmental stressors on a daly basis. Violence is a job stressor. The aim of the research is the reasons, types and indications of violence directed to municipal police officers by their society and also to point out the municipal police officers views about her role as far as violence Is concerned. This study has been carried out among municipal police officers at Izmir Metropolitan Municipality. Focal group interviewing method-a qualitative research type has been used in order to attain the target of the study. The interview has been applied to a group, each consisting of eleven, married, divorced or single municipal police officers. The subject guide, covering the topics designated above, has been used and the topics have been discussed in detail throughout the interviews. These interviews have been performed by the researchers and audiotape recodings of the interviews have been obtained. One researcher was moderator, and two observers. The moderator supplied the clearity of open questions and the participation to interview. These recordings have been deciphered and interpreted. It has been found out that the views ol the municipal police officers have entirely been formed by their own life experiences. Therefore, the views of married and divorced municipal police officers were closer to reality. However, none of these groups seemed to have sufficient information in handling violence in the professional way. In conclusion, the municipal police officer who have an important mission for the health of society yet his/her own health wellbeing needs to be protected. Violence was an important and frequent risk factor of this study group.</p><p><bold>PP-714</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Forensic Cases Admitted to a Child and Adolescant Psychiatry Clinic</bold></p><p>Burak Dogangun<sup>1</sup>, Mine Elagoz<sup>1</sup>, Hatice Gozde Akkın<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Abdullah Coskun Yorulmaz</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istanbul Universitiy, Cerrappaşa Medical Faculty Department of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Istanbul University, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Forensic psychiatry practices differ from a country to the other due to their different legislation. In Turkey there is no additional special training in the application of psychiatric knowledge. This work presents epidemiological data of adolescents and children whom judges (89 %) or the department of forensic medicine of our faculty (11 %) referred to our clinic.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The cases that we detected while executing our profession were not evaluated. 98 cases between May 2006 and March 2012 were analyzed retrospectively, in terms of sex, age, psychiatric examinations, type of crime and mental capacity ratio.</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> The majority of subjects were girls (64 %). We were mostly assigned in 12 % of cases if the child is about to perceive the meaning and results of the juridical act and about to investigate the existence of a significant lack of ability to direct behaviors in course of the crime; in 69 % of cases if the victims of physical and sexual child abuse have a lasting mental health problem as a result of the case and in 10 % of cases which parent is proper for the childs guardianship. 33 % of suspected were on trial of sexual abuse, 17 % were on trial of homicide, 41 % were on trial of thievery.

According to notification taken by the public prosecuter; the highest number of forensic death cases were noticed in age group of 15–49 with 51.7 %. It was also found that 1352 (57 %) the cases were mostly caused by accidents. As postmortem examination, only 708 cases (29.8 %) were exposed to autopsy and among them only 1172 cases (49.4 %) were examined by only a single practitioner.

However, forensic biological samples can be present in low quantities, and also be exposed to different environmental insults leading to DNA degradation and its contamination by inhibitor compounds. Thus, it is desirable for the forensic expertise to have useful information about the forensic sample quantity and quality prior to STR amplification and analysis.</p><p>New methods in Forensic DNA analysis for detecting, preserving and quantifying DNA are continually being developed. Since many forensic evidence samples, mainly those resulted from sexual assault cases, are often composed by a mixture of unbalanced male/female DNA mixtures, a new Real Time PCR quantification approach has been developed in order to quantify the relative male/female DNA ratio. This methodology contributes not only for total DNA determination, but also to ascertain the presence and quantity of male DNA for autossomal and Y-STRs amplification in a single highly sensitive RT-PCR reaction.</p><p>DNA from samples related whit 30 sexual assault cases, was, extracted with PrepfilerExpress™ Extraction kit in the AutoMate ExpressDNAExtraction System. Samples were quantified in duplicate with Quantifiler® Duo DNA using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system. For concordance studies Quantifiler® Human and human male DNA quantification kits (Applied Biosystems) were used as directed. STR analysis was performed to correlate quantification results and the impact on autossomic-STR and Y-STR genotyping.</p><p>The Quantifiler® Duo detected quantities as little as 3.1 pg of total input DNA. In male/female mixtures, the comparison between male and female concentrations suggested which type of STR analysis might provide useful male genotype information. The results show that there is a correlation between total DNA/male DNA concentration ratio and the ability to detect male specific alleles in male/female DNA mixed samples.</p><p>The quantification results are important as a guide for the optimal STR analysis selection, such as autossomal STR, Y-STR or mini-STR, increasing downstream analysis success rates. In this work we present real forensic caseworks where the DNA amount and quality was an important guide for the selection of the appropriate STR amplification kit in order to increase the success of profiling in the first attempt, reducing the number of samples that need to be reprocessed and thereby decreasing the turnaround time in a forensic laboratory.</p><p><bold>PP-723</bold></p><p><bold>Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1975): the role of forensic genetics on recently exhumed soldiers identification - preliminary results</bold></p><p><underline>António Amorim</underline><sup>1</sup>, Jorge Costa Santos<sup>2</sup>, Eugénia Cunha<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Serviço de Genética e Biologia Forense, Delegação do Sul, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal e Ciências Forenses, Lisboa, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>Serviço de Clínica Forense, Delegação do Sul, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal e Ciências Forenses, Lisboa, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>Unidade de Antropologia, Serviço de Patologia Forense, Delegação do Sul, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal e Ciências Forenses, Lisboa, Portugal</p><p><sup>4</sup>Ciências Forenses e Criminais, Instituto Superior de Ciências da Saúde Egas Moniz, Almada, Portugal</p><p><sup>5</sup>Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><sup>6</sup>Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal</p><p><sup>7</sup>CENCIFOR, Centro de Ciências Forenses, Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> During the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1975), many soldiers were killed and buried anywhere in the battle field or into cemeteries, at the Portuguese ex-colonies - Angola, Guiné and Moçambique, without any identification placed at the graves.</p><p>In the last years, as it occurs in many other countries, assuming the social and humanitarian importance of having their bodies in appropriated burial place, and in order to, eventually, return them back to their families, whenever they ask for it, it was created the project ‘Recovery of Memories’ by the Portuguese government.</p><p>While some of the soldiers bodies were identified by means of forensic anthropology, for others only with genetics this task could be accomplished.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Last year we received, at Lisboa Genetic Department, of Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal e Ciências Forenses, skeletal remains from 10 soldiers, exhumed at Guiné-Bissau cemeteries.</p><p>Bones DNA extraction was promoted with enzymatic silica-based methods and automated methods.

There are many reasons for young people in starting drug use and addiction to it. In this study, both reasons and conclusions of drug use and drug addiction of young people were examined. Moreover, types and harms of drug and the ways of release from it were analyzed. This research showed us that the most important factors for use and addiction to drug are the effects of environment and friends. Moreover, it has been understood that family has a responsibility for both drug using of young people and struggle with it. The children who come from broken and troubled families are being introducing more easily with drug and they are being addicted to drug.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> The aim of this study is to investigate the socio-demographic features of adolescents who have drug addiction, reasons about beginning use and becoming drug addicted, reasons why they use drug and results of using drug.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> Study was consist of 60 adolescents who were between 12 to 18 ages and appealed to Hospital of Psychic and Neural Hospital, and the questions which were prepared by researchers were applied to group.</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> It was found that friends who use drug, affect drug use mostly.

Also many populations in the world the gene frequencies are determined. About these loci DNA databases are created and used. So these loci have become ideal genetic markers in forensic sciences study. Even if multiplex PCR kits of these loci have been used, there has been cause of DNA typing in highly degraded forensic cases and trace amounts of biological samples [3]. For the solve of these problems, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) had developed 26 new mini STR loci which is unlinked from the CODIS markers. Amplicons of these loci less than150 bp in size. Especially 6 of them (D10S1248, D14S1434, D22S1045, D4S2364, D2S441, D1S1677) amplicons are less than 125 bp in size. Blood stains are the most common biological evidence at a crime scene. Sometimes we don’t know how much time has elapsed according as the shape of the event occurrence. The event over the weeks, months or even years may go. In addition these stains can be found on the various surfaces.</p><p>Purpose of this study; usability of these new mini STR loci on trace amount, worst protected and long waited biological samples. For this purpose, sensitivity of these loci on typing was determined on blood spots which were waited several surface and different time. Also it is aimed that to study these loci in routine forensic laboratories.</p><p><bold>Material method:</bold> 200 μl blood sample of a volunteer was dropped on various surfaces (jean, t-short, upholstery fabric, towel, iron, knife hilt, laminate flooring and tile). These objects were waited for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. DNA extraction of blood samples was made with QIAamp® DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN). PCR reaction of 6 mini STR loci was made according to our optimization study- Ünsal et al. PCR products were separated electrophoretically using ABI Prism® - 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Data from the ABI 310 was analyzed using GeneScan 3.7 program (Applied Biosystems).</p><p><bold>Result:</bold> Finally, its determined that it is possible to identification with 6 miniSTR loci on blood spots which were waited for 6 months. But these times can increase to several years in further research. Also it can determine that the usability of this method on degraded other samples.</p><p><bold>PP-726</bold></p><p><bold>A Retrospectıve Study On Suicides Deaths That Occurred In Gaziantep Provınce Between Years Of 2005–2011</bold></p><p><underline>Bekir Karaarslan</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ayşe Gül Bilen<sup>2</sup>, Adnan Çelikel<sup>3</sup>, Ramazan Karanfil<sup>4</sup>, Onur Eyisoy<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Gaziantep University Medical Faculty, Gaziantep / TURKEY</p><p><sup>2</sup>The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Specialist of Forensic Medicine Adana -TURKEY</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty, Hatay / TURKEY</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Kahramanmaraş Sütcü Imam University Medical Faculty, Kahramanmaraş/ TURKEY</p><p><sup>5</sup>The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Specialist of Forensic Medicine Gaziantep -TURKEY</p><p>In this study, between 2005–2011, to commit suicide in the Gaziantep region of deaths occurring in a retrospective analysis was performed.

In this paper we report on an interesting case in which two incompatibility were obtained at loci D13S317 and HUMCSF1P0. This apparent exclusion of paternity suggested the use of other DNA markers (STR, VNTR) and traditional markers which strongly corroborated the hypothesis of paternity, indicating that the incompatibility was to be attributed to two mutational phenomena. The paternity was also supported by statistical computations, which took into account the two mutated loci and the mutation rate of the STRs employed.</p><p>We analyzed 33 different markers, consisting of 22 DNA systems (18 STRs and 4 VNTRs) and 11 standard biochemical systems. We introduced a simple mutation process with estimated parameter, as previously published, and obtained the overall weight of evidence which strongly supported the hypothesis that the putative father was the biological father, but that two independent mutations had occurred.

This study has the potential to make a significant impact on the processing of skeletal evidence for the forensic community and law enforcement agencies. Forensic analysis of DNA from bone can be important in investigating a variety of cases involving violent crimes and missing person cases. However, bone is difficult to process for isolating DNA. To remove the potential presence of co-mingled remains and eliminate contamination by animal scavenging, environment-borne inhibitors, and bacterial growths that interfere with forensic DNA analysis, the outer surface of the bone fragment must be cleaned, which is a labor-intensive and a time-consuming step. Thus, a simple and reliable processing method is highly desired. This study is to address this issue and evaluate two methods for processing bone specimens prior to DNA isolation. The mechanical and enzymatic processing techniques were compared in this study. The effects of these techniques on the yield of DNA isolated and the quality of DNA analysis were studied.</p><p><bold>PP-730</bold></p><p><bold>Investigation of 17 Y-STR loci polymorphism in Turkish population</bold></p><p><underline>Gülay Özel Cavlak</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ömer H.

All this failures and negative image on the mass media made think us that an official and ready-to-go Disaster Identification (DVI) Team must be organised urgently.

Within 2006–2007 academic years, Büyükçekmece National Education Directorate and the Children's Center of Bahçeşehir carried out the project named as “Combat against Substance Abuse”. Under this project, fifth grade and senior high school students were educated about substance use and addiction with materials created by Yeniden Health and Education Society. Purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the education program which was used to inform children about substance abuse.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> During education session pre and post tests were applied to 133 5th-grade, 227 8th graders and 68 final year students. Educations had been evaluated and analysed separately by two groups: under and above the age of twelve. The effectiveness of the educations was evaluated by comparing the total scores obtained from the pre tests and post tests. To test if there is a test effect, only post test was applied to 10 % of the participants as control group in each education session.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Increase in the total score of post test was statistically significant in both groups.Increase of total score between pre and post tests was the highest within the 12 years age and above group. Satisfaction from educator performance and training program was also higher in the 12 years age and above group.</p><p><bold>Coclusion:</bold> This results showed that the education program is effective for redounding the awareness about substance abuse of students. Increase on the awareness and the information level about substance abuse is the most beneficial issue against substance use. Lower amount of total scores and satisfaction percentages in the group of under 12 years age is striking and must be investigated for further education program plans. Increasing in the awareness and information level for both groups should be studied again and continuity of learning should be evaluated in the future for preventive forensic medicine.</p><p><bold>PP-740</bold></p><p><bold>Relationship between empathy and psychopathy</bold></p><p><underline>Cemal Onur Noyan</underline>, Seyma Sipahioglu Ortac</p><p>Department of psychiatry service, gumussuyu military hospital, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Empathy defined as “the ability to understand another’s perspective and to have a visceral or emotional reaction” plays a key role in social cognitionsThere are currently a number of methods used to assess empathy, the most common ways are self-report measurements. Baron-Cohen Empathy Quotient(EQ) is a self-report scale recently designed to have a clinical application sensitive to a lack of empathy as a feature of psychopathology. Psychopathy can be considered one of the prototypical disorders associated with empathic dysfunction. However, although many studies indicate that antisocial subjects have lower scores on the EQ test some of the studies have failed to revealing the differences between healthy controls and psychopathic subjects. The aim of this study was to show whether APD or psychopathic individuals show emphatic impairment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 30 male subjects with diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder(APD), without any comorbid neurologic conditions, and 30 sex and age matched healthy control subjects assessed by a semi-structured questionnaire form, SCID-II, Psychopathy Checklist-Revised(PCL-R) and the Turkish version of Empathy Quotient(EQ). Subjects with APD diagnosis divided into two groups as ‘psychopathic’ and ‘nonpsychopathic’ group by using PCL-R scores. 30 point was used as cut point for psychopathy diagnosis regarding previous studies</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> EQ scores(33,62 ± 10,06 ) of APD subjects were significantly lower(p = 0,000) than the control subjects scores(46,91 ± 11,59). Although the non-psychopathic group showed better performance(34,76 ± 6,17) on the EQ test than psychopathic group(29,84 ± 11,33), statistically significance could not be showed(p = 0,170). These finding suggest that individuals with APD show significant impairment on identifying of others emotion regarding empathic abilities.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first study assessing the emphatic skills of the APD subjects within Turkish samples. Studies looking at cognitive measures of empathy in violence offenders have showed inconsistent findings. Further and larger sample size studies needed to confirm relationship between violence and empathic disabilities within the APD and psychopathic subjects.</p><p><bold>PP-741</bold></p><p><bold>Interpreter Usage during Investigative Interactions</bold></p><p><underline>Robert M Tovar</underline></p><p>Chicago Police Department's Forensic Division-Retired</p><p>Interactions during investigative communications [such as intelligence and criminal investigations] can be hampered when they involve subject’s [identified as Source] who speak foreign languages. When Interpreters are used for assistance an investigator’s [identified as Collector] investigative skills and strategies may be put on hold as the Interpreter now becomes dominate during the communicative relay with a Source. The author suggests during Interpreter usage a practice identified by this author as the Interpreter Bridging Approach.</p><p>Conventional Interpreter usage during investigative interactions normally has the Interpreter facing the Source in some manner and communications is relayed via Collector through the Interpreter and vice versa from Source. The Interpreter Bridging Approach places the Collector in a position shielding the Interpreter from the Source. The Collector now becomes the communicative relay between Interpreter and Source.</p><p>During conventional practices, the Collector relies on the Interpreter’s ability not only to translate properly, but to provide a face-to-face communicative relay which can direct the investigative flow of the investigative interaction during communications. This face-to-face communicative relay consists of facial and body gestures, tone and voice inflections, as well as any other interactive exchanges.</p><p>As a result of this communicative relay, the Interpreter dominates these facial and body gestures, voice and tone inflection, verbal exchange, and now directs the investigative interactive flow with the Source. The Collector can during Interpreter assisted investigative interactions re-sort to being a note-taker or an observer during the face-to-face interaction be¬tween the Source and Interpreter.</p><p>The Collector becomes dependent on the Interpreter’s behavioral and verbal investigative ability and assessments. In addition, Due to this dependence on the Interpreter, the Collector may set aside investigative skills and strategies in identifying ongoing nonverbal or verbal cues the Source may display at the time of occurrence.</p><p>The author suggests Collectors can apply their proven investigative skills and strategies using the Interpreter Bridging Approach as compared to conventional Interpreter practices. The Interpreter Bridging Approach will improve communicative effectiveness through 1) a physical shielding by the Collector between Interpreter and Source, 2) the Interpreter becoming a physical mechanical earpiece and microphone for the Collector and 3) the Collector’s use of hand and arm gestures increasing understanding between Collector and Source.</p><p>The Interpreter Bridging Approach will provide the Collector with a more effective communicative insight, investigative flow and assessment of the Source and not necessarily through the eyes of the Interpreter.</p><p><bold><underline>PEDIATRIC FORENSIC MEDICINE</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-742</bold></p><p><bold>Complex Suicide</bold></p><p><underline>Jorge Ivan Pareja</underline></p><p><bold>Definition:</bold> Mechanical asphyxia, suicide, cyanosis, choking, cyanosis,</p><p><bold>Metodology:</bold> Autopsy is performed forensic medical office in Medellin, Colombia, South America.</p><p>Study was made of samples from the scene, toxicology and biological</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Woman 40 years of age who is found in Barrio Aranjuez, on a bed and abdominal decubitus position with the feet under the bed, the victim had the red plastic bag over the head with a scarf tied Green's hands victim was fastened with handcuffs behind gray, were also found at the scene a envelopes with money inside and targeted.</p><p>Observed at necropsy red plastic bag on her head secured to the neck by a strip of green which features a simple knot in the back of the neck, transparent band covering the mouth and wives silver metal subject to his left wrist, the clothes are in good condition.</p><p>At external examination conjunctival petechiae are observed, generalized visceral congestion, blood flow markedly.

Formulae for calculating body length/weight from the month of pregnancy described by Haase (1875)/Sakaki (1887) are applicable for this purpose. However, the usability of such old formulae has not been examined. When we compared calculated body length (BL) using Haase’s rule (from 1st to 5th month, BL = M squared, from 6th to 10th month, BL = M multiplied by 5, M means the number of months of pregnancy) with modern growth curve at the end of each month of pregnancy, the former corresponded well with the latter. In the same way, the curve of monthly body weight (BW) obtained by Sakaki’s rule (from 1st to 5th month, BW = M cubed multiplied by 2, from 6th to 10th month, BW = M cubed multiplied by 3, M is the number of months of pregnancy) was very close to the actual growth chart. Though these rules are not well known and not enough described in many textbooks for forensic medicine, they are simple and easy to remember. They should be recognized to be useful tool for forensic diagnosis at the autopsy of fetus or neonate.</p><p><bold>PP-744</bold></p><p><bold>A case of infant accidental hanging</bold></p><p><underline>Mehdi Ben Khelil</underline>, Anis Benzarti, Mohamed Allouche, Fatma Gloulou, Ahmed Banasr, Mongi Zhioua, Moncef Hamdoun</p><p>Forensic Medicine Department, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia</p><p>Hanging deaths in children aged 6 year-oldr and younger are usually accidental.

When abuse is suspected, a forensic examination becomes necessary. Medical confirmation of sexual abuse in boys is a difficult task, easily thwarted by the victim’s unwillingness to report the abuse which delays the forensic examination. Consequently, physical findings are low as the delay may remove the main evidence of anal intercourse, namely the presence of sperm or semen. That notwithstanding, in the same manner that the standard examination does not exclude the occurance of rape, many signs are nonspecific of sexual abuse and can be found in children with other diseases. The objectives of this study are to describe the main clinical findings in the anal region that may confuse the coroner and to present epidemiological data regarding sexual abuse on Brazilian boys.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Analysis of the Ministery of Health database – DATASUS - using the ICD 10 - Y05 (Sexual assault by bodily force) and revision of the main databases’ literature. The key-words employed were: sexual abuse, boy, anal traumatic injury.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In Brazil, between 2008 and 2011, 206 hospitalized sexually abused boys were reported according to the CID - Y 05. White boys between the ages of 4 and 10 where prominent and the country’s Southeast showed the highest number of cases. The clinical findings that often mimic abuse but that may also be observed in other clinical conditions are: anal dilatation (encopresis, sedation, suppository use, chronic constipation, megacolon, megarectum, celiac disease, post-mortem anal dilatation, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, reflex anal dilatation, haemolitytic uraemic syndrome); anal dilatation with stool (constipation), edema (angioedema); smooth area at 6 or 12 o’clock in perianal areas (varying from normal); fissures (constipation, Chron’s disease, ulcerative colitis, infectious nonspecific colitis); scar (previous anal surgery); gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis (vertical transmission); laceration (accidental trauma); redness (poor hygiene, itching for verminosis), venous congestion and skin tags and thickened fold at midline (constipation, Crohn’s disease), human papillomavirus –HPV - (rectal or genital infection by Chlamydia trachomatis amongst young children may be the result of perianal acquired infection and may persist for as long as 3 years).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The importance of this poster is to alert coroners to the existence of perianal and anal abnormalities in boys which are not always due to violence and that may be present in non-abused children.</p><p><bold>PP-746</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Ability of Realization and Distinction Cases According to Forensic and Psyhciatric Concept</bold></p><p><underline>Cem Uysal</underline><sup>1</sup>, Eyüp Yılmaz<sup>2</sup>, Yasin Bez<sup>3</sup>, Ismail Güneş<sup>4</sup>, Şükrü Çetinkaya<sup>4</sup>, Süleyman Gören<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Dicle University Medical Faculty, Diyarbakır, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Diyarbakır Regional Office of Council of Forensic Medicine, Diyarbakır, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Psychiatry, Dicle University Medical Faculty, Diyarbakır, Turkey</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of Children, Diyarbakir Police Department, Diyarbakır, Turkey</p><p><bold>Summary:</bold></p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> According to the New Turkish Penal Code, 12 and 15 years of guilty children have to be evaluated for the ability of realization and distinction.

The average age of males and females were 9.95 ± 5.49 (1–18), and 10.72 ± 6.74 (1–18) respectively. The age of most seen cases were in range of 13–17 years (46.0 %). 66 % of the cases had come to the hospital at their own expense. Cases were more frequently applied to hospital in August and in September [26 cases(10.97 %)]. The most seen causes were traffic accident in men (33.6 %) and, intoxication in women (42.6 %). The rate of cases with no risk of death was 84.3 %. One hundred nineteen cases were discharged after observation follow-ups from the emergency service, 109 cases were hospitalized and had medications.

We have noticed a higher frequency of the cases in winter and spring (26,4 and 28,3 % respectively). 4 cases had suicidal attempts before the fatal act and only 2 cases presented suicidal threats. In only one case the victims filled a suicidal note explaining and apologizing for his act. Reasons of suicides were a familiar conflict and/or the love relation disappointment (24,5 % and 18,9 % of the cases respectively). 71,7 % of the suicides were performed in the victim’s domicile and 24,5 % in an isolated place. 45,3 victims did suicides with hanging, in 20,8 % with medicines ingestion and 15,1 % with pesticide ingestion. We noticed 3 cases of self-immolation and a case of complex suicide (stab wound and drowning). We highlight 4 cases of suggested suicides (2 self-immolation during the Tunisian revolution events, one suicide closely after a friend suicide attempt and a 5 year-old suicide suggested by her older sister who wanted to try an “after-world experience”)</p><p><bold>PP-750</bold></p><p><bold>The evaluation of juvenile delinquency cases referred to juvenile police, in Izmir</bold></p><p><underline>Metin Picakciefe</underline><sup>1</sup>, Pembe Keskin<sup>2</sup>, Gul Ergor<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Mugla University, Mugla, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Provincial Health Directorate, Izmir</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, 9 Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Abstract:</bold> Juvenile delincuency or children incrimination is an important issue in our country as in most of the countries.

In this process, some difficulties like childs own incapacity, rapid urbanization, migration and economic crisis, confusion due to changing value judgment and code of ethics, familial problems, insufficient education, lack of interest and affection etc. are oriented child to criminal behaviours. In this study, we evaluated 47 children's data who came/were brought in Child Department of Konak-Izmir Police Office for substance abuse in 2005. This study is a retrospective type of study. The data was examined by using Fisher’s Exact Test and Pearson Chi-Square Test. The data was evaluated by SPSS 15.0 package program. All of the children are male and mean age is17.06 ± 3.76. Of all cases 76.6 % were the graduated from elementary school. 9 of them (19.1 %) gave up their education and so still are not going to school. All of the children have used volatile substance and 44 of them (93.4 %) are using tobacco, 7 of them (14.9 %) are using drug, 7 of them (14.9 %) are using cannabis, 2 of them (4.3 %) are using alcohol besides volatile substances. 50.1 % of cases were judged for offences directed to property. Secondary was to injure intetntionally with 13.8 %. In conclusion, when we compare with previous studies we found an increase in volatile use. These finding shows us that there is a significant increase in volatile use. To present usage of volatile substances, goverment, people and groups all must take their role. A social goverment must prevent the easy route to substances and fight against the users. For today, usage of substances is under control but the individual and social sensitivity studies on the health and social risks of substance abuse must go on ceaselessly.</p><p><bold>PP-753</bold></p><p><bold>Death from aspiration of vomiting in krabbe disease: a case report</bold></p><p><underline>Kemalettin Acar</underline><sup>1</sup>, Nagihan Yalcın<sup>2</sup>, Ayse Kurtulus<sup>1</sup>, Sumeyra Demir<sup>1</sup>, Akgun Olmez<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Pamukkale University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Denizli, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Pamukkale University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Denizli, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Paediatric Neurology Department of Denizli County Hospital, Denizli, Turkey</p><p>Krabbe disease is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe destruction of myelin and presence of globoid bodies in white matter.

Recent clinical survey of patient records from autism spectrum disorders (ASD) children under the age of 6 years and their age-matched controls revealed evidence of abnormal markers of thiol metabolism, as well as a significant alteration in deposition of several heavy metal species, particularly arsenic, mercury, copper, and iron in hair samples between the groups. As a preliminary step in understanding the possible role of some metals in the etiology of autism, this study aims at detecting the difference in the level of mercury, lead, copper and zinc in the hair of autistic children versus normal control group and whether the levels of these substances are correlated with severity of autism or not. Patients and control group were matched regarding the age (nearly 4 years old). Results showed the lead and copper levels were significantly higher in cases (9.75 ± 1.8 ug/mg and 26.5 ± 1.9 ug/mg respectively) than in control (6.8 ± 0.86 ug/mg and 19.1 ± 4.4 ug/mg respectively) while, mercury and zinc levels were significantly lower in cases (0.55 ± 0.06 ug/mg and 304.99 ± 25.8 ug/mg respectively) than in control (3.2 ± 0.2 ug/mg and 419.5 ± 45.96 ug/mg respectively). There was positive correlation of Child Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score and both mercury and copper levels while; Intelligence Quotient (IQ) has significant negative correlation with hair lead level. Zinc level does not correlate with either CARS score or IQ. These preliminary results suggest a complementary role for the studied elements in the pathogenesis of autistic disorder which should be considered in the management plane.</p><p><bold>PP-755</bold></p><p><bold>Descriptive data on juvenile delinquency in Kadiköy and Kartal districts in İstanbul</bold></p><p>Türkan Akbaba<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Mehmet Akif Inanici</underline><sup>2</sup>, Sinem Yıldız<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Health Sciences, Forensic Nursing MSc Program, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Medical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Understanding the nature of specific crimes and/or specific age groups’ crime behavior as well as the local crime characteristics of a geographic region is vital to determine the needs of a prevention program. In this study it is aimed to show the descriptive information of juvenile delinquency in two regions in Istanbul.</p><p><bold>Material-method:</bold> The verdict files of Kadıköy and Kartal Juvenile Courts which are registered between years 2008–2009 are reviewed. One of the researchers visited the courts with the written permission of both Marmara University Ethical Committee and the Ministry of Justice. She investigated the related files and documented them in a classified manner. Statistical analysis is executed by SPSS 16.0.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Demographic information of research groups are available in Table 1 and 2. For both districts number of male adolescents within the age range 16–18 is higher than 12–15 age range.</p><p>In Kadıköy, mean number of crimes committed by males is 1,22 (ss = .49) and by females is 1,10 (ss = .29) (p &lt; 0,5). See the detailed description of crime types in Figure 1. The mean age of the victims is 36,1 (ss 14,22). It is found out that 93,7 % (n = 385) of males are victimized by male perpetrators (p = .000).</p><p>In Kartal district, mean number of crimes committed by males is 1,22 (ss = .50) and by females is 1,08 (ss=,32) (p &lt; 0,5). The mean age of the victims is 32,74 (ss 13,5). Again, 96 % (n = 559) of males are victimized by male perpetrators (p = .000).</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> It is determined that older male juveniles are at greater risk than the younger ones in being party to a crime. Perpetrators from different age ranges are not selective to specific victim properties such as gender and age. The fact that the most common type of crime is theft for both gender smay be the sign of low SES and ganging in these regions. Females do not commit crimes which involve active aggression. As a result, gender type, age range and SES are chosen as key points in future prevention programs.</p><p><bold>PP-756</bold></p><p><bold>An Infant Death due to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Case Report</bold></p><p><underline>Hakan Oğuz</underline>, Çetin Seçkin, Tansev Boran</p><p>Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease of the myocardium in which a part of the myocardium is hypertrophied. HCM is often asymmetrical, in which one part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. The occurrence of HCM is a significant cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group. It is usually inherited. On the other hand, causes of child deaths show changes between countries according to the level of advance. In Turkey and similar underdeveloped and developing countries, basic causes of child deaths are infection diseases, malnutrition, congenital malformation, accidents, malignant diseases. In a study analyzed the deaths of babies, it was determined that cardiac ve central nervous system anomalies were the most frequently seen congenital anomalies. Aim of the study, to present an infant girl case, 43-days of age, who was found by her parent as died and HCM was determined in the autopsy, then revision of the related literature.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> According to the hospital’s medical documents, when she was brought to the hospital by her parent cyanosis was observed. Respiration and pulse were absent. CPR was applied. Nevertheless any reaction couldn’t be taken. Therefore she accepted as exitus. At the autopsy, she was 50 cm in tall and 3000 gr in weight. External examination findings were normal. Heart was 19 gr, right lung was 60 gr and left lung was 61 gr. A small amount of gastric content was observed in the stomach. Systematical toxicological analyses were negative. Histopathological examination findings as follows; Hypertrophy and hyperemia were observed in myocardium. Walls of the left ventricle were thicken, papillary and trabecular muscles were became rude in this area, left ventricle cavity was narrow, out of the left ventricle was narrow slightly. Diffuse edema, intra-alveolar fresh hemorrhage, severe hyperemia in the lungs; hyperemia in liver, kidneys, thymus and cerebrum were observed. As a conclusion, microscopic changes of the heart was making think HCM.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HCM must be call to mind in sudden death cases.</p><p><bold><underline>QUALITY CONTROL</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-757</bold></p><p><bold>Discrepancies between clinical and autoptic diagnoses: evaluation of 879 consecutive cases</bold></p><p><underline>Sara Sblano</underline><sup>1</sup>, Alessandra Arpaio<sup>1</sup>, Alessandro Bonsignore<sup>1</sup>, Fiorenza Zotti<sup>2</sup>, Andrea Marzullo<sup>3</sup>, Alessandro Dell'Erba<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Legal Medicine, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Risk Management Unit, Policlinico Hospital of Bari, Italy</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Clinical Pathology, University of Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The number of clinical autopsies has recently undergone to a progressive decline and many professionals are concerned about it in the medical community and in the wider healthcare system. Multiple factors are contributing to this decline. In addition to an alleged high cost-effectiveness ratio and the fear of medico-legal consequences, some argue that with the improvement of the imaging technology the diagnosis as well as the cause of death are more certain in most cases. Despite these advances in diagnostic modalities, recent studies stressed that autopsies continue to demonstrate inaccuracies in clinical diagnoses that can affect outcomes and this is the reason why autopsy still remains a fundamental tool for healthcare quality and safety assurance.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> A retrospective study on the reports of all the 879 consecutive autopsies performed on patients who died at “Policlinico” Hospital in Bari from 1990 to 2009 was conducted. A progressive reduction in the number of the autopsies executed per year was observed with the sole exception of an increase in the number of the perinatal ones. All clinical diagnoses have been compared with autopsy findings. Major and minor diagnostic discrepancies were categorized according to the criteria of Goldman et al. (Class 1: a discrepant major diagnosis with a potential impact on survival; Class 2: a discrepant major diagnosis but with equivocal or no impact on survival; Class 3: a discrepant minor diagnosis that could have been diagnosed before death; Class 4: a discrepant minor diagnosis that could not have been made before death).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The rate of discrepancy revealed on the base of autopsy findings was significantly high (36,5 %) allowing us to hypothesize that a better diagnostic assessment could lead to a different outcome. Especially the major diagnostic discrepancies have certainly had an at least pejorative effect in the matter of the initial assessment of the case and / or the treatment provided.</p><p>In terms of risk-management this negative performance needs to be carefully analysed and requires a comprehensive audit of all services provided in the hospital.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion we would like to underline the everlasting importance of autopsy as an essential tool to address unresolved clinical questions and to highlight previously undiagnosed medical conditions. Particularly, data from post-mortem examinations continue to be important for society, in order to inform about causes of death, for doctors, to improve practices, and for decision-makers, to improve organizational systems and clinical performances.</p><p><bold>PP-758</bold></p><p><bold>Medical activity documentation</bold></p><p><underline>Saadia Cristina Zawadzki</underline><sup>1</sup>, <underline>Saadia Cristina Zawadzki</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Facultad de Medicina Uruguay, Uruguay</p><p><sup>2</sup>Hospital de Clinicas Uruguay, Uruguay</p><p>Clinical records, medical and medical records audit.</p><p>Today in our country there have been made public knowledge as the deaths of terminally illness patients or almost terminal in CTI conducted by Hospital´s personnel.</p><p>At this point health´s authorities notice a flaw in the controls not only from the operational standpoint, also at the medical records of patients.</p><p>We have to take into account that the medical record of our patience is the most important document that we have.

In 2006, the SNPforID Consortium published the development of a multiplex PCR assay for detection of 52 autosomal SNPs for human identification, validated for forensic use in the following year. Even though the analysis of 52 SNPs may be ideal, a smaller number of loci can be sufficient to provide additional data for complex casework. The use of a 20 SNP multiplex has already been developed for paternity and kinship analysis. Here we present the internal validation study of that multiplex.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> DNA was extracted using Chelex®100 resin method from buccal swabs and/or blood samples of 113 unrelated individuals involved in paternity testing casework. DNA from animal samples was also extracted. PCR amplification of autosomal SNPs was performed in two 25 μl 10-plex reactions designed to amplify SNP loci rs1490413, rs1029047, rs763869, rs735155, rs2107612, rs1454361, rs2111980, rs1005533, rs8037429, rs891700 in the first multiplex and SNP loci rs2046361, rs717302, rs1886510, rs729172, rs1024116, rs1463729, rs2076848, rs1355366, rs907100, rs737681 in the second one. PCR conditions and SBE reactions were performed as described by Sanchez et al. with slight modifications and SBE products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> An optimum PCR annealing temperature of 58°C was obtained although Sanchez et al. described it at 60°C. This assay revealed sensibility to obtain full profiles from 2.5 ng, 2.0 ng, 1.0 ng and 0.5 ng of human DNA. No SNP loci amplification was detected from animal samples, which included various vertebrates such as cats, dogs, horses and others.</p><p>Population studies were performed with 113 individual samples. All studied loci revealed allelic frequencies higher than 0.310, sixteen above 0.400. Discrimination Power of 99.9999995 % and Power of Exclusion (PE) of 97.88 % were obtained with the 20 SNP studied. Although PE is relatively low, these 20 SNP multiplex can be very informative when analyzed together with one or two routine STR multiplex loci.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A sensible and specific 20 SNP multiplex for forensic testing, based on SNPforID 52-plex, was validated. This multiplex shows human specificity, full profiles can be obtained from very low DNA quantity and is very informative when analyzed together with routine STR multiplex loci. Autosomal SNP analysis can be a valuable tool in Forensic Genetics, especially in kinship analysis and human identification.</p><p><bold>PP-760</bold></p><p><bold>A practice of patient complaint management</bold></p><p><underline>Hanife Eregez</underline><sup>1</sup>, Didem Söylemez Sur<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Social Sciences, Arel Univercity, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Faculty of Health Sciences, Yeditepe Univercity, Turkey</p><p>The purpose of this study is, to analyze how the customer complaint management is handled in private hospitals in İstanbul. Patient complaints management is a crucial part of patient-oriented service and quality improvement. In this context, the relation between practice and processes of the basic tools such as Responsiveness, Effective Evaluation, Effective Solution, Privacy, Information Collection and Use, Monitoring, and Make Improvements. Questionnaire interviews with private hospital managers were carried out to determine customer complaints management approaches. Based on bed capacity, although there are 13 institutions were included to the study, only 6 of them participated. Reasons declared about not participating were private corporate privacy, competitive conditions for private hospital, and not being eligible (time constraints). The average numbers of; sectional hospitals of the institutions was 6, beds 186; employees 933. 55.9 % of the hospitals' have TSE, 79.4 % have JCI, 91.2 % have the ISO certification. The Patient Focus and Quality Improvement (p = 0.037 *Accessibility (p = 0.019), responsiveness (p &lt; 0.0001**), Effective Evaluation (p = 0.013*), Effective Solution (p &lt; 0.0001**), Privacy (p &lt; 0.0001 **) and monitoring / improvement (p = 0.006*) processes of the institutions with TSE certificates were significantly different compared to others.

Deficiencies have been identified in customer complaint management processes. More were missing in "effective evaluation process" which is the most important factor. 48.2 % of survey respondents marked that, management strategies were determined by the risk assessment in order of severity of complaints whereas 51.8 % of respondents' indecision on this issue or disagree. 41.8 % of the respondents' disagree or indecision to the question of which complaints will be taken away to foreign corporations (like chambers of commerce, police, etc.) in complaint management procedure. In addition, 60 % of respondents declared that, public have not been informed on a regular basis, about patience feedback aiming to improve the quality.</p><p><bold><underline>SEXUAL ABUSE</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-761</bold></p><p><bold>Complete hymen pregnant teenager.

Such ways of thinking have deep roots and hold important cultural significance in this part of the country. What makes this case so unusual and interesting however, is the way in which the perpetrator went about sexually abusing his daughter:</p><p>• Seeking the help of sorcerers.</p><p>• Sadistic practices such as injecting sperm into the victim, as well as providing her with food and drink laced with sperm.</p><p>• Psychological violence.</p><p>• Isolation of the victim.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We examined the features of the violence perpetrated. An unusual web of ritualistic, mythical, subcultural, and “magical” elements were involved that went far beyond those normally associated with cases of sexual abuse. Another atypical characteristic of this case was the duration of the sexual relations between the father and daughter: 4 years.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In cases of incest, the adult transforms a child’s dreams of seducing the parent into a nightmare in which the child is actually able to realize his or her goal. The parent should remain impassive in such situations. Whereas the child may only fantasize about sexual or incestuous behavior, adults must understand the difference between infantile phantasms by deciphering the meaning of these fantasies and not permitting them to be acted upon.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Unlike a “classic” rape, where the victim feels a sense of separateness from the rapist, the victim of sexual abuse within the family environment finds him or herself in a highly complicated relationship with the perpetrator. Even when these victims have feelings of hate toward the relative, they are unable to experience conflicting tensions and ambiguous emotions: This is particularly damaging to a child as we can see from this case.</p><p><bold>PP-763</bold></p><p><bold>Female pedofily.

Sometimes it can happen that the abuser is a female and tje consequences both moral and social can have a different way. This reality is harder to understand because of the role that a female has in the society: she is a woman, a mother, she gives protection, love. But what does it happen when the abuser is a woman? There are differences in the behaviour of the abuser?The authors, throught the presentation of specific cases and the experience of brilliant psycologist will try to give an explanation and a contribution to this “special” reality.</p><p><bold>PP-764</bold></p><p><bold>A Rare ‘Educator Sexual Abuse’ case: Mistress &amp; Schoollgirl</bold></p><p><underline>Ugur Kayhan</underline>, Zafer Liman, Esat Şahin, Dilek Güntepe</p><p>Adli Tıp Kurumu, İstanbul Türkiye</p><p>In the literature in concern with about child sexual abuse the term that is defined as “Educator Sexual Abuse” or “Educator Sexual Misconduct” is put forward in the last few years. This term often finds place in the visual and print media and also causes significant reactions in the society. In most of the studies about sexual abuse, up to date it is reported that the abuser and the victim are different gender: the abuser is male and the victim is female. Cases in which the gender of the victim and the abuser is same is less abundant.And also it is very very rare that the victim and the abuser are female. In addition in terms of general characteristics there is a close correlation between “Educator Sexual Abuse” and the whole sexual abuse cases.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> An ‘Educator Sexual Abuse’ case that admitted to judicial authorities for allegedly suffered sexual harassment by a female teacher and that has sent to Specialized Board of The Councel of Forensic Medicine (The Sixth Commitee) for evaluation of mental health.Our case is a 15-year-old elementary school girl living in the city center.The abuser is a female math teacher. Since the abuse the victim has been living sexual identity problems and thinks she is responsible for the abuse becauce of masculine attitudes and behaviours she has.

Children rarely talk about sexual abuse to a third one.One of the main reasons is the abuser's threaten to child that he would harm her and her family members.The other reason is that nobody will believe her when the abuse is heard. One of the most important dimensions of child sexual abuse is prevention children from child sexual abuse and realising child sexual abuse as early as possible. In early diagnosis and prevention of child sexual abuse, generally community’s and especially professionals’ awareness of about the subject is of great importance.

According to the victim's testimony, when the victim was 12, her brother V.D. born in 1981 first had vaginal intercourse with her by force after drinking alcohol.The victim told the event to his mother the first time, but her mother covered up the event for fear that the father would learn the situation.Later, his older brother born in 1979 S.D. forced her have intercourse like his another brother.Until 2006 when S.D. died and until June of 2010 V.D's marriage, they continued sexual attacks almost every day. In 2007, O.D her twin brother and E.D. born in 1987 older brother had begun to have intercourse with her by force. O.D continued his actions until his marriage in 2010. Then V.D. forced the victim to informally marry with 27-year-old uncle of his wife R.C. They lived together only in a month and then she divorced from R.C,she returned to her family house.Lastly E.D. raped the victim in his Office. As a result of this event, she abandoned him and she began to live in parks. An old woman found her, she brought the victim to women’s shelter. The event reflected the judicial authorities in here.</p><p>The examination of the committee; was determined “Posttraumatic Personality Change”. The latest rape by E.D have been carried out by the study of biological, foreign DNA and sperm cells were not found but as a result of the psychiatric interview in judicial investigation, It is identified that she has exposed to sexual harassment</p><p><bold>Discussion &amp; conclusion:</bold> In our case, only one thing which may prevent the abuse was mother’s help but mother’s ignorance made the event longer and more complex. Despite many case reports in the literature on incest, in this family we mentioned here, multi incest including especially the victim's twin brother and other brother incest made this event more different than others.</p><p><bold>PP-769</bold></p><p><bold>Comparison Of The Optical Filtered Colposcopic Images With Unfiltered Colposcopic Images In Suspected Rape Victims</bold></p><p><underline>Mustafa Selim Ozkok</underline>, Ozlem Erel, Berk Gun, Musa Dırlık, Basak Cakır, Ufuk Katkıcı</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Adnan Menderes University, Faculty Of Medicine, Aydin, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colposcopy and colpophotography are important methods of examination that are used in a lot of western countries as standard for the research of genital lesions in sexual abuse cases and they are recognized to increase the detection of the findings in the first 72 hours. During the colposcopic examination, if the tissues that are not cleaned well and if there is discharge, infection and/or edema around the region; it causes brightness and reflection on the images and makes it hard to examinate and take images. In photography, various filters are used to prevent such reflections. For the purpose of avoiding reflections and improving image quality; we used a special optic filter which was improved for a reserach project in Turkey.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Informed consent was taken from all the patients that were sent to Adnan Menderes University Department of Forensic Medicine Sexual Examination Center with a suspection of sexual abuse. Filtered and unfiltered standard images that included lesions were taken with the improved special filter mounted on the colposcope. Lesions were evaluated with the patient history, visual examination and the filtered and unfiltered images.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the cases that were examined within the first 72 hours; there was intense brightness around the examination regions on the unfiltered images, the size and the borders’ of the lesions were more evident on the filtered images and some lesions that were not clear on unfiltered images became more evident on filtered images. These findings will be discussed by comparing the images in our presentation.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In colposcopic imaging, brightness is a major problem in the unfiltered colpophotographic shots that affect the image quality and future evaluations. It was determined that the optic filters which prevent brightness and make the tissues more evident are valuable and useful in the examination and the documentation of the rape victims and increase the quality of the examination.</p><p><bold>PP-770</bold></p><p><bold>Les violences sexuelles conjugales en Algérie, entre tabou, religion et loi</bold></p><p><underline>Mokhtaria Souag</underline></p><p>The authors intend to demonstrate that the conjugal duty makes possible all that the law and religion to this day because repress sexual abuse inflicted on women by their spouses are not recognized as offenses within the Algerian penal code and are the subject of any judicial repression.

But sexual abuse in the old occurs frequently enough for it to be ignored. Among the victims of sexual assault 1/7 are aged more than 60 years and in a study done in Turkey 0.9 % of the seniors were victims of sexual abuse. Senior population is on the rise because of progresses in medicine, technology and preventive health care. It is also expected that life expectancy which was in the fifties in the fifties (1950) has reached 70–75 years. It is also known that elderly victims are more prone to psychiatric disorders, cognitive defects and genital trauma, and become more dependent after an assault compared to the more resilient young. Studies in Turkey are mostly on the physical abuse and neglect of the seniors. As it is has not been wholly acknowledged that the elderly people may be physically and emotionally abused even in a traditional society like Turkey in which the elderly are revered it is no surprise that sexual abuse is not even mentioned.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> A 82 year women who lived alone, was assaulted by 2 men invading her home. She suffered 3 days of physical and sexual abuse and her pension money was seized. On hospital admission the victim complained of anal, left eye and left and right lumbar pain and on physical examination there was ecchymosis on and around the left eyelid, 1 cm swellings on the right and left occipital region, 3 cm abrasion on the back of the neck, 1 cm bruise on the left shoulder, 8–10 cm abrasions on the left side of the back, ecchymosis around the anal area, 2 cm bruise under the left kneecap, diverse scratches and bruises on left foot and legs. In the Forensic Medicine Institute, 6th Expert Committee psychological evaluation 2 years after the fact, post traumatic stress disorder and major depression was diagnosed. It was concluded that the previous episode had undermined her mental well-being, and caused her to leave her home, friends and neighbors and to live with her son.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The purpose of this report is to highlight the facts that elderly may be victims of sexual predation, that they may more severely compromised emotionally and physically and that they may lose their previous autonomy.</p><p><bold>PP-772</bold></p><p><bold>Post-mortem examination of the female ano-genital region: the medico-legal urgency to find out what is normal and what may be a sign of abuse</bold></p><p><underline>Francesca Ambrosetti</underline><sup>1</sup>, Elisa Palazzo<sup>1</sup>, Tiziano Motta<sup>2</sup>, Andrea Gentilomo<sup>1</sup>, Cristina Cattaneo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Sezione di Medicina Legale e delle Assicurazioni, Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana e Scienze Biomediche, Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy</p><p><sup>2</sup>Clinica Mangiagalli, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> the evaluation of normal anatomical variants and modes of presentation of female genitalia and the anal region particularly in cadavers is fundamental for the proper assessment of these areas when sexual violence before death has been hypothesized. In literature very few studies have investigated the normal anatomy of the ano-genital region nor which signs can be specific or mistaken for sexual abuse in the cadaver where postmortem phenomena may mimic or alter the original situation. The aim of this study is to observe post-mortem modifications and the alterations of genital anatomy in women with a known sexual history of the immediate antemortem period.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 30 female cadavers were selected from the autopsies performed at the Sezione di Medicina Legale di Milano. Age, parity, use of systemic hormones and sexual activity were recorded for each case. Before cadaveric dissection, forensic pathological and ano-genital data were noted. Measurements were taken of clitoral body length, distance from the base of clitoral glans to the urethral orifice, labia minor length and width, labia majora length, vaginal and anal orifice length and width, distance from the posterior fourchette to anterior anal margin. All examinations were performed independently by two pathologists in order to minimize inter-observer variability using calipers. Digital photographs of the ano-genital region were taken both prior to dissection and after evisceration. Samples of suspected lesions were taken for further microscopic evaluation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> as far as metric assessment was concerned large discrepancies between observers were observed more frequently in the evaluation of the anus which proved to be extremely difficult to standardize. Post mortem phenomena up to several days did not seem to have significant effects on vulval, hymenal and labial morphology whereas large difficulties and discrepancies in interpretation were found with apparent erythematous areas on the labia, hymen and vaginal walls which could be mistaken for lesions (eg. ecchymoses) but which upon closer examination revealed themselves to be hypostatic areas of engorgement.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> studies of the genital and anal areas of cadavers is much called for. Very little is known concerning anal and genital postmortem modifications. The present study has shown that many pitfalls may exist in the interpretation of such findings due to difficulties in examining and measuring these areas and the frequent areas of congestion and hypostasis in the genitalia which may create some ambiguity in their interpretation. All of these phenomena may, if improperly handled, have severe medico-legal implications.</p><p><bold>PP-773</bold></p><p><bold>Sexual assault by intimate partner: a prospective study</bold></p><p><underline>Patrick Chariot</underline>, Marie Seyller, Cyril Boraud</p><p>Department of forensic medicine, hopital Jean-Verdier (AP-HP), Bondy, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Increasing attention has focussed on the effects of intimate partner violence on physical and mental health. Only a minority of victims report sexual assaults to the police and even more rarely when the assailant is an intimate partner. Our objective was to characterize intimate partner sexual violence and its physical and psychological effects, at the time of forensic examination and one month later.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated all individuals aged over 15 at the time of the reported sexual assault who were referred to our department of forensic medicine. In a prospective study (January 1, 2008 - March 1, 2011), victims of assaults by intimate or ex-intimate partners (group 1) were compared with victims of assaults by unknown or previously known individuals (groups 2 and 3). Data collected included characteristics of the victim, of the assailant, and of the assault, and the results of clinical examination. Follow-up included a second examination, one month later. Posttraumatic stress and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 797 patients (767 women [96 %], 30 men [4 %]) were examined. Median age was 23 (range: 15–82). Group 1–3 included 263, 290, and 244 patients. Antiretroviral therapy was given in 239 patients (30 %). A chronic psychiatric illness was found in 217 patients (27 %) and 139 patients (17 %) received a psychoactive treatment at the time of the assault. Most victims of assaults by intimate partners had been previously assaulted (71 % vs. 29 % and 47 %, Chi2 test, P &lt; 0.0001). Victims reporting physical violence associated with sexual assaults accounted for 145 of 263 (55 %) in group 1 vs. 95 of 290 (33 %) and 75 of 244 (31 %) in groups 2 and 3 (P &lt; 0.0001). Physical injuries were found in only 349 patients (44 %) and were more frequent in victims of assaults by intimate partners (54 % vs. 44 % and 33 %, P &lt; 0.0001). A total of 306 victims (38 %) attended the follow-up examination. After one month, median scores were 55, 48, and 50 for IES-R (groups 1–3, P = 0.95, NS) and 16, 17, and 18 (groups 1–3, P = 0.34, NS) for GHQ-28.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most victims of assaults by intimate partners had been previously assaulted before reporting the case to the police. Only a minority of sexual assaults survivors present with physical injuries. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were present as well in most victims by intimate partners as in other victims of sexual violence.</p><p><bold>PP-774</bold></p><p><bold>Friends’ Compulsion for Abusing Children Sexually: A Child Molester Report</bold></p><p><underline>Zerrin Erkol</underline><sup>1</sup>, Taşkın Özdeş<sup>1</sup>, Hayri Erkol<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, Forensic Medicine Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Abant Izzet Baysal University, Faculty of Medicine, General Surgery Department, Bolu, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Child sexual abuse can be defined as any situation in which an adult or another child threatens, forces a child into sexual activity. However, the abuser doesn't need to use physical force to the victim every time. A part of molested children are abused by persons who have close proximity to them. Abusers may have some characteristics. Most abusers were abused themselves. The study is aim to present a child sexual abuser case who molested three children due to his friends’ compulsion and discuss the factors which move the abuser to molest.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> Three victims of children, who were 9-8-6 years of age and a 13-year-old boy as a suspected molester were sent to our department for examination by Attorney General. One of the victim told that the molester was their relative and abused his ano-genital region by his penis one time. Other victims’ statements were similar. Examination of the general body and genital region of the victims didn’t show any traumatic findings.</p><p>During the examination, suspected child told that he abused the victims’ anal region one time a number of months before. Because his friends were often saying him “Everybody do it. Why you didn’t do it till today? You didn’t know how to do it? Really?” etc. They often teased to him. These speeches made him nervous. Therefore he decided to make his behaviours because of his friends’ compulsion. Anybody didn’t make such behaviours to him up till now. It was learnt from his mother that he has social difficulties, statement disability and he was unsuccessful in school. He received a treatment for anxiety two years before. Results of examination and tests indicated that 62 oral mental score, 88 performance mental score, total 72 mental score. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, anxiety disorder, learning disability and borderline intellectual functionality were diagnosed.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case shows us that the child’s friends may canalize tho him/her to the wrong ways. Therefore the child may beleive that these behaviours are normal and doing these things is necessary for him/her. Thus s/he may commit some crimes such as sexual abuse, robbery, etc. Education and close attention of family will be useful to assist the children for prevent such wrong acts.</p><p><bold>PP-775</bold></p><p><bold>Attitudes among residents in forensic medicine toward the survivors of childhood sexual abuse</bold></p><p><underline>Murat Emül</underline><sup>1</sup>, Sinan Sevinc<sup>2</sup>, Ramazan Atlen<sup>2</sup>, Dursun Memis<sup>2</sup>, Esat Sahin<sup>2</sup>, Sedat Demirbuga<sup>2</sup>, Suheyla Aliustaoglu<sup>2</sup>, Haluk Ince<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>MD, Department of Psychiatry, Medical School of Cerrahpasa, İstanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>MD, Resident, Forensic Medicine, Forensic Medical Council, Istanbul, Ministry of Justice, Turkey</p><p><bold>Aims:</bold> Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) spoils the survivor's trust and sense of safety in the world. Careless over-interpretation of the data about the long-term consequences of CSA in survivors might lead to some misunderstandings and result stigmatization. Frequently, children are reticent to report such abuse. Reason for this reluctance may be previous negative experiences with professionals or hidden prejudices toward the legal system.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We investigated the attitudes of forensic medicine residents toward the survivors of CSA. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about stigmatization, anonymously.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 49 residents from Forensic Institute in our study, 42 of whom were male. Of the participants, 77.5 % responded negatively about “asking a survivor of abuse to supervise their child for a few hours”. When asked, “What would you think if your child wanted to marry a survivor of sexual abuse?” 85.7 % of residents displayed negative attitudes toward that idea. 71.4 % of residents were reticent to the suggestion of “a sexual abuse survivor can control his/her impulsivity”. Additionally, 44.9 % of residents agreed that “If a childhood sexual abuse survivor is present in street/district, I do not allow my child to go out alone”</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It seems essential to focus on a better understanding of risk and protective factors that affect the adjustment of childhood sexual abuse survivors. Forensic medicine residents appear to be a logical and important target for this aim. Forensic medicine residents seem to distance themselves from or have negative thoughts about childhood sexual abuse survivors, particularly when the issue involves their own children and/or social situations. However careless and undetailed interpretations of studies which have inconclusive data regarding types of psychopathology, the duration of the abuse, the likelihood and reasons for remaining non-symptomatic, and the long-/short-term impacts and outcomes of childhood sexual abuse might lead such stigmatized attitudes in forensic medicine residents.</p><p><bold>PP-776</bold></p><p><bold>Inquiry on Juvenile Sexual Abusers in Sicily (2005–2009).

Sexual psychopathology can be studied within the framework of impulse control disorders and it seems considerable to understand personality features of young abusers in order to find effective care strategies for themselves and overcome social blame which can easily influence a neutral approach of care. The presented research is a part of a study aimed at structured therapeutic interventions for young abusers to avoid crime reiteration and take into specialized care abusers who were victims himself of sexual offences. The knowledge of this phenomenon (so-called “cycle of abuse”) was carried out with an interdisciplinary approach, by using social, clinical and forensic indicators: in fact, abuse should be understood through the analysis of bio-psycho-social background of the abusers, their psychological functioning, psychopathological personality features and relationship with adolescents. This investigation was carried out on 67 case files concerning sexual crimes made by juvenile offenders since 2005 to 2009 at Juvenile Penal Court, first and second instance, district of Palermo. The inquiry completed in autumn 2011 shows that juvenile offenders usually live in deprived social contexts and often suffered adverse life events with psychological consequences. 16,5 % of abusers were victims of sexual abuse in their childhood. The forensic approach detail analyzes the criminal offense taking into account type of sexual intercourse, possible combined physical violence, abuse and delay between complaint / clinical examination, characteristics of site of abuse, medical investigation and biological collection (sampling blood, sperm, DNA analysis), according to the Adams’s classification.</p><p>The analysis of psychological patterns underlines dysfunction of the expression of emotions and impulses which sometimes constitutes specific disorders as it has been observed by psychiatric and psychological examinations carried on during the legal proceeding.</p><p>The most commonly diagnosis trend is a personality disorder of the dramatic cluster, according to the DSM IV, or a personality “organization” expressing the vulnerability to developing a personality disorder.</p><p>The clinical assessment could be modified during penal trail because of expert evaluation required in some cases psychiatric treatment aimed at alleviating symptoms such as the use of benzodiazepines.</p><p>Our research pointed out that, in the early stages of penal trial, there weren’t any supportive or counseling therapeutic interventions focused on feelings of rage, fear, and suffering for stigmatization.</p><p><bold>PP-777</bold></p><p><bold>The Comparison of Macroscopic and Colposcopic Examination Findings in Sexual Assault Cases</bold></p><p>Murat Yıldız, <underline>Nursel Gamsız Bilgin</underline></p><p>The Department of Forensic Medicine, Mersin University Medical Faculty, Mersin, Turkey</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic, examination, consultation and laboratory findings, to compare the macroscopic and colposcopic genital examination findings in cases which are sent with sexual assult claim.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The cases which are sent to ME.U.M.F.

In the morning his father found him death in bed. External examination showed a discrete petechial rash on the thorax, neck and lower limbs. Autopsy findings and medical history were negative for any pre-existing illnesses or potential causes of death. An enterotoxin producing Bacillus cereus was isolated and identified from the hemocultures and a bottle of water. Other food was also tested but showed no contamination. The cause of death was determined to be multiple organ failure due to an enterotoxin producing Bacillus cereus sepsis. A few days later his younger brother was admitted to the hospital with a skin infection. Bacillus cereus was isolated from the wound, and the boy healed after antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Bacillus cereus is known for causing eye infections and food poisoning in immunocompetent hosts and accounts for 2-5 % of all food borne illnesses. Fulminant B. cereus septicemia with multiorgan failure and death is more often associated with immunosupressed patients (malignancy, neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy) or seen in the presence of intravenous catheters or devices. The rapid development of sepsis and sudden death in this otherwise healthy young boy signifies that B. cereus infections should not only warrant suspicion in the immunosupressed. This disease usually goes underdiagnosed, but with this case report we would like to report that it is a possible cause of sudden death and could present a potential threat for the closest surroundings.</p><p><bold>PP-781</bold></p><p><bold>Epidemiologic characteristics of sudden cardiac death in north Tunisia</bold></p><p>Shimi Maha, <underline>Allouche Mohammad</underline>, Bekir Olfa, Gloulou Fatma, Ben Khlil Mahdi, Zhioua Mongi, Hamdoun Moncef</p><p>Department of forensic medicine, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Sudden death represents the most frequent cause of death in thanatological activity in forensic pathology.</p><p>It’s a natural death which can occur in any circumstance, at any time, among all age groups, which an underlying pathological condition or not. It is a natural death excluding all forms of violent deaths and it is related in most cases with a cardiac cause that has led to a sudden cardiac arrest.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We conducted a prospective study in the Department of Forensic Medicine of Charles Nicolle hospital over a period of 24 months during which we collected all cases of sudden deaths that represent 542 cases among 3192 autopsies.</p><p>We conducted an epidemiologic investigation using questioning that has been subsequently supplemented by autopsy that included a detailed examination of the heart as well as additional histological examinations and toxicology.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of sudden death representing 80 % of all sudden deaths.

In the group aged between 25 and 45, 64 % are smokers. In most cases (67 %) death occurs at rest and in 20 % of cases over the weekend. It was noticed that the vast majority (78 %) died outside of hospitals and only 16 % received medical transport to the hospital.</p><p>Family history of sudden death was searched during the investigation in the immediate family of the cases studied: father, mother brother and sister in 10 % of such history were noted with the following distribution (father46%, mother 20 %, brother 22 %, sister 11 %).

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is one of a subset of diseases that result in the formation of microthrombi within the vasculature, either as a primary or secondary manifestation. Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis during pregnancy are hemolytic uremic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, preeclampsia-eclampsia and the HELLP syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The histologic manifestations of these diseases can be similar and in most cases do not provide adequate information to accurately differentiate these diseases in the postmortem period. This paper addresses the need for clinical history (i.e., symptomatology, trimester of onset) and antemortem laboratory testing in addition to a thorough autopsy to accurately differentiate among the conditions named previously. In the absence of an adequate clinical history and antemortem laboratory testing, the more general diagnosis of "thrombotic microangiopathy of pregnancy" is acceptable.</p><p><bold>PP-784</bold></p><p><bold>Homicide by Commotio Cordis in Malaysia: A Report of Two Cases</bold></p><p><underline>Khairul Anuar Zainun.</underline><sup>1</sup>, Suhani Mohd Noor<sup>2</sup>, Shahrom Abdul Wahid<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Kuala Lumpur Hospital, Malaysia.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital, Alor Setar, Malaysia.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Forensic Unit, UKM Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Commotio cordis is an established cause of sudden death following nonpenetrating, often minor impact to the chest. Death ensues as a result of ventricular arrhythmias and eventual cardiac arrest. It commonly occurs amongst young athletes participating in sport-related activities albeit increasing reports have associate deaths by this mechanism with falls and motor vehicle accidents. However, homicide by commotio cordis is invariably a rare phenomenon.</p><p><bold>Case Reports:</bold> We present two cases of sudden death in young adults attributed to commordio cordis following assaultive blows to the chest. In the first case, a 25 year-old man was involved in a verbal commotion with his friend when he suddenly collapsed following a direct blow to his left chest by a long, cylindrical-shaped implement. The event was witnessed by a passer-by. Postmortem examination demonstrated an oblique, spindle-shaped tramline bruise over the left lower chest about 3 cm below the nipple with associated left lower lung contusion. The heart was morphologically normal. Analysis of the usual body fluids did not detect any drugs of abuse, alcohol or common toxicants. Death was attributed to commotio cordis (blunt trauma to the chest).</p><p>The second case involved a middle-aged man who was found dead following an altercation during a gambling session. The assault itself was unwitnessed. In addition to a scalp laceration and facial abrasion, the postmortem examination also demonstrated an oblique tramline bruise across the chest with a fracture of the right 6th rib. The heart showed focal anterior epicardial hemorrhage, endocardial fibrosis and subendocardial hemorrhage of the left ventricle, and healthy coronaries. There was also mild subarachnoid hemorrhage that was not considered fatal in nature. His blood and urine alcohol levels were 244 mg% and 350 mg% respectively. In view of the blunt impact to the chest across the precordium, the heart findings, and the absence of any other fatal trauma, death was attributed to commotio cordis with alcohol intoxication as a contributory factor.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Establishing homicidal manner of death in commotio cordis can be a challenging process. Detailed scrutiny of event cimcumstances is paramount. When a postmortem examination shows evidence of blunt impact to the precordium in the absence of any other fatal injury or potentially fatal natural disease, the possibility of commotio cordis should be considered. Eyewitness account, if available, may also serve as an additional corroborative information.</p><p><bold>PP-785</bold></p><p><bold>Sudden death as the first manifestation of a myofibroblastic inflammatory tumor in a young male - case report</bold></p><p><underline>José Moura Fernandes</underline><sup>1</sup>, <underline>José Moura Fernandes</underline><sup>4</sup>, Liliana Santos<sup>1</sup>, Liliana Santos<sup>2</sup>, Liliana Santos<sup>4</sup>, Rogério Eisele<sup>4</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>1</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>2</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>3</sup>, Agostinho Santos<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>Health Sciences School of the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal</p><p><sup>4</sup>Forensic Sciences Center - CENCIFOR, Portugal</p><p>With no previous signs or symptoms, a 20 years old male had an episode of syncope at his home and was taken to a hospital emergency department of Porto.

Death was verified with an undetermined cause and, according to the Portuguese law, the body was taken to the National Institute of Legal Medicine (North Branch), so that the medico-legal autopsy could be performed.</p><p>In his previous medical history could only be found a bipolar disorder, diagnosed years before and controlled with lithium.</p><p>In the external necropsy exam the only findings were those that resulted from intervention of the medical assistance in the hospital - puncture lesions and thorax abrasions from defibrillator shocks. In the internal necropsy exam was found a retroperitoneal mass that measured 14 x 8 x 4 centimeters and surrounded the abdominal aorta, the inferior vena cava and the common iliac veins. The inferior vena cava diameter was straightened to a minimum of 0.5 centimeters and a mural thrombus comprising more than 90 % of its lumen could be observed. Additionally was found a similar mass in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 3 x 2 x 2.5 centimeters.</p><p>The anatomopathological exam revealed that the mass found in the retroperitoneum and in the kidney was a myofibroblastic inflammatory tumor. The inferior vena cava stenosis was confirmed and signs of flebitis with recent thrombosis in its lumen were diagnosed.</p><p>A peripheral blood toxicologic analysis only found lithium in a therapeutic level.</p><p>The association between the necropsy findings and the anatomopathological exam allowed the forensic pathologists to admit an acute cardiac failure in consequence of the reduction of pre-load caused by the inferior vena cava thrombosis in consequence of the myofibroblastic inflammatory tumor as the cause of death.</p><p>The myofibroblastic inflammatory tumor is considered a benign neoplasia of stromal origin but presented in this case with sudden death as the first manifestation.</p><p><bold>PP-786</bold></p><p><bold>Coronary Artery Dissection: A sudden death case</bold></p><p>Abdullah Avşar, <underline>Bahadır Kumral</underline>, Erenç Dokudan, Bülent Şam, Yalçın Büyük</p><p>Council of Forensic Medicine</p><p>Isolated coronary artery dissection may precipitate acute infarction and sudden death in adults.

Undiagnosed coronary artery disease raises the suspicion coronary vasospasm (eg.localized) or non occlussive luminal narrowing ( typically present in young adults. In the anatomopathological setting a consensus has long been reached as to the minimum grade of lesion compatible with SCD, and diagnostic criteria have been proposed for coronary artery disease. It is essential before the final medicolegal diagnosis, to not only study the myocardial morphology but to histologically of the coronary branches but to histologically analyse the myocardium of both ventricles by standard and targetting sampling of evident or suspicious lesions as well. CCN1 (CYR61) is a member of the CCNfamily of secreted matricellular proteins, it can regulate the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and tissue remodelling. The latter mechanism appears to be of vital importance in the pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We performed an immunohistochemical analysis on 62 cardiac tissue specimens deriving from individuals of young and middle age who had expired from SCD. A control group of 20 heart tissue samples, deriving from vehicle accident victims was stained beforehand with CCN1 antibody and all samples were CCN1 immunonegative. A statistical analysis was then performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CCN1 immunopositivity was detected in 80.6 % of all specimens. Semiquantitative statistical analysis of the staining results revealed that CCN1 immunonoreactivity was signifigantly associated with ischemic morphology and hypertrophy myocardial fibers, interstitial edema and atheromatosis of coronary arteries in more than 10 % of myocardial fibers.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Taking the above correlations into account ischemia appears to induce myocardial expression of CCN1. Therefore CCN1 immunostaining could be evaluated as a complementary tool in the assessment of ischemic areas when no tissue evidence of necrosis is available.</p><p><bold>PP-790</bold></p><p><bold>Sudden Pediatric Deaths (retrospective analyses of the years 2007–2010, in Adana)</bold></p><p><underline>Kenan Kaya</underline><sup>1</sup>, Ahmet Hilal<sup>1</sup>, Ebubekir Burak Çelik<sup>1</sup>, Necmi Çekin<sup>2</sup>, Mete K Gülmen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Çukurova University, Adana, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Adli Tıp Kurumu Adana Grup Başkanlığı, Adana, Turkey</p><p>Sudden deaths occurs within the 24 hours of onset of the symptoms and remains as undiagnosed.(WHO) Sudden death cases convey a challenging group as a means of detection of the cause of death.

The present work aimed to study the characteristic of victims of road traffic accidents, the pattern of their injuries and to determine the different risk factors of the accidents. It aimed also to study the role of alcohol and cannabis in the occurrence of such accidents and to assess the severity, prognosis and outcome of different injuries. The study was carried out on injured victims of road traffic accidents (RTAs) admitted to the Emergency Department of Alexandria Main University Hospital during the period from the first of January till the end of June 2008. The total number of injured victims included in the study was 1016 victims. The study showed that: victims of RTAs were more likely to be in the age group 10–30 years, Nearly three quarter of the victims were males. Pedestrians accounted for the majority of RTAs victims (66.8 %) while back seat occupants represented the highest number of occupants involved in car accidents (11.8 %). Drivers represented only 5.2 % of victims, the least numbers were among pedal cyclists (3.1 %).The commonest site of injury in all victims was the head and neck (94.5 %) followed by lower limb injuries (47.1 %). The majority of drivers (73.6 %) and only 26.9 % of front seat occupants were using seat belt at the time of accidents. The use of seat belt did not prevent head injury or chest injury in drivers. The use of helmet by motorcyclists proved to be highly protective against head injury. Nearly half of drivers showed positive results as regards the presence of cannabinoid in urine while none showed alcohol positive results. NISS was superior than GCS in predicting the outcome in severely injured and intubated patents while GCS is more reliable in predicting severity of head injury. The level of serum CK was more useful as a trauma marker in assessing severity and predicting the outcome of victims of RTAs than lactate. 9.7 % of the RTA victims died and 2.5 % developed infirmity. The highest number of deaths were among pedestrians &amp; back seat occupants. The victims who died were at extremes of age.

He was in close proximity to a ballast machine that is formed by a tamping unit and a lifting/lowering hydraulic cylinder that pack the track ballast under railway tracks. The operations are controlled from the control cabin by an operator. The Ballast Cleaning Machine carries-out deep screening of ballast, by cutter blades that dig out ballast from under and around the sleepers, and conveyor belt transfers it to the on-board cleaning equipment. The machine goes into reverse and the blades rotate counter-clockwise.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The victim was a 45-year-old man who was located to the left of BCM, near the cutter blades, checking the correct progress of operations wearing appropriate safety equipment (helmet, headset and reflective vest). He was probably bent near the chain when he was slipped due to the instability of the ground, being engaged on the helmet or on the jacket by the chain’s teeth and transported to the right arm of the BCM. Therefore the head was literally cut thorough the passage in the BCM, whose size (45 centimeters height and 40 centimeters wide) did not allow the passage of whole body.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The autopsy findings show the head and right forearm detached from the rest of the body.</p><p>The longitudinal diameter of the head was 28.5 centimeters and the diameter of the laceration at the base of the neck was 15x10 cm.</p><p>The laceration line passed through the high left lateral to the low right lateral and posterior part of the upper cervical region. Head and neck were covered with powdered material. The airway was severed at the trachea level. The laceration present in the cervical region had a longitudinal diameter of 21.5 centimeters and transverse diameter of 16 centimeters showing heart, part of lungs, trachea and neck vessels. Excoriated streaks and de-epithelialisation area were observed in whole body even if mainly in the dorsal region; these injuries were due to the action of sliding on the stones present in the binary. The helmet and the headset were broken.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the context of the risks associated to railway’s activity this case represents an unusual example of beheading by stripping of the head during a shift with heavy machine.

Drowsiness is one of the most important risk factors. In order to avoid it, some professional drivers use psychoactive drugs, which have serious side effects. This study analyzes the relationship between traffic accidents and use of amphetamines. We interviewed 216 truck drivers in Minas Gerais, Brazil, from August 2008 to July 2009. Of those interviewed, 47 % currently use or have used amphetamines. Of these, 75.8 % sleep less than 5 hours per day versus 39.1 % of non-users (p &lt; 0,0001) and 86,9 % drive more than 13 hours non-stop versus 66.2 % (p &lt; 0.0001) of non-users. Of those who use or have already used amphetamines, 50.9 % had been involved in traffic accidents versus 26.1 % of non-users (p = 0.002). The study revealed a strong association between amphetamine use and traffic accidents which are also associated with less hours of sleep and more driving hours.</p><p><bold>PP-802</bold></p><p><bold>The association effects of the use of Alcohol and Cell Phone in car drivers: 2010</bold></p><p><underline>Leandro Duarte De Carvalho</underline>, Frederico Hanaoka, Helaine Oliveira, Iara Magalhães, Kelly Silva, Maria Luiza Manna</p><p>Medical Sciences Faculty of Minas Gerais</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> This study aimed to analyze the physiological effects on drivers who associate alcohol and cell phone use while driving a motor vehicle.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Tests were performed simulating common transit situations. A track made of street cones was used to apply the test. Thirteen male volunteers drove a vehicle at increasing levels of alcohol (0 g / L, 0.2 g / L, 0.6 g / L and 1.0 g / L), combined with the use of mobile phones.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There was no change the number of cones knocked down by the volunteers comparing 0,6 g/L and 0,0 g/L (p &lt; 0,005). Comparing 0,6 g/L without phone usage and 0,2 g/L using the mobile phone were noticed an increase of 25 % mistakes in the last condition (p &lt; 0,005). While comparing the situation in which there is 0.9 g / L of alcohol without the use of cell phone and the situation in which there is 0.0 g / L of alcohol in the blood and cell phone usage, it was noticed an increase of 116.6 % of cones down (p &lt; 0,005).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There is not a reliable parameter for the use of alcohol when driving. In a concentration lower than 0.6 g / L, the use of cell phone can cause more accidents than alcohol alone. However, when this value is exceeded, the alcohol becomes a major cause of accidents. These accidents risk is increased when there is an association of these two variables.</p><p><bold>PP-803</bold></p><p><bold>Characteristics Of Traffic Accidents In Aydin Between The Years 2005–2011</bold></p><p><underline>Musa Dirlik</underline>, Başak Çakır, Tülay Elbek, Bedir Korkmaz, Füsun Çallak Kallem, Berk Gün, Ufuk Katkıcı</p><p>Department of Forensic Medicine, Adnan Menderes University, Faculty Of Medicine, Aydin, Turkey</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Traffic injuries come first in rank among all injury-related deaths all around the world.

Traffic accidents take place with a significant proportion in the studies investigating the causes of geriatric patients admitted to the emergency departments. Objective of this study was to evaluate the geriatric cases presented to the emergency department due to injuries caused by traffic accidents.</p><p><bold>Material-methods:</bold> In this study, 118 patients aged over 65 who presented to the emergency department (ED) of Ankara Atatürk Training and Research Hospital between 01/01/2010 and 01/01/2011 due to traffic accidents were enrolled. Sociodemographic data as well as the diagnosis and treatment courses of these patients were studied.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of total 469 cases of traffic accidents presented to ED, 118 (25.2 %) were in the geriatric age group. These patients aged between 65 and 108 with a mean age of 74.3. Forty-four (37.3 %) of these were female and 78 (62.7 %) male patients. According to the type of accidents; 65 (55.1 %) cases were defined to be injuried due to in car accidents and 53 (44.9 %) were pedestrian accidents. External injuries were found in 88 (74.6 %) of the cases.The most common consultation was asked from the neurosurgery department with 42 (35.6 %) cases. Radiological examination was needed in 114 (96.6) cases; radiologic pathology was identified in 59 (50 %) of the patients. Of the patients, 32 (27.1 %) were hospitalized. In these patients, the mean hospital stay duration was found as 10.7 days (min:2, max:58). These patients were most frequently hospitalized in the orthopedic clinic. Of the patients, 17 were underwent a surgical intervention, while surgical intervention was not needed in 101. Two of the cases were seen to be dead on arrival and 5 died after the diagnosis and treatment.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Traffic accidents are responsible for higher morbidity and mortality in geriatric age group because of the inability to deal with consequences of traumas.

The prosecutors sent a total of 100 cases for autopsy during that period. Of theses cases, 87 were males, 13 females, with the peak age of 20–29 years (n = 20). The peak year for these events was 2008 (n = 22). When the legal paperwork sent by the prosecutors for the autopsies were evaluated, the information was inadequate and inconsistent: Based on the witness`s statements, 11 deaths were related to suicide, 7 related to fall from a train, and 2 related to electrical injuries. However, the origin of death hadn’t been able to be identified in the rest of the cases (n = 80). When the degree of trauma is considered, the findings were as follows: fragmented intensely causing the loss of body integrity in 3, skull fractures in 67, skull/rib/vertebrae fractures in 29, upper and lower extremity and pelvis fractures in 16, upper extremity amputations in 7, lower extremity amputations in 13, amputations of both lower and upper extremities in 2, great artery lacerations in 28, thorax organ injuries in 67, abdominal organ injuries in 57, both thorax and abdominal injuries in 79, and brain hemorrhages in 74. In 44 of 74 cases with the brain hemorrhage, brain tissue contusion was present, and brain tissue changes could not be assessed due to putrification in one case.</p><p>Railroads increased significantly in Turkey within the last 10 years and reached a total length of 11940 km in 2012.

An important question in the analysis of the victims of traffic accidents, for example in collisions between motor vehicles and pedestrians or cyclists, is the situation of the impact. Apart from forensic medical examinations (external examination and autopsy), three-dimensional technologies and methods are gaining importances in forensic investigations. There are few models constructed for analyzing &amp; reconstructing traffic accidents.</p><p>One of these models is the Total Human Model for Safety version 4 "THUMS 4". Toyota Motor Corporation and Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs partnered to develop THUMS virtual model. This virtual model used to simulate the injuries sustained in actual car crashes. As a result, the model is able to detect and predict the most common injuries reported in accident data analysis.</p><p><bold>Aim of work:</bold> Evaluate &amp; asses if the THUMS version 4 model represents the 50th % German male with its different age group via calculating the measurements of thorax (height Lt. &amp; Rt., depth, &amp; width) with the same measurements obtained from Postmortem computed tomography "pm CT" images using Osirix software.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> This study was conducted on 98 male cadavers, with ages between 20 yrs and 89 yrs. These age groups were divided into 3 age groups. The measurements parameters include the thorax height lt. &amp; rt., thorax width &amp; thorax depth. This study is carried out in 4 steps:</p><p>1. Obtaining the pm CT images from the cadavers.</p><p>2. Measuring thorax parameters in the CT images using the Osirix software.</p><p>3. Calculating the human models' measurements.</p><p>4. Comparing the CT measurements to those of the THUMS 4 model.</p><p><bold>Results &amp; conclusion:</bold> Comparing the measurements and parameters of the pm CT of the cadavers' thorax, preliminary analysis shows that the THUMS 4 failed to represent the different age groups equally. Regarding the thorax depth parameter, the THUMS4 model represents age group (3) by only 76 %, while it represents age group (2) by only 78 %, and it represents age group (1) by 91 %.</p><p>There is a clear discrepancy in the representation of the 3 different age groups. The THUMS version 4 does not equally represent the thorax anthropometric measurements of the 3 different age groups; therefore it will not be accurate in simulating thorax injuries.</p><p><bold>PP-807</bold></p><p><bold>Individualized forensic human 3d modelling based on ct scans</bold></p><p><underline>Sherif Mohamed El Mahdy</underline><sup>1</sup>, Stefanie Lochner<sup>2</sup>, Steffen Peldschus<sup>3</sup>, Dina Ali Shokry<sup>1</sup>, Sonja Kirchhoff<sup>4</sup>, Florian Fischer<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany</p><p><sup>3</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Biomechanics speciality, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany</p><p><sup>4</sup>Department of ٌRadiology, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Crash test dummies continue to be the accepted standard test device across the auto industry for evaluating the severity of an impact to vehicle occupants and pedestrians in a car crash. But while traditional dummies can measure the force and acceleration that is applied to a body during a crash, they cannot simulate the tissue injuries that result from these impacts. Therefore the need for Computer generated 3D models has strongly emerged in the past few years.</p><p><bold>Aim of work:</bold> This study is mainly concerned with the analysis and comparison between the measurements of the pelvis and lower limbs of the existing 3d models (HUMOS and THUMS) and the measurements acquired form the post mortem CT images, as well as and the European anthropometric standards, in order to illustrate how accurate do these human models represent the existing European population, and whether these models are adequate or not, and is there a need for additional ones.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> 102 cadavers (35 females &amp; 67 males) with ages between 20 and 60 years were transferred to the Radiological department, and one of two CT Devices (Philips Brilliance CT 64-channel or GE discovery CT 750 HD) is used to scan the cadaver in multiple series of images using either 0.6 or 1.25 slice thickness scan. These images are then imported into the OSIRIX database, and used to obtain biomechanical parameters, which in turn are statistically analyzed and compared to those of the human 3D models to compare the validity of these models in representing the different age groups of the European population.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> Initial analysis of the acquired post mortem data and those of the HUMOS female 3D model clearly illustrated a significant variability in the accuracy of different parameters representation by the model. The model represents the female pelvic width by only 66.1 % compared to the actual PM CT measurements, whereas the pelvic width is represented by 94.4 %, and pelvic depth by 98.5 %. The HUMOS male model represents the male pelvic width by 96.9 %, the pelvic width by 91.3 %, and pelvic depth by 89.5 %.</p><p>Conclusively not all the biomechanical parameters are accurately represented by the model, as some parameters are more accurately represented than others. This discrepancy may in turn have a drastic impact on the biomechanical properties of the model when used in different simulation scenarios.</p><p><bold>PP-808</bold></p><p><bold>Difficulties and Scientific Limits Reconstructing Road Fatalities</bold></p><p><underline>Maria Madentzoglou</underline>, Katerina Kanaki, Despina Nathena, Andreas Kontogiannis, Manolis Michalodimitrakis</p><p>Department of Forensic Sciences, Medical School, University of Crete - 71110, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.</p><p>Pathologists are frequently called upon to assist in reconstructing fatal traffic accidents by correlating autopsy findings with roadside evidence. Most of the injuries pertinent to a postmortem traffic accident reconstruction are found on the body surface. Generally in a traffic accident, a pattern may constitute a predictable distribution of injuries that is indicative of a specific mechanism by which these injuries were occurred. The following types of victims are recognized: pedestrian, driver/passenger, and motorcyclist.</p><p>As far as pedestrian injuries are concerned they may be sustained in one of four following ways: the pedestrian could be struck by the front of the car, sideswiped by the car, injured when the car backed up or struck by two or more vehicles. Questions that will be raised are: was the pedestrian walking, standing or lying in the road; what was the direction of travel of the vehicle; were the brakes being applied at the time of impact; did the driver see the pedestrian prior to the collision? The answer to these questions is based on the distribution of the injuries and especially estimation of bumper injuries. Last but not least the evidence of damage to the automobile and the presence of skin, hair or blood on it are crucial in traffic accidents reconstruction.</p><p>During investigation of a motor vehicle accident involving the driver or passengers, injuries caused by specific car gadgets may assist in reconstructing the accident and separate the driver from the passenger. So, there are “Dicing” injuries of caused by small pieces of glass of the door windows, dashboard injuries and injuries caused by the use of seat belts. There are also injuries caused by windshield impact and characteristic imprints found on the driver caused by the steering wheel or steering column and gas or brake pedals.</p><p>Concerning injuries of motorcyclists, for obvious reasons they are usually more extensive and more severe than those sustained by occupants of automobiles. In a major collision a helmet or leather clothes provide little protection. Whereas, “brush burns” on the body surface may be reduced by such clothes, internal injuries and fractures are very common. They are observed specific fractures of the skull and “whiplash” injuries of the neck due to sudden deceleration in such accidents.</p><p>Both automobile collisions and motorcycle accidents are often related to alcohol consumption and so toxicological analysis enlightens the traffic accident reconstruction in each case.</p><p><bold><underline>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-809</bold></p><p><bold>Assessment Of Reproductive Behavior And Women’s Compatibility In Unwanted Pregnancy In Mashad</bold></p><p><underline>Lida Jarahi</underline></p><p>Department of community medicine, mashad faculty of medicine, university of medical sciences, iran</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In Iran significant percentage of pregnancies are unintended or unwanted. In women faced with unwanted pregnancy, lack of satisfaction is created low quality of life and more concern and anxiety therefore they are in high risk to risky behaviors and psychological effects. Proper interventions for prevention of unintended pregnancies is positive step for maternal and child health promotion. Reproductive behavior in unintended pregnancies can be a guide to prevent this occurrence.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Population study was 400 women referring to maternities wards of Mashhad hospitals.

Mean age of them were 22 years (range 42–16), in unwanted pregnancies mean age of current gestational was 1.9 years and mean age at first pregnancy was 2.2 years more than compare of those in wanted pregnancies, the average age of marriage 1.2 years less than and the average number of children was 1.1 higher than other group. Withdrawal was important factor in unwanted pregnancies. About compatibility and satisfaction at the end of pregnancy 83 % of women who had unplanned pregnancy still were dissatisfied.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Different reproductive behaviors were seen in unwanted pregnancies. Women's awareness about the high failure rate of withdrawal method is an effective measure in reducing unwanted pregnancies. Because of the high prevalence of unwanted pregnancy in the community and these effects of pregnancy on maternal mental health, emphasizing the use of screening tools for detection of psychological problems, counseling and psychological support of women in conjunction usual care during pregnancy and postpartum is necessary.</p><p><bold>PP-810</bold></p><p><bold>Abortion And Unwanted Pregnancy In Concubine Women Tehran, Iran</bold></p><p><underline>Lida Jarahi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Fatemeh Hamedanian<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mashad Faculty of Medicine, University of Medical Sciences, Iran</p><p><sup>2</sup> M.A of women’s studies, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Concubine is a kind of marriage in Iran legislative system has accepted it as a legitimate marriage.

This perceived dishonor is normally the result of (a) utilizing dress codes unacceptable to the family (b) wanting out of an arranged marriage or choosing to marry by own choice, (c) engaging in certain sexual acts or (d) engaging in relations with the same sex. These killings result from the perception that defense of honor justifies killing a person whose behavior dishonors their clan or family.1 Honor killings have been reported from antiquity from all over the world, however the recent past has shown an alarming and disturbing resurgence of this inhuman deed. I present a typical case related to honour killing in the Indian context: a dual homicide of two lovers who were killed in the name of preserving family honor and hanged after death together by the entire village.

Most women have closer and more frequent contact with health services during pregnancy. This period therefore provides a unique opportunity to identify violence against women, implement interventions against this phenomenon and prevent it. Moreover, pregnancy is a period with particular characteristics, since the consequences of violence not only affect women but also the babies they are expecting. The aim of this study was to detect gender-based violence during pregnancy in women who give birth in public hospitals in Andalusia, Spain, using two validated instruments: the Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS) and the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA).</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We developed a cross-sectional study whose population consisted of women who were going to give birth in public hospitals. After calculating the sample size and the type of sampling for each cluster according to the type of hospital, the study population was composed of 750 women who were supposed to give birth in 15 different hospitals. Violence was detected using two questionnaires: the Abuse Assessment Screen and the Index of Spouse Abuse. Data were collected by midwives previously trained for this purpose. Total anonymity and confidentiality were guaranteed throughout the process. The analysis yielded data on the prevalence of violence against women during pregnancy and the prevalence of various types of violence with 95 % confidence intervals.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> According to the AAS questionnaire, the prevalence of violence against women during pregnancy was 7.7 %. Among the various types of violence detected by this questionnaire, the most frequent was emotional violence (4.8 %), followed by physical violence (1.6 %) and sexual violence (0.5 %). In contrast, the ISA yielded a prevalence of 21.3 % for general violence against women during pregnancy, 20.9 % for non-physical violence and 3.6 % for physical violence (Table 1).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Gender-based violence during pregnancy is a shameful reality suffered by women. It is necessary to detect it to establish mechanisms for the intervention of medical and forensic teams. The analysis of the questionnaires showed that the ISA detected a higher prevalence of violence against women during pregnancy than the AAS questionnaire, both regarding violence in general and the different types of violence analyzed.</p><p><bold>PP-813</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of Partner Violence Against Women</bold></p><p>Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Erdoğan Kara</underline><sup>1</sup>, Harun Akkaya<sup>1</sup>, Emine Sezer<sup>2</sup>, Yiğit Sezer<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 2nd Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p>Domestic violence is a general definition that includes the whole family members, but often comes to mind with intimate violence against women. World Health Organization described "Violence Against Women," as a health issue. Women's physical, sexual, emotional or economic violence, are dealt with primarily as a health issue and protection of victimized women and elimination of this scourge need legal sanctions. Medical expert opinion is needed in the detection and reporting of physical and mental abuse during the legal sanctions applied. In the study, thirty victimized women cases which were asked for medical expert opinion to 2nd Specialization Board of the Council of Forensic Medicine during legal procedures,between July 2011-March 2012,were included. Informed consent were obtained from all cases. Interviewing with the help of a questionnaire and contribution of socio-demographic characteristics to the violence were aimed to be determined. The majority of the cases were in 26–30 years age group (n = 9). 14 of all cases were housewives,and 16 of all have a job and an individual income. When marriage history was questioned, 17 of them got married with the approval of their family; 11 of 17 cases made a prearranged marriage. In 5 of 13 cases, who married without the consent of their parents eloped to be able to get married. Approximately for half of the cases (n = 14), violence started in the first month of marriage. In 6 cases, violence began after 10 years. Alcoholism was the main factor underlying the problems shown in 17 cases. 11 cases were reported to receive medical assistance after the violence, while 19 of them were reported not to receive medical help. This study was designed as a pilot study with a limited number of people to evaluate multi-dimensional factors that give rise to violence and presented to determine deficiencies for further extensive studies.</p><p><bold>PP-814</bold></p><p><bold>Murder by the partner</bold></p><p>Felice Francesco Carabellese<sup>1</sup>, Donatella La Tegola<sup>2</sup>, Manuela Tamma<sup>3</sup>, Chiara Candelli<sup>4</sup>, <underline>Gabriele Rocca</underline><sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> F.

Rocca, MD, Section of Criminology and Forensic Psychiatry, DISSAL, University of Genova, Via De Toni 5, 16132</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> EURES-ANSA (2007) data reveal that in Italy murder by the partner accounts for 16.7 % of all murders in which the perpetrator is known, and 52.8 % of murders within the family. The victim of murder in the family is mostly the woman (70 %), and almost always the woman when the perpetrator is the partner or ex-partner (94 % of cases). A similar situation applies in the USA, where the percentage of women victims of murder by the partner or ex-partner is again 70 %, although in the USA the woman is not always the victim but can also be the perpetrator (in about 1/3 of cases). Even after a separation, agressive behavior by the ex-partner continues to occur in the form of stalking. The ISTAT (2007) data underline that in about 50 % of cases harassment of the woman is perpatrated by her ex-partner after the end of an intimate relationship. These data are confirmed by the USA data.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In Italy, in such cases of murder in the family a forensic psychiatry expert investigation of the perpetrator is often commissioned, assuming that the crime could be induced by a mental disorder. In Italy, the Penal Code specifies that a judgment of abolished or diminished responsibility due to mental disease can be made only if a correlation between the crime and the disease can be demonstrated and if the disease was in course at the time of the crime.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In our experience the mental disease alone is not sufficient to explain the phenomenon of violent attacks on women. In all the cases we have investigated it was the man who murdered his woman partner, and in no case was the mental condition so severe as to exclude or diminish the perpetrator’s responsibility for the crime. The EURES-ANSA data confirm this point, since in the population investigated only in about 11 % of murders by the partner was mental disease the key factor in bringing about the crime.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We believe that the forensic psychiatric assessment must not be focused only on ascertaining the presence of mental disease but must also reconstruct the entire history of the relationship between the couple, as well as the social and cultural factors constituting the setting within which the crime was committed. All these factors can often clarify episodes of violence, and this may even tend to reduce to some extent the murderer’s degree of penal responsibility.</p><p><bold>PP-815</bold></p><p><bold>Intimate partner violence against women: a medico-legal and criminal approach</bold></p><p>Fernando Vázquez Portomeñe<sup>1</sup>, Antía Regueira<sup>2</sup>, Gumersindo Guinarte<sup>1</sup>, Lucía Ordóñez<sup>2</sup>, Natalia Pérez<sup>3</sup>, Maria Teresa Fernández<sup>4</sup>, Luis Concheiro<sup>2</sup>, <underline>José Ignacio Muñoz Barús</underline><sup>2</sup>, María Sol Rodríguez Calvo<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute of Criminology.

The purpose of this work was to analyse the characteristics of intimate partner violence from the medico-legal and criminal perspectives.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> Files classified as gender violence from the prosecutor office of Santiago de Compostela (Galicia, NW Spain) were examined and analysed. The clinical histories of victims were also studied. A descriptive statistical analysis, testing the possible association of variables was carried out with the statistical package SPSS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Demographic and clinical data: Most victims were young adult women, of Spanish origin, married or divorced, with children and living in an urban population, belonging to a middle-low socioeconomic level. The aggressor was frequently a Spanish young adult with a component of violent personality and some type of substance addiction. Assaults usually occurred at night, during the weekends, and mainly took place at home. Many victims had chronic pain and sexual/reproductive problems such as menstrual disfunction, sexually transmited diseases and abortions. Depression was the most prevalent mental disorder.</p><p>Medico-legal data: Proven facts and forensic reports showed that women suffered psychological and physical aggressions. Most injuries were superficial, needing scarce days for recovery and no hospitalization, corresponding to minor assaults.</p><p><bold>Legal and criminal data:</bold> This study showed the hegemonic role that victims play in the legal process and the remarkable higher incidence of minor offences. Even though the majority of the examined cases ended in conviction, the number of those with a not guilty verdict was considerable. Victim right to not testify seemed to be a relevant factor in order to explain the rationale of these verdicts. Occasional maltreatment was the main crime in which the gender-based violence translated. We must emphasize the remarkable incidence that the mitigating circumstance of substance addiction had in the files analyzed.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Abused women presented in different health care settings with diverse physical and mental health problems and demographic characteristics, although Spanish women, of middle–low socioeconomic level, were the most prevalent. Victims suffered from physical and psychological abuse, but most of the assaults were minor. The victim played a fundamental role both in the initiation and ending of criminal proceedings, which in most cases were considered as occasional maltreatment.</p><p><bold>PP-816</bold></p><p><bold>The analysis of violence against the nurses who in employee status in Mugla State Hospital, Turkey</bold></p><p><underline>Metin Picakciefe</underline><sup>1</sup>, Sema Akca<sup>2</sup>, Ayse Elibol<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Mugla University, Mugla, Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>School of Health Sciences, University of Mugla, Turkey</p><p><bold>Abstract:</bold> Workplace violence in the country, especially in the health system remains obscure. The search of the relationship using an intersectional, analytical survey between the working conditions and violence exposure of the nurses who work in Muğla State Hospital was aimed in the study. Of the 310, 268 nurses participated, yielding a response rate of 86.5 %. The data was examined by using Fisher’s Exact Test, Pearson Chi-Square Test and Logistic Regression. In result, it was found that 85.8 % of the nurses were exposed to violence, with 70.4 % of the violence coming from the relatives of patients. 77.2 % of the nurses were exposed to verbal abuse while 71.4 % were physically assaulted. Unfortunately, 98.4 % of the abused did not report the physical abuse. 91.3 % of the nurses always felt violence anxiety, while 92.9 % of them thought that their instutions do not make an effort for the security systems. According to logistic regression analysis, 21 years and over working time, night work and felt encounter violence in the workplace, significantly increases the frequency of meeting with violence of nurses. In conclusion we found that the nurses were exposed to multiple forms of violence. This was correlated with their monthly average income, marrital status, parental status, work status, night shifts, overtime, rotational shifts, total and daily work hours.</p><p><bold>PP-817</bold></p><p><bold>Fatal intimate partner violence against women in Portugal</bold></p><p>Ana Rita Pereira<sup>1,2</sup>, Duarte Nuno Vieira<sup>1,2,3</sup>, <underline>Teresa Magalhães</underline><sup>1,2,4,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><sup>2</sup>Forensic Sciences Center - CENCIFOR, Portugal</p><p><sup>3</sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><sup>4</sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Portugal</p><p><sup>5</sup>Biomedical Sciences Institute "Abel Salazar", University of Porto, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important cause of women´s health and socio-familial problems, being the most extreme one the victim’s killing.

IPV-related cases (perpetrated by current or former men-intimate partners) were selected after reviewing the correspondingly judicial decisions and analyzed according to the victim and perpetrator’s profiles, characteristics of the victim-perpetrator intimate relationship, characteristics of the circumstances surrounding the death, autopsy findings and legal case progression and judicial outcomes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The main findings of this study were: (1) at least 62 women were killed by current or former men-intimate partners, corresponding to an IPV-related female mortality rate of 0.44 per 100.000 women over 15 years-old; (2) fatal IPV constitutes 13 % of forensic autopsies and 61 % of women’s homicide cases; (3) the typical Portuguese victim is a young adult woman, employed, killed by a current husband in a long-term relationship, usually with offspring in common and often with a history of previous IPV (79 %); (4) the typical Portuguese perpetrator is a man, older than the victim, employed, usually with a history of substances abuse and psychiatric problems, owning a firearm and without criminal records; (5) most fatal events took place in the summer, during the weekend and in homes shared by the victim and perpetrator; (6) half of the perpetrators attempted or committed suicide afterwards; (7) most women were killed by gunshot trauma (45 %), especially in the thorax (49 %), with multiple fatal injuries (55 %) and 57 % also presented non-fatal IPV-related injuries (73 % defense wounds), particularly due to blunt trauma (63 %); (8) from the known cases, 75 % of the victims have presented previous denouncements of IPV; (9) perpetrators, who did not die, were prosecuted and convicted of murder in almost all cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The prevalence of fatal-IPV among women´s homicides is very high. Most of the results are similar to other series. The detection of prior IPV and the risk evaluation is fundamental to decrease fatal outcomes.

These are related not only with physical damage but also with other cultural and emotional aspects that justify the submission, resignation and silence of the victim towards this kind of victimization. Thus, it is fundamental to improve our knowledge of these aspects, namely in Portugal, where most of the studies are retrospective.</p><p>A prospective study, based on a randomized sample of alleged female victims of IPV, was conducted during 2011 at the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine of Portugal (INML) - n = 300. It was based on the results of the interviews held by a social worker and the physical evaluation carried out by a forensic doctor. Data was always collected with the victim’s consent. The study focused on characterizing the victim, the alleged offender and any children, the previous abuse, and the specific episode of violence which lead the victim to ultimately present their claim.</p><p>Selected cases represent 23.6 % of all the cases observed during 2011.The victim’s mean age was 39.9 years, whereas the alleged offender’s was 42.3 years. Victims reported a history of: (1) abuse during childhood or adolescence (19.3 %); (2) economic dependence upon the offender (14.3 %); (3) substance abuse by the offender (69.3 %); (4) repeated abuses by the same partner (98.3 %); (5) abuse lasting more than 5 years (52.7 %); (6) child exposure to IPV (42.6 %); (7) previous psychiatric disorders (45.7 %); (8) physical abuse (100 %) - punching 42.3 % - and sexual abuse (11 %). In 29 % of the cases the victim required health care as a result of the abuse. In most cases the resulting injuries were ecchymosis (51.0 %) and abrasions (23.3 %); in 2.7 % resulted physical permanent consequences.</p><p>This study allowed for the characterization of IPV in the North of Portugal which is important to orientate the implementation of prevention strategies and to improve the capacity and awareness of the professionals who work with these victims, regarding the detection of the cases and subsequent reports. The forensic medical evaluation is more complex in these cases than in other “common” assaults due to their specific context and to the vulnerability and dependence (mainly emotional) of the victim upon the offender; this fact hampers the possibility of collecting empirical evidence thus requiring a special level of skill and time by the forensic doctor.</p><p><bold>PP-820</bold></p><p><bold>Interpartner violence against women.

Despite the positive evolution in the understanding of this phenomenon occurred in the last few years, there are still cognitive and cultural factors, consisting in myths and stereotypes about women’s role in society, family and inside the intimate relationship, that have strong influence in its maintenance. Indeed, they often lead them to stay in the abusive relationship and contribute highly to IPV staying unreported.</p><p>The main goal of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of women victims of IPV by characterizing both cognitive and cultural factors that influence their perception and reaction to this violence, considering their evolution in the latest 5 years, in Portugal.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> This study took place in the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine, Portugal, in 2005 and 2010, using, respectively, a sample of 126 and 161 women, victims of IPV, aged 18 or older, using a questionnaire oriented interview technique.

Experts recommend the use of clinical scales for predicting serious risk in the relationship. Risk assessment can be made urgently (within 72 h) or programmatically (for review of security measures already taken). Recently in Spain is being used for risk assessment “Severe Intimate Partner Violence Risk Prediction Scale (EPV-R)” that includes personal data of the victim or aggressor, status of relationship in the past 6 months, type of violence in the past 6 months, profile of the aggressor and the victim's vulnerability. The risk assessment urgent is done at a particular time, so the risk may vary according to the circumstances of the offender and the victim's vulnerability. The aim of this study is evaluate the risk in cases of intimate partner violence. The sample for this study consisted of 50 female who had complained to her partner. Mean age was 34.9 years (range: 18–80), 20.4 % with secondary studies and 4.1 % university. Mean years of relationship with your partner is 10.6 (range: 1–50), the mean number of complaints is 1.1 (range: 1–5).

Data concerning age, profession, educational status, civil status, cause of death, ways of killing, location and number of lesions and profiles of the victims were retrieved from autopsy reports. Court files of 79 cases out of 141 could be accessed. Expetrators of 3 homicides could not be evaluated, because they were acquitted due to lack of evidence or their disappearance. The remaining 76 executers of female murders were evaluated. A total of 96 perpetrators of 76 cases of female murders were analyzed. From the data obtained about gender, age, profession, educational and marital status, criminal records, perpetrator’s degree of intimacy to the victim, crime site, the probability of spouse crime and motives for committing crime related to the suspect profiles of the expetrators were delineated.

Only 2 women were of foreign nationality. Spouse murders were the predominant finding in our investigation which were responsible for most (33 %) of the female murders, and 48.1 % of the spouse murders occurred in the home of the victim.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our country, these crimes have been committed mostly using firearms like the cases in many other countries. As owning a firearm is a risk factor for femicide, just like for all criminal acts, we think restricting the firearms can reduce femicides.</p><p>We think that spouse murders, which constitute an important portion of femicides, are committed based on concepts of chastity, and fear of being abandoned are related to the personal immaturity, rather than developmental status of a nation.

The statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 16.0 Packet Program.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In our study, the autopsy was performed in 66 female suicidal cases. The age distribution was as follows: 9 cases (13,6 %) were in 15 and under years old group whereas 30 cases (45,5 %) were in 16–20; 9 cases (13,6 %) were in 21–25; 7 cases (10,7 %) were in 26–30; 6 cases (9,1 %) were in 31–35; 1 case (1,5 %) was in 36–40; 2 cases (3,0 %) were in 41–45; 1 case (1,5 %) was in 46–50; and 1 case (1,5 %) was in over-50 years old age groups. It was remarkable that 9 of the cases were below the age of 15. Suicide methods were as follows: hanging in 44 cases (66,7 %), firearm injury in 18 cases (27,3 %), insecticide intoxication in 3 cases (4,5 %), and jumping from height in 1 case (1,5 %). The scene of the incident was a house in 39 cases (59,1 %).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to the literature, the complete suicide is more frequent in males compared to the females. However, different results can be obtained from the various regions. Cultural suppression of females and prevention of their socialization in enclave societies are the risk factors for female suicides. Therefore, the female suicide attempts and recurring attempts should be prevented with psychiatric scanning, follow-ups and therapy for high-risk individuals and also by education. Besides, differential attitude of the prosecutor and the forensic medicine specialist between suicide and murder is also very important since in eastern parts of Turkey it’s frequently heard that honour murders can be being hushed up in fake ‘suicide’ crime scenes.</p><p><bold>PP-824</bold></p><p><bold>The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women’s Mental Health: Depression</bold></p><p><underline>Fatma Dilek Gürbüz</underline><sup>1</sup>, Alev Aktaş<sup>1</sup>, Demet Havaçeliği<sup>1</sup>, Nevin Yıldırım Koyuncu<sup>2</sup>, Hakan Coşkunol<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ege University, Institute on Drug Abuse, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (BATI), İzmir/Turkey</p><p><sup>2</sup>Ege University, Women Research and Implementation Center (EKAM), İzmir/Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> This study aims to investigate the type, prevalence and causes of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women receiving sheltering services in Izmir.

Detection of the semen is important both for proving the alleged assault incident and determination of the identity of the abuser. In this study, we present a case with medicolegal aspects of a female who had been forced to anal intercourse by her husband without her consent. On her first litigation, real evidence could not be reached and she had presented again with the same complaint 3 days later.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> A 31-year-old female patient admitted to the department of forensic medicine, claiming that she had sexually assaulted by her husband. The patient stated that she had been forced to anal intercourse once or twice a month by him for 15 years. She reported severe pain and occasionally suffered anal bleeding following the intercourse. She stated that lubricant was used during the intercourse. On the physical examination, evidence was found indicating sexual assault. No sperm was detected in the collected anal swab samples. The victim was informed that she should apply immediately after the incident.</p><p>On the second examination; three days later the patient again applied with the claim of sexual assault by her husband in the same way. The patient stated that he had forced her to anal intercourse. On the examination, fresh lacerations with bleeding ground were detected at the level of 11 and 12 o’clock quadrant. No scars, ecchymosis and erasing of the mucosal pilus were observed. Anal sphincter tonus was normal. There was no evidence of chronic anal penetration. A number of sperm were reported in the anal swab samples collected from the patient.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Collecting of the real evidence after a sexual assault is of high importance in forensic investigations. No real evidence was found on the first examination of our patient. However, sperm was observed in anal swabs obtained in the second examination. Awareness of the victim is crucial for collecting of the real evidence following a sexual assault. In addition; police, social service specialist and the other related persons to get informed about management of the cases in the pre-examination period will be useful for collecting of the real evidence.</p><p><bold><underline>WOUNDS</underline></bold></p><p><bold>PP-827</bold></p><p><bold>Bite of wild DONKEY in an Occupacional Accident occurred in Mato Grosso Pantanal - BRAZIL</bold></p><p><underline>Manoel Campos Neto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Vidal Haddad Júnior<sup>2</sup>, Caroline A.

In February 2011, the victim was carrying cattle on an unpaved road between the towns of the Comodoro and Jaurú (MT-Brazil). During rest stops, he and his brother would tame some of the wild donkeys who were transported with the cattle. In one of these intervals, he tried to secure a rope connected to the brake animal's mouth and he was bitten on his left hand. As a defense mechanism, he was quickly pulled his hand and his thumb was blown off. Feeling intense pain, the victim and her brother made a dressing with a piece of shirt and sought medical help, taking care to get the amputated toe. The patient was observed more than ten hours after the accident, he showed the thumb amputated with the base crushed with fragments of muscle tissue and tendons, exposure of the proximal phalanx, with comminuted fracture, and cyanosis. The extensive degree of destruction, ruled out the possibility of implant. The muscular structures, vascular and nerve were exposed and lacerated. There were heavy bleeding and contamination by fragments of grass and clay. The radiographic study revealed fracture at the middle 1 / 3 of the 1st-proximal phalanx of the left thumb. The anesthetic block did not work, and general anesthesia was performed. After copious washing with soap and Povidine, in the hand and forearm a pneumatic tourniquet was applied. We performed excision of devitalized tissue and identification of anatomical structures (vessels, nerves, tendons, ligaments and skin). We were forced to higher bone section. The skin flap pedicle has worked biological dressing. We conduct internal sutures with Vicryl 3–0 to cover the injury. Without the tourniquet, hemostasis accomplished. Penrose drains placed and made the cover and close wounds. We made small incisions, thereby targeting the spontaneous, facilitating adherence of the graft during healing (photos). At the end we put compressive occlusive dressing.</p><p><bold>Postoperative:</bold> prescribing preventive (routine in our hospital): antibiotic (Cephalothin + Gentamicin); anti-inflammatory; analgesics; gastroprotective medication; anti-tetanus serum + specific instructions.

Accidents are rare but can happen when the animal is attacked or cornered.</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> AS, male, 65 years-old, victim of unprovoked attack caused by a tapir (Tapirus terrestris) on August 13, 2010. The patient was treated in the Department of Trauma and Emergency Hospital Regional de Cáceres - MT and said that "around 13:00 pm. I was working in a plantation at Santa Ediviges farm in Cáceres-MT, when passing the sickle at the base of a clump of grass, was attacked by an adult tapir who left the bush and bit his right wrist. The patient started scream for help, and the animal dropped his arm, chased by dogs on the farm, being rescued and taken to the Hospital by his own boss. DESCRIPTION OF INJURIES: the victim was admitted on August 13, 2010 at 17:30 pm and is observed by an orthopedist and after x-ray was taken immediately to Surgical Center and operated in an emergency. Radiographs (see photo) showed comminuted fracture of the distal 1 / 3 of the right forearm, associated with bone exposure. At external examination there were multiple soft tissue injuries (lacerations of skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscles). FINAL PRE-SURGICAL DIAGNOSIS: FRACTURE comminuted exposed (Grade III) of the distal third of right forearm, with exposed bone, caused by a tapir´s bite (Medical Records 25449). SURGICAL REPORT: ANESTHESIA: Brachial Plexus Block associated with axillary block. Asepsis, removal of devitalized tissue, hemostasis, alignment and reduction of fractured bone fragments, percutaneous fixation with Steimann wires (steel), sutures by planes, occlusive dressings and splint sleeve type.

The few reports point to the fact that most attacks are caused by lack of care when approaching these animals or provocation. This is especially true for species Caiman yacare (Pantanal alligator) and Caiman latirostris (broad nose alligator). However, there are large Amazonian species that can attack humans for predation, such as the black caiman (Melanosuchus niger).</p><p><bold>Case:</bold> N.P.V., male, 61 years. In November 2011, after cleaning fish, the fisherman was attacked by an Pantanal alligator of about 1.50 m long, which left the weeds beside him and bit his right hand. With heavy bleeding and severe pain, the victim washed the wounds with water and sutured the wounds with sewing thread. Three days after the patient had chills and pain with the hand being very "swollen and hot". He sought medical care at the Regional Hospital of Cáceres. After the stitches are removed, we performed rigorous cleaning with saline. The injuries were blunt-piercing and piercing-cutting and the area presented significant inflammation, with reduced sensory and motor function, but without purulent discharge. An X-ray showed a fracture with a small bone fragment at the head of the 2nd metacarpal law. The patient was treated with 1000 ml glicosaline IV bid; cephalexin 1 g IV 6 / 6 hours; gentamicin 80 mg 8 / 8 hours; tenoxicam 20 mg 12/12 hours; SAT 5000 U IM, IV dipyrone 2 ml 6 / 6 hours and omeprazole 20 mg IV 12/12 hours and daily dressings. Culture for bacteria was not performed due to the difficulty of obtaining pus and the early administration of antibiotics. After five days there was significant regression of the hospital and he was discharged to weekly follow-up and physical therapy. The wounds were healed after 45 days.</p><p><bold>Discussion / conclusions:</bold> the accident was an unprovoked attack and the reptile probably tried to devour the fish that he was cleaning, with no attempt to human predation. Injuries caused by alligators should be viewed as high risk for the lacerations and punctures caused and by the high potential of secondary bacterial infection.</p><p><bold>PP-830</bold></p><p><bold>Death by drowning associated with an Attack of Piranhas, with threatening injuries structures the face - Report of a case occurred in Cáceres - MT-Brazil</bold></p><p><underline>Manoel Campos Neto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Vidal Haddad Júnior<sup>2</sup>, Caroline A.

The victim and a friend drowned while diving in the evening in the Padre Inácio River. After the bodies were recovered (almost immediately), it was found that a body showed no external injuries, while the victim showed deep lacerations on his face with the destruction of tissue and bone exposure, characteristics of attacks by piranhas, including showing teeth marks typical of fish. The autopsy reports showed the typical lacerations on the face (injuries by pullout) and the presence of foreign bodies in the lungs alveoli, favoring the drowning as the leading cause-of death There are extensive lacerations and teeth marks with avulsion of tissues in the face of the victim and circular lesions in frontal region with tissue destruction in the submandibular region, affection and section of important branches of the carotid artery. There was also muscle wasting in the temporal region.

How can there be confusion with other causes of death and even attacks on live individuals by some species of fish, it is important to know if there is a characteristic pattern of injuries in corpses devoured by fish. Additionally, it is not unusual to observe small specimens of various species of crabs in internal cavities of bodies submerged (personal communication from authors)1.2. Among the main fish decomposers are the freshwater and marine catfish (families Pimelodidae, Cetopsidae and Ariidae). Piranhas have a very important role in these attacks, perhaps more active than the folkloric attacks in living humans through shoals2.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim is a research an attack pattern to human bodies by small fish, which will be able to identify the bodies’ victim of secondary attacks where the cause of death was not the action of the fish.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed postmortem examinations on two bodies of humans who had proven attack action by fish and was dead by causes other than the attack. Morphological aspects were highlighted in the common search for a pattern of action of fish.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The main cause of death was mechanical asphyxia slowly in liquid medium (freshwater). In one case, the victim was tortured and after his death, he was tied to a weight and thrown into the Paraguay River. After a few days, the water level lowered and the body part was exposed when it was removed by firefighters. The common aspects to all bodies were the tissue destruction of the face and cartilaginous areas of the head.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The victims died of causes other than the attack of the fish. The cheeks and the rest of the face are the points of initial preference of the attacks of small carnivorous fish and crustaceans decomposers, as well as areas of cartilage. We could still find these animals in the cavities of corpses. Lesions with these characteristics should alert the forensic medicine expert to the possibility of attacks post-mortem by fish.</p><p><bold>PP-832</bold></p><p><bold>Injuries caused by Predators Large Carnivores species Panthera onca - Report of Two Cases occurring in the Pantanal Region of Mato Grosso – Brazil</bold></p><p><underline>Manoel Campos Neto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Vidal Haddad Júnior<sup>2</sup>, Caroline A.

As skin covers the outersurface of the body, it is the most vulnerable part, and dermal wound age is a critical issue in routine forensic autopsies. The aim of this study was to determine the wound age by the use of immunohistochemical study of transforming growth factors (TFG-α and TGF-β1) on human skin wounds. Samples were collected from human skin wounds after operative incisions (from a few minutes to 6 weeks) and investigated using immunohistochemistry. TGF-α was started to increase after a wound age of approximately 10 min. The maximum level was between 30-60 min then decreased significantly. TGF-β1 was also markedly increased within 60 min and remained detectable in elevated levels in older wounds (6 weeks). Thus, it appears that TGF-α and TGF-β1 can efficiently contribute to the estimation of wound age based on the evaluation of their expressions. In particular, this applies to TGF-β1 because it remains in high level for long time post injury.</p><p><bold>PP-836</bold></p><p><bold>Chop wounds in the neck - suicide?

Therefore, this case was initially treated as a possible homicide.</p><p>The victim was found in a pool of blood on the floor of the living room, with a crescent shaped chopper at his side. The apartment was locked-down and no evidence of recent intrusion was found. Except for the traces in the living room, there were no other blood traces in the other rooms of the apartment. Autopsy findings showed a large complex chop wound (16 x 8 cm) with parallel superficial extensions and/or hesitation lesions from behind the left ear, transversely descending across the neck to the right ear, with underlying bone fragments of the cervical vertebral column. Underneath this wound a subdural cerebellar hemorrhage and left temporal subarachnoid bleeding was found. All organs had an anemic appearance. Post mortem imaging (CT-scan) showed the presence of a vital air embolism. DNA analysis of the cleaver revealed only DNA-fingerprints of the victim.</p><p>Based on the police investigation, the psychiatric history of the victim, the distribution of the bloodstains, the wound pattern and the DNA-analysis, this case, initially considered as an homicide, could eventually be classified as a suicide by self inflicted chopper slashes resembling a self decapitation attempt. The cause of death was exsanguination and cerebral air embolism.</p><p><bold>PP-837</bold></p><p><bold>The analysis of CD14 protein expression during wound healing on mouse skin</bold></p><p><underline>Yoichi Yagi</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kazuya Ikematsu<sup>2</sup>, Shinichiro Kagawa<sup>1</sup>, Takahiro Umehara<sup>2</sup>, Ichiro Nakasono<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Forensic Science Laboratory, Nagasaki Prefectural Police Headquarters</p><p><sup>2</sup>Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The determination of wound age is indispensable in forensic practice. At present, Prussian blue staining is usually used to establish wound age. However, positive staining of Prussian blue was obtained only from day 7 or so, and there are no helpful markers to determine before day 7 after wounding at all. Therefore, it is important to search new markers in the initial state of the wound healing process. We previously reported that CD14 mRNA expression peaked from 12 hour to day 1 after injury on mouse skin. However, mRNA is so fragile, it is difficult to be used as a marker for the estimation of wound age. In this study, we investigated the expression of CD14 protein, which was considered to be more stable than mRNA to use as a new marker to determine wound age with immune-histochemical method.</p><p><bold>Materials and method:</bold> Pathogen free 6-week-old male BALB/c mice were anesthetized by an intra-peritoneal injection of pentobarbital. Six full-thickness excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of mice using a 4 mm biopsy punch. The wounds passed from day 1 to day 9 were excised with surrounding tissues. Total proteins were extracted from these tissues, and relatively determined by Western blot to evaluate CD14. GAPDH was used as the internal reference protein. The other skin tissue sections were embedded in paraffin, and stained with immune-histochemical staining of CD14 after making thin sections.</p><p><bold>Result and discussion:</bold> The Western blot analysis revealed the expression of CD14 protein peaked from day 3 to day 5 during wound healing. We could immune-histologically detect the localization of CD14 protein. And the positive strong signal could be observed at only day 3, but the weak of expression showed at day 5. These results indicated that the CD14 protein might be a useful marker for determination early stage of wound age for forensic practice.</p><p><bold>PP-838</bold></p><p><bold>An Unusual Case of Penetrating Intracranial Injury Due to Scissors</bold></p><p>Bülent Eren<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Selçuk Çetin</underline><sup>2</sup>, Nursel Türkmen<sup>2</sup>, Okan Akan<sup>1</sup>, Murat Serdar Gürses<sup>2</sup>, Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Bursa Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, Turkey.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Forensic Medicine, Uludag University Medical School, Bursa, Turkey</p><p><sup>3</sup>The Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice, İstanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Craniocerebral penetrating non-missile injuries caused by metallic foreign bodies are uncommon among the civilian population. These injuries have been mostly due to industrial accidents in industry or criminal activities. Although intracranial cavity enclosed by the cranium which is consisting of rough bony structure and this type of injuries are very rare, penetrating non-missile injuries caused by metallic foreign bodies can be seen like the other body cavities.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> We present a case of craniocerebral trauma due to scissors that penetrated intracranial cavity without dural injury and it is discussed with a review of literature.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A previously healthy 10 year-old male applied to hospital emergency service with his parents. Family members stated that the scissors have been stalled his head accidentally by his sister when they had played together. During physical examination the scissors which located on the posterior of left parietal region of the head was observed. There was no loss of consciousness and oriented with normal vital signs. No other apparent injuries and neurological deficit symptoms were defined. A cranial lateral X-ray and cranial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a hyper dense foreign body (scissors) penetrating cranial cavity and ended before reaching posterior region of the left parietal lobe. He was admitted to the neurosurgery department after the initial physical, neurological and radiological examination and surgical exploration of the wound was performed under general anesthesia. Dural or cerebral laceration underneath of the injury was not inspected. He was discharged from hospital on 8th day post-surgery.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Penetrating brain injuries caused by non-missile low velocity objects are infrequent and include violence, industrial accidents and accidents during childhood, and suicide attempts. High mortality rates in early injury period among cases similar to our case with intracerebral hemorrhage, brain contusion, and major vascular injuries were reported. Various foreign bodies have been described related to penetrating the cranium such as nails, knives, screwdrivers, sewing needles, scissors, bullets, and shrapnel. To our knowledge, the presented was rare case of intracranial penetrating scissor, which was not removed until, injured reached the hospital. Our goal was to discuss the rare case of penetrating non-missile foreign body cranial injury in medico legal aspect.</p><p><bold>PP-839</bold></p><p><bold>Physical and Psychological Evaluation of a Person Who Has Multiple Razor Scar Tissues on His Body</bold></p><p>Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Harun Akkaya</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kenan Karbeyaz<sup>2</sup>, Hüseyin Eş<sup>3</sup>, Atiye Sözen<sup>4</sup>, Tuğba Başoğlu Özgür<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 2nd Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Branch Office, Eskişehir, Turkey.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p><sup>4</sup>Council of Forensic Medicine, 6th Speciality Board, Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>The people diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder may be encountered with a wide range of criminal cases varies from insignificant reactional deed to killing behaviour. The case is a person who has razor scar tissues on approximately 35 % of the body surface and has anti-social personality disorder. Due to incision on his neck caused by a person who has again anti-social personality disorder in the prison that he was being detained, injured party sent to Coroner’s Jury 2. and opinion of an expert was demanded to expose the claims of injury. In his physical examination at the hospital after the injury; on the left carotid artery there is an incision including the muscles reaching posterior, left carotid artery amended by an operation, left jugular veins connected, furthermore longudutinal 5 cm 4 units incision on front thoracic wall amended, with the control of hemorrhage it was determined that the patient was discharged from the hospital. The person claimed that the injuries on his neck resulted accidentally during his attemption to intervene a quarrel. The person also declared that other incisions on his body surface caused by himself.</p><p>During his psychological evaluation; the characteristics of new and previous physical diagnosis of the person who has anti-social personality disorder, the mechanism of the injury case, the connection between psychological diagnosis and current lesions, the communal and individual measures to be adopted against these kind of people, has been discussed by taking national legislation and literature into consideration.</p><p><bold>PP-840</bold></p><p><bold>Medico legal aspect of permanent infirmities as a sequel of different types of injuries</bold></p><p><underline>Randa H.

The highest percent was in age groups 21–30 (43.75 %) followed by age group 31–40 years (25.59 %). Male cases represented (92.36 %) while females represented (7.64 %). The highest percent of victims were farmers (68.75 %) followed by manual workers (20.83 %). Most of victims were from rural areas (93.05 %) while victims from urban area were only (6.95 %). Educated victims represented (37.5 %) where illiterate victims represented (62.5 %). Blunt instruments were responsible for (59.72 %) followed by sharp instruments (21.53 %) and firearms (8.75 %). The cause of injury was due to criminal assault (81.94 %), accidental (18.06 %), while there were no suicidal cases end in permanent infirmities. Extremities, upper and lower limb represented (38.19 %) of cases, of which (15.28 %) due to nerve injuries while (22.91 %) were due to bone injuries.

Haematoxylin and eosin stain is one of the most commonly used histological stains to do this evaluation. Unfortunally this microscopic technique is not reliable in decomposed bodies because erythrocytes are often lysed and not recognizable.</p><p>Although a lot of researches have attempted to use histological and immunohistochemical methods to analyze the vitality of lesions of soft tissues, there is still no conclusive tools to determined whether a wound is ante-mortem or post-mortem in decomposed corpses.</p><p>The impossibility to recognize red blood cells in histological samples with haematoxylin and eosin stain does not exclude the possibility to identify their specific components. In particular haemoglobin chain seem to be one of the most resistant elements to putrescence.</p><p>We tested the usefulness of the immunohistochemical technique using antibodies against haemoglobin alpha chain on formalin fixed–paraffin embedded tissue sections in some cases of decomposed corpses in the aim to understand which lesions were ante-mortem and which post-mortem.</p><p>We try to use it in some murdered cases that gave us some problems about vitality diagnosis of the lesions.</p><p>The employment of anti-haemoglobin alpha chain antibody allowed us to validate the results of haematoxylin-eosin analysis and understand which lesions were really dealt to kill and which not (made as an attempt to hide the corpse or by animals).</p><p>These preliminary data suggest that immunohistochemical analysis could be a useful tool in determination of wound vitality.

Every single day animals die struck by cars, killed by humans, or other animals. These every day events are present throughout our lifetime and most often passed by unnoticed. What changes how the situation is dealt with is when a human is attacked by an animal. The information is repeated, media publicizes the facts, and enriches them in presumptions and conclusions. The general hysteria increases.</p><p>The aim of the paper was: to evaluate the number of animal aggression including the cases of death, to analyze the victims of aggression according to sex, age and type of injuries, and to compare the total number of animal versus human bite victims.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> The analysis included autopsy protocols and protocols of medical-legal examination performed in the Department of Forensic Medicine in PUMS from years 2004–2009. Cases with animal bite injuries were selected from the protocols. Data was analyzed according to particular categories.</p><p>The information collected was based on the cases reported or submitted to the department either directly by a victim or legally by law enforcement officials. Overall, occurrence of animal aggression is probably more frequent and includes cases never reported for the medical-legal examination.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The analysis revealed presence of animal bite injuries in 0,81 % of all the victims of aggression. All the bite marks found were postmortem in type. During the period, there were no deaths due to animal aggression occurring. The number of deceased people with animal bites found during autopsy in particular years was comparable and did not exceed four cases in a year.</p><p>The protocols of medical-legal examinations documented the presence of animal bite injuries in 0,89 % of victims. Number of victims with animal bite injuries varied from 3 to 10, but never exceeded 1.5 % of all cases. The number of female and male victims of animal aggression was comparable. Majority of animal bites occurred in adults. The most frequently medium injuries were observed. Apart from the animal bites injuries, the investigation showed the presence of human bite injuries in 0,54 % of victims.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The analysis confirmed the observation that animal aggression is marginal, especially when compared to the aggression of a human against another human. In contrary to the aggression of human towards another human, it is a very rare cause of human death or even major injury.</p><p><bold>PP-843</bold></p><p><bold>Virtual reconstruction of a stab wound</bold></p><p><underline>Fabio De Giorgio</underline><sup>1</sup>, Leonardo Grimaldi<sup>1</sup>, Roberto Politi<sup>2</sup>, Vincenzo M.

The autopsy revealed the presence of a stab wound in the left fifth intercostal space, 2.5 cm long and 12 cm deep, reaching the anterior surface of the left ventricle. The edges of the wound in the skin suggested that a single-edge blade knife was used, whose length was 12 cm or higher. The wound was inflicted with the knife slightly angled toward the cranium in the craniocaudal axis and toward the median line in the mediolateral axis. The victim also presented a linear superficial cut wound on the second finger and scrapes on the third and fourth finger of his right hand. The knife was never found. Eight days after death, a man went to the police station and confessed the murder. During the following interrogation, he stated that after a quarrel they started fighting and, when the victim pulled out the knife, he grabbed the victim’s wrist, turned the blade towards the victim who, de facto, stabbed himself in the assault. The clinical forensic examination of the suspected murderer diagnosed an abrasion in the left pectoral area and some other scrapes on his right hand’s fingers.</p><p>The Prosecutor had to test these two hypothesis: the deceased was killed during a quarrel or he accidentally stabbed himself while fighting. In this case the traditional medico-legal approach, based on the characteristics of the wound compared with the anthropometric features of the two individuals, such as e.g height and handedness, together with the compatibility between the lesions of the hand and typical defense wounds has been used. Furthermore, a simulation involving two man with anthropometric features similar to the victim and assailant was realized. Finally a virtual 3D reconstruction of the two hypothetic dynamics was made to identify the most likely.</p></body></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Forensic Medicine</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Medical Law</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Medicine &amp; Public Health</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Medicine/Public Health, general</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">International Journal of Legal Medicine</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2012</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"/><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
