Our research review reveals a plethora of approaches for optimization of energy allocation and all achieving varying degrees of success and not without any compromises. In this paper, we exploit the use of serious gaming in a novel energy allocation algorithm that aims at minimizing energy consumption to maximize the utilities of both CubeSats and terrestrial sensors. To demonstrate this, we use Stackelberg for serious gaming and standalone topology for CubeSat configuration. The experimental results show that the use of a Stackelberg game approach for optimization has led to reduction in the required transmission energy in sensors, an improved link performance between the CubeSat and ground sensors, and an increase in network lifetime and performance without resorting into sensor power enhancements or other external power sources. The overall average operational capacity improvement predictions range between 22 to 27% across all performance indicators of energy efficiency across RF chains of link budgets.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Serious gaming</kwd><kwd>Optimization</kwd><kwd>Energy allocation</kwd><kwd>Energy consumption</kwd><kwd>Cubesat</kwd><kwd>Aerial model</kwd><kwd>Wireless connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/11042_2023_Article_15795.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Multimedia Information Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Communication Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Data Structures and Information Theory</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Special Purpose and Application-Based Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Serious gaming is an alternative testbed for testing complex decision-making in numerous subject areas through simulation and analysis of decision-making processes. The use of rewards, which are incentives based on performance, and the user interactions that follow inform on the choice of actions. Serious gaming techniques are increasingly applied widely for data analytics by retrieving valuable information from complex large data sets that support generating smart decision. The learning and training concepts rely on discovering data patterns and those data elements that when adapted may change the data patterns. This is driven by the competition as it unfolds during interaction and helps support decision making and performance optimization, despite the continuous challenge of measuring the learning impact of competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Serious gaming is regularly used to examine the behavior of rational and strategic decision-makers by considering possible equilibriums in conflict-of-interest situations and then providing appropriate mechanisms for enabling cooperation between two or more players. Stackelberg, and Nash Equilibrium are prime examples of the use of hierarchical serious gaming in observing the sequential interactions among players foe the purpose of making strategic decisions across many applications. Observing different attributes and behaviors among players during interactions enables these serious gaming methods to seek optimum decision-making solution(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Serious gaming has been applied successfully for smart decision making to enhance performance across a wide range of applications ranging from education to healthcare, to manufacturing and energy allocation is among these. Optimization of energy allocation will prolong network terminal lifetime and which in turn will help with sustaining the system performance, especially of wireless systems. This requires optimization of channel modeling and use of the limited transmission energy resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Satellite systems including Cubesat are crucial in global wireless communication systems, due to their soft deployment, high frequency bands, wide coverage footprint, and line-of-sight connectivity. Yet, despite the advancement of Cubesat technology, energy allocation and consumption remain an open challenge that reportedly affect performance and/or operational lifetime. CubeSats use solar cells to convert solar light to electricity that is stored in rechargeable lithium batteries that are an energy source during an eclipse as well as during peak load times. Moreover, the energy subsystem in Cubesat is responsible for storing, distributing, and controlling the spacecraft’s electrical energy. The efficiency of the Cubesat solar cells may be affected, for instance, by the radiation intensity of the sun, and the incident angle at which the sunlight strikes the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Motivated by the open challenge of energy consumption, the overall aim of this paper is to apply serious gaming in optimizing energy allocation in a Cubesat.

Our proposed contribution not only aims to address on-going challenges, but it also offers added value. Optimizing energy allocation in CubeSats is scarcely reported in the literature and currently lacking consideration of a serious gaming approach. Therefore, a key difference between the proposed contribution and what is reported in the literature is, primarily, the novel energy allocation approach that aims at joint minimization energy consumption to maximize utilities for both Cubesat and terrestrial sensors using a Stackelberg game approach. This noticeable shift from mainstream approaches promises smart decisions and achieving the objective of efficient energy allocation. This requires making multiple decisions to minimize energy consumption, i.e., from fair transmission to maximization of feasible sleep time, to optimization of convergence range, to adjustment of cluster size and to node selection.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Related research against the proposed contribution</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Ref</p></th><th align="left"><p>Aerial Type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Configuration</p></th><th align="left"><p>Optimization Approach</p></th><th align="left"><p>Issues Resolved</p></th><th align="left"><p>Issues Persisting</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>Two-player game</p></td><td align="left"><p>Propagation delay</p></td><td align="left"><p>bit energy/power density</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>Nash </p></td><td align="left"><p>RF allocation</p></td><td align="left"><p>Scalability, no power data</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Network</p></td><td align="left"><p>Nash </p></td><td align="left"><p>Inter-satellite links</p></td><td align="left"><p>Complexity</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stackelberg</p></td><td align="left"><p>Interference</p></td><td align="left"><p>Transmit power fixed/limited</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Integrated</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stackelberg </p></td><td align="left"><p>QoS/utility price</p></td><td align="left"><p>Utility price/evolution speed trade-off</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Bus</p></td><td align="left"><p>Empirical</p></td><td align="left"><p>Link capacity</p></td><td align="left"><p>Complexity, low performance</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lyapunov optimal</p></td><td align="left"><p>Data traffic</p></td><td align="left"><p>Delay trade-off</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>AI </p></td><td align="left"><p>High throughput</p></td><td align="left"><p>Inflexible, local optima</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>DRL</p></td><td align="left"><p>High throughput</p></td><td align="left"><p>Sporadic higher energy</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Cubesat</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>IP formulation</p></td><td align="left"><p>Task and energy plan</p></td><td align="left"><p>Broad time units</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>UAV</p></td><td align="left"><p>Mesh</p></td><td align="left"><p>EPG and Nash </p></td><td align="left"><p>Coverage</p></td><td align="left"><p>RF band set, interference</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>Satellite</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>MGBA-SPA </p></td><td align="left"><p>Coop beam, power plan</p></td><td align="left"><p>Complexity</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Model</p></td><td align="left"><p>Cubesat</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stand Alone</p></td><td align="left"><p>Stackelberg </p></td><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Fair transmission, cluster size adjustment, convergence range optimization, node selection, feasible sleep time maximization</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Proposed model</title><p id="Par15">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a bird’s-eye-view of the proposed model that uses Stackelberg serious gaming for optimizing energy allocation on a Cubesat.

Introducing node clustering and a head node would help with managing the number of nodes that are directly communicating at any given time with the Cubesat. A cluster head will have the responsibility of data transmission directly to the Cubesat, which reduces the probability of data collision between nodes and in turn would lead to better energy consumption. The cluster size and the number of nodes in each cluster can be pre-set to ensure energy allocation fairness. Cluster allocation considers criteria, such as energy level consumption, number of neighbor nodes, and harvested energy levels.

The Cubesat serves K randomly distributed sensors on the ground via the RF links, and this can be optimized using Stackelberg serious gaming. Sensing the link margin data depends on a set of parameters including path loss, transmitter power, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna gain, frequency band, and bandwidth. Data links are established between cluster heads and ground sensors. Stackelberg comes into play to prioritise access and optimize the overall network utility and energy allocation for the Cubesat.

An optimization model with serious gaming may optimize priority-based access and overall network utility. The aim of this paper is to use Stackelberg as the serious gaming approach in achieving that. With serious gaming, the learning concept and strategies can be developed based on real conditions or data from predicted results. With the proposed model the Cubesat, acting as the leader, sets the interference prices to the terrestrial sensors, acting as the supporters, including both the cluster heads and cluster nodes. The Cubesat, although affected by the cost of interference, focuses on maximizing its utility from interference returns. The terrestrial sensors focus on maximizing their utilities per unit of power consumption. Hence, Stackelberg aims at obtaining the optimal prices for Cubesat and optimal transmission powers for terrestrial sensors. The formulation of the serious Stackelberg game approach is mathematically expressed in Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="disp-formula">6</xref>) to (<xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="disp-formula">17</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The Cubesat can transmit data at a particular level of energy <inline-formula id="IEq17"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq17_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq17_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The best link performance is the one that allows for the lowest possible BER with the lowest possible Eb/No, i.e., after applying the proposed serious gaming approach. This prescribes a robust channel, where a low error rate is achieved without requiring a high transmission power. The overall predictions of these two QoS indicators reveal reasonable improvements. This may lead to a reduction in the required transmission energy from sensors and an improved link performance between Cubesat and ground sensors, thus, increasing network lifetime and performance. The predicted Eb/No performance, after applying the proposed serious gaming approach, shows an increase of 21% on average in relation to non-optimized predictions. Once again this supports the conclusion that energy consumption optimization is possible without having to resort to sensor power enhancements or external power sources. This may lead to a reduction in the required transmission energy from sensors and an improved link performance between Cubesat and ground sensors, thus, increasing network lifetime and performance. Most importantly, this improvement yields to optimization of energy consumption without using sensor power enhancements or external power sources. After applying the Stackelberg gaming approach, the Eb/No performance has improved by an average of 21% in comparison to non-optimized predictions. This is a noticeable improvement that results in fair transmission between nodes and clusters.

The use of Stackelberg aims at prioritizing access and optimizing the overall network utility and solving the problem of energy allocation. This supports making a set of decisions to guarantee fair energy allocation: fair transmission, feasible sleep time maximization, convergence range optimization, cluster size adjustment, and node selection. The predicted results not only suggest a reduction in the required sensor transmission energy and an improved link performance between a Cubesat and its ground sensors but also an increase in network performance and battery lifetime without the use of sensor power enhancements or external power sources. Overall, the performance indicators suggest improvements ranging between 22 and 27% on average across all performance indicators in comparison to non-optimized predictions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Taif University for funding this research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par38">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alharbi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Design and Study of a Miniaturized Millimeter Wave Array Antenna for Wireless Body Area Network</article-title><source>Int J Antennas Propag</source><year>2022</year><volume>2022</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1155/2022/1736377</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Almalki</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Comparative and QoS Performance Analysis of Terrestrial-aerial Platforms-satellites Systems for Temporary Events</article-title><source>Int J Comput Netw Commun</source><year>2019</year><volume>11</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>111</fpage><lpage>133</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other" assigning-authority="American Mathematical Society">4027232</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5121/ijcnc.2019.11607</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Almalki</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Angelides</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A machine learning approach to evolving an optimal propagation model for last mile connectivity using low altitude platforms</article-title><source>Comput Commun</source><year>2019</year><volume>142–143</volume><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.comcom.2019.04.001</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Almalki FA, Angelides MC (2022) Autonomous flying IoT: A synergy of machine learning, digital elevation, and 3D structure change detection.
