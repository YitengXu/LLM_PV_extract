Transformational changes in battery technologies are critically needed to enable the effective use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to allow for the expansion of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) to plug-in HEVs and pure-electric vehicles. For these applications, batteries must store more energy per unit volume and weight, and they must be capable of undergoing many thousands of charge-discharge cycles. The articles in this theme issue present details of several growing interest areas, including high-energy cathode and anode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries and challenges of Li metal as an anode material for Li batteries. They also address the recent progress in systems beyond Li ion, including Li-S and Li-air batteries, which represent possible next-generation batteries for electrical vehicles. One article reviews the recent understanding and new strategies and materials for rechargeable Mg batteries.

However, the utilization of electricity generated from these intermittent renewable sources requires efficient electrical energy storage (EES) systems. Batteries, as one of the most appropriate and promising EES systems, are ubiquitous—virtually all portable electronic devices today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. There is no doubt that the development of the next generation of batteries will play a vital role in future use of electrical energy.</p><p>A rechargeable Li-ion battery consists of two Li-ion intercalation electrodes with a non-aqueous electrolyte in between for ionic conduction. The electrical and chemical energies in a Li-ion cell are interconverted via reversible de-intercalation/intercalation processes of Li ions between the cathode and anode along with electrons traveling via an external circuit simultaneously. The advent of rechargeable Li-ion batteries ushered in the wireless revolution and has stimulated a quest for batteries to power hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (PEVs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> Lithium batteries are also anticipated to be a key component to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources as part of the electrical distribution grid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> Another motivation to discover novel EES systems, in particular rechargeable Li batteries with new chemistries, is the ceaseless fluctuation of fossil fuel prices and the prospect of global warming associated with CO<sub>2</sub> emission.

Other technical bottlenecks of Li-ion batteries should also be considered, including the limited energy density of individual cells, the lack of fast recharge cycles with long cell lifetimes, as well as safety concerns. In order to increase the energy density of individual cells significantly, one can either increase the cell voltage and/or the amount of charge stored reversibly per unit weight and volume. One approach that can increase the cell voltage is to develop novel cathode materials, for example 5V spinel (LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> However, enabling cell performance with high voltages requires developing new electrolytes and/ or electrolyte additives for thermodynamic stability or novel surface passivation layers that adjust rapidly to changes in electrode morphology during a fast charge and discharge process.

This marked a massive swing away from the relatively low-voltage, water-based systems such as Ni-Cd and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries as well as high-temperature systems, such as conventional Na-S batteries. Nowadays, rechargeable Li-ion batteries are being pursued intensively for a myriad of devices, such as uninterrupted power supply units, rechargeable power sources for consumer electronics, and electrical vehicles.</p><p>The first commercial Li-ion battery, introduced by Sony Corporation in 1991, was based on a LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode and a carbon anode, as schematically shown in <bold>Figure</bold><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. When an electrical current is applied to charge the cell, lithium ions move out of the cathode (Li<sub>1</sub><sub>−x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>) and become trapped inside the anode storage medium, which is usually graphitized carbon (Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>C<sub>6</sub>). Upon battery discharge, the lithium ions travel back to the cathode and produce an external electrical current. During cell operation at 3.0–4.2 V, however, the surface reactivity and instability of the delithiated Li<sub>1<italic>−x</italic></sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> structure limit the practical capacity of the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> electrodes to approximately 140 mAh/g, which corresponds to <italic>x</italic> ≈ 0.5 (i.e., ∼ 50% of its theoretical value [273 mAh/g]).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> These limitations, together with the high possibility of thermal runaway caused by cell overcharge and short circuit in inadequately controlled batteries and the relatively high cost of cobalt, have led to enormous efforts since 1991 to find alternative cathode materials to LiCoO<sub>2</sub> that provide Li-ion cells with superior energy density, rate capability, safety, and cycle life.

Typically, a rechargeable Li-ion battery consists of two Li-ion intercalation electrodes, for instance, a graphite anode and a layered LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode, with a non-aqueous electrolyte in between for ionic conduction. The electric and chemical energies in a Li-ion cell are interconverted through reversible discharge/charge processes between the cathode and anode along with electrons traveling through an external circuit simultaneously.

Since carbon in the form of graphite is the material of choice for the anode for the Li-ion battery industry, these requirements must be achieved by varying the cathode materials. Incidentally, the nearly universal use of graphite anodes also explains why battery cell characteristics can be discussed in terms of the cathode’s properties alone.</p><p>Several alternative cathode materials to LiCoO<sub>2</sub> have been exploited by the Li-ion battery industry over the past decade. They include compositional variations of the layered LiCoO<sub>2</sub> structure, such as LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCA);<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> spinel electrodes derived from LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, such as lithium-rich compounds in the Li<sub>1+<italic>x</italic></sub>Mn<sub>2</sub><sub>−x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> system;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> that has an olivine-type structure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref> Although NCA provides a slightly higher practical capacity (160–180 mAh/g) than LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, its thermal instability on delithiation due to the presence of the high valence Ni compromises the safety of Li-ion cells. On the other hand, spinel LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and olivine LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrodes are significantly more stable to lithium extraction than the layered Co- and Ni-based electrodes (both structurally and thermally), but they deliver relatively low practical capacities in a lithium cell above 3 V, typically 100–150 mAh/g at moderate current rates.</p><p>It became clear by the end of the 1990s that new strategies would have to be developed to design alternative high potential cathode materials (&gt;3 V) with capacities superior to those achievable with standard LiCoO<sub>2</sub>-, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-, and LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-type electrodes without compromising the structural stability or rate capability of the electrodes or the cycle life of the cells. Recently, researches at Argonne National Laboratory have developed a family of high-energy manganese-based cathodes by structurally integrating a Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> stabilizing component into an electrochemically active LiMO<sub>2</sub> (M = Mn, Ni, Co) electrode.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> The relatively high Mn content in these high-energy cathode materials lowers material costs, while the excess lithium boosts specific capacity up to 250 mAh/g between 4.6 and 2.5 V, and therefore, significantly improves the energy density of battery cells to 900 Wh/kg. However, in practical cells, when these high-energy Ni-Mn-Co oxides (NMC) are cycled against graphite, deliverable capacity decreases dramatically with cycle number along with a significant decay of cell discharge voltage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> The consequences of the capacity and voltage fading of these materials is the severe loss of the energy density of the cell during long cycling times, which hinders its practical application in electrical vehicles. The underlying mechanisms for the observed energy fading need to be addressed in order to unlock the potential of these compounds as high-energy cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.</p><p>Furthermore, since these cathodes operate at a high voltage, there is a need to develop high-voltage electrolytes to enable these new cathodes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> Several novel organic solvents with greater oxidative stability, such as sulfones,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> nitriles,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref> and fluorinated solvents,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> have recently been explored as electrolytes. Unfortunately, these electrolytes may also compromise the anode solid electrolyte interphase-forming reactions required in Li-ion batteries. The development of a novel electrolyte additive that helps form an interfacial film on the cathode surface is thus important and will likely lead to the development of workable electrolyte systems for high-voltage cathodes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></p><p>Since lithium resources are not considered to be abundant, there is the potential for significant cost increase if vehicle electrification expands in the future. As a result, there is growing interest in substituting lithium ions with sodium ions, because sodium is one of the most abundant elements. The article by Kubota et al. in this issue addresses progress in and challenges of sodium ion batteries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Anode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries</title><p>Li batteries with metallic Li anodes offer one of the highest theoretical capacities among conventional battery types, and, in principle, should provide the highest energy density of all Li batteries, primary or secondary, since lithium metal has an extremely high specific capacity (3860 mAh/g) and lower negative redox potential (−3.04 V versus standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> However, two major technical bottlenecks prevent the realization of a successful rechargeable Li metal battery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref> One is the growth of lithium dendrites during repeated charge/discharge cycles, which severely compromises the rechargeability of each lithium cell. The rechargeability is affected by the reactions that can take place between the nonaqueous, flammable electrolyte and the cycled lithium anode, leading to the formation of high surface area dendrites. The formation of the lithium dendrites could also lead to serious safety hazards because of the potential for internal short circuits if these dendrites penetrate through the separators and contact the cathode directly. The other bottleneck is low Coulombic efficiency during repeated cycles, although this can be partially compensated for by an excess amount of lithium. For example, in the early development of Li metal batteries, an excess amount of 300% of lithium was typically applied. Overcoming these hurdles presents an enormous challenge to the lithium battery industry.</p><p>Recently, researchers demonstrated that the growth of lithium dendrites can be partially prevented through either a physical blocking mechanism (using polyethylene oxide-based block copolymer electrolytes)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref> or a self-healing mechanism (using electrolyte additives).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> However, these mechanisms are only effective under very limited conditions (i.e., at high temperatures or under low current densities). Therefore, more work is needed to explore a more reliable solution to prevent dendrite growth in order to push the use of lithium anodes for broader applications. Despite these obstacles, significant efforts are under way to capitalize on and exploit the advantages of metallic lithium systems, such as Li-S and Li-air batteries (see the Nazar et al. and Kwabi et al. articles, respectively, in this issue), with a big assumption that these obstacles can be overcome eventually.</p><p>The technical hurdles of lithium metal as the anode material have led to the use of carbon-based materials as the most widely used negative electrodes in current rechargeable Li-ion batteries, typically carbon-based materials with the limited specific capacity of graphite (372 mAh/g). In order to overcome the capacity limits of current technology, materials such as Sn, Sb, Si, and Ge,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref><sup>–28</sup> which form alloys with lithium, have been explored as potentially more attractive anode candidates since they can incorporate larger amounts of lithium (<bold>Figure 2</bold>, Sn and Si are shown because only they have been intensively investigated thus far). Among these, silicon-based anodes are particularly attractive because of their higher theoretical specific capacity of approximately 4200 mAh/g (ca. Li<sub>4.4</sub>Si), which is far larger than that of graphite and oxide materials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> However, the application of bulk silicon anodes faces one major problem: during the reaction for formation of the silicon-lithium alloy (corresponding to the insertion of lithium in the negative electrode during the charging process), volume expansion from the delithiated phase to the lithiated phase may reach 380%. This high expansion, followed by contraction of the same amplitude (corresponding to the extraction of lithium from the negative electrode during the discharging process), rapidly leads to irreversible mechanical damage to the electrode and eventually to a loss of contact between the negative electrode and the underlying current collector, which causes rapid capacity fade during cycling. Furthermore, silicon usually possesses low electrical conductivity, which has the effect of kinetically limiting the use of the battery. A significant effort is currently under way to enable this system by designing conductive binders that can minimize particle isolation or by incorporating Si in graphene sheets to maintain good conductivity at the electrode level during cycling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Beyond Li-ion systems</title><p>The inherent energy densities of current Li-ion technology are not sufficient for the long-term needs of future applications such as extended-range electrical vehicles.

The energy density of Li-air batteries is over an order of magnitude higher than Li-ion batteries. Whereas state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries have achieved 150–200 Wh/kg (of the 900 Wh/kg theoretically possible value) at the cell level, Li-air batteries have the potential to achieve 3620 Wh/kg (when discharged to Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 3.1 V) or 5200 Wh/kg (when discharged to Li<sub>2</sub>O at 3.1 V). When the “free” oxygen supplied during discharge and released during charge is not included in the calculation, Li-air cells offer ∼ 11,000 Wh/kg. This is basically identical to the value for gasoline (octane) at ∼13,000 Wh/kg when the oxygen that is supplied externally, combusted within, and exhausted from the engine is neglected. Unlike other battery technologies, Li-air is thus competitive with liquid fuels.

Mg is also lightweight which, in theory, could enhance the volumetric energy density of the cell (see the article by Shterenberg et al. in this issue).</p><p>Rechargeable Mg batteries have been regarded as a highly promising technology for energy storage and conversion since the first working prototype was ready for demonstration about a decade ago, which could compete with lead-acid or Ni-Cd batteries in terms of energy density and self-discharge rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref> Since Mg provides two electrons per atom with electrochemical characteristics similar to Li, Mg batteries offer a theoretical specific capacity of 2205 mAh/g.

Rechargeable Na-ion batteries, due to the almost infinite supply of Na, are the most appealing as an immediate alternative to lithium batteries.
