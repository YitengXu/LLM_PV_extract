The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of R21 expression in the differential diagnosis of melanocytic nevi (MN) and malignant melanomas (MM).</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Method:</bold> R21 immunostaining was performed in 50 cases of MM (24 nodular melanomas, 9 superficial spreading melanomas, nine lentigo maligna melanomas, seven acral lentiginous melanomas, 1 unclassified) and 50 cases of MN (19 common melanocytic nevi, 19 dysplastic melanocytic nevi, 12 Spitz’s nevi) diagnosed in our department between 2010 and 2016. Two different thresholds, 10 and 50 %, were used for positivity.</p><p id="Par8"><bold>Results:</bold> The difference between these two entities was statistically significant for both cut-offs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). At the threshold of above 10 % R21-stained cells, the sensitivity was 72 %, specificity was 92 %, positive predictive value (PPV) was 90 % and negative predictive value (NPV) was 76 %. At the threshold of above 50 % R21-stained cells, the sensitivity was 60 %, specificity was 94 %, PPV was 90 % and NPV was 70 %.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Results of this study indicate R21 may have utility in the differential diagnosis of MM and MN.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>OFP-01-002</bold></p><p id="Par11"><bold>PD-1 expression and its relation with histologic and clinical variables in mycosis fungoides</bold></p><p id="Par12">C.

Mozos</p><p id="Par13"><sup>*</sup>Hospital de Sant Pau, Dept. of Pathology, Barcelona, Spain</p><p id="Par14"><bold>Objective:</bold> Micosis Fungoides (MF) has an indolent evolution, and most cases have a prominent microenvironment. PD1 is expressed on activated T cells, interacts with its ligands and plays a role in microenvironment modulation. The aims of this study are to evaluate PD1 expression in MF cells, and to identify histologic variables that might have an impact on clinical outcome.</p><p id="Par15"><bold>Method:</bold> 66 patients with MF were reviewed (37 males; 29 females, median follow-up:125 months (range 6–450 months). All cases were stained with PD1 (clone NAT105) and its expression was evaluated.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Results:</bold> MF cells express PD1 in a high proportion of cases (87.9 %). Only atypia, age &gt;60 yo and advanced stage had an negative impact on overall survival (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Other histological variables, such as epidermotropism, tumour microenviroment and CD7 expression did not reach statistical significance. There was a weak correlation between atypia and proportion of cells with PD1 expression, PD1 intensity, and loss of CD7 expression (r &lt; 0.5). The overall survival in the early stages was 85 % vs.64 % in advanced stages (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par17"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our series, we demonstrate a correlation between PD1 and atypia, and between atypia and overall survival. However, most of our cases expressed PD1, and therefore it might be a therapeutic target.</p><p id="Par18"><bold>OFP-01-003</bold></p><p id="Par19"><bold>Up-regulation of FOXP1 in melanoma cells is a new unfavourable prognosticator and a specific predictor of lymphatic dissemination in cutaneous melanoma patients</bold></p><p id="Par20"><underline>P.

Matkowski</p><p id="Par21"><sup>*</sup>Wroclaw Medical University, Dept. of Pathomorphology, Poland</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Objective:</bold> To assess FOXP1 expression in tumour cells (TCs) and tumour-associated immune cells (TAICs) of 96 cutaneous melanomas, and analyze associations between FOXP1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics.</p><p id="Par23"><bold>Method:</bold> An immunohistochemical analysis was performed for FOXP1 in 96 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary cutaneous melanoma tissue specimens. The results were correlated with classical clinicopathological features and patient survival.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Results:</bold> Enhanced expression of FOXP1 in TCs was strongly associated with the presence of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes and positive status of regional lymph nodes. 96 % (52/54) of patients with low FOXP1 expression had no clinical or histopathological features of lymphatic dissemination. On the other hand, increased numbers of FOXP1-positive TAICs were observed in thinner and non-ulcerated tumours. Moreover, up-regulation of FOXP1 in TAICs was significantly associated with lack of regional lymph node metastases. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high expression of FOXP1 in TCs was significantly correlated with shorter melanoma-associated overall survival and recurrence-free survival. FOXP1 expression in TAICs was not associated with clinical outcome. Multivariate analysis confirmed a significant impact of FOXP1 expression on unfavorable prognosis in melanoma patients.</p><p id="Par25"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest that FOXP1 plays a key role in melanoma progression and is a potential target for molecular-based therapies.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>OFP-01-004</bold></p><p id="Par27"><bold>Characterisation of the immunomodulatory effects of nivolumab and ipililumab in advanced melanoma by quantitative immunohistochemistry</bold></p><p id="Par28"><underline>R.

We examined several immune markers from patients with advanced melanoma who did (IPI-T) or did not (IPI-N) receive ipilimumab prior to treatment with nivolumab (Checkmate CA209-038).</p><p id="Par31"><bold>Method:</bold> Baseline and on-treatment (Day 29) biopsies (<italic>n</italic> = 54) were stained for CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, CD68, FoxP3 and CD4 by IHC. Digitized slides were subjected to image analysis (tIA, CellMap 0.8 software). Marker levels were compared using medians across the whole group, by ipilimumab subgroups and by BOR subgroups [responders (CR/PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD)]. Responses were assessed with RECISTv1.1.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Results:</bold> An increase was observed in all markers for the whole cohort, primarily driven by increases in Ipi-N; however, substantial increases were observed in CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 in IPI-T responders. In the IPI-N subgroup, CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 increased in PD and SD but did not change in responders. Both IPI-T and IPI-N subgroups showed higher baseline CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 in responders vs SD and PD.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patterns of immunomodulatory effect of nivolumab differ by ipilimumab pre-treatment. Further work is required to determine the significance of these differences and whether they underscore unique mechanisms of anti-tumour response.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>OFP-01-005</bold></p><p id="Par35"><bold>Vascularised composite tissue allograft pathology: Akdeniz University experience</bold></p><p id="Par36"><underline>C.

Vascularized tissue allotransplantation pathology is important in detecting changes in the event of rejection. The histopathological examination for the detection of the rejection of vascularized tissue allotransplantation is generally based on the Banff 2007 classification.</p><p id="Par39"><bold>Method:</bold> Routine skin biopsy specimens taken during the follow-up of seven patients were evaluated for rejection. Findings were rated according to the Banff 2007 classification. In a total of 96 biopsy specimens, findings of grade I mild rejection were observed intensively, while grade II moderate rejection was detected at secondary frequency.</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Results:</bold> Besides the histopathological findings in the Banff 2007 classification, some additional histopathological findings were detected in our cases. The overlapping lesions were accompanied by drug eruption findings of rejection. In addition, although the cases showed high rates of grade I mild rejection findings contained in the Banff 2007 classification, no clinical evidence of acute rejection was detected.</p><p id="Par41"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We would like to present the findings that we observed during the routine histopathological examination of the five face transplant cases and two leg transplant cases performed by the Akdeniz University Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department.</p><p id="Par42"><bold>OFP-01-006</bold></p><p id="Par43"><bold>The assessment of clinical and histopathologic effects of PUVA and NB-UVB in early stage mycosis fungoides</bold></p><p id="Par44"><underline>E. Yilmaz</underline><sup>*</sup></p><p id="Par45"><sup>*</sup>Osmangazi University, Pathology, Eskişehir, Turkey</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Objective:</bold> Mycosis Fungoides (MF), the most common form of T-cell lymphoma, is staged as patchy, plaque and tumour forms. Although PUVA and narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) are the two most commonly used treatment modalities in the early stages of disease, studies comparing their histopathologic effects are scarce. The aim of our study is to compare the clinical and histopathologic effects of PUVA and NB-UVB in early stage MF.</p><p id="Par47"><bold>Method:</bold> The study included in 41 early stage MF cases treated with either PUVA or NB-UVB. Both clinical and histopathologic responses including the persistence of epidermotropism, changes in stratum corneum and epidermis, dermal infiltrates, dermal fibrosis and other dermal and vascular changes were evaluated. Complications during treatments were also noted.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Results:</bold> Complete clinical responses were seen in 14 of 23 patients (60.9 %) in the PUVA group and 11 of 18 patients (61.1 %) in the NB-UVB group. The two groups showed significant differences in terms of resolution of epidermotrophism, decrease in dermal infiltrates, and other dermal and vascular changes.</p><p id="Par49"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PUVA and NB-UVB have similar clinical and histopathologic effects in the treatment of early stage MF.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>OFP-01-007</bold></p><p id="Par51"><bold>Tertiary lymphoid structures in ameloblastoma</bold></p><p id="Par52"><underline>C.

Sciences, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p><p id="Par54"><bold>Objective:</bold> The ameloblastoma is a benign but locally-invasive odontogenic epithelial tumour with a high recurrence rate after treatment. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are ectopic lymphoid formations representing an adaptive immune response to either specific pathogen, inflammatory challenge or neoplastic process. Although these structures are acknowledged measures of disease outcome in many cancer types, their role in ameloblastoma remains unclear. To address this, we investigated for their distribution, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics, and evaluated their relevance.</p><p id="Par55"><bold>Method:</bold> Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 63 primary and 14 recurrent ameloblastoma cases were subjected to immunohistochemistry for expression of CD20, CD45RO, CD3, cortactin, NWASP, WIP, RANK, RANKL and osteoprotegerin. Intra- and peri-tumoural lymphocytic infiltrate, lymphoid aggregates and TLS findings were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Results:</bold> There is a positive association between lymphocytic response with tumour status (primary versus recurrent). Peritumoural lymphocytic infiltrate, lymphoid aggregates and TLS were significantly higher in patients presenting with recurrent ameloblastoma (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Actin cytoskeletal regulators NWASP and WIP (except cortactin) overexpression within TLS and lymphoid aggregates suggests enhanced motility of T and B lymphocytes. A low RANK-RANKL and high osteoprotegerin profile within these lymphoid structures indicate an altered tumoural osteoimmunologic microenvironment.</p><p id="Par57"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results show that neogenesis of lymphoid organs do occur in ameloblastoma albeit in low frequency. Their enhanced presence in recurrent tumours may represent locally generated immune response with potential antitumour activity to control growth and progression.

Sugino</p><p id="Par61"><sup>*</sup>Shizuoka Cancer Center, Dept. of Pathology, Nagaizuimi, Japan</p><p id="Par62"><bold>Objective:</bold> PA is the most common benign tumour of the salivary glands. Malignant change of PA is called “carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA)”, and its carcinomatous component frequently shows salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). We aimed to elucidate the malignant potential in PA.</p><p id="Par63"><bold>Method:</bold> We selected PA (30 cases), atypical PA (APA: 5 cases), and CXPA (20 cases). We examined AR, GCDFP-15, Her-2, MMG, S-100P and AMACR expression, immunohistochemically.</p><p id="Par64"><bold>Results:</bold> The inner ductal cells in PA were focally positive for AR, GCDFP-15, and S-100P, whereas they were very weakly and focally positive or negative for Her-2. In this study, the carcinomatous component of CXPA was composed of SDC, most of which were strongly and/or diffusely positive for AR, GCDFP-15, Her-2, S-100P, MMG and AMACR. The inner cells of APA histologically had the large eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei with moderate atypia, and they were also positive for such markers.</p><p id="Par65"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to AR and GCDFP-15 expression pattern, some inner cells of PA and APA have biologically malignant potential with apocrine differentiation, resembling the phenotype of SDC. The critical point of malignant change is the overexpression of Her-2 and/or S-100P, inducing aberrant MMG or AMACR expression.</p><p id="Par66"><bold>OFP-01-009</bold></p><p id="Par67"><bold>Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC): Is there value in supplemental testing for EBV, p16 or HPV?</bold></p><p id="Par68"><underline>M.

Disease-free survival at 5 years was 51 % (95 % CI = 42 %–59 %) with a median time at risk of 37 months (range 3 to 120 months). Combined EBER-/p16-negative cases had worse 2- and 5-year overall survival (p values 0.014 and 0.017 respectively).

Therefore, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of these tumours are less defined than neuroendocrine tumours of other sites. We reviewed our institutional experience with middle ear adenomatous neuroendocrine tumours (MEANTs).</p><p id="Par87"><bold>Method:</bold> We searched our institution’s pathology files to identify patients treated between 1990 and 2015 who had lesions classified as middle ear adenomas, adenomatous tumours, adenomatous tumours with neuroendocrine differentiation, carcinoid tumours of the middle ear, low-grade neuroendocrine tumours of the middle ear, and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the middle ear.

A wide age range (3 to 80 years) was observed with mean age 32 years at presentation. Highest incidence was recorded in 20–40 year age group. A slight male preponderance was noted (57 %). Majority of the cases were intraosseous (76 %) amongst which mandible (87.5 %) was the most frequent site. An attempt was made to categorize all cases according to 2005 WHO classification, but due to fragmented biopsies, inadequate clinical and radiological correlation, a large percentage (40.5 %) of cases were classified as “uncategorized”.

Even though the tumour has a predilection for higher age group and males, we recorded cases in both extremes of age. Therefore, ameloblastoma should be considered in differential diagnosis of odontogenic tumours at either extreme of age. Ameloblatoma has strong tendency for recurrence and recurrence rates vary for different variants.

Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERT) mutations have been reported in variety of tumours and often shown to be associated with aggressive behavior. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and correlate the results with patients’ clinicopathological data.</p><p id="Par103"><bold>Method:</bold> Total genomic DNAs of 213 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples.

Eight patients were males (53 %); mean age was 58 years (34–75). One high-grade, solid ACC from the nasal cavity of a 67 year-old female showed diffuse p16 and HPV mRNA ISH expression (6 %); LiPA SPF10 amplified HPV DNA but no specific genotypes; DNA ISH was negative. In all other cases, p16 stain was luminal and ISH negative; 3 were positive for HR HPV DNA.

However, little is known about the localisation of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the human liver. The aim of our study was to visualize HEV RNA and proteins in liver tissues.</p><p id="Par191"><bold>Method:</bold> Twelve antibodies against HEV open reading frame (ORF) 1-3 proteins for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and two probes for in situ hybridization (ISH) were tested on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) Huh-7 cells transfected with HEV ORF1-3 expression vectors. IHC and ISH were then applied to HEV replicating human hepatoblastoma (Hep293TT) cells and to liver specimens from patients with hepatitis E (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and controls (<italic>n</italic> = 134).</p><p id="Par192"><bold>Results:</bold> While ORF1-3 proteins were all detectable in HEV protein-expressing cells, only ORF2 and 3 proteins could be visualized in HEV-replicating cells. In liver specimens from patients with hepatitis E, only the ORF2-encoded capsid protein was unequivocally detectable. IHC for ORF2 protein showed a patchy expression in individual or grouped hepatocytes, generally stronger in cases of chronic compared to acute hepatitis. In addition to cytoplasmic and canalicular, ORF2 protein also revealed a hitherto not described nuclear localisation. HEV RNA detection by ISH in defined areas correlated with positivity for ORF2 protein. IHC was specific and comparably sensitive as PCR for HEV RNA.</p><p id="Par193"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In livers from patients with hepatitis E, the ORF2 protein can be reliably visualized, allowing sensitive and specific detection of HEV in FFPE samples. Furthermore, its variable subcellular distribution in individual hepatocytes of the same liver might provide the basis for an interaction with nuclear components, and argues for a redistribution of ORF2 protein during infection.</p><p id="Par194"><bold>OFP-02-010</bold></p><p id="Par195"><bold>Increased 53-binding protein 1 nuclear foci expression in the liver of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</bold></p><p id="Par196"><underline>Y.

Steatohepatitis is progressive, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. Hexokinase Domain Containing 1 (HKDC1) is a recently identified hexokinase-like gene, which functions as a hexokinase. Studies revealed that HKDC1 expression is associated with body fat deposition; however, its association with NAFLD has never been studied. The current study aims to explore HDCK1 expression in NAFLD in the context of disease progression.</p><p id="Par207"><bold>Method:</bold> HKDC1 immunohistochemistry was performed on normal livers (<italic>n</italic> = 22) and liver with NAFLD (<italic>n</italic> = 26, 11 cases with advanced fibrosis). Immunostain intensity was graded as 0–1 (no or weak expression), 2 (moderate expression) and 3 (strong expression). Pearson’s Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.</p><p id="Par208"><bold>Results:</bold> Normal hepatocytes have minimal HKDC1 expression. HKDC1 expression is significant increased in NAFLD characterized by strong expression in steatotic hepatocytes (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

Postoperatively acute LVAD failure was suspected, the transthoracic echocardiography revealed an aortic thrombus and an ejection fraction of 0 %. Subsequently the patient suffered cardiac arrest and all resuscitation attempts failed.</p><p id="Par232"><bold>Results:</bold> The aortic arch was fully obstructed by a large thrombus with continuous blockage and thrombosis of all coronary arteries. Furthermore, numerous central and peripheral thromboemboli were found in both lungs. The left ventricular and septal myocardium showed signs of scarring and acute infarction. The previous LVAD aortic graft had been left in place without occlusion of its lumen. The patient had also developed a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after removal of the first LVAD, leading to distribution of thromboemboli as well as a continuous thrombosis from the old graft, with full aortic arch and coronary obstruction.</p><p id="Par233"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LVAD thrombosis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and the already elevated risk of thrombosis is multiplied by the added risk of thromboembolic complications associated with HIT.

Enhanced autophagy has been reported in hypoxic areas of solid tumours; however, there are only few ultrastructural reports concerning the relationship between autophagy and tumour grade.</p><p id="Par303"><bold>Method:</bold> We have performed an ultrastructural investigation aimed to document autophagy in 25 cases of advanced gastric adenocarcinomas intestinal type, twelve of which were well differentiated and thirteen poorly differentiated.</p><p id="Par304"><bold>Results:</bold> Autophagic changes were only occasionally found in well-differentiated carcinomas, while they constitute a frequent ultrastructural finding in poorly differentiated ones. These changes represent a peculiar feature in undifferentiated phenotype together with rare organelles, numerous microfilaments, prominent nucleoli, heterogeneous or plurilobated nuclei and micronuclei.</p><p id="Par305"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> On the light of our observations, it can be argued that autophagy is not constantly present in all intestinal type gastric adenocarcinomas, but it seems to be a phenomenon related to the tumour progression and differentiation.</p><p id="Par306"><bold>OFP-03-012</bold></p><p id="Par307"><bold>A call for unified guidelines on pathology reporting</bold></p><p id="Par308"><underline>M.

We have conducted a survey among pathologists from different European countries to find out what guidelines they follow in their routine practice and how they are being followed.</p><p id="Par312"><bold>Results:</bold> Significant differences exist between colorectal cancer guidelines of major pathology societies. Universal guidelines would facilitate the workflow and enable a more effective cooperation between different countries.

To date, apolipoprotein A4 (apoA4) were found in many amyloid proteins by mass spectrometry-based proteomics (Vrana 2014). However, in cardiac amyloidosis apoA4 was found separately with wild-type transthyretin (Bergstrom 2004). The aim of this study is to investigate the association of apolipoprotein A-4 with amyloidogenesis.</p><p id="Par319"><bold>Method:</bold> We purified amyloid fibrils from systemic and localized amyloidosis, separated their constituents by PAGE, and identified amyloid specific proteins by mass spectrometry. With anti-apoA4 antibody, many different types of amyloid deposits were stained.</p><p id="Par320"><bold>Results:</bold> By mass spectrometry, apoA4 proteins were found in systemic and localized amyloidosis (3/3) cases. By immunostaining, amyloid deposits of AA(5/6), AL(systemic9/11, localized4/4), AB2microglobulin(2/2), Senile(1/1) Aortic valve (3/3) were positive for anti apoA4. Light chain deposition diseases were negative (0/2). Positive areas were coincident with Congo-red positive amyloid deposits.</p><p id="Par321"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ApoA4 were codeposited with many different kinds of amyloid proteins and should be a cofactor for amyloid fibril formation.

The sum of such adverse events in each SL represented their Patient Harm Index (PHI). Historic data were used to develop threshold/target/reach goals.</p><p id="Par336"><bold>Results:</bold> Cases with one of following events resulting in patient harm or potential harm constituted the AP PHI: (1) major diagnostic error, (2) major frozen section (FS) discrepancy due to sampling, (3) major FS discrepancy due to interpretation, (4) significant/unexpected finding without documented communication in report and (5) significant diagnostic delay, specimen loss, or results reported on wrong patient. 48 (4 % reduction), 45 (10 % reduction) and 40 (20 % reduction) were set as threshold, target and reach goals, respectively. Progress towards these goals was discussed at faculty, staff and quality management meetings. By year-end, 38 patients had potential/adverse events. This 24 % reduction in the potential/adverse event rate (0.061 to 0.046 %) appeared more meaningful when translated into 12 less patients with potential/adverse events.</p><p id="Par337"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> By aggregating the total number of potential/adverse events in time and supplementing other, more traditional “rate-based” metrics, the PHI emphasizes the numerator and deemphasizes the denominator, keeping the focus on the patient rather than the total number of specimens.

CAC was diagnosed only when unequivocal malignant glandular and squamous differentiation was present. This pattern was distinguished from 3 lesions: 1) Usual-type adenocarcinoma with benign-appearing squamous metaplasia; 2) Glassy cell carcinoma; 3) Invasive SMILE (Schoolmeester and Lastra). TMAs were constructed and immunohistochemistry for p16, p63, vimentin and PR was performed on 44 cases. Endometrial adenocarcinomas involving cervix were excluded.</p><p id="Par344"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 61 CACs and related lesions classified by 2014 WHO, 32 CAC cases remained, while 9 were reclassified as pure invasive SMILE, 4 as mucinous adenocarcinoma with invasive SMILE, 7 as usual-type adenocarcinoma with invasive SMILE, 6 as usual-type adenocarcinoma with benign-appearing squamous metaplasia and 1 as poorly differentiated usual-type adenocarcinoma. 2 glassy cell carcinomas remained. The vast majority of the CACs and reclassified cases were p16+ and, while none were vimentin+. 60 % of CACs represented in the TMA were p63+, while only 1/20 reclassified cases were positive. Results for other markers were tabulated.</p><p id="Par345"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The differential diagnosis of CAC includes one new entity, usual type adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia, and a newly described lesion, invasive SMILE. P63 should be used to verify the presence of squamous differentiation (when malignant) to ascertain a diagnosis of CAC.

Reyes-Múgica</p><p id="Par541"><sup>*</sup>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Pathology, Dallas, USA</p><p id="Par542"><bold>Objective:</bold> To propose a panel of immunohistochemical markers that can contribute to distinguish male, female and steroid-producing gonadal elements in disorders of sex development (DSD).</p><p id="Par543"><bold>Method:</bold> FOXL2 is required for granulosa cell differentiation and expressed in ovarian stroma. Its counteracting transcription factor SOX9 is a target of SRY and essential for testis development by formation and maintenance of Sertoli cells. DMRT1 represses FOXL2 and is necessary to maintain testis differentiation. CYP11A1 and StAR are enzymes in the testosterone biosynthetic pathway. This panel was applied to 15 cases of dysgenetic gonadal tissue in 10 patients with DSDs.</p><p id="Par544"><bold>Results:</bold> In ovo-testis and mixed gonadal dysgenesis, the sex cord-stromal cells of ovarian type tissue (Granulosa cell lineage) expressed FOXL2. Streak gonads showed a similar expression pattern of FOXL2 as normal ovarian-type stroma. Sex cord-stromal cells in testicular type tissue (Sertoli cell lineage) showed nuclear staining of SOX9 and DMRT1, including Sertoli-cell hamartoma. CYP11A1 and StAR highlighted the presence of steroid-producing cells.</p><p id="Par545"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on the distinct expression of FOXL2, SOX9 and DMRT1 in dysgenetic gonads, our findings support that this panel is useful to distinguish male and female gonadal components. CYP11A1 and StAR are useful for identification of steroid-producing cells.</p><p id="Par546"><bold>OFP-06-003</bold></p><p id="Par547"><bold>Two cases of bilateral hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis mimicking Wilms tumour: A case study with serious clinical impacts</bold></p><p id="Par548"><underline>T.

Literature data are quite scarce on this topic and based on USA material, where preoperative chemotherapy is not used, thus lack the experience of chemotherapy effects on NRs. According to these papers, the best discriminative feature of WTs is encapsulation, which in fact can occur in NRs due to preoperative chemotherapy (usually given in Europe). Based on literature, one can over-diagnose hyperplastic NRs as WT and give wrong treatment. There is a need for update in literature data on hyperplastic NRs and their appearances after chemotherapy.</p><p id="Par554"><bold>OFP-06-004</bold></p><p id="Par555"><bold>Sarcoma with CIC-DUX4 gene fusion: Case report of kidney tumour location in a 12-year-old boy</bold></p><p id="Par556"><underline>H.

Most of them were females (<italic>N</italic> = 11), with a median age of 60 years. The most common site was the thigh (<italic>N</italic> = 8). Mean size was 4.6 cm (interquartile range 3–6 cm). Tumours were seated “intramuscular” (<italic>N</italic> = 13) or “within muscular fascia” (<italic>N</italic> = 2). NGS analysis was evaluable in 14 patients. Several gene mutations, producing a constitutively activated protein R201Y, were identified in 11 cases, that were consequently diagnosed as IM. Three cases did not harbour GNAS mutations: two myxofibrosarcoma, low-grade, and one IM.</p><p id="Par665"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> NGS for GNAS can be helpful in differential diagnosis of deep low-grade myxoid soft tissue tumours.

However, EM facility is not available in every institution. In this study, we aimed to explore the success rate of minimal change disease (MCD) diagnosis in the renal biopsies of adult nephrotic patients in which EM was not performed.</p><p id="Par703"><bold>Method:</bold> 79 adults which were given possible diagnosis of MCD by one of 2 experienced nephropathologists between 2000 and 2016 in a single institution were investigated for their therapy response.

Amyloidosis, cast nephropathy, light chain deposition disease (LCDD) and glomerulonephritis can be seen in renal biopsies secondary to hematological diseases. We aimed to examine the clinicopathological findings of the patients having both bone marrow and renal biopsies.</p><p id="Par711"><bold>Method:</bold> Between 2012 and 2015, 1030 patients had obtained renal biopsy in our center. One hundred thirty of them had also bone marrow biopsy(12.6 %).

Overall HER2 gene amplified and protein positive tumour cells were significantly lowered among post-treatment residual tumours. However, there were two types of response in non-pCR cases: 1) little/no response (28 %) and 2) moderate/marked response (72 %). No HER2 protein positive cells were observed in 7 cases. In these cases persistent tumour cells were either negative for both amplification and protein overexpression or positive only for amplification.</p><p id="Par785"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy effected reduction/elimination of HER2 protein-positive tumour cells even among non-pCR patients. Some patients may need a longer HER2 targeted-therapy for achieving pCR.

Tumour-reactive lymphadenopathy is a complex reaction, which comprises morphological and functional changes that may alter the effect of neoadjuvant therapy in tumour-draining sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) compared to non-SLNs. Differences in the degree of regression induced by neoadjuvant therapy in SLNs and in non-SLNs were investigated.</p><p id="Par799"><bold>Method:</bold> Neoadjuvantly-treated breast cancer patients who underwent SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection were analyzed. All metastatic and non-metastatic SLNs and non-SLNs were evaluated and fibrotic foci in the lymph nodes were interpreted as signs of regression.</p><p id="Par800"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 142 cases, 89 showed signs of nodal regression. Greater regression in non-SLNs was found in 22 cases (22/89 cases, 25 %), whereas 18/89 cases (20 %) were in support of a more pronounced regression in the SLNs.

The appearance of cerebral metastasis usually defines the terminal stage of disease for women suffering from disseminated breast cancer. Understanding the molecular basis of the tumour cells crossing the blood-brain barrier is crucial to prevent metastasis to the brain. Aim of the study: To identify new genes involved in the development of cerebral metastasis in breast cancer patients.</p><p id="Par815"><bold>Method:</bold> The expressional profiles of primary breast cancer samples of patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer with cerebral metastases were compared to the expression profiles of matched tumours of women with metastases to sites other than the brain. For profiling the Illumina WG-DASL RNA platform was used.</p><p id="Par816"><bold>Results:</bold> The cell adhesion associated, oncogene regulated (BOC) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) were significantly highly expressed in breast cancer samples that metastasized to brain as compared to those samples that metastasized to other organs.

Aim: To identify specific pathways involved in brain metastasis of breast cancer.</p><p id="Par823"><bold>Method:</bold> We compared the gene expression profiles of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) primary breast cancer samples of women with metastasized disease, with and without brain involvement. Validations were done by IHC, RT-PCR and by using an in vitro BBB model. In addition, we discovered how T cells change breast cancer cells at the protein level by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS).</p><p id="Par824"><bold>Results:</bold> We found genes related to “T cell response” to be prominently associated with the occurrence of brain metastasis. In functional studies using an in vitro BBB model, breast cancer cells that were co-cultured with T lymphocytes passed the artificial BBB with a 300–600 fold acceleration. Following, we identified 11 differentially expressed proteins in breast cancer cells that were co-cultured with T lymphocytes. After matching these proteins with gene expression profiles of the original patient datasets, we found that the gene for guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) was upregulated in the samples that were associated with cerebral metastasis. Silencing of GBP1 in breast cancer cells resulted in a 30–70 fold decrease of the passage of the breast cancer cells through the BBB model.</p><p id="Par825"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Expressional imprinting of breast cancer cells by T lymphocytes assists in the formation of brain metastases, which is a new insight in the complex interplay of T lymphocytes with cancer cells.

A possible therapeutic role of AR in MBC is emerging in the recent literature. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the X chromosome in MBC development.</p><p id="Par831"><bold>Method:</bold> Seventy-three consecutive MBC cases were reviewed. When present areas of DCIS and gynecomastia surrounding the invasive carcinoma were also studied. Cases were tested by FISH to assess the X chromosome status and AR amplification, ICH for AR expression, and bisulfite-Sequencing for AR DNA methylation.</p><p id="Par832"><bold>Results:</bold> X chromosome gain was observed in 74,7 % invasive MBC, in 20.6 % of DCIS and in 14.6 % of gyecomastia when associated to cancer. AR gene copy number increased parallel to the number of X chromosomes. On ICH, AR expression (positive staining in &gt; 1 % of the neoplastic nuclei), was present in 96.6 % of invasive MBC tested.

Multiple renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) determine the prognoses of BHD patients. Most BHD-RCCs are chromophobe RCCs or hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumours (HOCTs). Differential diagnosis between BHD-RCCs and sporadic counterparts is important because FLCN mutation carriers have high risks of developing bilateral multiple RCCs. The aim of the study is to find useful markers for differentiation between BHD-RCCs and histology-matched sporadic counterparts.</p><p id="Par863"><bold>Method:</bold> We investigated histopathologic characteristics of 67 surgically resected RCCs from BHD patients, using immunostaining, Western blotting, FISH/CISH, and DNA sequencing.</p><p id="Par864"><bold>Results:</bold> Two histologic types, chromophobe RCC and HOCT, accounted for 82 % of BHD-RCCs. Normal-looking cortices often contained oncocytic/clear cell nests. BHD-RCCs showed overexpression of glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB) and underexpression of FLCN, whereas sporadic tumours showed inverted patterns. FISH/CISH analysis for the chromosomes 2p, 3p, 6p and 17q revealed disomic pattern in BHD-RCCs and frequent copy number losses in sporadic counterparts.</p><p id="Par865"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> BHD-RCCs were often indistinguishable from sporadic RCCs in histology but had some characteristic molecular markers.

Although a liquid-based preparation (LBP) technique has been recently applied to overcome these limitations, its clinical utility and its accuracy over CS is controversial. This study aimed to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of LBP in thyroid FNAC by meta-analysis.</p><p id="Par951"><bold>Method:</bold> We searched major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane library, Google Scholar) with queries of “thyroid,” “liquid-based preparation,” and “liquid-based cytology.” Original articles including cytohistologic correlation data comparing the accuracy of any LBP technique, such as ThinPrep, SurePath, and Liqui-Prep, with CS were included for qualitative meta-analysis and preparation of synthesized reporter operating curves (sROC).</p><p id="Par952"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 372 studies were screened and 51 original articles were eligible for full-text review; finally, 24 studies were chosen for the meta-analysis.

Both the authors postulated that PDC has an intermediate behavior between well differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Carcangiu et al. observed that this tumour was de facto identical to the Wuchernde Struma (WS) of Langhans (1907). Interestingly Wegelin (Bern, 1879-1968) recognized that features of benign thyroid trabecular adenomas in cases of WS were “exaggerated in a grotesque way”.

The ICD-10 diagnoses were coincident in up to 75 % (36/48) of the cases. The MIA allowed the identification of the specific pathogens deemed responsible for the death in 25/32 (78 %) of all deaths of infectious origin.</p><p id="Par1001"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> MIA showed a substantial performance for CoD identification in this series of paediatric deaths in Mozambique.

Three cases of NF due to GAS were identified (2003, 2011 and 2016). Histologic sections and clinical data were analyzed. Whole-genome sequencing from the 2016 isolate was performed.</p><p id="Par1008"><bold>Results:</bold> All cases were confirmed by premortem blood cultures and postmortem soft tissue cultures. Lower extremities were the site of infection for all cases. In two cases, the clinical signs of NF were subtle and consisted of localized pedal and malleolar erythema and edema. One case survived for 24 hrs and the other two died within 6 hrs of admission. Histologic evidence of NF and sepsis was present in all cases. The isolate from 2011 was characterized by western immunoblotting and milkplate hydrolysis assay that revealed strong expression of secreted streptococcal cysteine protease (SpeB) that is crucial for severe tissue destruction and dissemination. Whole-genome sequencing of the isolate from 2016 revealed it to be a serotype emm77 strain that has an intact hasABC operon encoding the hyaluronic acid virulence factor. This strain also carried genes encoding superantigens SpeG and SpeK, and TetM tetracycline resistance factor.</p><p id="Par1009"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> NF due to GAS is rapidly progressive and highly lethal, whose initial presentation can be subtle. Deterioration occurs rapidly unless aggressive medical and surgical treatment is started promptly. These cases exemplify GAS infections with subtle clinical presentation and rapid lethal outcome due to expression of several virulence factors and superantigens.</p><p id="Par1010"><bold>OFP-10-010</bold></p><p id="Par1011"><bold>The efficiency of a minimally invasive autopsy diagnosing a disseminated strongyloidiasis</bold></p><p id="Par1012"><underline>I.

Currently, little is known on the prognostic relevance of pre-treatment histopathological features of rectal cancer. In this study we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of histological grading based on the counting of poorly differentiated clusters (PDC) of neoplastic cells in pre-treatment biopsies of rectal cancer submitted to neo-adjuvant CRT.</p><p id="Par1039"><bold>Method:</bold> Grading based on PDC counting was retrospectively applied to 204 pre-treatment endoscopic biopsies of rectal carcinomas treated with neo-adjuvant CRT and surgery.</p><p id="Par1040"><bold>Results:</bold> . Inter-observer agreement in the assessment of PDC grade was good (K: 0,79). High PDC grade was significantly associated with high yT stage (<italic>P</italic> = 0,044), yM+ status (<italic>P</italic> = 0,0004) and unchanged TNM stage or TNM upstaging (<italic>P</italic> = 0,032).

Cell motility of cancer cells contributes to tumour invasion, migration and eventually metastasis. However, the genes associated with cell motility (GO:0048870) had yet been systemically evaluated in RCs.</p><p id="Par1047"><bold>Method:</bold> A comparative analysis of gene expression profiles was applied to a transcriptomic dataset (GSE35452) with focus on genes associated with cell motility, where SERPINB5 was recognized as the most significantly upregulated. 172 primary RCs which underwent neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgical resection were collected. Immunohistochemical study was used to semiquntatively assess the expression level of SERPINB5 protein.</p><p id="Par1048"><bold>Results:</bold> High immunoreactivity of SERPINB5 was significantly linked to pre- and post-CCRT advanced disease, lymphovascualr invasion, and poor response to CCRT (all P ≤ 0.015).

The availability of T790M targeting TKI and the possible unfeasibility of repeated biopsy testing indicate the need for sensitive T790M detection in plasma.</p><p id="Par1279"><bold>Method:</bold> No clinical samples were used due to ethical reasons. All samples were generated using cell line-derived sheared DNA, qualified by digital droplet PCR in quadruple.

Mutations in EGFR, HER2 and BRAF, specific translocations of ALK, ROS1, RET and amplification of MET all have diagnostic importance and lead to specific treatment options for the individual LAC patients. Recently, in 2–4 % of LAC MET gene mutations leading to skipping of exon 14 were found. LAC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations showed impressive responses to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) crizotinib, cabozantinib and capmatinib.

CTCF is mutated in many human malignancies and is implicated as a tumour suppressor gene. Although mouse models of Ctcf haploinsufficiency are susceptible to spontaneous multi-lineage malignancies, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. The objective of this study was to establish how a reduced genomic concentration of Ctcf increases susceptibility to cancer.</p><p id="Par1311"><bold>Method:</bold> We generated Ctcf heterozygous and homozygous mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures and applied chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), proteomics, and chromosome conformation capture (HiC) to decipher potential tumour suppressor mechanisms.</p><p id="Par1312"><bold>Results:</bold> Transcriptome profiling identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes that were highly correlated with their corresponding proteins measured by tandem-mass tag proteomics (Spearman’s rho = 0.65).

We utilize a targeted cancer research panel to estimate tumour mutation burden.</p><p id="Par1343"><bold>Method:</bold> We present a single sample analysis workflow for estimating tumour mutation burden from FFPE research samples. Our assay utilizes a PCR-based target enrichment panel that covers ~1.7 Mb of total genomic space. Our customized workflow requires only 20 ng of input DNA and enables a 2 day turn-around time from sample to the final report. The workflow enables &lt; 60 min of hands-on time for automated library preparation and templating on a batch of 8 samples. Sequencing is performed on high throughput semiconductor sequencing platform to achieve sufficient depth (~500× coverage) and accuracy. Our analysis pipeline calls somatic variants on the tumour sample only, with no matched normal sample, and applies filters to remove germ-line variants.</p><p id="Par1344"><bold>Results:</bold> Through in silico analysis performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data we show that the panel can achieve &gt; 90 % sensitivity and &gt; 95 % specificity to distinguish high and low mutation burden samples. Our filters consistently eliminate ~98 % of germ-line variants from the set of all variants called in a single sample analysis workflow. Evidence from tumour-normal analyses on matched tumour and normal samples suggests that our single sample analysis, on the tumour sample only, detects somatic mutations with high sensitivity and specificity.</p><p id="Par1345"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A simple workflow has been developed on the Ion Torrent sequencing platform to estimate per megabase somatic mutational burden.

However, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is highly fragmented and is usually of low abundance. Therefore, NGS-based assays to detect variants in ctDNA must be sensitive enough to detect mutations at low allele frequencies (&lt;2 %) from &lt;100 ng of highly fragmented DNA. We developed a targeted NGS assay based on Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP™) for sensitive and specific detection of mutations in liquid biopsy-derived ctDNA.</p><p id="Par1351"><bold>Method:</bold> AMP uses unidirectional gene-specific primers and molecular barcoded adapters (MBC) for amplification, enabling enrichment of small ctDNA fragments from a single primer-binding site. MBC adapters permit post-sequencing error correction, reducing background noise and increasing analytical sensitivity.</p><p id="Par1352"><bold>Results:</bold> This assay demonstrates 100 % detection sensitivity for 1 % AF variants using 10 ng DNA input and 71.9 % detection sensitivity for 0.1 % AF variants using 50 ng DNA input.

Pathology, Czech Republic</p><p id="Par1446"><bold>Objective:</bold> DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to cytosine position 5, and play an important role in epigenetic regulation, which could be involved in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) or monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). DNA demethylation is necessary for the epigenetic reprograming of genes and is directly involved in tumour progression. Passive DNA demethylation usually takes place on newly synthesized DNA strands via DNMT1 during replication rounds. Active DNA demethylation occurs during 5-methylcytosine through TET (Ten Eleven Translocation) enzyme-mediated oxidation removal, and this process can be repaired directly by conversion of cytosine via de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b.</p><p id="Par1447"><bold>Method:</bold> The expression of DNA methyltransferase was analysed by RT-PCR in CCL-155 (RPMI-8226) human multiple myeloma cells treated with two types of inhibitor of the DNMTs (5-azacytidine and disulfiram) and one type of histone deacetylase inhibitor (suberic bishydroxamata, SBHA). The impact on gene demethylation and global DNA methylation status were colorimetric assessed.</p><p id="Par1448"><bold>Results:</bold> The expression of DNMT3a in multiple myeloma cells after treatment with disulfiram increased while DNMT1 expression was not changed.

By DEPArrayTM technology, CD30-positive HRS cells were selected and morphologically evaluated. Then, pools of HRS cells and lymphocytes were recovered consecutively and whole genome amplified. Ultimately Ampli1™ LowPass sequencing kit was used to assess genome-wide copy-number aberrations (CNA).</p><p id="Par1456"><bold>Results:</bold> CNA profiles enabled a distinct discrimination of malignant HRS cells from non-malignant lymphocytes: HRS cells exhibited an aberrant CNA profile with multiple gains and losses, while lymphocyte pools showed a generally flat profile.</p><p id="Par1457"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The automated, image-based DEPArray™ sorting technology enables the precise selection and isolation of rare HRS cells from FFPE cHL-derived samples as demonstrated by the aberrant CNA profiles of the purified HRS cells.</p><p id="Par1458"><bold>OFP-14-012</bold></p><p id="Par1459"><bold>Type-I Interferon signature in cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm</bold></p><p id="Par1460"><underline>L.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MXA and phosphorilated STAT1 (p-STAT1) were performed on all samples. RNA was extracted from FFPE sections of 5 cBPDCN, 5 cAML, 4 cLE and 4 NS cases. qRT-PCR was performed for RSAD2, STAT1, SIGLEC1, IFIT1, MXA and IFI27 genes to calculate the Interferon Score (IFN-S)(Rice et al., 2013).</p><p id="Par1464"><bold>Results:</bold> All cLE showed diffuse expression of MXA and pSTAT1 on inflammatory infiltrate and keratinocytes. In 18/19 cBPDCN cases MXA was positive on tumour cells, while its expression in keratinocytes was observed in 6/18, similarly to pSTAT1. MXA and pSTAT1 were negative in cAML and NS. IFN-S was positive (186.137) in all cLE and negative (17.531) in cBPDCN. Interestingly, samples with MXA+ keratinocytes had higher expression of MXA, but not of other genes. Moreover, cAML did not express MXA, but RSAD2, STAT1, SIGLEC1 and IFI27 were higher than in cBPDCN.</p><p id="Par1465"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Data on IFN-I production by BPDCN are conflicting.

PCNSL usually forms a mass; biopsy and histopathological confirmation are necessary for appropriate treatment. Rarely, PCNSL diffusely infiltrates the CNS, with no discrete mass (“lymphomatosis cerebri”). Coupled with corticosteroid effects in a biopsy, this presentation may cause diagnostic delay.</p><p id="Par1471"><bold>Method:</bold> A previously well 21-year-old female presented with progressively unsteady gait and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging showed confluent white matter T2 / FLAIR hyperintensity involving the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and brainstem, consistent with an infective, inflammatory or demyelinating process. Following a clinical diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide were administered without sustained improvement. A brain biopsy performed at an external institution 3 months after presentation showed gliosis and perivascular macrophage infiltrates.</p><p id="Par1472"><bold>Results:</bold> A second biopsy from the right cerebral hemisphere, performed in our centre after severe clinical deterioration in the subsequent 4 months, showed an infiltrative tumour consisting of large pleomorphic lymphoid cells with the immunoperoxidase staining profile of a DLBCL.

The whole surgical specimen was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for histological examination with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains and immunohistochemistry. IDH1 and IDH2 genes sequencing, Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutational analysis and 1/19q Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) were performed separately in tumour fragments with different morphology and immuno-phenotype.</p><p id="Par1480"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination showed distinct oligodendroglial and astrocytic areas. The former retained alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) immuno-expression and had absent staining for p53, while the latter had ATRX loss and p53 over-expression. Gene sequencing disclosed IDH2 mutation in both areas, while oligodendroglial, but not astrocytic areas, had 1p/19q codeletion and Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation. Based on those finding,s low grade dual-genotype oligoastrocytoma was diagnosed.</p><p id="Par1481"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Identification of dual-genotype oligoastrocytoma might be clinically relevant for prognosis and therapy. The incidence of this entity might be underestimated due to sampling biases or to the use of immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses in a limited portion of the tumour. We believe that further analyses on morphologically heterogeneous diffuse gliomas are warranted before dismissing oligoastrocytoma as a distinct nosological entity.</p><p id="Par1482"><bold>OFP-15-003</bold></p><p id="Par1483"><bold>Rhabdoid meningioma: Grading and prognostic significance of this unusual histotype</bold></p><p id="Par1484"><underline>V.

The current outcome is still very poor. Translation initiation regulated by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) is one rate limiting step of protein synthesis. Alterations of eIFs might lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and promote gliomagenesis.</p><p id="Par1495"><bold>Method:</bold> Survival data were retrieved from “The Cancer Genome Atlas” database. Biochemically, eIF expression was analysed in human glioma samples on protein and mRNA level. Additionally, GBM mouse xenografts were treated with established agents and evaluated regarding their eIF expression profile.</p><p id="Par1496"><bold>Results:</bold> Survival analyses showed significantly improved overall survival in GBM patients with low tumour eIF4H levels. Basic characterisation of various eIF subunits in human cancer tissue revealed an up-regulation of eIF4H and additional eIFs on protein and mRNA level. In GBM mouse xenografts, temozolomide and regorafenib significantly down-regulated eIF protein-expression. This decrease could not be observed in temozolomide-resitant GBM models. Combination of temozolomide and other agents did not additionally affect eIF expression.</p><p id="Par1497"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> eIF levels are not only increased during gliomagenesis but also seem to reflect the treatment effectiveness. eIFs might therefore represent novel prognostic and predictive markers for GBM patients and their clinical outcome.</p><p id="Par1498"><bold>OFP-15-005</bold></p><p id="Par1499"><bold>Predictors of long-term outcome in diffuse gliomas</bold></p><p id="Par1500"><underline>E.

Molecular analyses have discovered that almost all SFTs harbour an NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene, being STAT6 immunohistochemistry a reliable surrogate of the fusion gene. Recent 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System restructured SFT and hemangiopericytoma as one entity and adapted a grading system to accommodate this change. We performed STAT6 in all cases diagnosed in our department and reclassified all meningeal cases.</p><p id="Par1527"><bold>Method:</bold> 39 cases of SFT were identified. Clinical information included treatment and patient outcome. Cellularity, mitotic index and necrosis were re-evaluated. STAT6 immunohistochemistry was done in freshly cut sections.

Copy number variations (CNV), gene expression profiling, and the recurrent gene mutations in BAP1, SF3B1, or EIF1AX, can be used to stratify patients for risk of metastatic disease. This study aims to identify whether common chromosomal aberration patterns are related to UM gene mutation status and vice versa, whether the mutations correspond to a specific chromosomal signature in UM.</p><p id="Par1535"><bold>Method:</bold> SNP array data of 214 UM was available. Mutational status of the 5 core genes was determined in 209 tumours. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the array data resulted in five distinct clusters. Based on the mutational status the array data was analyzed for recurring CNV.</p><p id="Par1536"><bold>Results:</bold> BAP1-mutated (immunohistochemical-negative) tumours have the largest CNV in size (whole chromosome or chromosome arms). SF3B1-mutated tumours were characterized by multiple (&gt;3) structural aberrations of the chromosomes. EIF1AX-mutated UM were characterized by a relative lack of UM specific CNV.</p><p id="Par1537"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> UM harbor mutation-specific chromosomal patterns.

The final cytology were re-categorized into 6 major categories by two independent cytopathologists, as 1- Non-diagnostic, 2- Non-neoplastic, 3- Atypia of undetermined significance, 4a-Neoplastic, benign and 4b- neoplastic, uncertain malignant potential, 5-suspicious for malignancy, and 6- malignant. The risk of malignancy (ROM) and the overall ROM (OROM) for each diagnostic category were determined.</p><p id="Par1576"><bold>Results:</bold> There was near perfect agreement on category assignments. The results for OROM in the categories 1, 2, and 3, were 5, 9, and 15 %, respectively.

At first all the slides were prepared using Cytospin-3 and evaluated cytologically. Then immunocytochemical assay was performed using biochip and fluorescent microscope. Biochip is a device with 15 equal individual cells. Each cell has a transparent bottom with adhesive cover containing MA Ber-EP4, conjugated to fluorochrome Cy3. And finally all the material was stained conventionally in azure-eosin for reanalysis.</p><p id="Par1584"><bold>Results:</bold> In 86 cases, 35 effusions were malignant, 19 had only reactive mesothelial cells and 32 were suspicious for malignancy. In 35 cases, 33 were confirmed by biochip-FICC as metastatic effusions and 2 had negative ICC. One of them was subsequently characterized as non-specific effusion, the other one turned out to be a metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. In 19 (negative for malignancy) cases, 12 had no reactions with Ber-EP4, but 7 were Ber-EP4-positive, that confirmed the presence of tumour. The other 32 specimens (37 % of all cases) required FICC, and tumour cells were identified in 15 of them.</p><p id="Par1585"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FICC on biochips is a reliable and rapid method for cytological diagnostics of serous effusions. This technique allows to identify few cells and small groups of cells that may be missed in conventional cytology, thereby reducing the frequency of hyper- and hypodiagnosis. Ease of use is also one of the advantages—It doesn’t take much time and has no complications in preanalytic phase.</p><p id="Par1586"><bold>OFP-16-005</bold></p><p id="Par1587"><bold>Predictive accuracy of thyroseq v2 for malignant thyroid nodules among Bethesda-III cytology subcategories: Atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS)</bold></p><p id="Par1588"><underline>I.

In general, a double probe fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) test is used, whereby also loss and gain of the centromere of chromosome 17 can be observed.

Improvements concerning the individual treatment modalities play a great role in prognosis and disease free survival. As c-erbB-2 expression directly affects the treatment of breast cancer, this feature is routinely evaluated by immunohistochemistry in many laboratories. However, the immunohistochemical evaluation of c-erbB-2 possesses several challenges and pitfalls mainly related to the c-erbB-2 clones used, variabilities among the observers, and some morphological characteristics of tumour. This study is designated to investigate the differences between the two frequently used c-erbB-2 clones, CB11 and 4B5.</p><p id="Par1712"><bold>Method:</bold> C-erbB-2 scores of 218 breast cancer cases were overviewed retrospectively for 18 months’ period of time.</p><p id="Par1713"><bold>Results:</bold> Consequently, there were much more 2+ scores with clone-CB11 compared to that of 4B5.

A possible mechanism explaining the TNBC resistance to all types of therapy could be the activation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). In turn, interleukin-8 (IL-8) is considered as the main promoter of CSCs activity. The aim of the study is to evaluate the real synthesis of IL-8 in tissues of patients with TNBC.</p><p id="Par1720"><bold>Method:</bold> The primary cultures of TNBC were obtained from tumour specimens of 18 patients. The IL-8 level in the culture supernatants was determined by ELISA. The presence of IL-8 cognate receptor, CXCR1, was detected by immunohistochemistry both in primary cultures and tumour tissues.</p><p id="Par1721"><bold>Results:</bold> High IL-8 concentrations (700–7000 pg/ml) were found in 6 of 18 TNBC culture supernatants (33 %). Four cases showed relatively low IL-8 levels (50–250 pg/ml) and IL-8 was undetectable in 8 tumour supernatants (44 %).

Despite aggressive treatment with surgery and radiotherapy of DCIS, the incidence of higher stage breast cancer has not decreased, suggesting overtreatment of DCIS exists. Therefore it is important to distinguish aggressive from indolent DCIS. As the immune microenvironment plays an important role in cancer progression, we aim to assess the composition of an immune cell marker panel for DCIS lesions in a pilot study.</p><p id="Par1800"><bold>Method:</bold> A representative series of 34 paraffin-embedded DCIS lesions was studied with multispectral immunohistochemical analysis, providing simultaneous detection and quantitation of CD20 + B-cells, CD8 + T-cells, CD4 + T-cells, FoxP3 + regulatory T-cells, CD68 + macrophages and pankeratin.</p><p id="Par1801"><bold>Results:</bold> Multispectral immunohistochemical quantification showed a range of 50 to 600 stromal lymphocytes/mm2 in DCIS cases. CD20 + B-cells, CD8 + T-cells, CD4 + T-cells, FoxP3 + CD4+ regulatory T-cells and CD68 + macrophages were successfully and simultaneously detected in stromal and in situ compartments.</p><p id="Par1802"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Multispectral immunohistochemical analysis by simultaneous detection of CD20, CD8, CD4, FoxP3, CD68 and pankeratin is feasible in DCIS lesions. This panel will later be analysed in our nationwide DCIS cohort (1989-2004, median follow-up 12,9 years) for correlation with outcome.</p><p id="Par1803"><bold>PS-01-021</bold></p><p id="Par1804"><bold>Idiopathic lobular granulomatous mastitis: Retrospective study of 33 cases</bold></p><p id="Par1805"><underline>Y.

Scattered solid polypoidal areas were noted, the largest measuring 20 mm. Two sentinel lymph nodes were excised. Histologically the tumour was an encysted papillary carcinoma of predominately intermediate nuclear pleomorphic grade. Mitoses were abundant. There was no evidence of conventional invasion. Unexpected for these types of breast carcinomas, one of the sentinel lymph nodes contained a macrometastasis (12 mm) of encysted papillary carcinoma.

The optical chain of XDFI consists of an asymmetrically cut, Bragg-type monochromator-collimator that provides a planar monochromatic X-ray beam which passes through the specimen mounted on a precision positioning stage; the X-ray beam exiting the specimen is split into dark and bright field images by a Laue-case angle analyser.

So far, we have shown that XDFI can provide images equivalent to the low to medium power light microscopes. XDFI-computed tomography (XDFI-CT) is also effective for three-dimensional rendering of anatomical structures such as breast lobules, the three layers of arteries, and articular cartilage; these features are barely visible in conventional absorption-based images. XDFI of breast tissue can discriminate between normal tissue, diseased terminal duct lobular units such as those present in cases of pure adenosis, and the involvement of lobular carcinoma in situ.

AME is frequently regarded as a benign tumour, but local recurrence or malignant transformation have been reported. The association of AME with lobular neoplasia is very rare, with only one previously reported case in the literature.</p><p id="Par2048"><bold>Method:</bold> A 42-year-old female presented with a solid mass in her right breast. Core needle biopsy of the lesion showed lobular neoplasm.</p><p id="Par2049"><bold>Results:</bold> In the serial sections of the excional biopsy, a solid, well-circumscribed, gray-white, firm nodule was observed. Histologically, the tumour had a biphasic nature, composed of cuboidal to columnar, epithelial-lined tubules surrounded by myoepithelial cells. In some areas, dyscohesive neoplastic cells were observed filling the glandular structures. Immunohistochemically, the myoepithelial cells were positive with p63 and smooth-muscle actin, and there was absence of e-cadherin expression in the dyscohesive groups. The lesion was diagnosed as AME with atypical lobular hyperplasia.</p><p id="Par2050"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Due to the heterogeneity of the tumour, there may be diagnostic errors in needle biopsies.

Chondroid matrix is rarely seen in benign conditions of human breast, so its presence raises a difficult differential diagnostic dilemma.</p><p id="Par2088"><bold>Method:</bold> We present the case of a 71-years-old woman who was found with a breast tumour, with imaging features of a lipoma in her left breast, during routine mammographic control, which was excised.</p><p id="Par2089"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, the tumour had 4 cm maximum diameter and was circumscribed with fatty consistency. Histologically, the tumour consisted of mature adipocytes admixed with nests of vacuolated lipoblasts and ovoid cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and slightly pleomorphic nuclei, embedded in a prominent myxoid or hyalinized chondroid matrix. Mitoses or necrosis were absent. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells expressed vimentin, CD34, CD68. S100 was detected in mature adipocytes.

At the time of the diagnosis, tumours were classified T1 and T2 (8 cases), N1 (1 case) and M1 (1 case). The histological examination showed 4 cases of solid neuroendocrine carcinoma, 3 cases of large cell type and two cases of atypical carcinoid. All tumours were positive for chromogranin and 80 % of them were reactive for synaptophysin. Six tumours (60 %) were estrogen receptor-positive and 7 (70 %) progesterone receptor-positive. All tumours were negative for HER2/neu. All patients had surgical treatment with radical mastectomy in 7 cases. One patient had metastasis in the mediastinum. Adjuvant treatment was indicated according to histopronostic elements.</p><p id="Par2138"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast is an unknown and rare pathologic entity due to its rare incidence and lack of definitive criteria for diagnosis.

The optimal treatment of ACC has not yet been determined. A case report of an ACC of the breast is reported that recurred in the axilla, 2 years after simple mastectomy and a negative lymph node biopsy.</p><p id="Par2144"><bold>Method:</bold> A 73-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to the mammographic finding of a 1,3 cm density of her left breast. The woman underwent a total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Two years later, the woman diagnosed with an enlarged lymph node of her left axilla. The woman underwent axillary lymph node dissection and chemotherapy.</p><p id="Par2145"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologic examination of the tumour density of the left breast was diagnostic of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast. Sentinel lymph nodes were free of tumour deposits.

Further decrease in expression of E-cadherin was observed during tumour progression. Decrease in membrane expression and emergence of nuclear expression of β-catenin was observed in grade 2 and grade 3 carcinomas.

To our knowledge, spindle cell adenolipoma of the breast has not been reported.</p><p id="Par2248"><bold>Method:</bold> Here we present spindle cell adenolipoma in 63-year-old woman with histological and immunohistochemical work-up.</p><p id="Par2249"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient presented with a mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Ultrasound showed a well demarcated lobulated mass measuring 13.5 × 7.3 mm with a mixture of high and low echoic areas. There was no blood flow signal. Fine aspiration cytology was reported as negative. Excisional biopsy revealed a lesion composed of myxoid spindle cells, mature adipocytes and mammary glandular tissue.</p><p id="Par2250"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our case is a mammary analogue of cutaneous spindle cell adenolipoma. It can be viewed as a variant of breast hamartomas because it appears non-homogenous mass with circumscribed fatty mass.</p><p id="Par2251"><bold>PS-01-087</bold></p><p id="Par2252"><bold>Breast cancer in patients aged 90 years and older: Pathological characteristics and molecular subtypes in a series of 40 cases</bold></p><p id="Par2253"><underline>S.

The management of primary hyperparathyroidism is surgical. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) requires the clear localisation of a parathyroid lesion. Ultrasound (US)-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) can successfully localize abnormal parathyroid tissue. This technique can be limited by the coexisting goiter and previous surgical procedures in the neck. The measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in needle washout fluids has been reported to increase the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB in preoperative localizing of pathological parathyroid glands and their discriminating from thyroid tissue and neck lymph nodes.</p><p id="Par2296"><bold>Method:</bold> FNAB/PTH samples from 27 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and one patient with suspicious of parathyroid carcinoma metastasis were evaluated and compared with subsequent surgery.</p><p id="Par2297"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty six patients yielded elevated PTH level &gt; 3000 pg/ml. Twenty three of these patients underwent MIP, and 3 patients are awaiting a surgical procedure. Histopathologic examination of excised abnormal parathyroid tissue confirmed parathyroid adenoma in 20 and hyperplasia in 3 patients.</p><p id="Par2298"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The combined approach of cytology and measurement of PTH levels in needle washout provides high diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of US-guided FNAB for preoperative localisation of parathyroid lesions.</p><p id="Par2299"><bold>PS-02-008</bold></p><p id="Par2300"><bold>GATA-3 immunoreactivity expands the transcription factor profile of pituitary neuroendocrine tumours</bold></p><p id="Par2301"><underline>M.

Mete</p><p id="Par2302"><sup>*</sup>Ondokuz Mayis University, Dept. of Pathology, Samsun, Turkey</p><p id="Par2303"><bold>Objective:</bold> The classification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (pitNETs) uses immunohistochemistry for transcription factors, adenohypophyseal hormones and other biomarkers. The transcription factor GATA-2 is required for the development of gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs but to our knowledge has not been used in the diagnosis of pitNETs. Because of the genomic paralogy of GATA-2 and GATA-3, we postulated that antibodies to GATA-3 may detect GATA-2 in pitNETs. For this reason, we investigated the expression profile of GATA-3 in a series of pitNETs.</p><p id="Par2304"><bold>Method:</bold> A series of 81 pitNETs (26 gonadotroph, 24 somatotroph, 17 corticotroph, 12 lactotroph, and 2 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumours that expressed beta-TSH) was investigated with a monoclonal GATA-3 antibody using an automated stainer. Nuclear positivity for GATA-3 was scored as follows: 0 (0–5 %), 1 (6–25 %), 2 (26–50 %), 3 (51–75 %), and 4 (&gt;75 %).</p><p id="Par2305"><bold>Results:</bold> With the exception of a few entrapped non-tumourous adenohypophyseal cells, all corticotroph, somatotroph, and lactotroph tumours lacked GATA-3 expression. All gonadotroph tumours were positive (score 4). Two poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumours that expressed beta-TSH were also positive for GATA-3 (score 3).</p><p id="Par2306"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This cohort showed that GATA-3 identifies positivity in gonadotroph tumours and in poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumours that express beta-TSH. This finding is important in the differential diagnosis of sellar tumours since GATA-3 expression has been reported in paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas, parathyroid proliferations and carcinomas that may metastasize to the sella. Further studies are required to clarify the distinction of GATA-2 and GATA-3 in this application.</p><p id="Par2307"><bold>PS-02-009</bold></p><p id="Par2308"><bold>Evaluation of the expression of transcription factors of neuro D1, Pitx1 and Pit1 in human pituitary adenomas</bold></p><p id="Par2309"><underline>L.

The immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against Ki-67, Neuro D1, Pitx1, Pit1 and the six hormones of the anterior pituitary.</p><p id="Par2313"><bold>Results:</bold> The expression of Neuro D1 was observed in 90 % of gonadotropic cells, in 85 % of prolactin cells, in 94 % of corticotropic cells and in 39 % cells of the normal adenohypophysis, on the average. The expression of Pitx1 was found in 19 % of prolactin cells, in 4 % of corticotropic cells, in 13 % of the normal adenohypophysis, on the average, and was not observed in gonadotropic cells. The Pit1 expression was observed in 0,45 % of prolactin cells, in 16,5 % cells of the normal adenohypophysis, on the average, and was not detected in gonadotropinomas and corticotropinomas. There was not any significant correlation between the expression level of transcription factors and Ki-67.</p><p id="Par2314"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The transcription factors Neuro D1, Pit1 and Pitx1 remain important for the normal adenohypophysis in adult humans.

In one of the cases, CD10 and CD56 were expressed by the luminal membrane of parathyroid cells. CD31, as well as CD68, were expressed in monocytes/macrophages located dispersely between parathyroid cells (interparathyroid sinusoids) or in parathyroid vesicles. Several monocytes/macrophages expressed also CD10 and/or CD56.</p><p id="Par2322"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, heterogeneous CD324 expression in parathyroid cells may only indirectly be related to vesicle and cyst formation while CD56 and CD10 expressions seem incidental.

However, atypical cells are rare in papillary thyroid carcinomas(PTC), and only an article had been published that presents four cases. It was presented five cases of encapsulated follicular variant PTC with atypical cells.</p><p id="Par2488"><bold>Method:</bold> Five cases of PTC with atypical cells were detected in examinated thyroidectomy specimens between 2005 and 2017. The clinical and pathologic findings and survive were investigated.</p><p id="Par2489"><bold>Results:</bold> One of the patient was male, others were female. The mean age was 30 years (range 14–50). All the patients were treated with I131 ablation once and no recurrence was detected in the 5-year follow-up. Histologically, PTC was seen as encapsulated nodules between 2.5 and 6.7 cm in diameter in all cases. The nodules was composed of follicles showing nuclear features of PTC. In some follicles, there were atypical cells with large, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei.</p><p id="Par2490"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite the presence of atypical cells, these tumours do not differ in survival from other encapsulated follicular variant PTC. However, PTC with atypical cells should be kept in mind that it can be confused with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, especially in cytologic diagnosis.</p><p id="Par2491"><bold>PS-02-035</bold></p><p id="Par2492"><bold>A rare type of thyroid tumour: Primary epithelioid angiosarcoma</bold></p><p id="Par2493"><underline>M.

Baris</p><p id="Par2494"><sup>*</sup>Ondokuz Mayis University, Dept. of Pathology, Samsun, Turkey</p><p id="Par2495"><bold>Objective:</bold> The primary angiosarcoma of the thyroid is a malignant tumour with endothelial differentiation. It is often observed in Alpine countries of Central Europe, generally in patients with prolonged nodular goiter associated with iodine deficiency. In this report, morphologic and proteomic findings of primary thyroid angiosarcoma are discussed with its differential diagnosis.</p><p id="Par2496"><bold>Method:</bold> A 47-year-old male patient had neck and ear pain for 1 year. Ultrasonography revealed a poorly circumscribed hypoechoic mass at the thyroid right lobe-isthmus. FNA biopsy was positive for malignancy and total thyroidectomy and right functional neck dissection were performed.</p><p id="Par2497"><bold>Results:</bold> Gross findings showed that a 3.5 × 2.7 × 1 cm solid mass with irregular margins and hemorrhagic areas completely filled the right lobe and extended to the isthmus. Histopathologically, the mass was consisted of atypical mesenchymal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasms with partly fusiform, partly epithelioid features and chromatin-rich nuclei. Scattered multinucleated tumour cells were also observed. Immunohistochemically, tumoural cells were positive for CD31, Fli-1 and vimentin; focally positive for D2-40, pancytokeratin and CD34 and negative for TTF1, thyroglobulin, Pax-8, cytokeratin20, HBM45 and CEA. Systemic scanning of the patient revealed no other lesions and with the morphological and immunohistochemical findings the patient was diagnosed as primary thyroid angiosarcoma.</p><p id="Par2498"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Primary thyroid angiosarcoma causes difficulties in the differential diagnosis, because they imitate the pseudoangiomatous patterns and the reactive atypical and benign vascular proliferations occurring with primary and secondary thyroid malignancies. Since primary thyroid angiosarcoma has different clinical, histological and immunohistochemical features, its differentiation from undifferentiated carcinoma is particularly important.</p><p id="Par2499"><bold>PS-02-036</bold></p><p id="Par2500"><bold>Composite pheochromocytoma-ganglioneuroma of the adrenal gland: Case report</bold></p><p id="Par2501"><underline>G.

Rontogianni</p><p id="Par2502"><sup>*</sup>Evangelismos General Hospital, Pathology, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par2503"><bold>Objective:</bold> Composite pheochromocytoma (CP) is a rare tumour that combines features of pheochromocytoma with those of ganglioneuroma (&gt;70 % of cases), ganglioneuroblastoma, neuroblastoma or peripheral nerve sheath tumour.</p><p id="Par2504"><bold>Method:</bold> We present a case of composite pheochromocytoma-ganglioneuroma of the right adrenal gland of a 37-year-old male patient. Grossly an encapsulated tumour arising from the adrenal gland was observed, measuring 4.5 × 4 × 2 cm and weighing 20 gr. The cut surface was tan brown partially pale.</p><p id="Par2505"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically the tumour was composed predominantly of areas with features of pheochromocytoma, focally exhibiting pronounced nuclear pleomorpism. A second component intermixed with the pheochromocytoma was identified, consisting of ganglion-like cells, in a fibrillary schwannian stroma arranged in transverse bundles. Immunohistochemicaly the pheochromocytoma cells were positive for Chromogranin-A and Synaptophysin. Staining for neurofilament proteins highlighted the ganglion cells and axon-like processes. S-100 was expressed in the sustentacular and schwann cells.</p><p id="Par2506"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The histogenesis of composite tumours has been attributed to the common embryologic origin of the chromaffin and neuronal cells. Differentiation of pheochromocytoma cells into neuronal cells has been also suggested. CPs are often associated with familial neoplasm syndromes (neurofibromatosis type 1 or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A). Composite tumours containing ganglioneuroma without immature neural elements have the same prognosis as pheochromocytoma.</p><p id="Par2507"><bold>PS-02-037</bold></p><p id="Par2508"><bold>Ultrastructural features of cellar interactions in pancreatic insulinomas</bold></p><p id="Par2509"><underline>O.

Male to female ratio was 10:28. The average age was 48.2 years. All the tumours were clinically benign. The electron and histological study of the removed tumours was conducted.</p><p id="Par2513"><bold>Results:</bold> In 39,5 % the tumour was localized in the head, in 24 % - in the tail, in 36 % - in the body. Tumour’s size ranged from 0.8 to 5.5 cm. G1 was present in 84 %. G2 was present in six cases. Ultrastructurely two main β-cell phenotypes in different stages of functional activity were detected: “the light cells” were dominated by the processes of synthesis of granules; “the dark cells”, in which the processes of hormone secretion outside the cell membrane were actively running. The two cell types were connected by the desmosomal junctions. In the area of contact of adjacent cell’s cytomembrane the portions of the cytoplasmic fusion with the formation of cytoplasmic bridges were determined. This resulted in the formation of syncytium-like structures. These changes were more common between “the light cells”.</p><p id="Par2514"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Through the cytoplasmic bridges the metabolic processes of nutrients and secretory material occure. Perhaps, it is a condition for the release of granules synchronization processes in the bloodstream. Syncytium-like structure due to the large size cannot penetrate through the fenestrated capillary, eliminating the possibility of the formation of the secondary tumours. Moreover, their production makes it impossible to complete the next cell division and progression of the tumour stops.</p><p id="Par2515"><bold>PS-02-038</bold></p><p id="Par2516"><bold>Metastasis in a cervical lymph node of two metachronous primary tumours</bold></p><p id="Par2517"><underline>D.

No capsular or vascular invasions were observed. The tumour was characterized by trabecular structures separated by fibrous stroma with many calcifications. The intra-trabecular hyalin was prominent with PAS positivity and Congo Red negativity. Alveolar structures were also present, partitioned by sinus vascular network. The tumour cells were oval with an acidophilic or clear cytoplasm. The nuclei were round with frequent pseudoinclusions. Immunohistochemical study showed positivity for thyroglobulin and negativity for calcitonin, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, galectin 3 and hormone receptors.

The increased use of screening systems, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the incidental detection is increasing in frequency.</p><p id="Par2544"><bold>Method:</bold> We report a case of adrenal giant mass that detected incidentally in 44-year-old female with no symptoms. There was no finding in physical examination. Abdominal MRI scan revealed a well-demarcated, round shaped lesion which was 10 × 8 cm sized and located in left adrenal region with heterogenous attenuation suggesting the possibility of myelolipoma.

After that a clinicopathological correlation was done trying to establish her underlying cause of death. Moreover, a brief histopathological review about possible diseases was done.</p><p id="Par2553"><bold>Results:</bold> Mary Tudor was the eldest child of King Henry VIII of England. Since her childhood, Mary suffered from emotional disorders. Queen Mary believed herself to be pregnant for twice, but no child ever born. During Mary’s I life her main symptoms were: amenorrhoea, depression, headaches, palpitation, indigestion, blurry vision, swelling of the abdomen and milk secretion.

We reevaluated our cases to this new classification to investigate the efficacy.</p><p id="Par2560"><bold>Method:</bold> Case selection was made using our institute’s database. Patients who have undergone radical surgery with lymph node resection were chosen. Only the usual type endocervical adenocarcinoma was included. 6 cases were involved in this study.

Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Italy</p><p id="Par2575"><bold>Objective:</bold> Ulipristal acetate (UPA) is an oral selective progesterone-receptor modulator (SPRM). Progesterone receptor modulators (PRM) are hormonally active drugs effective in the management of uterine leiomyomas (ULMs). The histological endometrial changes associated with PRM treatment have been described as PAEC (PRM Associated Endometrial Changes), but the morphological features of ULMs treated with PRMs are currently not well-defined. The aim of the study was to describe and evaluate the PRM-associated changes in ULMs.</p><p id="Par2576"><bold>Method:</bold> Here, the histopathological features of ten ULMs treated with UPA are reported.</p><p id="Par2577"><bold>Results:</bold> In all patients ULMs were multiple, lesions greater than 5 cm showed grossly marked cyst appearance and were more softened and paler than the usual leiomyoma. The morphological changes included vascular alterations (thick-walled blood vessels, lymphangioma-like appearance of the vessels, intravascular thrombi, contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels), and degenerative alterations of the intratumoural stroma such as cystic formation, marked stromal oedema, mixoid change and/or hyalinization. Rarely, apoplectic changes (multiple stellate to ovoid zones with a hypercellular periphery and central hemorrhage, mitotic activity, pyknosis and necrosis) were observed.</p><p id="Par2578"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In order to appropriately classify these benign tumours, pathologists should be aware of PRM-associated morphological changes in ULMs that may represent a response to the treatment.

Microscopically the tumour consisted of polygonal cells with abundant microvacuolized clear cytoplasm arranged in a solid pattern. The neoplastic cells were immunohistochemically positive for inhibin and calretinin and negative for CD10, excluding the possibility of metastatic CCRC. A diagnosis of ovarian steroid cell tumour was made. Only three cases with this association have been reported.

Transcription factor PAX8 has been widely used as a sensitive and reliable marker for distinction in both cytology specimens or in surgical pathology specimens. However, whether there is a gender difference in the expression of this marker in mesothelia or if reactive status affects its expression has not yet been well evaluated. The goal of this study is to examine whether mesothelium is immunopositive for PAX8 in some settings, which may cause diagnostic problems in difficult cases.</p><p id="Par2720"><bold>Method:</bold> Immunochemistry was carried out using PAX8 antibody on archival tissue from 50 peritoneum (25 women and 25 men) with either inactive mesothelia or reactive mesothelial cells and nuclear reactivity in more than 5 % of cells was considered positive.</p><p id="Par2721"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty percent (10/50) of the cases were focally positive for PAX8, especially in reactive mesothelia (7/10) of female patients (9/10).</p><p id="Par2722"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Reactive mesothelial cells of female patients tend to have focal immunoreactivity for PAX8, which may cause a diagnostic pitfall, especially in small biopsies or cytological specimens.

The cervical smear had shown ASCUS or HSIL and the initial cervical biopsy showed either high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) or squamous cell carcinoma. All patients underwent a Wertheim operation, two of which were preceded by a cervicectomy. Microscopically, all tumours were characterized by poorly defined sheets of undifferentiated squamous cells with a syncytial pattern and a heavily lymphocyte-infiltrated background. On immunohistochemical analysis, the lymphocytes were predominantly CD3 and CD8 positive. The CD8-positive lymphocytes were the only ones found within tumour lobules. CD4-positive and CD20-positive lymphocytes were around tumour lobules. Scattered cells were positive for CD56 and CD79. An ISH staining for EBER was negative. All cases were positive for P16 by immunohistochemistry.

Since 2013 in our Pathology department we had 5 cases of immature teratoma among 120 cases of teratomas. Patients were of reproductive age, 16–38 year old. The average diameter of the tumours was 16 cm (11–24 cm). Three were solid and partially cystic and two were predominantly cystic.</p><p id="Par2856"><bold>Method:</bold> Sufficient sampling of the tumours was taken and a three tiered grading system was used.

The mean age group is 55 years old (range: 26–78 years old) and the prevalence is 5 % of all ovarian neoplasms, in which tumours of unknown origin account for 14 % of the cases. The proportion of metastatic ovarian neoplasms varies according to the geographic region, ranging from 3 to 15 % in western countries, to 21–30 % in the eastern countries.</p><p id="Par2912"><bold>Method:</bold> Our case is of a 62 years old female, who presented with post-menopausal bleeding. Her endometrial curetting showed groups of signet-ring like cells, this initiated a battery of investigations and a subsequent hysterectomy. On histology, there was an extensive infiltration of signet-ring cell tumour involving ovaries, uterus and cervix. Immunohistochemistry pointed towards a gastrointestinal primary; however, both endoscopy, CT and PET scan failed to find a primary origin.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy was negative in all patients. Due to very short disease-free interval, further treatments were started without substantial response in all patients. Histopathological examination revealed a mucinous carcinoma, with a predominant component of signet-ring cells and focal neuroendocrine features, involving both ovaries with loco-regional spread. Immunohistochemical analyses showed positivity for Keratins (pankeratin, CK7 ,CK19, CK20), E-cadherin, EMA and CDX-2, and focal staining for p16, calretinin and neuroendocrine markers.

A previous study demonstrated that a mitotic index cut off of 25 mitoses/10 high power fields (corresponding to 11.16 mitotic figures/mm2) could successfully divide these tumours into two prognostic groups with significantly different overall survival.

The admixture of large hydropic villi with circumscribed trophoblastic hyperplasia and smaller, normal-appearing villi without trophoblastic hyperplasia was observed in all cases. The cytotrophoblasts and stromal cells in the larger villi were negative for p57 (androgenic) and TSCC3, whereas these cells were positive in the smaller villi (biparental). Two cases were CM with foci of placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD). Two patients delivered live babies, and 2 patients with CM with twins developed lung metastasis.</p><p id="Par3010"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Immunohistochemical analysis is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of twin placenta with CM and morphologically similar conditions. In the present study, 2 cases were not twins with CM, but rather were diagnosed as CM with an androgenic/biparental chimera or mosaic molar gestation and PMD.

Double staining immunohistochemistry (D2-40/CD31) was performed to highlight lymphatic and blood vessels in the same slide.

The impact of MELF invasion on the overall survival of patients was estimated.</p><p id="Par3025"><bold>Results:</bold> MELF type invasion was present in 22 % cases. The majority of MELF positive tumours were grade 1 or grade 2 (93 %). MELF pattern invasion was observed mostly in FIGO stage IB (46 % ). The frequency of lymphatic vessels invasion was significantly higher in MELF positive tumours than in MELF negative tumours (66 % vs 22 %, respectively). The frequency of blood vessels invasion was twice as common in MELF positive than in MELF negative tumours (22 % vs. 10 %, respectively).

In 63 cases (23 BRCA1/2-associated and 40 sporadic), data on platinum-free interval (PFI) were available. BRCA1/2-associated cases demonstrated longer PFI compared to sporadic OCs (6.9 vs 4.0 months, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013). Neither BRCA1/2-mutated nor sporadic OCs showed correlation between pathologic response and PFI duration.

Even when serous carcinomas are minimally invasive or confined to the endometrium, it seems that advanced-stage disease or recurrence is common.

It accounts for 2.5–10 % of parotid gland lesions. The coexistence of tuberculosis with Warthin’s tumour (WT) is extremely uncommon and very few cases have been reported in the literature. We report a new case of a WT associated with tuberculosis in order to discuss the possible mechanisms of this association.</p><p id="Par3360"><bold>Method:</bold> The histological features of this association are described with a review of the related literature.</p><p id="Par3361"><bold>Results:</bold> A 53-year-old man, with no personal history of tuberculosis, presented with a right parotid mass measuring 4.5 cm. An exofacial parotidectomy with a lymph node biopsy were performed. Frozen section of the parotid mass concluded to WT. Paraffin sections confirmed this diagnosis and revealed the presence in the lymphoid stroma of multiple epithelioid granulomas with caseous necrosis. Histological examination of the lymph node revealed epithelioid granulomas without necrosis. Further clinical and radiological investigations didn’t show another location of tuberculosis.

The global microbiome of bile juice and its association with GB diseases was not investigated yet.</p><p id="Par3384"><bold>Method:</bold> We performed metagenomic sequencing on bile samples from ten healthy individuals, 14 patients with GB diseases, including chronic calculous cholecystitis (CCC), acute cholangitis and cancer. The clinicopathological characteristics were compared between CCC with normal and dysbiotic microbiome patterns.</p><p id="Par3385"><bold>Results:</bold> All normal bile samples were consistently composed of six major genera: Pseudoalteromonas, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Cetobacterium, Propionibacterium, and Gamaproteobacteria. Bile juice microbiome from patients with GB diseases dominated by Enterobaceriacea. Especially, Citrobacter was abundant in bile from GB cancer and a subset of CCC. CCC with dysbiosis showed marked epithelial atypia, severe active inflammation with wall thickening, and large gallstones (&gt;3 cm), whereas CCC with normal microbiome pattern revealed mild chronic inflammation without any active lesion. On immunohistochemical staining, CCC with dybiosis showed focal p16 expression, weak membranous EGFR and HER2 expression, and higher Ki-67 labelling. However, CCC without dysbiosis showed negative expressions of p16, EGFR and HER2 with low Ki-67 labelling. No KRAS mutation was identified in both groups.</p><p id="Par3386"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We identified normal flora in bile juice of healthy individuals and demonstrated association of dysbiosis with GB diseases. The histologic findings and immunohistochemical results also can support that dysbiosis may be associated with chronic active lesion with epithelial atypia, which can lead to develop precancerous or malignant lesion.<table-wrap id="Tabu"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><p>Sunday, 3 September 2017, 09:30–10:30, Hall 3</p><p><bold>PS-05 Pulmonary Pathology</bold></p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.</p><p id="Par3387"><bold>PS-05-001</bold></p><p id="Par3388"><bold>Is peritumoural lymphocyte infiltration predictor for PDL-1 positive patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?</bold></p><p id="Par3389"><underline>Z.

Immune checkpoint inhibition has shifted treatment paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). T regulatory cells play important roles in immune suppression, the reversal of which is vitally important for the success of immune therapy. Conflicting results have been reported regarding the immune infiltrate and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a prognostic marker. We correlated the peritumoural immune infiltrate and PD-L1 expression with clinicopathologic characteristics of resected with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC</p><p id="Par3392"><bold>Method:</bold> Tumour slides of surgical specimens of 50 cases with lung cancer diagnosed in our department from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed retrospectively.

Imaging techniques such as Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) or Multiphoton Laser Scanning Microsopy (MLSM) can alleviate part of the problems associated to conventional imaging techniques, and in certain cases can eliminate the need for tissue removal. We attempt to contribute in this regard by discussing a series of data sets collected on H&amp;E-stained sections of Acinar Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma by Bright Microscopy (BM) and CLSM.</p><p id="Par3400"><bold>Method:</bold> We employed a correlative imaging approach in which H&amp;E stained lung tissue sections were imaged with BM and CLSM. BM images have been collected using a Leica DM3000 system, while Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy data sets were acquired using a Nikon C2+ system working in fluorescence.

For lung cancers, especially non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), two immune checkpoints, PD-1 and PD-L1, have emerged as important targets for immunotherapy. Our aim is to correlate immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD-L1 with clinicopathological parameters in NSCLC.</p><p id="Par3504"><bold>Method:</bold> We examined 99 cases of invasive NSCLC, including 41 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 58 adenocarcinomas (ADCs), resected in our institution for a recent 2-year period. One representative histologic section of each case was immunostained with anti-PD-L1 antibody. The extent of immunoreactive tumour cells and infiltrating intratumoural lymphocytes was respectively scored in a semiquantitative fashion. The proportion score (PS) was statistically correlated with multiple clinicopathological parameters. In addition, for the purpose of dichotomization, immunoreactivity seen in &gt; 1 % of tumour cells was considered IHC “positive”.</p><p id="Par3505"><bold>Results:</bold> PD-L1 PS was significantly higher in SCCs than in ADCs (<italic>p</italic> = .0154), and 56.1 and 32.8 % IHC “positive” cases were found, respectively.

None had received chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 (22C3 pharmDx) and CD8 was performed. PD-L1 was semiquantitatively scored in tumour cells (TC). Intratumoural (TILs) and stromal (TSs) lymphocytes were estimated with CD8. Results were correlated with clinical and pathological information (chi square and Fisher tests).

Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PD-L1 gene, rs4143815, rs822336, and rs822337 from NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP), were genotyped using SNP pyrosequencing. Associations of PD-L1 expression and polymorphism with clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed.</p><p id="Par3673"><bold>Results:</bold> Ten of 49 ADC cases (25.6 %) and 29 of 50 SqCC cases (50.7 %) were positive for PD-L1 expression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Statistical correlations between PD-L1 expression and shorter disease-free survival was found (<italic>p</italic> = 0.028). Statistical correlations between PD-L1 expression and shorter disease-free survival in the ADC patienets was found (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Among the 3 SNPs, rs4143815C&gt;G was associated with short overall survival in the ADC patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.041).</p><p id="Par3674"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There was a significantly higher PD-L1 expression in SqCC than in ADC. But PD-L1 expression and polymorphism might be useful for the prediction of prognosis in ADC patients.</p><p id="Par3675"><bold>PS-05-040</bold></p><p id="Par3676"><bold>E-cadherin expression in primary non-small cell lung carcinomas in relation to lymph node metastasis</bold></p><p id="Par3677"><underline>A.

Staging was performed in accordance to TNM lung tumour classification by World Health Organization, 2015 (Travis et al., 2015). E-cadherin expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and evaluated as positive versus negative using cut-off level at 10 % of positive tumour cells (Deeb et al., 2004). The statistical analysis comprised descriptive statistics including calculation of 95 % confidence interval (CI), and Mann-Whitney test.</p><p id="Par3681"><bold>Results:</bold> The study group comprised 58 primary NSCLC cases. Lymph node metastases were found in 27 (46.6 %; CI = 34.3–59.2) patients of which 25 (92.9 %; CI = 77.4–98.0) were assessed as E-cadherin-positive and 2 (7.1 %; CI = 2.0–22.6) as negative cases. The remaining 31 (53.4 %; CI = 40.8–65.7) cases included pN0 carcinomas. Among these, 23 (74.2 %, CI = 56.8–86.3) tumours were E-cadherin-positive while 8 (25.8 %, CI = 13.7–43.2) cases were negative compared to metastatic cancers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058).</p><p id="Par3682"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There was a trend to more frequent E-cadherin expression in NSCLC showing metastatic spread to lymph nodes in contrast to non-metastatic tumours. The controversies regarding E-cadherin in lung cancer might be attributable to case selection, e.g., including only resectable tumours; or mesenchymal-epithelial transformation.</p><p id="Par3683"><bold>PS-05-041</bold></p><p id="Par3684"><bold>Is papillary pulmonary adenocarcinoma a homogeneous subtype?</bold></p><p id="Par3685"><underline>H.

However, adenocarcinoma may involve papillary formations differing from each other. Our purpose here is to explore the presence of histopathological subtypes of the papillary pattern.</p><p id="Par3688"><bold>Method:</bold> We reviewed the resection cases where an anatomic surgical tumour operation was administered.In re-evaluation, pseudolepidic ones were classified as pattern 1, those medium sized thyroid papillary carcinoma resembling papillary carcinoma as pattern 2, and those forming large complex structures like serous ovarian carcinoma as pattern 3. Additionally, micropapillary patterns, tumour spread through air spaces (STAS), secondary dominant patterns, nuclear grades, mitoses, necroses, and vascular invasions were reviewed.</p><p id="Par3689"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 41 cases were found. Their histological subtype distribution was 6 (14,6 %) papillary type 1, 24 (58,5 %) papillary type 2, and 11(26,8) papillary type 3. Unlike the other two subtypes, the pseudolepidic papillary pattern involves less micropapillary formations and STAS.Necrosis and vascular invasion were found more in papillary types 2 and 3.</p><p id="Par3690"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The papillary pattern of lung adenocarcinoma does not exhibit a single uniform morphology. This result may be associated with other minor histopathological factors.

Postoperative relapse and subsequent metastasis result in high rate of mortalities in lung cancer. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level, and frequently dysregulated in various cancers. The aim of this study was to identify recurrence-associated microRNAs in early stage of lung cancer.</p><p id="Par3696"><bold>Method:</bold> To screening the differentially expressed microRNAs related to postoperative recurrence, microRNA microarray data derived from stage I lung adenocarcinoma formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and publically available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data was analyzed.

Data information and molecular abnormalities were obtained from the pathological and clinical records of patients.</p><p id="Par3721"><bold>Results:</bold> The average age of patients was 59 years. Among 350 patients, 80 % were male. The most common clinical presentation was pain (75 %) followed by hemoptysis (30 %). Thoracic CT was performed in all patients, tumour size were classified as T1 (4 %), T2 (25 %), T3 (17 %) and T4 (54 %). 94 % of patients had metastases at the time of diagnosis. Pulmonary adenocarcinoma was the most frequent histologic type (75 %) followed by squamous cell carcinomas (22 %), whereas large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas were only 3 %. The expression of CK7, TTF1, CK5 / 6, P63 and synaptophysin was statistically significant (p &lt;0.00001).

It is characterized by intra-alveolar accumulation of lamellar calcium deposits in bilateral lung parenchyma. Here we report a case of this infrequent disease.</p><p id="Par3728"><bold>Method:</bold> A 43-years-old man presented with dyspnea. Subsequent chest high-resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) revealed a fine, sandlike micronodular pattern. Patient was given symptomatic treatment and was referred to our centre for lung transplantation. Single lung transplantation was performed.</p><p id="Par3729"><bold>Results:</bold> The surgical specimen was enlarged and heavy, measured 18 × 17 × 8 cm and weighted 1500 g. Histologically, the pulmonary architecture was diffusely altered because of the filling of alveoli with multiple microliths. Patchy inflammation was frequently present with variable degrees of interstitial fibrosis as well as osseous metaplasia.</p><p id="Par3730"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PAM has been considered to be an autosomal recesive disorder because it is transmits horizontally and is associated with consanguinity. The clinical course is not uniform. The optimal diagnostic procedure is the association of chest HRCT with bronchoalveolar lavage. The differential diagnosis may include miliary tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. At present lung transplantation is the only effective therapy.

Tumour cells were mostly elongated with moderately pleomorphic vesicular nuclei and abundant lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, organized in an fascicular, nested and focally discohaesive manner. Numerous »wreath like« giant cells were apparent among the lesional cells. By immunohistochemistry, tumour cells were positive for S100, melanA and HMB45.

The clinical diagnosis was tufted hemangioma. An infiltration of spindle cells extending from the papillary dermis to the subcutaneous fat tissue in a honeycomb pattern was observed. CD34 was positive and factor XIIIa, S100 protein and smooth muscle actin were negative. COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene generated by t(17;22)(q22;q13) was demonstrated by FISH analysis.</p><p id="Par3794"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Recognition of congenital DFSP in clinical practice may be problematic due to its resemblance to vascular lesions. A skin biopsy is required for the diagnosis. Histopathologic differential diagnosis includes various spindle cell tumours. Infiltration of the fat tissue in a honeycomb pattern is a peculiar finding and CD34 immunopositivity is supportive.

The aim of this study is to discuss the clinical, histological and immunophenotypical features and prognostic value of LCT.</p><p id="Par3800"><bold>Method:</bold> Eleven cases with LCT in MF diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 were studied.</p><p id="Par3801"><bold>Results:</bold> Patch, plaque and/or tumoural lesions were observed in the study group, including 9 males and 2 females, with median age of transformation 60.2 years-old and median time of transformation 9 years (range, 4–30 years). All skin biopsies revealed a superficial/deep dermal infiltration of atypical lymphocytes composed of &gt;25 % large neoplastic cells. Epidermotropism was absent in two cases and very few in one, meanwhile folliculotropism was observed in five patients. Immunphenotypically CD30 was strongly positive on large neoplastic cells in four cases, weak in five, whereas two were negative. Four patients had nodal involvement.

Pathogenesis of MCCs have still not been well elucidated. SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complexes regulate gene expressions by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling processes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation and SWI/SNF gene expressions frequently altered in human cancers. We investigated the association of altered expression of SWI/SNF complex with prognostic and biological significance in MCCs.</p><p id="Par3984"><bold>Method:</bold> We analyzed the immunohistochemical expressions of INI1, BRG1, BRM and ARID1A in 30 MCPyV-positive and 20 MCPyV-negative MCCs.</p><p id="Par3985"><bold>Results:</bold> All MCC cases showed INI1 and ARID1A expression, whereas 5 cases had loss or reduced BRG1 expression and 2 cases had reduced BRM expression. There were no statistically significant differences between altered expressions of SWI/SNF complex such as BRG1 and clinicopathological factors including MCPyV-infection and prognosis.

We analyzed new sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded specimens of all primitive skin lesions of our archival material. The viral infection was detected by immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par4033"><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-nine percent were positive for MCPyV LT antigen. All cases of MCC of the upper extremities (3/3) and 75 % (3/4) of the trunk were associated with viral infection. We investigated the tumour associated lymphocytic infiltrate; interestingly the only two cases with massive lymphocytic infiltration were positive for MCPyV and both patients were alive after 107 and 56 months of follow up. Ten cases showed necrotic areas and eight of these were virus positive.</p><p id="Par4034"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> MCPyV infection seems to be correlate to specific sites (upper extremities and trunk), massive lymphocytic infiltration and necrosis. These findings seems to suggest a possible strong protective immune reaction probably viral induced. We didn’t find any correlation between sun-exposed areas and virus infection.</p><p id="Par4035"><bold>PS-06-044</bold></p><p id="Par4036"><bold>Glomeruloid hemangiomas as the first symptoms of Castleman’s disease</bold></p><p id="Par4037"><underline>Y. Rogov</underline><sup>*</sup>, N. Kornev, O. Solodkaya</p><p id="Par4038"><sup>*</sup>Belarusian Medical Academy, Pathology, Minsk, Belarus</p><p id="Par4039"><bold>Objective:</bold> Glomeruloid hemangiomas are usually associated with Castleman’s disease and POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein and skin changes). They are considered a reactive vascular proliferation and play an important role as a specific marker in a proper diagnosis. We report a case of Castleman’s disease with POEMS syndrome, since it is a rare lesion and its first morphological symptoms must be evaluated carefully.</p><p id="Par4040"><bold>Method:</bold> A 38-year-old man was presented 2 years ago with numerous vascular papules on the trunk and pain in the fingers of the left foot. Biopsies were performed and capillary hemangiomas were identified. In one and half year this patient was admitted to the hospital with weight loss, low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, superficial distal hypoesthesia in the feet and hands, walking difficulties, gynecomastia. Histological and immunohistochemical studies of cervical lymph nodes were performed and preliminary biopsies of hemangiomas were reexamined.</p><p id="Par4041"><bold>Results:</bold> A histological review of the hemangiomas identified dilated vascular spaces in the dermis, containing in their lumens coiled capillaries resembling a renal glomerulus. These capillaries were lined by a single layer of endothelial cells with swollen clear nuclei, suspicious on the viral damage. The single small vessels close to such spaces had the same endothelium. These cells were negative for HHV8 and expressed VEGF. In lymph nodes there was an angiofollicular hyperplasia with some clusters of plasma cells in the interfollicular parenchyma. Multicentric Castleman’s disease with POEMS syndrome was diagnosed.</p><p id="Par4042"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case suggests the opinion that glomeruloid hemangiomas can be a first specific marker of multicentric Castleman’s disease with POEMS syndrome. Accounting for these signs may allow starting a specific treatment earlier.</p><p id="Par4043"><bold>PS-06-045</bold></p><p id="Par4044"><bold>Experience of application immunofluorescence antigen mapping for morphologic diagnosis of different types of congenital epidermolysis bullosa</bold></p><p id="Par4045"><underline>A.

Gallagher</p><p id="Par4054"><sup>*</sup>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, TCWO, Belgium</p><p id="Par4055"><bold>Objective:</bold> The tumour microenviroment is a complex biological system made up of different types of cells, each one with a different impact on prognosis. Tumour-associated macrophages are characterized by the ability to switch from a M1-like “anti-tumour” activation status to a M2-like “pro-tumour” immunosuppressive status. In melanoma, melanin-containing macrophages (“melanophages”) are often present in the tumourmicroenvironment, but their role in the local immune response is unknown, and studies on the effects of melanin loading of macrophages are lacking.</p><p id="Par4056"><bold>Method:</bold> We tested the effects of synthetic melanin on a mouse monocytic cell line (J774.2) and on peripheral blood-derived CD14+ monocytes from two different patients. We used flow cytometry, ELISA and bioenzymatic assays to compare the effects of melanin with LPS stimulation on cell viability, phagocytic activity, HLA-DR and CD206 (a classical M2-macrophage marker) expression, and TNFalfa and IL-10 production.</p><p id="Par4057"><bold>Results:</bold> Macrophage viability was not affected by melanin exposure, while both LPS and melanin decreased phagocytosis in macrophages. A trend towards diminished HLA-DR expression and decreased TNFalfa production after exposure to melanin in comparison to LPS exposure was observed.</p><p id="Par4058"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Preliminary results indicate that melanin exposure induces a decrease of several functions in macrophages.</p><p id="Par4059"><bold>PS-06-047</bold></p><p id="Par4060"><bold>BRAF-mutated giant congenital melanocytic nevus with extensive neurotisation and multiple large nodal nevi</bold></p><p id="Par4061"><underline>S.

The first of the lesions was presented as papule located in the breast skin with the clinical diagnosis of eczema or paget disease. The second one as nodule located in the head with the clinical diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans or fibrous histiocytoma. Physical examination and CT showed no lymphadenopathy or any extra-cutaneous lesions.</p><p id="Par4073"><bold>Results:</bold> Histology revealed polygonal S100+ histiocytes showing emperipolesis (lymphocytes, erythrocytes) and many lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. The immunohistochemistry showed that the histiocytes were also positive for CD68 and negative for CD1a, FXII, langerin and plasma cells were polyclonal. The patients remained asymptomatic with no signs of recurrence or other extranodal sites or associated lymphadenopathy 9 months after surgery.</p><p id="Par4074"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> RDD with extranodal involvement occurred in 43 % of the cases, with skin being the commonest site.

Surgical excision was performed.</p><p id="Par4089"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathological examination revealed large, ill-defined, dermal based and asymmetrical tumour with infiltrative growth and extension into deep subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Tumour cells were epithelioid shaped with an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic, centrally located vesicular nuclei containing prominent one or multiple nucleoli. They were intermingled with sparse spindle-shaped tumour cells. Mitoses were numerous. Ulceration was present, but tumour necrosis, lymphovascular invasion and perineural infiltration were not seen.

The aim of this study was to investigate histopathological and clinical features and associations between clinical outcome of this rare entity.</p><p id="Par4208"><bold>Method:</bold> Tumour slides of surgical specimens of 24 cases with SPN diagnosed in our department from January 2000 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed.</p><p id="Par4209"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age was 34.5 years (min. 14, max.66). Of 24 cases, 21(87,5 %) were females. Tumours were located prevalently in pancreatic tail (11 of 24). Median tumour size was 6 cm (range, 2–15 cm). Of 18 tumours surrounded by capsule, 14 were invaded the capsule and peripancreatic extension was present in 9 of the cases. Perineural invasion (PNI) was observed 20,8 %(5 of 24) of the patients.

We aimed to assess the histomorphological changes in pre-operatively treated PDAC and to determine characteristics that can help distinguish between tumour regression and desmoplasia.</p><p id="Par4312"><bold>Method:</bold> PDAC resection specimens from 27 patients after pre-operative chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy were evaluated. Three tissue samples/patient were selected.

The number of Shh-positive or K8/18-negative cells, isolated or in groups, was counted.</p><p id="Par4385"><bold>Results:</bold> Simple NAFLD and NASH (stage 0 <italic>n</italic> = 4, 1 <italic>n</italic> = 15 , 2 <italic>n</italic> = 14 , 3 <italic>n</italic> = 8, 4 <italic>n</italic> = 6) were diagnosed in 27/74(36.5 %) and 47/74(63.5 %) cases, respectively. Shh immunostain highlighted more BH (6.67 ± 9.46) compared to K8/18 (3.26 ± 6.23) per NASH biopsy. Shh detected more BH than K8/18 in 20/47(42.6 %), less BH in 8(17 %) and equal numbers in 19 (40.4) NASH biopsies.</p><p id="Par4386"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> K8/18 and Shh are useful markers for the objective assessment of BH in liver biopsies of NAFLD patients.

The presence of intraepithelial precursor lesions, including high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) or and biliary intraepithelial neoplasias (BilINs) may suggest origin of the periampullary carcinomas in challenging cases.</p><p id="Par4392"><bold>Method:</bold> To prove utilities of high-grade intraepithelial precursor lesions for identifying origin of ambiguous periampullary cancers, status and grades of PanINs and BilINs were evaluated from 257 consecutive pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens with well-defined cancer origin, including 114 pancreatic cancers, 82 distal bile duct cancers, 54 ampullary cancers, and 7 duodenal cancers.</p><p id="Par4393"><bold>Results:</bold> High-grade PanINs were more commonly noted in pancreas cancers (21.9 %, 25/114) than distal bile duct (8.5 %, 7/82), ampullary (9.3 %, 5/54), and duodenal (0 %, 0/7) cancers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02). Similarly, high-grade BilINs were more frequently identified in distal bile duct cancers (56.1 %, 46/82) than ampullary (24.1 %, 13/54), pancreas (9.6 %, 11/114), and duodenal (0 %, 0/7) cancers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p><p id="Par4394"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> High grade PanINs were most commonly noted in pancreatic cancer, while high-grade BilINs were most frequently seen in distal bile duct cancer.

We report a case of hepatic KS in a post-renal transplant patient.</p><p id="Par4400"><bold>Method:</bold> A 34-year-old and HIV-negative male, with a past medical history of Alport syndrome and renal transplantation, presented with hypervascular hepatic, pancreatic and pulmonary nodules discovered by imaging performed for routine follow-up. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour with visceral metastases was suspected. A subsequent needle liver biopsy was performed.</p><p id="Par4401"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically, the liver parenchyma displayed a spindle cell proliferation that formed slit-like spaces with extravasation of erythrocytes and hemosiderin deposits.

It is considered that TGF-beta is produced as an inactive latent complex, in which active TGF-beta is enveloped by its pro-peptide, the latency-associated protein (LAP), and PLK (plasma kallikrein) activates TGF-beta by cleavage between R58 and L59 residues within LAP, and the N-terminal side LAP degradation products ending at residue R58 (R58 LAP-DPs) functions as a footprint of PLK-dependent TGF-beta activation. Regulating TGF-beta activation could have possibilities of inhibiting hepatic fibrosis. In order to control TGF-beta activation, it is necessary to identify the local place (tissue and/or cell) where fibrosis occurs. Thus, we focus on the localisation of TGF-beta R58 LAP-DP in NASH fibrosis mouse models.</p><p id="Par4432"><bold>Method:</bold> We’ve performed histocytochemical analysis with R58 LAP-DP specific mouse monoclonal antibody for immunohistocytochemistry by means of LM and TEM in NASH models (MC4R KO mice, CDAHFD mice, and FLS-ob/ob mice), and human.</p><p id="Par4433"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that the R58 LAP-DPs were localized around the lipid droplets in NASH liver, especially macrophage and inflammatory cells.</p><p id="Par4434"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These findings insisted that macrophage and inflammatory cells were involved TGF-beta activation causing fibrotic disorder, and the possible inhibition of hepatic fibrosis could be achieved by regulating those cells function.</p><p id="Par4435"><bold>PS-07-039</bold></p><p id="Par4436"><bold>Ciliated hepatic foregut cyst</bold></p><p id="Par4437"><underline>B.

Throughout the past 7 years we diagnosed 3 cases in core needle biopsy (CNB) samples.</p><p id="Par4504"><bold>Method:</bold> Case 1: a 70 year-old woman with a 3-year history of multiple myeloma (MM) was submitted to a follow-up osteomedullary CNB. Case 2: a 70 year-old man with lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (LL/CLL) diagnosed 19 years before with signs of progression that underwent an osteomedullary CNB. Case 3: a 65 year-old woman without previous history of haematological malignancies presented with a retroperitoneal mass which was biopsied. CNBs were studied using H&amp;E and immunohistochemical techniques.</p><p id="Par4505"><bold>Results:</bold> Case 1 was diagnosed as MM and small B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma; the splenectomy specimen later unveiled a splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Case 2 was reported as LL/CLL and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), both later confirmed in an excised lymph node. Case 3 consisted in follicular lymphoma and HL which showed remission after treatment, tackling fatal outcome thus far.</p><p id="Par4506"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diagnosing composite lymphomas in CNB is a challenging—but feasible—task. To our knowledge this is the first series of composite lymphomas diagnosed through CNB.</p><p id="Par4507"><bold>PS-08-006</bold></p><p id="Par4508"><bold>Simultaneous occurence of peripheral t cell lymphoma with follicular helper phenotype and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphoma like B cell infiltration</bold></p><p id="Par4509"><underline>O.

Dogan</p><p id="Par4510"><sup>*</sup>Istanbul University, Turkey</p><p id="Par4511"><bold>Objective:</bold> Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma(CLL/SLL) is relatively common and patients occasionally develop other neoplasms; however patients who develop other types of lymphomas are rare. Here in we report a case with simultaneous occurance of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and CLL/SLL like B cell infiltration.</p><p id="Par4512"><bold>Method:</bold> Bone marrow, liver and paravertebral mass biopsies were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry was performed to all three formaline fixed parafine embedded tissue samples.</p><p id="Par4513"><bold>Results:</bold> A previously healthy 63-year-old man presented with fever, weight loss and night sweats. Laboratory findings revealed increased LDH, ALP, GGT as well as pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed composite lymphoma. First component was consistent with CLL/SLL like B cell infiltration and the second component was consistent with PTCL with T follicular helper(TFH) phenotype. Furthermore a focus of hemophagocytic activity was observed. PET-CT study revealed left paravertebral mass at cervical region. Paravertebral mass and liver biopsy showed PTCL with TFH phenotype and CLL/SLL like B cell infiltration, respectively.</p><p id="Par4514"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Composite lymphomas containing both T and B cell lymphomas are very rare. Moreover, synchronous cooccurence in the bone marrow and accompanying hemofagocyte activation is an exceptional event of which is probably related with immune dysregulation.</p><p id="Par4515"><bold>PS-08-007</bold></p><p id="Par4516"><bold>Hodgkin's lymphoma with aberrant T-cell expression: A diagnostic challenge</bold></p><p id="Par4517"><underline>S.

Here we present a case which posed a major diagnostic challenge.</p><p id="Par4520"><bold>Method:</bold> A 26 year female presented with fever and generalized lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the left axillary lymph node was done. Immunohistochemistry and additional molecular tests were done to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p id="Par4521"><bold>Results:</bold> The biopsy revealed lymph node with effaced architecture showing large areas of necrosis along with atypical cells containing prominent nucleoli. These cells were strongly positive for MUM1, and focally positive for PAX5, CD15 and CD30. Expression of CD2 and CD8 was also noted. A panel of other T cell markers, ALK and EMA was done. T-Cell Rearrangement and EBER in situ hybridization was performed to clinch the diagnosis</p><p id="Par4522"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hodgkins lymphoma with aberrant T cell expression can be misdiagnosed as T cell lymphomas with aberrant B cell expression. This distinction is important as it has both therapeutic and prognostic significance.

Pathology, Czech Republic</p><p id="Par4687"><bold>Objective:</bold> The disruption of normal mitosis by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors is a significant contributor to the anticancer effects of these drugs. HDAC inhibitors are known to arrest human tumour cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and activate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. One of the regulators of cell cycle progression is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, CDKN1A gene of the CIP/KIP family. The p15INK4b and p16INK4a encoded by CDKN2B and CDKN2A genes, belong to the INK4 family proteins. The aim of our study was to determine the sensitivity of human multiple myeloma cells to HDAC and CDK inhibitors as well.</p><p id="Par4688"><bold>Method:</bold> To determine HDAC and CDK inhibitors influence on cell cycle regulation, DNA content was assessed by flow cytometry analysis.

TTF-1 expression is assumed to be restricted to pulmonary and thyroid epithelium. We recently encountered a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a man with a history of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which showed nuclear expression of TTF-1/SPT24.

Commonly observed genetic abnormalities that likely contribute to pathogenesis include translocations of BCL6, BCL2, and cMYC. In this study, we investigated 44 cases of DLBCL for cytogenetic abnormalities of BCL2, BCL6, and cMYC genes by FISH, as well as for immunohistochemical expressions of BCL2 and BCL6.</p><p id="Par4720"><bold>Method:</bold> A total of 44 patients with DLBCL were retrospectively analysed.

Smears were stained according to short May-Gruenwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocol, areas with abundance of myeloma cells marked, slides destained, and the FISH analysis performed on selected areas. On MGG-stained slides, the frequency of morphological features and morphometrical data were assessed - chromatin, nucleoli, irregular nuclei, multinuclearity, paranuclear halo, “flaming” PCs, ragged cytoplasm, cytoplasmatic budding, Russell bodies, longest nuclear (ND) and cytoplasmatic diameter (CD) and the ND/CD ratio.

Given this fundamental function, we investigated the presence of liver hematopoietic stem cells at different weeks of gestation.</p><p id="Par4792"><bold>Method:</bold> Liver tissue specimens, obtained from ten fetuses with a gestational age ranging from 10 to 36 weeks, were stained with H&amp;E and immunostained with an anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody.

Although it is well-tolerated, rarely hematopoetic adverse effects, that are usually reversible, are reported.</p><p id="Par4800"><bold>Method:</bold> We present 4 cases with high-grade glial tumours (2 glioblastoma, 2 anaplastic astrocytoma) who develop cytopenia after TMZ usage.</p><p id="Par4801"><bold>Results:</bold> Three of the patients are females. Average age was 55 (range; 35–73) years old. All of the patients developed cytopenia in 1–3 months interval after TMZ. All had bone marrow(BM) biopsies. Two of them had BM selularity ranging 1–5 %, consistent with aplastic anemia(AA). They died due to hematopoetic toxicity. Other two patients had normocellular BM with dysplasia in hematopoetic cells without increased blast number. None of them had reticuline fibrosis. They accepted as secondary MDS.

Jaksa</underline><sup>*</sup></p><p id="Par4854"><sup>*</sup>Charles University in Prague, Dept. of Pathology, Czech Republic</p><p id="Par4855"><bold>Objective:</bold> Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a myoeloproliferative neoplasm which originates in a bone marrow pluripotent stem cell and is in most cases associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, which results from translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadelphia chromosome). Untreated CML typically develops in three phases - a chronic phase, followed by accelerated and blastic phases. Up to 30 % cases of CML present with mild (MF2) or moderate (MF3) fibrosis, but severe fibrosis (MF3) is rare. We report 2 cases of CML with atypical histopathological features at presentation, including clustering of dysplastic megakaryocytes and osteosclerosis mimicking primary myelofibrosis.</p><p id="Par4856"><bold>Method:</bold> Routine histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of trephine biopsy samples.</p><p id="Par4857"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination of two bone marrow samples revealed extreme proliferation of significantly dysplastic clustering megakaryocytes with marked osteomyelosclerosis. Granulocytes were increased, particularly eosinophils. Erythropoiesis was reduced. Blasts were not increased. The morphology was compatible with the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis. Subsequently performed tests for the BCR-ABL fusion gene were positive in both cases, whereas JAK2617F tests were negative. Acording to clinical, histopathological and genetical findings the diagnosis of CML was established.</p><p id="Par4858"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Chronic myelogenous leukemia can rarely imitate primary myelofibrosis and may lead to misdiagnosis.

It is a highly aggressive round-cell tumour partially showing skeletal muscle differentiation.</p><p id="Par4984"><bold>Method:</bold> A 40-year-old male patient presented to the hospital with swelling on the right side of his neck. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a destructive, 5 cm soft tissue mass filling the maxillary sinus and expanding into the orbital cavity. The cause of the initial symptom which was swelling on the neck turned out to be because of multiple metastases to the lymph nodes. As the symptoms developed rapidly, the patient suffered from blurred vision and proptosis of the right eye.</p><p id="Par4985"><bold>Results:</bold> The microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen revealed cells that were variable in size and shape with eosinophilic narrow cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures were evident. Immunohistochemistry panel including epithelial, mesenchymal and lymphoid markers supported the diagnosis of an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

The aims of our study were to assess the expression of the HBME1 antigen in parotid WT and the relationships to CK5/6, P63 and WT1 expression.</p><p id="Par4992"><bold>Method:</bold> Four parotid WTs (and surrounding parotid) were studied by immunohistochemistry for HBME1, CK5/6, P63 and WT1 expression.</p><p id="Par4993"><bold>Results:</bold> Membrane and/or cytoplasmic HBME1 were observed in a focal distribution, in luminal and suprabasal epithelial cells of all WTs. Cytokeratin 5/6 as well as P63 were expressed in a continuous pattern, in basal and focally suprabasal cells. WT1 was expressed focally at the luminal border of ¾ WTs. In the nontumoural parotid, HBME1 was expressed in ductal/luminal cells of intercalated ducts and interlobular ducts, mainly in a diffuse pattern while CK5/6 and P63 in the basal myoepithelial cells.</p><p id="Par4994"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The expression patterns we have observed for HBME1 are consistent with an origin of the Warthin tumour epithelium from the intercalated and/or interlobular salivary gland duct epithelium. The immunohistochemical profile HBME1 + CK5/6 + P63+ in the WT epithelium parallels rather that of mesothelioma/metaplastic mesothelial cells, than that of thyroid carcinomas (showing only rarely CK5/6 and/or P63 positivity), suggesting a primordial coelomic phenotype/differentiation.</p><p id="Par4995"><bold>PS-09-013</bold></p><p id="Par4996"><bold>Cytokeratin 7 expression in neck metastasis of primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC): Could this be a useful biomarker in locating primary tumours to tonsils?</bold></p><p id="Par4997"><underline>D.

The link between CK7, as a marker of junctional sites including the oropharynx, and HPV is the focus of ongoing investigation. The aim of this study is to investigate CK7 expression in neck node metastases from OP primaries, to determine the relationship between CK7 expression and the development of cystic metastases, tonsil subsite, p16 expression and HPV detection.</p><p id="Par5000"><bold>Method:</bold> Forty seven nodal metastases from primary OPSCCs were evaluated for CK7 expression by IHC and results correlated with p16 expression, HPV status by ISH and PCR techniques, tumour subsite within the oropharynx and the presence of cystic nodal metastases. The sensitivity and specificity of HPV ISH and p16 IHC was compared with HPV PCR.</p><p id="Par5001"><bold>Results:</bold> CK7 expression in lymph node metastases from OPSCCs significantly correlated with HPV detection but not with p16 expression. CK7 expression was not significantly related to cystic metastases as it was also expressed in noncystic metastases. CK7 was expressed in metastatic nodes associated with a primary tonsillar SCC, but was not expressed in metastases from soft palate or posterior pharynx primaries.</p><p id="Par5002"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> When considering OPSCCs, CK7 expression in lymph node metastases remains a significant predictor of a HPV related primary tumour. This finding was regardless of the cystic nature of the metastasis. The expression of CK7 was only found in lymph node metastases from tonsillar tumours, which could signify the predictive value of this marker in relation to primaries of tonsillar specific origin.</p><p id="Par5003"><bold>PS-09-014</bold></p><p id="Par5004"><bold>Molecular characterisation of sinunasal carcinomas</bold></p><p id="Par5005"><underline>R.

We assessed the interdependency and prognostic significance of immune and metabolic phenotypes in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) and evaluated reactive oxygen species (ROS) changes as a mechanism of treatment response in tumour spheroid/immunocyte co-cultures.</p><p id="Par5040"><bold>Method:</bold> Pretreatment biopsies were immunohistochemically characterized in 73 HNSCC patients treated by definitive chemoradiotherapy and correlated with survival. The prognostic significance of CD8A, GLUT1 and COX5B gene expression were analyzed within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. HNSCC spheroids were co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxyglucose (DGL) and radiation treatment followed by PBMC chemotaxis determination via fluorescence microscopy.</p><p id="Par5041"><bold>Results:</bold> In chemoradiotherapy-treated HNSCC mitochondrial-rich (COX5B) metabolism correlated with increased and glucose-dependent (GLUT1) metabolism with decreased intratumoural CD8/CD4 ratios. High CD8/CD4 together with mitochondrial-rich or glucose-independent metabolism was associated with improved short-term survival. TCGA analysis confirmed that patients with a favorable immune and metabolic gene signature had improved short- and long-term survival. In vitro, DGL and radiation synergistically upregulated ROS-dependent PBMC chemotaxis to HNSCC spheroids.</p><p id="Par5042"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest that glucose-independent tumourmetabolism is associated with CD8-dominant anti-tumour immune infiltrate, and together these contribute to improved chemoradiotherapy response in HNSCC.</p><p id="Par5043"><bold>PS-09-022</bold></p><p id="Par5044"><bold>Questioning the role of p16 as surrogate marker for Human papillomavirus (HPV) driven head and neck cancer</bold></p><p id="Par5045"><underline>K.

However, it may not suffice. We assessed whether p16 overexpression in non-keratinizing tumours, as recommended by the College of American Pathologists, is an adequate marker for HPV presence.</p><p id="Par5048"><bold>Method:</bold> In a cohort of over 150 patients with OPSCC, including a subset of cases without prior p16 testing, diagnosed at our institute we assessed p16 expression, keratinization and HPV status. For molecular HPV detection the VisionArray system by ZytoVision was used.</p><p id="Par5049"><bold>Results:</bold> By comprehensive analysis we found a significant number of discrepant cases. Twenty percent of p16 positive tumours were HPV negative in the molecular test, among them a considerable number of non-keratinizing cancers.

However, this effect has not been described in the oral mucosa. This study aimed to verify if chronic alcoholism affects the dendritic cell repopulation during wound healing process.</p><p id="Par5096"><bold>Method:</bold> Immunohistochemistry for CD1a, CD11c, CD207 and vimentin (DC markers) was performed in tissue sections of previously induced wounds in mice, that were divided in Ethanol group (EG) (exposed to ethanol solution during 28 days) and Control group (CG). Immunostaining was assessed 24 hrs, 3, 7 and 9 days after wound induction. Immunostained cells were analyzed quantitatively in conjunctive tissue and epithelium.</p><p id="Par5097"><bold>Results:</bold> The number of immunostained cells was lower in the animals of the EG compared to the ones in CG for all of the immunomarkers and for the cells found both in epithelium and conjunctive tissue.

Our aim was to determine if histology can clearly distinguish odontogenic (COF) from non-odontogenic (NO) (TOF, POF) lesions.</p><p id="Par5216"><bold>Method:</bold> OF were retrieved and classified COF or NO according to site and relationship to teeth. Histological assessment (<italic>n</italic> = 69) included the border of the lesion, secondary changes, and pattern of calcification, defined as trabecular, psammomatoid or mixed.</p><p id="Par5217"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall 67 % of OFs were painless and &gt;90 % were well demarcated and unilocular. Histologically 70 % were circumscribed with a highly cellular stroma (84 %) and low vascularity (81 %). 55/69 lesions (80 %) were COF, 80 % (44) of which were in the mandible. Only 4/14 (28 %) NO arose in the mandible, with 64 % in the maxilla or antrum. Most COF were psammomatoid (56 %). NO lesions were TOF (7/14:50 %), POF (36 %) or mixed (14 %). Calcification pattern did not correlate with origin. Multinucleated giant cells (32 %) and aneurysmal bone cysts (3 %) were also noted.</p><p id="Par5218"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A psammomatoid pattern is common (52 % of OF) and 83 % of odontogenic lesions are found in the mandible.

The site of the tumour was the lateral wall of the nasal cavity (six cases), nasal septum (two cases), maxillary cavity (two case), ethmoidal diffused to orbital cavity (one case) and internal mucosal jaw (two cases). Surgery was performed in 12 patients; adjuvant radiation therapy was used in nine patients after local recurrence and chemotherapy in 11 patients. Nine of 13 patients (69, 2 %) had a recurrence after previous treatment (surgery). The actuarial disease-free survival for is 33.7 % (4 of 13).

It was seen showed a dark gray to red colour alteration areas at anterior comissure and cord vocale in the laryngoscopy.The patient was performed biopsy.There was no clinical evidence of other primary malignant melanocytic lesions. Microscopically, the tumour consisted of polygonal and epithelioid cells admixed with more elongated, spindle-shaped cells. The majority of the cells demonstrated dark brown cytoplasmic and nuclear melanin. Marked pleomorphism and abnormal mitoses were also identified. Immunohistochemical studies were positive for S100, Melan-A,HMB-45 and vimentin, while cytokeratin and iron stains were negative.

A Bisulfite-NGS approach evaluating 19 genes in parallel using MiSEQ (Illumina) was used for quantitative DNA methylation analysis including 355 CpGs. Bioinformatic evaluation was done by BSPAT, BISMA and Methylation Plotter tools.</p><p id="Par5457"><bold>Results:</bold> ZAP70, ITGA4, KIF1A, PARP15, EPHX3, NTM, LRRTM1, FLI1, MIR193, LINC00599, PAX1, MIR137HG MIR296, TERT, and GP1BB resulted epigenetically altered comparing OSCC vs normal healthy donors and contralateral mucosa. DNMT1, TERC, H19, LINE1 were found to be unchanged. ROC curve analysis identified the most informative 13 CpGs allowing us to create an algorithm of choice for early detection of OSCC/HG-SIL. All OSCC/HG-SIL and none of the normal donors resulted positives (AUC: 1); 5/30 normal distant mucosa, 16/20 LG-SIL and 2/12 OLP exceeded the threshold value.</p><p id="Par5458"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our bisulfite-NGS based assay could contribute to reduce the OSCC burden with its early diagnostic potential starting from a minimally invasive collecting procedure.</p><p id="Par5459"><bold>PS-10-009</bold></p><p id="Par5460"><bold>Overexpression of ETS genes (ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5) in prostate cancer</bold></p><p id="Par5461"><underline>S.

The initiation of protein translation is an important rate-limiting step in eukaryotes, and is crucial in the pathogenesis of many viral infections. Eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) are proteins that are involved in the initiation step of protein translation and are linked to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway.

The step of initiation, regulated by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), is assigned as rate limiting step in protein synthesis. eIFs become major targets for cancer therapy and are functionally linked to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling . However, little is known about their contribution in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of eIFs and mTOR members in CRC.</p><p id="Par5576"><bold>Method:</bold> eIF and mTOR expression was analysed in primary low and high grade CC and RC samples in comparison to controls without any disease-related pathology on protein and mRNA expression. To assess the therapeutic potential of targeting eIFs, siRNA knockdown experiments in HCT116 cells were performed.</p><p id="Par5577"><bold>Results:</bold> Protein and mRNA levels of low grade and high grade CC and RC patients revealed a significant up-regulation of mTOR members and most eIF subunits.

Its rarity and clinical presentation may contribute to a delay in diagnosis. We report a case of a CBME with an aggressive clinical course that presented during adolescence.</p><p id="Par5696"><bold>Method:</bold> The clinicopathological features of a case of CBME are described, with a review of the literature.</p><p id="Par5697"><bold>Results:</bold> A 16-year-old female with a history of right eye enucleation for glaucoma was referred to our institution, with a rapidly growing 7 cm cranial invading orbital mass. The histopathological diagnosis of the enucleation specimen was unavailable at the time and a biopsy was performed. A small blue cell tumour was identified, and a diagnosis favoring PNET was rendered. After a partial response to chemotherapy, she underwent orbital exenteration. An embryonal tumour with neuroblastic and epithelial elements consistent with medulloepithelioma was observed. The enucleation specimen arrived 2 months later for review, and a diagnosis of teratoid CBME with poor prognostic features was confirmed.</p><p id="Par5698"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CBME is rare neoplasm that can pursue an aggressive clinical course.

This paper highlights a case of a small primary choroidal melanoma with particularly unusual clinical onset: vitreous hemorrhage.</p><p id="Par5704"><bold>Method:</bold> The patient presented with blurred vision in the right eye. Clinical examination and additional testing indicated a choroidal melanoma. Following surgical enucleation of the affected eyeball, on gross examination we identified a black dome-shaped structure with firm consistency, gripped to the posterosuperior wall side of the eye, with no invasion of the sclera or the optic nerve.</p><p id="Par5705"><bold>Results:</bold> Conventional hematoxylin-eosin stain examination found tumour cells of different sizes, sometimes intensely pigmented. At higher magnification, they shown to be type B spindle shaped cells, with a low mitotic index of 1 atypical mitose/mm2.</p><p id="Par5706"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Vitreous hemorrhage as a primary event is uncommon for early choroidal melanoma and can be often misdiagnosed. This fact is usually seen only in cases when the melanoma has erupted through the Bruch membrane. Ocular spindle cell melanoma generally has a better prognosis than epithelioid cell melanoma. The reduced number of atypical mitosis, the absence of optic nerve and sclera infiltration and the lack of metastases are also predictive for good prognosis of the patient.</p><p id="Par5707"><bold>PS-11-006</bold></p><p id="Par5708"><bold>Mammary Analogue Secretory Carcinoma (MASC) of the lacrimal gland: First case report</bold></p><p id="Par5709"><underline>M.

The lesion was slow-growing, yellow-pink, translucent, solid well-circumscribed located in the temporal bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye. There were no systemic features, or family history of genetic conditions. The extirpated tumour, 13x10x3mm, was hypocellular and composed of spindle-shaped or stellate tumour cells.

These tumour are benign but malignant in a sense that often embolizes and may cause severe complications. We report our experience with cadiac myxoma in adults at Hospitalary Complex of Navarra.</p><p id="Par5824"><bold>Method:</bold> Eight patients resected for primary cardiac tumours between Jan. 2007 and Jan 2017 . We retrospectively reviewed their clinical, immunohistochemical and pathological findings.</p><p id="Par5825"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age at the time of resection was 50.37 years (range 21–73). All the patients were females and one case was disgnosed during pregnancy. The most common clinical presentation was arterial embolisms (80 %). Most common location was left atrium. Mean size were 24.85 mm. Multiple myxomas were found in two out of eight patients reviewed and both tumour had recurrence 2 years after resection. All the tumours had characteristic stellate cells in a myxoid background, and 25 % showed ossification, 37.5 % Extramedullary haematopoiesis, glandular structures (12,5 %) and granulomas (12,5 %).

Aortic wall estrogen receptor beta (ER) positivity may protect from atherosclerosis of the dilated ascending aorta. We studied the presence of aortic valve stenosis during dilatation of the ascending aorta in respect to aortic wall ER positivity.</p><p id="Par5832"><bold>Method:</bold> Aortic wall histology (Elastase, HE, AbPAS staining) and immunohistochemistry for ER, T/ B-lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cell proliferation, were performed in 30 patients that underwent surgery for the ascending aorta, and the samples were grouped according to presence of ER positivity.</p><p id="Par5833"><bold>Results:</bold> 23 patients were operated due to dilated ascending aorta and 7 due to dissection. Two patients with ER had aortic valve stenosis, in contrast to eight without ER. Macrophages of the media were increased in patients with ER as compared to those without ER (1.75 ± 0.28 vs 1.08 ± 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.044, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that dilated ascending aorta with medial ER is seldom associated with aortic valve stenosis (AUC 0.805; SE 0.081; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008; 95 % CI 0.646–0.964). Aortic wall medial ER is inversely correlated with the severity of aortic valve stenosis (R2 linear = 0.937, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009).</p><p id="Par5834"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Lack of dilated ascending aortic wall ER is associated with aortic valve stenosis reflecting atherosclerosis and stiffness of the ascending aorta resisting dissection.

Immunohistochemical study of expression of collagen I, CD68, MPO, S100A9), caspase 3 and osteopontin was conducted in AV tissue of both groups.</p><p id="Par5841"><bold>Results:</bold> In CAV tissues the fibrillar component (collagen I) growths was found, but the quantitative compositions of circulating inflammatory cells (CD68+) are not significantly different from the control group. CAVs contain much more MPO+ -cells (<italic>p &lt;</italic>0.001) in comparison to the group of AV without biomineralization. Our data show a significant increase of the S100A9 and OPN expression in the mineralized tissue of AVs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Also a higher expression level of Casp3 and MPO was found in CAVs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par5842"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> High Casp 3 expression confirms the increased level of cell elimination in the CAVs tissue, which is obviously connected with the impact of high local concentrations of S100A9. These facts can contribute to the development of pathological biomineralization of AV. Since osteopontin inhibits the hydroxyapatite formation by binding to the surface of the crystals, its hyperproduction is a counteracting factor against biomineralization in AV tissue.</p><p id="Par5843"><bold>PS-12-013</bold></p><p id="Par5844"><bold>Post-mortem pathological investigation of early myocardial damage: A review of fluorescent markers and immunohistochemical procedures</bold></p><p id="Par5845"><underline>I.

We have tried to evaluate degree of loosening by the values of speeds-of-sound(SOS) which has strong correlation with tissue stiffness. Do SOS through tissues correspond to tissue loosening? Which chemical changes happen at the site of loosening?</p><p id="Par5856"><bold>Method:</bold> We compared the SOS images between lesions and normal areas. To investigate the sensitivity to protease digestion, we compared the SOS images before and after digestion. To detect chemical changes of the tissues, lysyl oxidase (LOX), fibronectin (FN), and vitronectin (VN) were stained by specific antibodies.</p><p id="Par5857"><bold>Results:</bold> The lesions of aortic dissection, valvular regurgitation, and cord rupture of mitral valve showed slower SOS than the surrounding normal areas and were vulnerable to protease digestion.

Primary cardiac osteosarcoma is a very rare entity which accounts for less than 10 % of primary malignant heart tumours and is generally located at the left atrium.</p><p id="Par5864"><bold>Method:</bold> A 70-year-old female patient presented with a nodular mass of the left atrium, clinically resembling myxoma. No past medical history or further symptoms were mentioned. The mass was excised and pathological examination followed.</p><p id="Par5865"><bold>Results:</bold> Sections showed a spindle cell neoplasm with a fascicular architecture and moderate or high cellularity. The neoplastic cells were highly pleomorphic and atypical. Abundant mitoses were found. Tumour cells produced large amounts of osteoid matrix. Chondroid differentiation was evident, as well. Immunohistochemical panel, including vimentin, AE1/AE3, CK8/18, EMA, CD99, CD31, calretinin, SMA, desmin, S100 and CD34 revealed vimentin positivity of the neoplastic cells.

The expression of these antibodies was evaluated in the tumour core and tumour buds. The buds were classified from G1 to G3 based on the number of isolated cells in the invasion front.</p><p id="Par5945"><bold>Results:</bold> 12 cases were staged as pT1-2 N0, 26 as pT3N0 and 12 as pT3N1-2. The budding phenomenon was mostly high grade (G1-<italic>n</italic> = 12; G2-<italic>n</italic> = 28; G3-<italic>n</italic> = 10). SLUG positivity/ N-cadherin negativity was observed in 47/50 cases in both core and invasion front. E-cadherin showed diffuse positivity in core and buds in 21/50 cases. The other 29 cases were focally positive in the core (10 G3- and 19 with G2-buds). In the invasion front all of the 10 G3-cases, E-cadherin was lost and β-catenin membrane to nuclear switch was observed. The 21 cases with diffuse E-cadherin positivity also presented β-catenin membrane positivity.</p><p id="Par5946"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In CRC, loss of E-cadherin and β-catenin nuclear translocation in the invasion front seems to be correlated with the tumour budding grade, as an indicator of tumour agressivity.

However, it is indistinguishable from conventional adenomas clinically.</p><p id="Par6056"><bold>Method:</bold> A 65-years-old male patient , had anemia on routine laboratory tests, underwent colonoscopy. Two polyps, that were 0.7 cm and 0.5 cm in diameter were seen in rectum and removed for histopathological assessment.</p><p id="Par6057"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination of an H&amp;E stained slides the first polyp showed a large number of ganglion cells which had large and oval eosinophilic cytoplasm, eccentrically placed nucleus and prominent nucleolus in submucosa. However, there were many spindle shaped cells among the ganglion cells. Lesion margins were well-defined and the base of the polyp was intact. Synaptophysin expression were noted in ganglion cells Neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100 protein marked both ganglion and spindled cells. Other polyp was diagnosed as tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.</p><p id="Par6058"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We present a rare case of a solitary polypoid ganglioneuroma associated with a conventional adenoma located in rectum.</p><p id="Par6059"><bold>PS-13-024</bold></p><p id="Par6060"><bold>Histological characterisation of ipilimumab-associated colitis and enterocolitis - a series review</bold></p><p id="Par6061"><underline>H.

We evaluated the presence of intraepithelial neutrophilic leucocytes (IENL), crypt distortion, cryptitis, crypt abscesses, apoptosis, ulceration, granulomas and lymphoplasmacytosis.</p><p id="Par6065"><bold>Results:</bold> There were 6 patients (5 men) diagnosed with ipilimumab-induced colitis. The mean age was 70. Two patients were biopsied twice and one of them also had a subsequent colectomy, i.e. with 9 specimens in total for evaluation. All patients had IENL, with exception of one that showed increase in apoptosis as an isolated alteration. The samples showed crypt distortion (6), cryptitis (7), crypt abscesses (5), apoptosis (8) and plasmacytosis (7), granulomas (1). Ulceration was seen only in the colectomy specimen.</p><p id="Par6066"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Literature on GI histology related to Ipilimumab CTLA-4 inhibitor is scanty. The histological inflammatory pattern of ipilimumab-induced colitis could mimic GVHD, infectious colitis, IBD or autoimmune enteropathy. Pathologists should consider the diagnosis in new onset diarrhoea occurring in patients with a prior history of melanoma or autoimmune disease and be aware of the spectrum of histological features.

All patients presented chronic active gastritis. HHLO seemed to determine less intensity of chronic inflammation (80.65 % moderate and 19.35 % mild HHLO, respectively 88.71 % moderate and 11.29 mild HP). Severe activity was found in 3 of the 62 HHLO cases, compared with 17 HP cases. Mild activity was observed in 26 HHLO and in only 13 HP cases. 4 of the HHLO cases had glandular atrophy, while 6 of the HP ones had. Intestinal metaplasia was observed in 3 HHLO and in 17 HP cases. Only 3 HHLO cases had follicular gastritis compared with 15 HP cases.

Clinical and endoscopical scores fail to evaluate histologic remission, frequently minimizing the risks for relapse and unfavorable evolution, while histologic scores are not well correlated with clinical evolution and with life quality reported by patients.</p><p id="Par6088"><bold>Method:</bold> We prospectively evaluated 45 patients with UC that underwent yearly complete clinical, endoscopical and histologic evaluation.

SPEM has been found to be retalted with gastric adenocarcinoma (GCa) as strongly as intestinal metaplasia (IM). Also, in some mouse models of GCa, SPEM increased the risk of GCa, dramatically.</p><p id="Par6096"><bold>Method:</bold> Partial/total gastrectomy specimens of patients with GCa between 2015 and 2016, in Marmara University Department of Pathology, were included in the study.

Moreover, ossification is extremely rare in colorectal carcinoma and the responsible mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we report the case of a 70 year old woman with osseous metaplasia in colonic adenocarcinoma.</p><p id="Par6120"><bold>Method:</bold> A 70 year old woman presented to our hospital with a 2 month history of weight loss and abdominal pain in left iliac fossa. Colonoscopy revealed a circumferential, exofitic and infiltrative tumour 25 cm from the anus. A tumour biopsy indicated a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. Laboratory data (carcinoembryonic antigen – 2,78 ng/mL and carbohydrate antigen 19−9–4,1 u/mL) were within normal range. Abdominal computed tomography showed a left colonic tumour with calcified deposits. Therefore, Reybard sigmoidectomy was performed under general anesthesia.</p><p id="Par6121"><bold>Results:</bold> The resected specimen showed a circumferential, polypoid and infiltrative tumour (2,5/2,3/1,5 cm) with superficial ulceration, situated 2 cm from the distal margin. Histologically, the tumour was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma extending through the muscularis propria into the subserosal tissue. The tumour contained numerous foci of well-formed bony trabeculae within the stroma composed of osteoid and ossification with osteoblastic rimming. One of 14 dissected lymph nodes had metastatic adenocarcinoma without metaplastic ossification. The patient’s postoperative clinical course was uneventful and 3 months after surgery she showed no signs of recurrence.</p><p id="Par6122"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Colon cancer is a common disease, but coincidental osseous metaplasia is a very rare entity.

Gaiser</p><p id="Par6190"><sup>*</sup>University Med Center Mannheim, Institute of Pathology, Germany</p><p id="Par6191"><bold>Objective:</bold> Crohn’s disease, a condition of chronic inflammation of the intestine, significantly increases the risk for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Sporadic CRCs are characterized by a specific pattern of genomic imbalances and a landscape of acquired gene mutations. In this study we aimed to compare CRCs associated with Crohn’s disease with sporadic CRCs.</p><p id="Par6192"><bold>Method:</bold> We analyzed 26 Crohn’s disease associated CRCs, four matched dysplastic lesions, six matched inflamed mucosa samples, and two matched lymph node metastases using array comparative genomic hybridization and targeted sequencing (563 cancer related genes). As a control, we used normal intestinal mucosa from the resection margin of these CRCs and 24 sporadic CRCs.</p><p id="Par6193"><bold>Results:</bold> In general, CRCs that developed in patients with Crohn’s disease mainly showed chromosomal aberrations expected in CRC. However, we identified the following distinct mutation signature compared to sporadic CRC: TP53 (65 % in Crohn’s disease associated CRC versus 33 % in sporadic CRC), KRAS (27 % versus 54 %), APC (23 % versus 75 %), PIK3CA (19 % versus 8 %), SMAD4 (12 % versus 13 %) and SMAD3 (4 % versus 29 %). The genetic analyses of multiple lesions from individual patients revealed a high degree of intertumoural heterogeneity with diverse patterns of gene mutations and allowed reconstruction of the sequence of genetic events during Crohn’s disease associated tumourigenesis.</p><p id="Par6194"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our comprehensive molecular profiling of Crohn’s disease associated CRCs suggests that the genetic landscape of CRC is influenced by the activation of inflammation related pathways.

We investigated 173 cases CCR stage II in order to clarify their potential role for selecting high risk subgroup.</p><p id="Par6200"><bold>Method:</bold> Surgical tumour samples of 173 patients, retrospectively collected, were immunostained for CDX2 and DNA extraction was carried out for MSI analysis. In MSI+ samples mismatch repair proteins (MMR) expression and BRAF exon15 sequencing were performed. CDX2 staining was scored as weak-moderate or intense according to intensity of staining and percentage of positive cells.</p><p id="Par6201"><bold>Results:</bold> 33/169 (19 %) showed MSI (mean age 66y). In 12/173 (7 %) samples complete loss of CDX2 expression was observed; 40 (23 %) and 121 (70 %) samples showed weak or strong CDX2 expression respectively. CDX2 loss was associated with MSI (90 %), proximal location (90 %), BRAF V600E mutation (60 %), old age (mean age 72y).

Current surveillance guidelines recommend a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy after detection of high-risk adenomas, defined by multiplicity (three or more) or advanced lesions (&gt;1 cm in diameter, villous component and / or high-grade dysplasia). However, this recommendation is exclusively based on endoscopical and histological criteria. Among all the genes related to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, mutations in TP53 plays an important role.

The underlying mechanisms of cancer chemoresistance are not clear. GRP78 is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein critical for protein quality control, which might be associated with cancer chemoresistance. The study aims to explore whether the expression of GRP78 protein in rectal cancer is increased compared to the normal colonic epithelium and further upregulated in residual tumour following chemoradiation.</p><p id="Par6320"><bold>Method:</bold> The expression of GRP78 was assessed in normal rectal mucosa and adenocarcinoma by immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining intensity of GRP78 protein was categorized as no or weak staining (0–1+) and strong staining (2–3+). Fisher’s exact test with two tails was performed for statistical analysis.</p><p id="Par6321"><bold>Results:</bold> There is minimal expression of GRP78 protein in normal rectal mucosa. GRP78 expression in rectal adenocarcinoma is markedly upregulated compared with normal rectal mucosal epithelium (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Furthermore, Residual cancer cells after chemoradiation show uniform strong cytoplasmic expression of GRP78.</p><p id="Par6322"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study shows that the expression level of GRP78 is significantly increased in rectal adenocarcinoma compared to the normal colonic mucosa. Residual adenocarcinoma after chemoradiation has a diffuse strong GRP78 expression pattern.

First described by Dahl in 1985. Kepes and Zacharias introduced the term “gangliocytic paraganglioma” in 1971, because of features similar to ganglioneuroma and paraganglioma. These neoplasms are composed of an admixture of three cell types: epithelioid, spindle and ganglion cells. This tumour has generally been regarded as benign, but a few cases with regional lymph node metastasis and even distant metastasis have been reported.</p><p id="Par6392"><bold>Method:</bold> A 57-year-old woman presented to our institute with dyspepsia. An intraluminal mass at the second portion of the duodenum was discovered in upper endoscopy. The patient underwent endoscopic resection for which pathologic examination of the specimen demonstrated safe margins.</p><p id="Par6393"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination showed a circumscribed submucosal mass with spindle cells arranged in nests and trabeculae. Rare ganglion cells were identified, scattered within the spindle cell compartment. The epithelioid cells were positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin. Ganglion-like cells showed positive reactivity for synaptophysin. The spindle-shaped cells showed positive reactivity for S-100 protein. The expression of Ki-67 was &lt;2 %.</p><p id="Par6394"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In cases in which the tumour is resected with negative margins, it appears to be safe to continue with surveillance and forego adjuvant therapy.</p><p id="Par6395"><bold>PS-13-076</bold></p><p id="Par6396"><bold>Signet ring carcinoma of duodenum and cliac disease: Rare coexistence</bold></p><p id="Par6397"><underline>A.

Our aim was to examine the prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant HP-infection and its connection to gender and age in a monocentric cohort.</p><p id="Par6408"><bold>Method:</bold> 4744 HP-positive adults were examined (2708 females; 57.1 %, 2036 males; 42.9 %). HP-positive gastric mucosal tissue slides were investigated by a bacterial rRNA-targeted FISH-test (BactFISH Helicobacter Combi Kit) detecting the clarithromycin-sensitive and -resistant HP-bacteria.

We minimized this bias by dissociating FFPE tissue and purifying distinct cell populations. Furthermore, we demonstrate compatibility with downstream applications for DNA and RNA analysis.</p><p id="Par6416"><bold>Method:</bold> A protocol was established by testing different methods for enzymatic and mechanic tissue dissociation of colorectal cancer FFPE tissue, antibody labeling, and cell sorting. Tissue sections were deparaffinized, dissociated with collagenase/dispase solution, labeled with Cytokeratin (CK) and Vimentin (Vim) and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Purified populations (CK+/VIM-, CK-/VIM+ and CK+/VIM+) were used for DNA and RNA extraction and downstream analysis.</p><p id="Par6417"><bold>Results:</bold> DNA analysis of isolated cell fractions confirmed that all isolated populations were 99 % pure, despite differences in tissue composition.

MMR expression was evaluated immunhistochemically and correlated with nonparametric tests.</p><p id="Par6425"><bold>Results:</bold> Among 44 cases with multiple CRCs, 81 % had synchronous; 18 % had metachronous tumours. The median age was 69 ± 13.3 (range:35–91) vs 68.5 ± 8.2 (range 54–79) years-old; female/male ratio was 0.16 vs 0.33; most common initial-tumour localisation and pathological stage was left colon (55.6 % vs 75 %); pT3 (77.8 % vs 87.5 %) and pN0 (44.4 % vs 62.5 %) respectively for synchronous and metachronous tumours. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (27.5 % vs 0 %), satellite nodule (16.7 % vs. 12.5 %), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (22.2 % vs 0 %) and expansive tumour border(22.2 % vs 12.5 %) were more frequent in synchronous than metachronous CRCs (statistical insignificant).

LAMN and CEGCC shared immunophenotype (CK7, CK20, MUC2, CDX2, CK19, MUC5ac) being only CEGCC positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin. Targeted-NGS was performed in CEGCC, LAMN and non-tumoural paraffin embedded samples using Trusight Tumour 26 Panel (Illumina, San Diego,CA).

Correlation of CD133 expression with clinicopathological parameters was also verified in CRACs.</p><p id="Par6617"><bold>Results:</bold> The adenomas showed significantly lower cytoplasmic and nuclear CD133 expression than did the CRACs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The CRACs located in descending colon showed lower cytoplasmic expression of CD133 than did CRACs located in other sites (<italic>p</italic> = 0.037), and the nuclear expressions of CD133 were lower in the CRACs which made recurrence or distant metastasis than the rest without it (<italic>p</italic> = 0.032).

The management of this widely prevalent cancer, have indicated that the selection of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy, can improve survival rates for those patients whose tumours do not have RAS mutations (K-RAS and N-RAS oncogenes).</p><p id="Par6632"><bold>Method:</bold> Therefore we analyzed mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of K-RAS and N-RAS oncogenes on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the 51 patients with primary tumour in the colon or rectum or a metastasis. The majority of these tumour samples were from primary tumour rather than from biopsies of metastatic sites.</p><p id="Par6633"><bold>Results:</bold> Approximately half of patients with CRC have RAS wild-type tumours and half have RAS mutant tumours. RAS mutation prevalence was higher in females versus males (58.6 % versus 41,4 %).

It is extremely rare in the gastrointestinal tract. Most are carcinoid tumour admixed with adenocarcinoma, or adenocarcinoma combined with lymphoma. Here, we report a case of collision malignant melanoma and adenocarcinoma of the anorectal junction.</p><p id="Par6752"><bold>Method:</bold> A 74-year old female patient presented with a change in bowel habit and fresh per-rectal bleeding. The initial diagnostic biopsy showed a poorly differentiated tumour with malignant melanoma component present at the anorectal junction. She underwent abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and made a full postoperative recovery.</p><p id="Par6753"><bold>Results:</bold> The histology demonstrated a biphasic tumour with the morphology of both malignant melanoma and adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis.

Clinical and radiologic findings are no specific. Often metastases to the breast show histological features, suggestive of the original cancer but that is not always true and processing to immunohistochemistry seems to be a helpful means of diagnosis.</p><p id="Par6784"><bold>Method:</bold> We report the case of a 63-year-old patient recently diagnosed with a metastatic pancreatic cancer.</p><p id="Par6785"><bold>Results:</bold> On clinical examination we found a right mammary, subcutaneous nodule. It was mobile, firm and measuring 1.5 cm long axis, at the under outer quadrant. A mammogram revealed a deep nodule, dense and relatively well limited measuring 1x1cm. It was classified ACR4. The patient had a lumpectomy. In the frozen section, an infiltrating carcinoma was found. At the final examination, a cancerous tumour proliferation of glandular and trabecular architecture with tumour necrotic foci was noted. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumour cells are CK7 +, CK19+, CK20-, CEA focally positive, HR-, HER2 score 1+.

Overall, considering a 1 % cut-off, 62/114 (54 %) samples were CD73-positive (membranous with/without cytoplasmic pattern in most cases) with 20/114 samples (18 %) having &gt;50 % CD73-positive TC. Staining intensity was frequently heterogeneous and tended to correlate to staining extent. CD73 expression did not correlate with gender, age, clinical presentation of primary tumour or location of metastasis. CD73 expression in TC (both extent and intensity) correlated to decreased survival from biopsy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Of the samples containing TIMC (106/114), 35 % presented some staining, the majority in ≤5 % of TIMC.</p><p id="Par6858"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CD73 is frequently present in the metastatic melanoma milieu and our findings suggest that CD73 expression might be associated with reduced survival.</p><p id="Par6859"><bold>PS-14-009</bold></p><p id="Par6860"><bold>Teaching with technology: 3D software in the pathology classroom</bold></p><p id="Par6861"><underline>A.

The program was structured around 10 modules. At the end of each module the program assessed students based on the modeling of gross changes during the pathological process (stage I) and their understanding of microscopic changes (stage II).</p><p id="Par6864"><bold>Method:</bold> We asked 67 students and 6 instructors from two different universities to participate in multiple pilots of the program (involving two surveys and one focus group conducted in 2016 and 2017). The participants were assessed by the 3D software and after this assessment students were asked to fill in the questionnaire to evaluate the program (and its components) and to express their opinion about the potential applications of the program.</p><p id="Par6865"><bold>Results:</bold> All the respondents mentioned that visualization of the pathological process in the organ contributes to better understanding of the subject. Moreover, many of them suggested that the software could be used as a tool illustrating the processes described in the textbook. Both instructors and students mentioned that the program could represent an alternative to the written or oral classroom test, and a useful tool that allows to prepare for the pathology seminar. During the focus groups, participants also stressed that programme helps with remembering of the stages of the pathological process and changes that appear in the organ.</p><p id="Par6866"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The integration of the 3D software in the classroom helped to find creative and constructive ways to enhance the learning process for students making a challenging medical subject more approachable.</p><p id="Par6867"><bold>PS-14-011</bold></p><p id="Par6868"><bold>Pathology in social media: Recruitment campaign experience</bold></p><p id="Par6869"><underline>E.

Nowadays, the widespread use of Social-Media-Networks (SMN) allows us to present and spread our occupation to society and to the patient, our ultimate goal. A creation of a group dedicated to the promotion of pathology was proposed.</p><p id="Par6872"><bold>Method:</bold> The Spanish Society of Pathology (SEAP-IAP) sent a communication to all its members via email, including an application form offering joining a working-group through Twitter. The campaign was titled #IWantYouForSEAP, and animage of the Nobel-Prize-winning Spanish histopathologist, Dr. Santiago Ramón-y-Cajal, was used together with the slogan, “I Want you” by Montgomery-Flagg. The recruitment period lasted 1 month (August 2016).</p><p id="Par6873"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 31 applications were received (17-women-/14-men, average age 38.6 years), including 27-pathologists (6-residents), 2-histotechnicians, 1-biologist, 1-administrative personnel. There were participants from 22 cities and 25 different institutions.</p><p id="Par6874"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> - It is possible to promote and motivate teamwork within our discipline through the use of SMN, having a quick turnaround-time. - Although this is an initial inquiry, there are great possibilities and high expectations on behalf of the participants. - Proper use of SMN could help to close the gap between pathologists and society.</p><p id="Par6875"><bold>PS-14-012</bold></p><p id="Par6876"><bold>Microscopic image stitching for cytopatological analysis</bold></p><p id="Par6877">H.

During manual microscopy diagnosis, firstly it is desirable from pathologists to provide the optimum focusing by moving microscope stage on the Z axis. After implementation of focusing, they must move the microscope stage on the 3D axes (X-Y-Z) without losing focusing to see all parts of the specimen in-focus. Hence, during manual screening that consumes a lot of time for cell identification, misdiagnosis may occur due to analysis of pathologists with poor concentration and short attention. In this study it is aimed to obtain a panoramic image with high resolution and all parts of the specimen in-focus.</p><p id="Par6880"><bold>Method:</bold> The proposed study consists of two main steps that are auto focusing and auto scanning. In auto-focusing step, an image with all parts of region in-focus is obtained with image fusion method based on wavelet transform. During scanning process, the images with overlapped areas are obtained with optimal auto-focusing and are used for image stitching.</p><p id="Par6881"><bold>Results:</bold> The results indicate that if in focus images that are obtained with image fusion are used for image stitching process the more feature points are produced, and panoramic image with higher resolution and more quality is obtained.</p><p id="Par6882"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study, it is achieved to obtain a panoramic image higher resolution. Moreover, image stitching process is performed with loss of focusing and auto-focusing to show that autofocusing is crucial to obtain high quality panoramic image on microscopy.</p><p id="Par6883"><bold>PS-14-013</bold></p><p id="Par6884"><bold>Identification of barriers and facilitators for the implementation of standardised structured pathology reporting in the Netherlands</bold></p><p id="Par6885">C.

Although Dutch guidelines recommend SSR, uptake is relatively slow in the Netherlands. Identifying barriers and facilitators for SSR by pathologists is necessary to develop tailored implementation tools to increase SSR uptake.</p><p id="Par6888"><bold>Method:</bold> A focus group interview identified facilitators and barriers for SSR. These factors were classified by the theoretical framework levels of Flottorp: innovation (SSR), professional (pathologist), social setting, organization and (inter)national regulations. Findings were quantified using a web-based survey among Dutch pathologists.</p><p id="Par6889"><bold>Results:</bold> Ten pathologists participated in the focus group, and 92 pathologists completed the survey. Main barriers for SSR were inability to express nuances (30 %), and no clarity of usability (41 %). Barriers within the social setting were lack of support from direct colleagues (20 %) and the multidisciplinary team (34 %). At organizational level, lack of support by managers (11 %) and lack of information on availability and updates of SSR-modules (22 %) were mentioned.

Cytomorphological assessment, performed by pathologists under light microscope, reguires scanning all cells, determining whether the cells are malignant, benign or reactive. Since this assessment is tedious, subjective, time-consuming and in many cases error-prone procedure, the need for automated microscopy systems is arised. The detection of cell nuclei is seen as the corner stone for diagnostic purposes in automatic analysis of cytopathological images. Because, the nuclei is most salient structure within the cell and it exhibits significant morphological features and changes which contribute in the discrimination of malign, benign and reactive cells. Identification of the cancer cells in pleural effusion cytology allows for the early diagnosis of the cancer and also the staging, prognosis and monitoring these cells.</p><p id="Par6896"><bold>Method:</bold> With the development of machine learning algorithms, medical image processing applications have adapted these algorithms to enhance medical image classification performance.</p><p id="Par6897"><bold>Results:</bold> The experimental results show that the detection of the cell nuclei by the machine learning method is highly accurate.</p><p id="Par6898"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this paper, we investigate the applicability of machine learning techniques to create a fully automated system for cell nuclei detection in pleural effusion cytology.</p><p id="Par6899"><bold>PS-14-015</bold></p><p id="Par6900"><bold>MIAP - a new web-based platform to support the pathological diagnosis</bold></p><p id="Par6901"><underline>T.

In our opinion, this last point has been insufficiently studied. Currently, in our center, resource limitations, mainly human, have resulted in the task of pathology report editing to be assigned to the pathologist, with the consequent work overload related thereof. With the aim of achieving time optimization, a speech recognition system (SRS) was implemented.</p><p id="Par6936"><bold>Method:</bold> Two pathologists from our department, specialized in gastrointestinal (GI) pathology, were involved in the implementation of a Laboratory Information System (LIS) –integrated SRS (INVOX Medical Dictation, Vocali). With a preliminary training period of 2 weeks, a total of 60 GI pathology cases were randomly selected, with the intention of comparing the reporting time for both typing and dictation. Several abbreviations and shortcuts were established when using the SRS, including SNOMED CT automatic coding.</p><p id="Par6937"><bold>Results:</bold> The overall reporting time for the 60 cases was 95′36″ (1′36″/case) with the typing methodology, while for the SRS it was 42′57″ (43″/case).This meant a reduction in reporting time of 55.2 %. In addition, there was a standardization of the pathology reports, both for structured texts and those edited as continuous text.</p><p id="Par6938"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A SRS can help pathologists optimize time in signing out cases, making them more efficient and cost-effective. Abbreviations and shortcuts allow reports to be more standardized, while avoiding typing errors. At the same time, this methodology implies a lower physical demand, as it is more ergonomic and reduces work-related musculoskeletal disorders.

Bone-marrow biopsy was unremarkable without atypia in the cellular components.</p><p id="Par6985"><bold>Results:</bold> First kidney biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi and focal cortical infarct, along with intraglomerular, intravascular, and intratubular hyaline globules reminiscent of crystalline deposits of cryoglobulin precipitates. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was not observed. Deposits stained positive for IgG and lambda light-chain without reactivity for kappa. A diagnosis of renal injury induced by monoclonal cryoglobulins was forwarded after laboratory tests confirmed cryoglobulinemia in the patient who then underwent plasmapheresis.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis has been reported to occur in association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma but there is few data reporting the coexistence of glomerulopathy and lymphoma infiltration of kidney parenchyma in the renal biopsy.</p><p id="Par7112"><bold>Method:</bold> We report the case of 70-year—old male with small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SCLL) presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephrotic syndrome (NS).</p><p id="Par7113"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient underwent the renal biopsy that showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and diffuse lymphoma infiltration of the kidney parenchyma. Light microscopy showed accentuation of lobular architecture and increased cellularity in all glomeruli. Immunofluorescence study revealed fine granular staining for IgG, C3, lambda and kappa light chains along capillary loops and in mesangial areas. Electron microscopy showed subendothelial and mesangial electron dense deposits consistent with MPGN, type I. Immunostains demonstrates a predominantly B cell population of lymphocytic cells infiltrating renal parenchyma that lacked expression of CD5 and cycline D1.

Our study consists of 3 cases, diagnosed during a 1 year period, 2015 to 2016. We will try to empathise the similarities and differences of these three tumours regarding histopathological features as well as clinical presentation.</p><p id="Par7144"><bold>Method:</bold> The cases were diagnosed based on classical HE slides, correlated with neuroimaging and clinical data. Our results were later confirmed by immunohistochemestry.</p><p id="Par7145"><bold>Results:</bold> Three patients, two male and one female, aged 47, 63 and 26 were operated for tumours located in the craniospinal junction, pituitary and temporal lobe respectively. While the first patient presented location specific symptoms, the second had been diagnosed with a nonfunctional pituitary macroadenoma 14 years prior which was believed to have recurred. The third patient was being followed up for a thalamic cavernoma when a second lesion was observed. Histopathologically all tumours were heavily pigmented and, while the first presented an overall spindled morphology, the other two were epithelioid. While nuclear features were sometimes difficult to examine due to melanin deposits, none of the tumours had nuclear atypia or mitotic figures. The last case showed limited brain invasion but proliferation index remained low.</p><p id="Par7146"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Though uncommon, melanocytic tumours affect a wide age range. Derived from leptomeningeal melanocytes, they usually involve the brain base.

It rarely occurs outside of the central nervous system and present as a tumour of the skin or subcutaneous tissue. We present a case report of a 17 years old boy with a subcutaneous sacrococcygeal ME who was initially treated for the pilonidal sinus.</p><p id="Par7224"><bold>Method:</bold> A 17-year-old boy presented with a painless, subcutaneous mass located intergluteal fold. There was no other finding in physical examination. It was clinically diagnosed as a pilonidal sinus and the tract was excised.</p><p id="Par7225"><bold>Results:</bold> In gross examination, the specimen was a subcutaneous tissue measuring 5,2x4,2x4 cm partially covered by skin and measuring 4,5x1 cm. Serial sectioning revealed multilobulated, mass with myxoid cut surface measuring 4,5x4x3,5 cm. In histopathological examination, tumour showed the typical histological appearance of a ME and besides there was a pilonidal sinus.</p><p id="Par7226"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ependymomas account for only 5 % of all neurogenic tumours. ME’s a low-grade intradural tumour of ependymal origin that slowly growing in conus medullaris and filum terminale. It’s considered grade I of IV (WHO) at these sites. About 50 cases of ependymoma in extraspinal locations have been reported and the majority of them occur in the sacrococcygeal subcutaneous tissue or the presacral regions.</p><p id="Par7227"><bold>PS-16-014</bold></p><p id="Par7228"><bold>Neuropathological effect of airborne exposure to formaldehyde in occupational exposure</bold></p><p id="Par7229"><underline>R.

Currently, the potential role of endogenous formaldehyde and increase of acetylcholinesterase into the pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction has been characterized. However little attention has been paid to relationship between formaldehyde exposure and acetylcholine signals.</p><p id="Par7232"><bold>Method:</bold> Cholinergic signals as a neuropathological effect of formaldehyde has been investigated in all workers of 4 melamine workshops at Tehran. Acetylcholinesterase activity was conducted using Elman method. Airborne exposure to formaldehyde was evaluated by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health 3500 methods.</p><p id="Par7233"><bold>Results:</bold> Cholinergic activity in exposed people was evaluated 27.59 (min-max; 1.83–308.09) IU/L which is higher than control groups significantly. All of airborne exposure to formaldehyde were lower than the Threshold Limit Value Ceiling (TLV-C) 0.3 ppm accepted by ACGIH. There are spearman correlation between occupational exposure to formaldehyde and acetylcholinesterase activity.</p><p id="Par7234"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our experimental finding reveal that the neurotoxic pathogenesis of formaldehyde depends on the cholinergic activity. It can be concluded that formaldehyde cause acetylcholinesterase activity enhancement which could be associated to cognitive dysfunction.</p><p id="Par7235"><bold>PS-16-015</bold></p><p id="Par7236"><bold>Chordoid glioma of the third ventricle: Diagnostic pitfalls and differential diagnosis of chordoid tumours - case report</bold></p><p id="Par7237">M.

Ciurea</p><p id="Par7238"><sup>*</sup>Bagdasar-Arseni Hospital, Bucharest, Romania</p><p id="Par7239"><bold>Objective:</bold> Chordoid glioma was first described in 1998 and included in the WHO classification 2 years later. While very rare (about 80 cases reported) it seems to be confined to the third ventricle area, specifically the lamina terminalis of its ventral wall.</p><p id="Par7240"><bold>Method:</bold> A 57 years old man was admitted to our hospital showing signs of elevated intracranial pressure. MRI revealed a dense suprasellar mass of 48/38/32 mm which “pushed back” the third ventricle. It was interpreted as meningioma. A subtotal resection was performed.</p><p id="Par7241"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, the tumour appeared as a whitish solid mass with a glossy, mucinous surface. It was included in two blocks of paraffin and prepared for examination. The patient however developed postoperative complications and died soon after surgery. Light microscopy examination revealed a chordoid looking neoplasm which was initially diagnosed as chordoid meningioma. Reexamining the case raised certain questions as no clear meningothelial features were apparent. Several areas of limphoplasmocitic infiltrate with frequent Russel bodies as well as important associated gliosis (with numerous Rosenthal fibers and granular eosinophilic bodies) gave it away as a chordoid glioma.</p><p id="Par7242"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Differential diagnosis of chordoid tumours usually involves chordoma, chordoid meningioma and chordoid glioma, the last one being the least frequent. While location seems very specific, the other tumours are also common in the suprasellar area and regular neuroimaging does not always distinguish exact origin. Chordoid glioma is often associated with high perioperative mortality due to its deep location and hypothalamic involvement.</p><p id="Par7243"><bold>PS-16-017</bold></p><p id="Par7244"><bold>Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour: A rare low grade neoplasm with distinguishing histological features</bold></p><p id="Par7245">M.

Since then it has been reported to other locations. It is a rare neoplasm and while incidence rates are still unavailable we found around 60 reported cases to date. We believe it to be more frequent but often misdiagnosed.</p><p id="Par7248"><bold>Method:</bold> A 15 years old male, treated for epilepsy, underwent a cerebral MRI. The scans revealed a relatively circumscribed, T2 hyperintense mass with moderate edema in the IV ventricle area. Neurosurgical resection was decided. During intraoperative examination, frozen sections and squash technique showed both glial as well as neurocitic elements.</p><p id="Par7249"><bold>Results:</bold> Examination of the parafin embedded, HE colored sections confirmed this biphasic pattern. The glial component revealed a loose, fibrilary matrix with few Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies. The neurocitic areas consisted of small cells with round nuclei arranged around a neuropil core which gave the distinct appearance of rosettes. Vascular proliferations were focally present as part of the glial, pylocitic-like component. No mitotic figures were present.</p><p id="Par7250"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our case represents a typical one: young adult with IV ventricle tumour showing byphasic glial and neurocytic patterns. Such patterns are very important to recognize as the tumour is grade I with very good clinical outcome. Our patient shows no postoperative deficits and will continue to be followed up. The presence of epilepsy was an unrelated condition.</p><p id="Par7251"><bold>PS-16-018</bold></p><p id="Par7252"><bold>Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour - histological evolution: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par7253"><underline>S.

However, there are 11 cases of malignant transformation reported in the literature. A histological evolution of a DNET case is presented.</p><p id="Par7256"><bold>Method:</bold> A 4-year-old boy with a 6 month history of seizures was referred to neurosurgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion in the left frontal-temporal lobe. He underwent surgery and histopathological evaluation disclosed a typical DNET. Three years after the initial surgery, follow-up MRI demonstrated progression of disease. Reresection was performed, and the specimen was again interpreted as a DNET. Ten years later, the patient presented a new lesion at the base of the previous surgery which was again removed.</p><p id="Par7257"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathological examination of the new lesion showed an oligodendroglioma WHO grade II, lacking IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion—paediatric-type oligodendroglioma.</p><p id="Par7258"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although the majority of DNET cases demonstrate benign behaviour, it retains the potential for recurrence and malignant transformation.

With aging, our immune system may initiate averse inflammation that may involve the systemic and central nervous systems (CNS). Microglia, the resident CNS macrophages, play a central role in AD. These cells regulate neuroinflammation in AD and are involved in disease propagation. They surround Amyloid-ß plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Previously, using sera of the Rotterdam study, we identified the pan-protease inhibitor Pregnancy Zone Protein (PZP) as a predictor for AD in women. PZP appeared to be elevated in microglia of AD patients. We want to compare the proteome of microglia of AD-patients with that of age-matched non-AD controls</p><p id="Par7272"><bold>Method:</bold> We stained fresh frozen postmortem brain tissue from AD patients and controls for P2ry12, a microglia specific marker. Using laser capture microdissection we enriched for microglia and analyzed the proteome using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer.</p><p id="Par7273"><bold>Results:</bold> This will allow us to specifically analyze the microglia proteome.

The immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against CD99, GFAP, synaptophysin, EMA, pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3, S100, vimentin, NSE, chromogranin A, p53 and neuroblastoma marker (clone NB84a); FISH analysis was used to detect 1p36 deletions.</p><p id="Par7281"><bold>Results:</bold> All CNS neuroblastomas and the peripheral one expressed S100, NSE, synaptophysin and did not express CD99 and the neuroblastoma marker. The average value of Ki-67 was 15–20 % in the adults and 52 % in the baby. The deletion in chromosome 1p36 was detected only in the patient aged 54 years with a slow-growing tumour for 6 years and the absence of recurrences and metastasis for 5 years after the treatment.

The tumour histopathologically consisted of solid and highly-cellular areas with small, uniform cells that formed typical rosettes. Atypia, mitoses and necrosis were absent. The tumour was positive for Synaptophysin, NSE, negative for GFAP. Ki67 index was 1 %. Considering the typical presentation, the tumour was diagnosed as WHO grade I pineocytoma. After 7 years, the neoplasm recurred and was composed mainly of papillary structures with cells with low-grade atypia. Rosettes, mitoses and necrosis were absent.

On MRI a left parietal tumour was found extending into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle and corpus callosum. She was submitted to surgery, the excision was incomplete and she suffered one local recurrence 6 years later. At this time she underwent radiotherapy and then reinterventioned.</p><p id="Par7297"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, the neoplasia was solid and papillary, with psammoma bodies, formed by small isomorphic cells with rare dysmorphic nuclei; cytoplasm was vast, eosinophilic and finely granular.

Germline SMARCE1 mutations have been described in hereditary forms of this disease and more recently in small clear cell meningioma series. The diagnosis value of SMARCE1 in distinguishing between clear cell meningiomas (CCM) and other meningioma variants has not been yet established.

The main molecular alteration involves BRAF (tandem duplication and fusion with KIAA1549 in more than 70 %, BRAF-V600E mutation in 5 %). Previous studies have shown senescence phenomena in PA cell lines. The tumour suppressor protein p16 plays a role in the oncogenic-induced senescence.

We focused on diagnostic changes, especially in using immunohistochemistry. Three types of tumours were described in the WHO CNS 2007: pituicytoma (PT), spindle cell oncocytoma (SCO) and granular cell tumour of sellar region (GCT). Tumour cells of pituicytomas strongly express the TTF1 like immature and mature pituicytes. It suggests their origin in pituicytes. TTF1 can also be detected in both SCO and GCT. This new fact supports their derivation from pituicytes too. The explanation of differentiation of three distinct tumours from pituicytes is the existence of several subtypes of pituicytes in physiologically developing neurohypopsysis.</p><p id="Par7353"><bold>Results:</bold> Based on new findings are three types of above described tumours now classified as variants of pituicytoma, WHO grade I.

It’s a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in GFAP gene (17q21). It’s inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, most cases arise de novo as a result of sporadic mutations. AD is characterized by delayed development of physical, psychological and behavioural skills, macrocephaly, seizures and spasticity; in some cases hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and dementia are present.</p><p id="Par7360"><bold>Method:</bold> 7-month-old male that required surveillance due to triventricular ventriculomegalia during prenatal screening.

As MRI scan showed a contrasting irregular mass in the 4th ventricle, she underwent to tumourectomy surgery. Case 2: One-year-old boy with symptoms of intracranial pressure increase was admitted to the neurosurgery department. An excisional biopsy was performed because of non-enhancing mass which was detected in the parietal lobe posterior of central sulcus by MRI scan. Neoplastic cells, which had narrow cytoplasm and small blue hyperchromatic nuclei, frequently made multilayered rosettes, true rosettes, and pseudo-rosettes. In case 1, between the neuropilic areas, many rhabdoid cells were also noticed. Neoplastic cells showed immunoreactivity with vimentin, CD99, EMA(luminal), INI-1, and most importantly LIN28A. GFAP was positive in the neuropil areas. In case 1, desmin was positive in rhabdoid cells, respectively. The diagnosis was ETMR with rhabdoid differentiation, NOS, grade IV, for case 1.

Although an infiltrative growth, 1p19q co-deletions and Olig2 expression have been described in AEVN, IDH1 or p53 mutations haven’t been reported to date. These findings could support the existence of a distinctive glioneuronal tumour, a common progenitor cell with divergent differentiation and/or a histogenetic overlap between EVN and oligodendrogliomas.</p><p id="Par7387"><bold>PS-16-037</bold></p><p id="Par7388"><bold>Two rare cases of kidney and lung cancer metastases to primary brain tumours</bold></p><p id="Par7389"><underline>S.

Immunotherapy has emerged as a new therapeutic approach in recent years and it is found to be that Indolamin-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which is a kynurenine metabolic pathway enzyme is playing a role in glioma cells immune escape and that high IDO expression levels are correlated with lower survival rates.</p><p id="Par7400"><bold>Method:</bold> This study included 82 patients with grade 2, 3 or 4 diffuse glial tumours according to WHO 2007 classification.

MRI showed a tumour in the left hemisphere of the brain in the temporal-occipital region with the characteristics of high-grade glioma.</p><p id="Par7473"><bold>Results:</bold> Discussion: Based on the morphological appearance of the tumour, one of our first impressions was that of an epitheloid glioblastoma. In the immunohistochemistry the tumour cells are strongly CD34, S100, and Vimentin and partly GFAP and EGFR positive. Anti-p53 reveals only a faint expression in the tumour nuclei, ATRX is not lost. There is no expression of mutant IDH1. The MIB1 proliferation shows up with a maximum of 9 %. Based on the morphological appearance of the tumour, the first impressions was that of an epitheloid glioblastoma, however, due to the leptomeningeal growth, the presence of reticulin fibers, and strong CD34 immunoreactivity of tumour cells, we considered in our differential diagnosis also a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA).</p><p id="Par7474"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Three months latter the patient presented new symptoms, CT-scan and MRI revealed a relapse of the tumour.

Extra-axial, extra ventricular localization is not common. Extra-axial supratentorial ependymomas (EASE) are radiologically mimicking to meningiomas. There are several hypothesis about the origin of EASEs. The most favored one is that the tumour arises from heterotopic placement of ependymal cell rests during the fetal development and grows up subsequently.</p><p id="Par7480"><bold>Method:</bold> Twenty-seven years old female was presented to our hospital’s neurosurgery clinic with complainings of hedache, vomiting and seizure. Cranial MR imaging revealed an extra-axial mass at right temporal region which was thought as meningioma preoperatively.The tumour was totally excised by left temporal craniotomy.</p><p id="Par7481"><bold>Results:</bold> The mass was in pale yelow and smoother than meningioma. The mass was attaching to dura mater. Histological analysis of the surgical specimens revealed perivascular pseudorosettes, atypic mitoses, necrosis and immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein established the diagnosis of anaplastic ependymoma.</p><p id="Par7482"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although there are very few cases of supratentorial extraaxial ependymoma in the literature, it is possible to find it as it is in our case, and it should be kept in mind even though it is rarely seen in the differential diagnosis.</p><p id="Par7483"><bold>PS-16-051</bold></p><p id="Par7484"><bold>Calvarial metastasis as clinic presentation of renal cell carcinoma: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par7485">E.

Approximately 25 % cases of RCC present with distant metastasis at the initial evaluation. Renal cell carcinoma can metastasize everywhere, the most frequent sites are lung, bone, controlateral kidney. Calvarium is an extremely unusual site for a metastatic RCC.</p><p id="Par7488"><bold>Method:</bold> A 76-year-old male patient presented with enlarging mass, headache and tinnitus. Computerized tomography was performed, showing an expansive mass at subcutis, retroauriculer region up to talamic region.</p><p id="Par7489"><bold>Results:</bold> The mass was removed and it sized 6x5x2 cm. H&amp;E stained sections revealed a malignant tumour arranged in papillary and nesting patern with variably sized tumour cell, nests were seperated by delicate fibrovascular septae. Cells in the larger nests were focally discohesive, giving rise to alveolar pattern. The tumour cells were large, round to polygonal, containing abundant, eosinophilic, and granular to clear cytoplasm. Mitoses were rare. The tumour cells were immunreactive for Vimentin, PanCK, EMA and CD10.</p><p id="Par7490"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Renal tumours are frequently accompanied by bone metastasis.

Psaridi</p><p id="Par7494"><sup>*</sup>Red Cross Hospital, Pathology, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par7495"><bold>Objective:</bold> Low Grade Gliomas(LGG-WHO grade II) include astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma. Oligodendroglioma (median survival 12 years) presents low mitotic activity, no necrosis and the characteristic chromosomal codeletion 1p/19q. Diffuse astrocytoma (median survival 6–8 years) is a diffusely infiltrating neoplasm with hypercellularity, without mitoses. By imaging both neoplasms present diffuse infiltration with indistinct borders. Histologic diagnosis of a LGG is necessary, since it is related to prognosis for survival and prediction for response to therapy.</p><p id="Par7496"><bold>Method:</bold> Woman, 58 years old, came with bipolar disorder. CT: a low-grade lesion of 0,8 mm at left frontal-parietal lobe. MRI: lesion consistent with low-grade diffuse astrocytoma without calcifications. Paraffin-embedded tissue was examined with histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization with MLPA.</p><p id="Par7497"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, a low cellular tumour, consisting of monomorphous cells with round nuclei and often perinuclear haloes, was observed. No calcifications, no necrosis. Low mitotic count (1 mitosis/10HPF). Immunohistochemistry: GFAP(+), Leu-7(+), p53(10 %), Ki-67(4–5 %). Molecular testing: 1p/19q codeletion. Diagnosis: Oligodendroglioma WHO grade II.</p><p id="Par7498"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Oligondrogliomas with 1p/19q codeletion have usually a retarded progression and a better response to chemotherapy. Since anaplastic transformation of a diffuse astrocytoma is higher than for oligodendroglioma, genetic testing for 1p/19q codeletion seems essential to incorporate to diagnosis so as to possibly direct treatment.</p><p id="Par7499"><bold>PS-16-053</bold></p><p id="Par7500"><bold>Intracranial benign cystic lesions</bold></p><p id="Par7501"><underline>I.

Our observations were compared with a review of the literature on cases of cloacal dysgenesis.</p><p id="Par7529"><bold>Results:</bold> All 4 fetuses showed a persistent cloaca (large dilated intraabdominal cystic formation, communicating with the intestine). Abnormalities or complete absence of the external genitalia and associated renal malformations were features noted in both female and male cases. The gonads were hypoplastic, absent or ectopic in one of the female cases. Anal atresia was present in all female fetuses, but was not seen in our male case. Vertebral defects were seen in one of the female fetuses. Cardiovascular malformations and focal amyoplasia were seen only in the male fetus. On prenatal ultrasonography all four cases were diagnosed as cases of megacystis. Dysplastic cystic renal changes were also detectable by ultrasound. Our findings were overall consistent with those described in the literature.

Carrier identification and newborn screening have significant implications in the overall prognosis of CF patients. However, current CFTR genotyping assays fail to detect mutations that are prevalent in non-white ethnic groups and cannot detect large deletions, which commonly drive CF pathogenesis in certain European populations. We present a method based on Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP™) and NGS for comprehensive, pan-ethnic detection of CFTR variants, including large deletions.</p><p id="Par7680"><bold>Method:</bold> AMP uses unidirectional gene-specific primers and molecular barcoded adapters for amplification of known and unknown mutations. Anchored primers amplify large genomic regions from both ends independently, permitting independent sequencing of both wildtype and variant alleles.</p><p id="Par7681"><bold>Results:</bold> We show 100 % accuracy of CFTR variant detection, and identified 34 unique mutations in a blinded screen of 1,585 U.S. clinical samples.

Differential diagnoses include osteomyelitis, metastasis, osteolysis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis and hyperparathyroidism. The medical treatment for Gorham’s disease includes radiation therapy, anti-osteoclastic medication and alpha-2b interferon.

The molecular hallmark of these tumours is presence of deletions and/or mutations of SMARCB1 or rarely SMARCA4 leading to absence of INI1 or BRG1 proteins. The histologic diagnosis is based on INI1 negative immunoreactivity and presence of rhabdoid morphology.

It is characterized by hepatic and extrahepatic siderosis sparing the reticuloendothelial system. The most important pathological features are heavy liver siderosis and siderotic cirrhosis resulting in hepatic failure at birth.</p><p id="Par7728"><bold>Method:</bold> We described a case of NH complicated with hydrops fetalis and fetal death due to iron overload and severe liver disease.</p><p id="Par7729"><bold>Results:</bold> The 37-week-old male stillborn was born to a 37-year-old woman with history of gestational diabetes and miscarriage. The antenatal ultrasound performed before fetal death showed severe fetal hydrops and heterogenous hepatic structure. On postmortem examination, the fetus had facial dysmorphism, cardiomegaly with marked ventricular hypertrophy, splenomegaly and cirrhotic hepatomegaly. Microscopically, the liver architecture was distorted with extensive portal bridging fibrosis and marked siderosis of hepatocytes. Hemosiderin deposits were also demonstrated to a lesser extent in renal tubules, pancreatic acini and zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Reticuloendothelial siderosis was absent. Fibrous thickening of the splenic tissue was noted.</p><p id="Par7730"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case supports the importance of the autopsy in establishing the diagnosis of NH which is associated with high risk of recurrence.

Deftereou</p><p id="Par7734"><sup>*</sup>Democritus University of Thrace, Lab. Histology-Embryology, Alexandroupolis, Greece</p><p id="Par7735"><bold>Objective:</bold> Preeclampsia constitutes an embryonic disorder characterized by aberrant functioning of the vascular intima and vasospasm. Clinically, it can be diagnosed through hypertension and proteinuria, resulting in abnormal placentation. Transmembrane serine protease, Corin, transforms pro-ANP to active ANP, which regulates blood pressure. In this regulation, also, contributes the process of the proteolytic cleavage. The purpose consists of the immunohistochemical study of Corin expression and its correlation to tissues’ histopathology.</p><p id="Par7736"><bold>Method:</bold> Fifty placental specimens, either normal or preeclamptic, were obtained and then processed histologically. At the next step, they were immunohistochemically analyzed in order to evaluate Corin’s expression.</p><p id="Par7737"><bold>Results:</bold> After observing all the processed tissue samples, we detected decreased expression of Corin protein on the pathological placentas in comparison with non-preeclamptic ones. More notably, the aggregation of the preeclamptic specimens displayed hypoexpression of Corin protease. However, the normal placental tissues demonstrated higher Corin expression.</p><p id="Par7738"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to our results, Corin hypoexpression inextricably correlates with the appearance of preeclampsia. Thus, Corin could be considered as a remarkable prognostic biomarker in fetal tissues as far as preeclampsia is concerned. Nevertheless, there are relatively few investigations concerning Corin’s expression in preeclampsia, thus, its crucial role awaits further elucidation.</p><p id="Par7739"><bold>PS-17-036</bold></p><p id="Par7740"><bold>Placental terminal villi adaptations under maternal congenital heart disease conditions</bold></p><p id="Par7741"><underline>O.

HAEC may manifest as abdominal distension and explosive diarrhea along with emesis, and even shock. Case report: A non-breastfed infant, born in term, was admitted to hospital 7 days after delivery with severe diarrhea and vomiting. Clinical examination did not reveal any cause of this condition and the infant was discharged, although the symptoms did not improve. Despite regular check-ups by a paediatrician, who recommended to change nutrition formula, symptoms progressed to lethargy. In spite of rapid transport to the Hospital the infant died at the age of 34 days due to septic shock. The autopsy revealed gross signs of pseudomembranous colitis.</p><p id="Par7856"><bold>Method:</bold> Histological examination of all segments of intestines was performed.

The previous ultrasound diagnosis was an indeterminate polymalformative syndrome.</p><p id="Par7864"><bold>Method:</bold> Before the autopsy of the fetus was done, an X-ray examination was requested to identify possible osseous malformations. The pathological study was performed in a conventional way. DNA, previously obtained from placental chorionic villi, was used for the genetic study, and a wide panel of skeletal dysplasias was evaluated with Next Generation Sequencing.</p><p id="Par7865"><bold>Results:</bold> The findings in the radiological and pathological studies were: facial malformations, arthrogryposis, bilateral tibial spines, bowed limbs, narrowed thoracic spinal canal, among others which led to the diagnosis of Campomelic dysplasia.

Neuropathological examinations delayed the reports with up to several months. One department had turnaround times of 10 days without and 32 days with neuropathological examination. Short response times were due to widespread use of additional reports in cases where special examinations of no importance for underlying death or for clinicians would result in delay of the final reports, as some neuropathological examinations. The same department also did not send preliminary autopsy reports, in contrast to the practise followed by all other departments.</p><p id="Par7874"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Short turnaround times may be achieved by changing the way of reporting autopsy answers.

After physical examination and routine laboratory was done, laparascopy for suspected appendicitis was performed. The patient’s condition was deteriorating and was transferred to Intensive Care Unit. CT-scan revealed a hypoattenuating venous filling defect with superior mesenteric vein enlargement. She was scheduled for second-look operation where small intestinal infarcted segment was resected. Unfortunately, the patient died 3 days after hospitalisation.</p><p id="Par7897"><bold>Results:</bold> Autopsy revealed superior mesentery vein thrombosis associated with small bowel infarction, fibrinopurulent peritonitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Analysis of genetic status for known pro-thrombotic mutations has revealed compound heterozygosity for 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt;C in MTHFR gene and heterozygosity for Factor V R2 mutation. The assumed reduced MTHFR enzyme activity, combined with the genetic constitution, abdominal trauma and infection has lead to precipitation of thrombophilic disorders.</p><p id="Par7898"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A screening of primary coagulation abnormalities must be carried out in all patients with MVT because they represent the most frequent cause of venous thrombosis.

Herein, we examined characteristic cytopathological features of mammary LELC.</p><p id="Par8040"><bold>Method:</bold> The patient was a 50-year-old postmenopausal Japanese woman who had noted swelling of a left axillary lymph node. Ultrasonography revealed an irregularly shaped, hypoechoic left breast mass as well as enlargement of the regional node. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the affected lymph node yielded a cytologic diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma.</p><p id="Par8041"><bold>Results:</bold> The intraoperative FNA specimen from the breast tumour showed high cellularity with numerous lymphocytes in a hemorrhagic background. Carcinoma cells were loosely arranged in solid clusters, although single, dissociated carcinoma cells were frequent. Some carcinoma cell clumps were prominently infiltrated by lymphocytes. Large carcinoma cells had ovoid or irregularly shaped nuclei with a fine granular chromatin pattern and distinct nucleoli. Multinodular tumour mass, measuring 12x8mm, were histologically composed of polygonal carcinoma cells, with relatively clear cytoplasm and large nuclei, accompanied by intratumoural tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as well as stromal TILs. Metastasis was identified in one of 23 excised lymph nodes. Carcinoma cells were immunohistochemically positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and 34βE12 showing a “triple negative” subtype.

A minority of symptomatic samples was negative for both markers, but follow-up on these is still too short to make definitive conclusions. Dual positivity was only found in some of the high grade UC that were not a diagnostic problem.

Most patients present with advanced disease and have very low survival rate.</p><p id="Par8080"><bold>Method:</bold> Sixty-four year-old man presenting with recent cervical mass and thyroid nodule. Both were submitted to fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). MGG and PAP stained smears and immunocytochemistry were performed.</p><p id="Par8081"><bold>Results:</bold> Smears of thyroid and cervical mass showed single cells and three dimensional aggregates. Cells were round and spindle, with large pleomorphic nuclei, bi/multinucleation, and dense cytoplasm. Expression of TTF-1 and thyroglobulin was strong and diffuse on both samples. Cytokeratin and p53 were also focally positive. Despite the diagnosis of ACT, the patient was considered eligible for surgery. Histology confirmed cytological findings. Local recurrence was detected 1 month later and palliative radiotherapy initiated. The patient died 3 months after initial diagnosis.</p><p id="Par8082"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> TTF-1, PAX8 and TTF-2 are fundamental for differentiation of thyroid tissue and control expression of thyroglobulin, which has been linked to iodine avidity. As such, this expression is typically lost in ACTs although it has been reported in rare cases, as a result of diffusion from normal follicles. Our case expressed TTF-1 and thyroglobulin in both primary and metastatic tumour.

These groups were composed of cells with scant, round and vacuolated cytoplasm and a high N/C ratio. Whereas some tumour cell nuclei had basophilic- finely granular chromatin with prominent nucleoli, others included only eosinophilic- fine chromatin. In both cell types, the nuclei were round-to oval,hyperchromatic and had smooth nuclear membrane. After Pap Smear was reported as malignant tumour cells, the patient underwent a radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy and final pathology report revealed PNET. The patient is alive in five-year follow up.</p><p id="Par8186"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although tumour cells of PNET rarely present in Pap Smears, sometimes they can be the first sign and lead to a guide for management of patients.</p><p id="Par8187"><bold>PS-19-040</bold></p><p id="Par8188"><bold>Thyroid secondary tumours diagnosed by FNA: 6-year-experience from tertiary care centre</bold></p><p id="Par8189"><underline>I.

Thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is useful in nodule evaluation. The goal was to examine the cytological and clinical features of secondary tumours diagnosed by FNA.</p><p id="Par8192"><bold>Method:</bold> A series of 15 secondary tumours from the 6-year-period (2011–2016) from university hospital pathology department is presented.</p><p id="Par8193"><bold>Results:</bold> The secondary tumours were diagnosed in 7 males and 8 females with mean age 71 years (age range 47–95 years). The primary malignancy was known in 10 cases in time of FNA diagnostics. The cell block was performed in 13 cases with contributive immunocytochemistry in 10 cases. The histopathological correlate was available in 5 cases, where surgical resection of thyroid gland or autopsy was performed. In two cases, continuous spread of primary tumour was revealed.</p><p id="Par8194"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FNA is reliable in the diagnostics of thyroid secondary malignancies with the contributive role of immunocytochemistry and essential role of the knowledge of malignancy history.</p><p id="Par8195"><bold>PS-19-043</bold></p><p id="Par8196"><bold>Fine needle aspiration of synchronous bilateral breast cancer</bold></p><p id="Par8197">E.

Fine Needle Aspiration of breast lesions is routinely performed in our hospital. We reviewed our archives, found the diagnosed cases of bilateral breast cancer, and compared them with histologic findings.</p><p id="Par8200"><bold>Method:</bold> One thousand sixty-four aspirates in breast lesions, most of them palpable, were performed during the last 8 years. The aspiration was done using 21-gauge needle. Conventional and Thin Prep smears were prepared.</p><p id="Par8201"><bold>Results:</bold> Two hundred twenty-five were carcinomas. In seven women (mean age 65 years), the aspiration of the masses revealed bilateral carcinomas and excision was advised. All but two were palpable and in the latter cases an ultrasound guided FNA of the impalpable lesions was performed. The most common type was ductal carcinoma in both breasts.</p><p id="Par8202"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A bilateral breast cancer is considered synchronous, by most authors, if it is diagnosed within 3 months after the first breast cancer. The initial tumour is usually diagnosed by palpation whereas the contralateral tumour is often diagnosed by mammography. Thus careful screening of the contralateral breast is essential in all patients with unilateral breast cancer.</p><p id="Par8203"><bold>PS-19-044</bold></p><p id="Par8204"><bold>Diagnostic effectiveness of cell block preparation in routine thyroid cytology</bold></p><p id="Par8205"><underline>U.

We compared PrestoSystem, Only-PrestoChill and Only-Presto Vs traditional.</p><p id="Par8293"><bold>Results:</bold> Pathologists had substantial agreement on diagnosis feasibility. We observed less variation in scores of PrestoSystem compared to Traditional. Specimens scoring inadequate in diagnosis were all in the frozen in liquid nitrogen groups. PrestoSystem scored equal or better than Traditional, improving the diagnosis score in 45 % of cases; moreover, scores for cytology, staining and architecture were significantly better for PrestoSystem than Traditional. Only-Presto and Only-PrestoChill received better scores for diagnosis than Traditional in 20 and 30 % of cases, respectively.</p><p id="Par8294"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PrestoSystem was always equal or better in diagnosis compared to traditional technique.

The aim of our study was to present the advantages and disadvantages of using cell blocks in cytology for diagnostic purpose.</p><p id="Par8308"><bold>Method:</bold> In this study, we selected cases in which patients were known with neoplastic lesions or not, in order to investigate the diagnostic value and validity of examining cell block slides and to determine the effectiveness of this method by comparing the cell block cytomorphology and immunhistochemical stain versus conventional cytology, in both gynecological and non-gynecological preparates.</p><p id="Par8309"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 46 samples were collected for this study. From these a number of 26 were gynecological samples and the remaining 20 samples consisted of ascites fluid, pleural fluid and fine needle aspiration from the breast. The samples were processed by performing a conventional smear and by making a cell block, and results were evaluated.</p><p id="Par8310"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The combined use of conventional cytology and cell block increase remarkably accurate cytologic diagnosis. In suspected lesions, cell block is a superior technique than smear by establishing a classification of the lesion. Cell block offers increased cellularity compared to conventional cytology. Multiple sections can be obtained for special stains and immunohistochemical study, with applications in the differential diagnosis. Therefore, along with the conventional cytology, cell block can be used as an adjuvant in evaluating fluid aspirates in order to obtain a final diagnosis as accurately as possible.</p><p id="Par8311"><bold>PS-21-008</bold></p><p id="Par8312"><bold>Optimised in vitro model for testing the molecular background of tumour damage caused by modulated electro-hyperthermia</bold></p><p id="Par8313"><underline>E.

Earlier we showed mEHT provoking significant apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) mediated cell death and immune cell infiltration in HT29 colorectal cancer xenografts of immunocompromised mice. In this study, we tested mEHT related damage responses using tumours grown in immunocompetent mice.</p><p id="Par8332"><bold>Method:</bold> C26 colorectal cancer allografts (CRCA) were treated for 30 min using single shot mEHT. The expression of heat shock, growth-, damage signaling and immune response associated proteins was tested in situ and in vitro.</p><p id="Par8333"><bold>Results:</bold> Loco-regional mEHT treatment caused significant caspase-dependent apoptosis in C26 CRCA with reduced phospho-Raf 1; and elevated phospho-ERK1/2 protein levels of dominantly cytoplasmic localisation. Ki67 protein expression disappeared completely from mEHT affected tumour cell nuclei. mEHT promoted the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) proteins such as Hsp70, calreticulin and HMGB1. In line with this, the number of tumour infiltrating S100+ antigen-presenting dendritic cells and CD3+ T-cells showed major increase.</p><p id="Par8334"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In immunocompetent mice, mEHT treatment interfered both with cell cycle progression and the MAP kinase related downstream growth pathway.

The method is based on the time delay (“lifetime”) between the excitation of molecules and the emission of the fluorescence photons. which depends on the molecule structure and the physico-chemical environment. A virtual fluorescence lifetime image is created by transforming lifetime values in pseudo-colors for each pixel. For theoretical reasons, this technique should be able to recognize metastatic cells inside lymphatic tissue.</p><p id="Par8356"><bold>Method:</bold> We collected from the files 25 cases of routinely formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes containing carcinoma metastases.. FLIM images of unstained slides of dewaxed histologic sections were obtained by a confocal microscope equipped with a pulsed laser at 405 nm, and a time-correlated single-photon counter.</p><p id="Par8357"><bold>Results:</bold> Whereas lymphatic tissue showed only very weak or no autofluorescence signals, metastatic carcinoma cells revealed usually prominent cytoplasmatic autofluorescence, thus permitting easily their detection on screening. In neuroendcrine neoplasias, the cytoplasmic autofluorescence showed dot-like features.

However, formalin poses several health hazards. Identification of non-toxic, readily available fixative agent is necessary. The objective of this study was to compare tissue fixative property of three agents, including 30 % jaggery, 70 % ethanol and 2 % mepivacaine with epinephrine 1: 100,000 to 10 % formalin.</p><p id="Par8428"><bold>Method:</bold> 24 pieces of soft tissue received from standard oral surgical operation were included. The tissue was sectioned into 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Each piece was fixed in four different fixatives, 6 pieces for each group, for 24 and 72 hrs at room temperature. All tissue were then fixed in 10 % formalin for another 24 hrs and processed according to standard protocol. The cellular structure and outline and staining quality of H&amp;E-stained sections were scored from one to three by pathologist, who was blinded from the experimental groups. Average fixative efficacy score among the four groups were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis.</p><p id="Par8429"><bold>Results:</bold> No significant difference was found between 70 % ethanol, 30 % jaggery and 10 % formalin at both 24 and 72 hrs.

Wilczak</p><p id="Par8442"><sup>*</sup>UKE Hamburg-Eppendorf, Dept. of Pathology, Germany</p><p id="Par8443"><bold>Objective:</bold> Microtubules are involved in crucial cellular roles. Class-III-ß-tubulin (TUBB3) is a microtubule protein, expressed in cells of neuronal origin and various tumour types. TUBB3 is of clinical relevance as overexpression has been linked to poor response to microtubule-targeting anti-cancer drugs such as taxanes.</p><p id="Par8444"><bold>Method:</bold> To systematically investigate the epidemiology of TUBB3 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues we used tissue microarrays (TMAs) for analyzing the immunohistochemically detectable expression of TUBB3 in 3911 tissue samples from 100 different tumour categories and 76 different normal tissue types.</p><p id="Par8445"><bold>Results:</bold> At least one tumour with weak expression could be found in 93 of 100 (93 %) different tumour types and all these 93 entities had also at least one tumour with strong positivity. In normal tissues, a particularly strong expression was found in neurons, endothelium, fibroblasts, spermatogenic cells and endocrine cells. In tumours, strong TUBB3 expression was most frequently found in various brain tumours, malignant melanomas and lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinomas and renal cell carcinoma.</p><p id="Par8446"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In summary, these results identify a broad spectrum of cancers that can at least sporadically express TUBB3. Testing of TUBB3 in cancer types eligible for taxane-based therapies could be helpful to identify patients who might best benefit from this treatment.</p><p id="Par8447"><bold>PS-21-026</bold></p><p id="Par8448"><bold>High-throughput tissue microarray: The utility of high-density pile-up array</bold></p><p id="Par8449"><underline>T.

Its manufacturing method is complicated. Therefore, we developed a novel high-density pile-up array by improving the high-throughput tissue microarray. With this technique, 240–500 tissue cores can be analyzed simultaneously.</p><p id="Par8452"><bold>Method:</bold> Retrospectively, 414 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 140 lung cancer cases were used. A high-density pile-up array was prepared from 160 to 250-μm-thick formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections that were laminated into horizontal sections using a hollow needle. Sections containing only paraffin were used as spacers between tissue cores.</p><p id="Par8453"><bold>Results:</bold> The tissue core loss rate using the high-density tissue microarray was approximately 10–30 % (range, 145–540 tissue cores) while using 0.6-mm-diameter tissue cores. In the high-density pile-up array, it was 0–10 % while using 160-200-μm-prism tissue cores. These findings demonstrated that high-density pile-up array was superior to high-density-tissue microarray due to a lower rate of tissue cores loss. High-density pile-up array is composed of tissue material and paraffin and can thus be easily tailored to specific tissue core sizes and inter-core spacing.</p><p id="Par8454"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The high-density pile-up array method can efficiently make tissue microarray in general facilities.</p><p id="Par8455"><bold>PS-21-028</bold></p><p id="Par8456"><bold>The borderland of embryology and pathology revisited: Two cases of tailgut cysts</bold></p><p id="Par8457"><underline>A.

Though congenital, it usually manifests in adults. We herewith report two cases.</p><p id="Par8460"><bold>Method:</bold> A 29-year-old female (case A) and a 62-year-old male (case B) both presented with lower intestinal symptoms. Imaging disclosed presacral lesions. Specimen A consisted of a 7 x 4.6 cm opened cystic wall; a 6.5 cm large fragment containing a 3.4 cm unilocular cyst filled with yellowish thin fluid, together with the coccyx, were received in case B.</p><p id="Par8461"><bold>Results:</bold> Both cysts were lined with non-keratinising squamous epithelium. Moreover, specimen A presented extensive ulceration with xanthogranulomatous inflammation and granulation tissue; whereas, in specimen B areas covered by columnar, non-ciliated epithelium containing mucus cells, as well as bundles of smooth muscle fibres were seen. Lack of structured intestinal wall excluded an enterogenous duplication cyst, absence of neural elements a neurenteric duct cyst, whereas absence of other tissues excluded a presacral teratoma.

There is a lesser male predominance as with pleural manifestation. Asbestos exposure is one of the main causes accounting for 60 % of peritoneal tumours.</p><p id="Par8484"><bold>Method:</bold> Two peritoneal tissue samples of a 27 year old male were excised and consecutively examined histomorphologically. To distinguish between primary and secondary lesions, we used various immunohistochemical markers.</p><p id="Par8485"><bold>Results:</bold> The infiltrative growth pattern as well as the epithelioid character of the tumour cells in context with various positive immunohistochemical markers such as MNF-116, Calretinin, Vimentin, led to the diagnosis of a malignant epithelioid mesothelioma.

Our pacient known with SBC had multiple surgical orthopaedic interventions for complications (infection, fracture) and ultimately developed an osteosarcoma.</p><p id="Par8556"><bold>Method:</bold> We present a case of a 26-year-old woman with a long history of disease. Thirteen years ago the patient suffered a pathologic fracture of the right femoral neck due to SBC, underwent orthopaedic reduction and plaster cast immobilization, healed with secondary coxa vara, limb shortening and difficulty walking. In 2010, was admitted for open curettage with bone grafting, Pauwels osteotomy and plate osteosynthesis using DCS with favorable recovery. At that time, histopathology was negative for malignancy and the radiologic data supported the findings. The patient was stationary on routine radiologic examination(available-end 2013). In 2017, presented with pain/difficulty walking, radiology showed the presence of the osteosynthetic metallic material and changes indicative of malignancy, no metastasis.

Tumours exhibiting features of both entities are considered hybrid LGFMS-SEF lesions. The majority of LGFMS cases are characterised by FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusions, with few cases showing FUS-CREB3L1 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusions. In contrast, the majority of pure SEF cases show EWSR1 gene rearrangements, with rare cases showing FUS gene arrangements.

About 40 % of patients have metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, spleen, or bones at diagnosis. Wide range of morphologic appearances of DSRCT creates diagnostic challenges.</p><p id="Par8660"><bold>Method:</bold> We present a case of metastatic DSRCT with unusual histology that led to incorrect diagnosis without complete clinical information.</p><p id="Par8661"><bold>Results:</bold> A 55-year-old female presented with incidental mass at left upper lobe, founded on fluorography in May 2014, which subsequently was resected. Well circumscribed, firm tumour was found. Microscopically, the neoplasm is composed of small, round to oval cells, generally uniform in size and shape. Cells were closely packed in solid mass, without any interfering stroma. Immunohistochemical study revealed expression of AE1/3 (focal), Vimentin, CD99, Bcl-2, SMA; while S100, CD34, Synaptophysin and TLE were negative. The diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma was proposed. At the same time 5 cm nodule was found on ultrasound investigation in plane of left ovary, initially interpreted as benign. One year later enlarged pelvic mass was removed. The histopathological features in the form of island, nests and trabecules of monomorphic small round to ovoid cells dispersed within a prominent fibroblastic stroma as well as polyimmunophenotypic profile were characteristic of DSRCT.

Jeong</p><p id="Par8802"><sup>*</sup>Kyungpook National University, Pathology, Daegu, Republic of Korea</p><p id="Par8803"><bold>Objective:</bold> Periostin is a secreted extracellular matrix protein that is consisted by 4 fasciclin-1 domains. Periostin is secreted by osteoblast and exists on periosteum. It is involved in bone formation as a key regulator of bone microarchitecture, strength and mass. Periostin is secreted from fibroblasts in some carcinoma and metastatic lung. It is also reported that periostin is expressed in osteosarcoma and its expression level is correlated with tumour angiogenesis and poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. However, periostin expression on chondroid tumour has not reported yet. The differential diagnosis of low grade chondrosarcoma from enchondroma is important, however it is not easy. Periostin expression in chondroid tumour was analyzed in this study.</p><p id="Par8804"><bold>Method:</bold> Immunohistochemical stain for periostin was performed on 61 cases of chondroid tumour, including 28 enchondromas and 33 low grade chondrosarcomas. 13 cases of normal cartilage were also included as a control group. Percentage and area of positive staining were evaluated. The area was subdivided as nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellular matrix.</p><p id="Par8805"><bold>Results:</bold> In contrast to all normal cartilage tissue was negative for periostin, 60 cases (98.4 %) of chondroid tumour showed positivity for periostin in any area.

Oztop</p><p id="Par8810"><sup>*</sup>Ege University, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, Turkey</p><p id="Par8811"><bold>Objective:</bold> Telangiectatic osteosarcoma (TelOS) is a rare subtype, accounting 3–10 % of osteosarcomas. It is characterised with large, nonsclerotic-lytic, destructive tumours with blood-filled cystic cavities lined by atleast focally osteoid producing neoplastic cells. Resemblance to aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is diagnostically concerning.</p><p id="Par8812"><bold>Method:</bold> We reviewed 37 specimens of 11 TelOSs and 10 TelOS-mimicking cases evaluated between 2000 and 2016. TelOS-mimickers were defined as cases with ABC-like features or extensive hemorrhage; notable TelOS-like component in biopsy specimens which is focal/lacking in resections or cases with cystic changes in postchemotherapy resections.</p><p id="Par8813"><bold>Results:</bold> The median age for TelOSs were 16 ± 9.3 years-old (Range:6–43 years), were more frequent in males (82 %), mostly located in proxymal tibia (46 %), humerus (36.4 %), distal femur (18.2 %), significantly involved epiphysis (83.3 %, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06, chi-square), with a median diameter of 10.2 ± 5 (Range: 5–17 cm). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy responce was divergent (Huvos grade I-III), however difficult to interpret for extensive cytic nature of lesion. Three cases presented with pathological fracture (28 %), two (18 %) with satellit tumours, two with accompanying ABCs. Re-biopsy/open biopsy was done in 3 cases (28 %). For other osteosarcomas with TelOS-like areas (23.8 %), metaphyseal involvement were more frequent (%60) and median age was higher (21 ± 11.6).</p><p id="Par8814"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Paucity of neoplastic tissue in biopsies due to cystic nature of tumours or so-called “Hemorrhagic-necrotic variant” of TelOS with sparse osteoid production are the major pitfalls in trucut biopsies. More-confusing, conventional osteosarcomas may present with ABC/ABC-like/TelOS-like component which needs further evaluation with their affect on diagnostic outcome.</p><p id="Par8815"><bold>PS-23-041</bold></p><p id="Par8816"><bold>Comparative analysis between growth factors of epiphyseal plate (SOX-9,Runx-2,Ihh,PTH-rP) and BCL-2 in benign and malignant cartilaginous tumours.

Immunostaining was applied and a score, according to Zhu et.al,2013 (modified), was used for analysis.</p><p id="Par8821"><bold>Results:</bold> Poor outcome was associated with high grade CSs, chondrosarcomas developing in flat bone and with SOX-9 over-expression. Higher levels of SOX-9 and Runx2 were found on cartilaginous tumours with similar morphology to growth plate. PTH-rP and Ihh higher expression levels were seen more often in enchondromas then in CSs, including when comparing with CS1, however, there was no difference of patients’ outcome. BCL-2 expression levels showed no differences either in histological grade or in patients’ prognosis.</p><p id="Par8822"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> SOX-9 may help to predict patients’ outcome with these cartilaginous tumours. PTH-rP and Ihh overexpression could be useful in distinguishing enchondroma from CS1. Expression of epiphyseal plate transcription factors SOX-9 and Runx-2, in cartilaginous tumours with morphology similar to the growth plate, may suggest a possible participation of these molecules in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms.

Ultrasound-guided testicular biopsy of the largest nodule(1.3 cm) was attained.</p><p id="Par8893"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination of this hilar brownish nodule showed a proliferation of cells with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm containing abundant lipofuscin, and a fibrous stroma with adipocyte foci and lymphocytic infiltrate. The lesion was positive for alpha-inhibin, calretinin, CD99, synaptophysin and CD56, and negative for androgen-receptors. In accordance with clinical/analytical data, a diagnosis of TTAGS was suggested. Bone/cartilage disease in early age and the association with SCST raised the concern for Ollier disease, and IDH1/2 mutation screening is ongoing.</p><p id="Par8894"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pathologists must be aware of the clinicopathological characteristics that should raise the concern for TTAGS, as bilateral Leydig cell-like testicular tumours might be the first manifestation of this syndrome.</p><p id="Par8895"><bold>PS-25-008</bold></p><p id="Par8896"><bold>Cystic nephroma - a difficult decision: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par8897"><underline>M.

Abdominal ultrasound examination showed bilateral hydronephrosis and a mass involving prostate and urinary bladder. Gleason score 5 + 5 prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in prostatic biopsies in another hospital. Bladder mass was removed through trans-urethral resection</p><p id="Par8909"><bold>Results:</bold> At histological examination of bladder fragments we found a tumour composed of ribbons of large cells with prominent nucleoli, necrosis and brisk mitotic activity, that diffusely infiltrated the bladder wall. Neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin and HOXB13, and negative for prostate specific antigen (PSA), androgen receptor (AR), ETS-related gene (ERG), p63 and thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1).

Our review covers the clinicopathological data between 2006 to 2017. The exclusion criteria for the study was a diagnosis of a non-urinary bladder malignancy or a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma with no sarcomatoid component.</p><p id="Par8941"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 2882 patients diagnosed with a urinary bladder tumour a total number of 30 cases met our selection criteria (1.04 %), 11 (0.38 %) patients were diagnosed with a sarcomatoid histopathological variant and 19 (0.65 %) had only a sarcomatoid tumour component (sTC). The cohort consisted of 23 males and 7 females, with a mean age of 60.1 years. Initial staging of the lesions showed: 3 pTx (10 %), 9 pT1 (33.3 %), 9 pT2 (30 %), 5 pT3 (16.6 %), and 5 pT4 (16 %). On initial presentation: 7 surgical specimens of en bloc radical cystoprostatectomies and 1 cystectomy specimen with hysterectomy with the remaining being represented by transurethral resection of the urinary bladder. On follow-up, 8 patients had local recurrences, furthermore, 4 had higher stage disease.</p><p id="Par8942"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ScC of the urinary bladder is a pleomorphic cancer with a high index of variability regarding the immunohistochemical profile and remains a relatively rare primary urinary bladder neoplasm.

Recent data has shown though that a wide range of neoplasms, including urothelial carcinomas, may express TTF-1. Aim of this study is investigate the frequency of TTF-1 positive urothelial carcinomas.</p><p id="Par8948"><bold>Method:</bold> An immunohistochemical study in a series of 40 urothelial carcinomas was performed on tissue microarrays sections (TMAs).

Three of them concerned non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinomas and two corresponded to infiltrating urothelial carcinomas, including the metastatic one. There was no association between TTF-1 expression and tumour grade (x2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.419) or stage (x2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.550), a finding that may be biased due to the small specimen sample.</p><p id="Par8950"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The observed frequency of TTF-1 positive urothelial carcinomas is higher compared to the results of previous studies.

CCP-RCC is estimated 1 %-4 % of all resected renal tumours.</p><p id="Par8956"><bold>Method:</bold> We retrospectively evaluated pathological features of nine nephrectomy materials with CCP-RCC diagnosed in our center between 2013 and 2016 years. All cases were stained with antibodies against GATA3, CK7, CAIX, TFE3, RCC and AMACR.</p><p id="Par8957"><bold>Results:</bold> All tumours contained a single layer of clear, cuboidal cells arranged in a tubulopapillary pattern, nuclear alignments of which were away from the basement membrane. Two tumours had smooth muscle stroma. Tumour cells had diffuse CK7 and “cup-shaped” CAIX positivity. Three tumour showed nuclear reactivity for GATA3. Five tumour stained with CD10 focally. None of the tumours were stained with TFE3, RCC and AMACR.</p><p id="Par8958"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CCP-RCC was included in the 2016 WHO classification. Local recurrence or metastases have not been documented among the cases reported so far. It is therefore very important to distinguish them from clear cell RCC and papillary RCC with similar morphological features. GATA3 is expressed in 30 % of CCP-RCC in our series. Unlike other variants of RCC, GATA3 positivity may contribute to CCP-RCC. Larger series are needed for showing the prognostic importance of CCP-RCC.

Samples were fixed, embedded in paraffin and analized for Hsp90 accumulation using the anti-Hsp90 antibody, followed by DAB detection substrate and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Microbiological examinations were carried out in intraoperative collection of material. The identification of accumulated bacterial cultures was carried out using conventional methods based, on morphological, tinctirial, cultural, biochemical and antigenic properties.</p><p id="Par8965"><bold>Results:</bold> In prostates with CBP E.coli was defined in 63.6 % of cases, S.aureus and P.vulgaris in 9.1 % of patients, Klebsiella spp. in 18.2 % of samples. CBP was characterized by significant inflammatory infiltration around glands and in the stroma. Immunohistochemical examination revealed significant expression of Hsp 90 in the prostate gland epithelium. The reaction in the stroma was observed around foci of inflammation. Corpora amylacea had a rounded shape and lamellar structure, between layers of deposits of Hsp 90 was revealed. Hsp90 overexpression was found in points corpora amylacea and glandular epithelium contact.</p><p id="Par8966"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Overexpression of Hsp 90 in prostate tissue with CBP and corpora amylacea indicates a participation of the heat shock proteins in the development and formation of corpora amylacea.

Macroscopically, a solid mass measuring 4.4x3.4x3.8 cm was observed without an extrarenal extension. Light microscopy revealed an epithelial tumour which consists of cords and tubules of cuboidal cells within a stroma of basophilic mucin with a spindle cell component. In addition to classical low grade areas, tumour has sarcomatoid areas characterized by the presence of large pleomorphic cells with high-grade nuclei and geographic necrosis.

CDK8/CDK19 correlated significantly with nuclear pSTAT1(Ser727). We observed CDK8 or CDK19 gene amplification in 15 % of tumours. CDK8/CDK19 inhibition resulted in decreased migration, while proliferation was not affected. Mesenchymal markers and nuclear pSTAT1(Ser727) were reduced in response to CDK8/CDK19 inhibition. Small molecule inhibitors led to comparable effects as specific CDK8 and CDK19 knockdown</p><p id="Par9014"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CDK8/CDK19 overexpression in PCa is based on gene amplification at least in a subset of tumours. CDK8/CDK19 inhibition leads to reduced migratory potential and mesenchymal phenotype. We identified the CDK8 phospho-substrate STAT1 as downstream signaling of CDK8/CDK19 in PCa. Collectively, this study give evidence that CDK8/CDK19 inhibition by recently published small molecule inhibitors might be a potential therapeutic option for PCa patients.</p><p id="Par9015"><bold>PS-25-023</bold></p><p id="Par9016"><bold>Ectopic adrenal tissue in kidney: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par9017"><underline>Z.

A previous study by our group from 1990 to 1996 showed an error rate of 7.5 % but with no immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed. We wished to examine a more contemporaneous series when IHC was readily available, being more relevant to current clinical practice.</p><p id="Par9028"><bold>Method:</bold> Core biopsies and TURPs from clinically localized PC diagnosed and managed conservatively in the United Kingdom, mostly between 2000 and 2003 were reviewed by two uropathologists. All incomplete cases where excluded and reasons for potential misdiagnosis were examined. IHC was performed centrally if needed.</p><p id="Par9029"><bold>Results:</bold> 1080 sets of biopsies and 314 TURPs were reviewed: 19 biopsies (1.75 %) and 7 TURPs (2.22 %) were reclassified as benign. 4 biopsies (0.37 %) were reclassified as suspicious but not diagnostic of PC. The total error rate was 2.15 %. IHC was centrally performed in 4 cases and originally on 7. The most common error on biopsies and TURPs was the overcall of areas of adenosis, followed by partial atrophy and PIN.</p><p id="Par9030"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There is a significant reduction of overdiagnosis compared to our previous study. This may be the consequence of a more prevalent use of IHC and better recognition of PC mimics by pathologists possibly related to the introduction of specialist reporting. However, 23 % of the over-diagnoses in our current study had IHC originally performed and these were due to misinterpretation of the IHC findings. A low threshold for requesting IHC together with continuing education in interpretation of IHC findings may help reduce this error rate.</p><p id="Par9031"><bold>PS-25-027</bold></p><p id="Par9032"><bold>Interobserver agreement in the assessment of tumour front inflammation and necrosis in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder</bold></p><p id="Par9033"><underline>A.

Cribriform GP4 and solid GP5 represented large epithelial proliferations without intermittent fibrovascular stroma either with or without round and linear lumina, respectively, not connecting with other growth patterns. Glomeruloid GP4 revealed two growth patterns: intraluminal epithelial proliferations continuous with cribriform GP4 and strongly curving glands in close relation to GP3 and fused GP4 glands.</p><p id="Par9126"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Novel three-dimensional microscopic imaging gives comprehensive insight in mutual relations and key features of clinical prostate cancer growth patterns.</p><p id="Par9127"><bold>PS-25-040</bold></p><p id="Par9128"><bold>The association between expression of P16 and Her2/neu immunostainings, grading and prognosis of urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder</bold></p><p id="Par9129"><underline>M.

Although the clinical significance of TMPRSS2-ERG is yet to be proven, the presence of the fusion gene is a key genomic event specific for prostate cancer. In the present study we aimed to investigate the relation between ERG-expression and 2 parameters: Gleason grade and clinical failure (CF, i.e. disease recurrence).</p><p id="Par9156"><bold>Method:</bold> Matched patient cohorts were composed for different Gleason grades and for presence/absence of CF 5 years post-prostatectomy. Tissue micro-arrays with both PCa and non-PCa tissue were composed and processed for immunohistochemistry with a clinically validated ERG-antibody. Stained slides were digitalized, epithelium was selectively annotated and analysed for percentage of (nuclear) ERG-expression with standardized and validated image analysis, followed by statistical analysis.</p><p id="Par9157"><bold>Results:</bold> We observed a significant decrease of ERG expression in the Gleason 8 group as compared to the Gleason 6 and 7 groups. No significant differences in ERG expression were observed between the CF and the non-CF groups. There was high intra-tumoural heterogeneity in ERG expression (as measured by the coefficient of variation across the samples of each patient).</p><p id="Par9158"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The present results indicate that TMPRSS2-ERG differentiates towards a low grade phenotype of prostate cancer. No evidence was found for TMPRSS2-ERG as an independent predictor for clinical outcome. The high intra-tumoural heterogeneity in ERG-expression suggests prominent tumour clonality in TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in PCa. The present data show that decreased ERG expression might be useful as a clinical biomarker for aggressive PCa.</p><p id="Par9159"><bold>PS-25-044</bold></p><p id="Par9160"><bold>NPY system in prostate cancer neuroinvasion</bold></p><p id="Par9161">W.

Ustunel</p><p id="Par9378"><sup>*</sup>Akdeniz University, School of Medicine, Histology and Embryology, Antalya, Turkey</p><p id="Par9379"><bold>Objective:</bold> Testicular germ cell tumours (GCTs) constitute the most common solid tumour in men between the ages 20 and 34 years, and the incidence of testicular GCTs has been increasing in the past two decades. Intratubular germ cell neoplasi (IGCN) is defined as a pre-invasive testicular germ cell lesion and is now believed an important precursor of TGCTs. Notch receptors may have a role as an oncogene or a tumour supressor gene depending upon cell type, though the majority of studies reveal that Notch signaling promotes tumourigenesis.</p><p id="Par9380"><bold>Method:</bold> In the present study, we examined the expression of four Notch receptors, two ligands (Jagged1,2) and two transcription factor (Hes1,5) in normal testis (n:20), IGCN (n:20), and seminoma (n:20), tissues using immunohistochemistry, followed by scoring staining distribution and intensity.</p><p id="Par9381"><bold>Results:</bold> According to our results; Notch 4 expression was higher in seminoma tissues, Hes5 expression was higher in IGCN tissues compared with normal tissues. Notch 3 expression was lower in IGCN and seminoma tissues, Jagged 1 expression was lower in IGCN tissues compared with normal tissues.</p><p id="Par9382"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Notch is a member of the signalling pathway that plays an important role in homeostasis and development of tissue. We explained that Notch 4 and Hes 5 overexpression and decreased levels of Notch 3 may have a role in the tumourigenesis of testis. However there is no report about the association between Notch receptors and seminoma and IGCN.</p><p id="Par9383"><bold>PS-25-076</bold></p><p id="Par9384"><bold>Negative correlation of beta catenin expression to inflammatory response in testicular germ cell tumours</bold></p><p id="Par9385"><underline>P.

We aimed to evaluate beta catenin expression in germ cell tumours for assessment of its possible prognostic significance for its inhibitory mechanism for tumour T-cell infiltration</p><p id="Par9388"><bold>Method:</bold> Surgical specimens from 247 patients with GCTs (238 with primary testicular tumour and 9 with extragonadal GCTs) were included into the translational study. Beta catenin expression was detected by immunohistochemistry, scored by the weighted histoscore (HS) method and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics, clinical outcome, PD-L1 expression and SII.</p><p id="Par9389"><bold>Results:</bold> Most of GCTs (86.2 %) showed a beta catenin expression. Seminoma exhibited significantly lower expression compared to non-seminoma GCTs. High beta catenin expression was associated with primary mediastinal non-seminoma tumours, intermediate/poor risk disease and highly elevated tumour markers.

A recent publication, based on image analysis, argues that GATA-3 and CK5/6 evaluation could be enough to identify these subtypes. We have evaluated GATA-3 and CK5/6 immunostaining patterns in bladder urothelial carcinoma.</p><p id="Par9436"><bold>Method:</bold> We used two tissue microarrays to asses GATA-3 and CK5/6 immunohistochemical expression in 64 muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma samples (22 of them with squamous differentiation) corresponding to transurethral resection.</p><p id="Par9437"><bold>Results:</bold> Four immunohistochemical patterns were identified according to immunostaining extent and intensity for both GATA-3 and CK5/6.

Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against EPO and neuroendocrine markers was performed.</p><p id="Par9485"><bold>Results:</bold> The 33 patients who were diagnosed with CCRCC had 35 tumours, where 34 tumours were CCRCC and one tumour was papillary adenoma. Of the 11 patients diagnosed with non-CCRCC seven were papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) type 1, two were PRCC type 2, and two were chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Of the CCRCC 33/34 (97 %) were positive for EPO, and the same 33 (97 %) tumours expressed NSE. Two of 34 (6 %) CCRCC had focal expression for synaptophysin, and three of 34 (9 %) CCRCC were positive for CD56. EPO and NSE were negative in all non-CCRCC, and CgA was negative in all tumours examined.</p><p id="Par9486"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In summary, we found that the majority of tumours examined with morphology consistent with CCRCC demonstrated strong expression for EPO and NSE, whereas the same markers were negative in non-CCRCC. The above findings suggest that there is a strong link between CCRCC and the expression of EPO and NSE.</p><p id="Par9487"><bold>PS-25-092</bold></p><p id="Par9488"><bold>Study of status of CD10, e-cadherin and β-catenin immunohistochemical staining in urothelial bladder carcinoma (UCC) before and after intracystic infusion therapy</bold></p><p id="Par9489"><underline>A.

The cases of prostate adenocarcinoma with focal NE differentiation and prostate NE carcinomas of untreated patients were excluded. The following immunohistochemical (IHC) makers were used for establishing the diagnosis: CgA, Syn, PSA, Prostein, PSMA, TTF1, Ki67, CK7, CK20.</p><p id="Par9501"><bold>Results:</bold> In the mentioned period there were 4 cases of prostate NE carcinomas secondary to androgen deprivation therapy diagnosed in patients aged between 62 and 81 years. The original tumours had Gleason score between 7 and 10. In two of the 4 cases, the NE small cell carcinoma was associated to conventional adenocarcinoma in the TUR-P specimen, while in the other two cases, the NE differentiation was detected in the liver metastases as small cell NE carcinoma.</p><p id="Par9502"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The NE differentiation should be considered in the progression of hormonally treated prostate conventional adenocarcinomas and IHC documented.

Gómez-Román</p><p id="Par9506"><sup>*</sup>HUMV, Santander, Spain</p><p id="Par9507"><bold>Objective:</bold> Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most frequent and aggressive renal cancer. We need more accurate prognostic and predictive factors than clinic-pathological staging. Some hypotheses postulate that the presence of genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5), could be related to prognosis. We aimed to look into the association of ITGA5 expression with ccRCC prognosis.</p><p id="Par9508"><bold>Method:</bold> We analyzed the expression of ITGA5 by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray of 46 ccRCC (one patient Fuhrman 1, 14 Fuhrman 2, 18 Fuhrman 3 and 13 Fuhrman 4), stage pT3. Clinical follow-up was also assessed.</p><p id="Par9509"><bold>Results:</bold> Only four tumours showed positivity for ITGA5. Of those, two patients died of disease, having a shorter survival time (25,60 and 30,17 months) than those without expression of ITGA5 (13 patients, with a median survival time of 53,35 months). Furthermore, when tumours with the same Fuhrman grade and presence of necrosis were compared, still those with ITGA5 expression showed worse prognosis.</p><p id="Par9510"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ITGA5 has been associated with a poorer prognosis in ccRCC, as seen in our series, although these results are limited because of the low number of cases examined. Further studies need to be undertaken.</p><p id="Par9511"><bold>PS-25-098</bold></p><p id="Par9512"><bold>Impact of the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in renal cancer: A study on the expression of PLAUR on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC)</bold></p><p id="Par9513"><underline>E.

An analysis of Plasminogen Activator Urokinase Receptor (PLAUR) expression and its relationship to prognosis in ccRCC was performed.</p><p id="Par9516"><bold>Method:</bold> We analyzed the expression of PLAUR by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray of 46 ccRCC (one patient Fuhrman 1, 14 Fuhrman 2, 18 Fuhrman 3 and 13 Fuhrman 4), stage pT3, as well as the clinical follow-up.</p><p id="Par9517"><bold>Results:</bold> Only two tumours were positive for PLAUR. Both of them had a Fuhrman grade 3 and died of disease, having a shorter survival time (16.62 months) than the other patients with tumours Fuhrman grade 3 that died of disease (four patients), having a shorter survival time (68.43 months).</p><p id="Par9518"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PLAUR, a protein involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, has been postulated to be associated with adverse prognosis in renal cancer. Although a poorer survival was observed, we have only seen two positive cases in our series.

Nowadays, active surveillance is the preferred method for the patients with low risk prostate cancer patients who will have indolent disease that will not need to be treated radically.</p><p id="Par9524"><bold>Method:</bold> We newly started to implement fusion biopsy technique at our center and performed 37 prostat fusion biopsies by this time.</p><p id="Par9525"><bold>Results:</bold> We diagnosed 15 adenocarcinomas of 37 lesions which were classified according to PI-RADS, and the rest 22 were benign prostate tissues. We believe a detailed histopathological description of the lesions included in the PI-RADS classification, will increase the success of the fusion biopsy technique, which is becoming radiologically the current practice.</p><p id="Par9526"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> As is well known, diagnosing the prostate cancer is not enough itself, but it is also a necessary to find out low-risk disease at the same time. A detailed histopathological description of any benign lesion, and accurate analysis of patterns and gleason scoring of adenocarcinomas classified according to PI-RADS, has central utility in improving the success of fusion biopsy technique.</p><p id="Par9527"><bold>PS-25-100</bold></p><p id="Par9528"><bold>Prostatic leiomyosarcoma as an unusual diagnosis for acute urinary retention: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par9529"><underline>C.

We will report a case.</p><p id="Par9532"><bold>Method:</bold> An 87-year-old male, with history of mantle cell lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, presented in the Emergency Department with acute urinary retention (AUR) complaints. Physical examination and ultrasound findings confirmed an enlarged and heterogeneous prostate. Serum PSA value was within normal limits. The patient was treated with the clinical hypothesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia and a transvesical open prostatectomy was performed</p><p id="Par9533"><bold>Results:</bold> The histopathological examination identified a proliferation of spindle cells, with moderate nuclear pleomorphism and necrosis. Imunohistochemical analysis (Smooth Muscle Actin and Desmin positive; S-100, CD117, CD34 and Beta Catenin negative) supported the final diagnosis: prostatic leiomyosarcoma.</p><p id="Par9534"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our case has some important educational messages: leiomyosarcoma is a highly fast-growing tumour, enhancing the pathologist role in establishing the diagnosis, mainly because differential diagnosis of AUR are extensive (of which leiomyosarcoma is not among the most common causes) and prognosis is dependent on acting quickly and decisively. Although there are reports of leiomyosarcomas following cyclophosphamide therapy, mostly of the urinary bladder, the low doses received by our patient seem to exclude a causal relationship.</p><p id="Par9535"><bold>PS-25-101</bold></p><p id="Par9536"><bold>On integrative pathology on example of radiogenic urinary bladder (UB)</bold></p><p id="Par9537"><underline>M.

In 2013, his 35 years old brother, also lacking significant medical history or elevated levels of serum markers (ßHCG, AFP, LDH), was admitted to the same Urology Clinic. A testicular tumour was suspected and he underwent tumourectomy. Both testicular tumours were investigated using an immunohistochemical panel: calretinin, WT1, inhibin, CK, vimentin, EMA, S100, PLAP, CD117, ß-catenin.</p><p id="Par9605"><bold>Results:</bold> In the first case, the gross examination revealed two whitish tumour masses in the testicular parenchyma, 1.5 and 1.8 cm in diameter.

A computed tomography scan of his upper abdomen revealed a 10 cm heterogenous adrenal mass compressing his liver. These appearances raised the possibility of a primary malignant tumour. A biopsy was performed showing a proliferation of spindled cells and histiocytoid cells arranged haphazardly and in fascicles with intervening thick collagen bundles. There was an admixed moderate inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Mitoses were absent and no necrosis was seen.

Immunophenotypically the cells exhibited complete loss of the SMARCB1/INI1(BAF47) protein while they were positive for Pax-8, CK7, CK34βE12, SDHB, E-cadherin and pVHL. Vimentin, GATA3, CD10, TFE-3 and OCT3/4(POU5F1) immunostains were negative. The diagnosis of collecting duct carcinoma was established.</p><p id="Par9734"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The differential diagnosis from renal medullary carcinoma was based upon the patient’s age, the absence of sickle cell trait evidence and the appropriate histological features. SMARCB1/INI1 loss is observed in approximately 15 % of collecting duct carcinomas.</p><p id="Par9735"><bold>PS-25-130</bold></p><p id="Par9736"><bold>A rare case of left inguinal hernia caused by a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) thrombus in the spermatic vein</bold></p><p id="Par9737"><underline>I.

Metastatic tumour to the spermatic vein from RCC is unusual, with only occasional cases described in the literature. We present a rare case of RCC recurrence, presented as an inguinal hernia, due to histologically proven RCC thrombosis of the spermatic vein.</p><p id="Par9740"><bold>Method:</bold> A 76-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to a painful swelling of the left inguinal area, which was interpreted as hernial incarceration. Clinical examination revealed a firm-to-hard swelling of the left spermatic cord at the external inguinal ring A biopsy of the spermatic cord area was initially undertaken which was non diagnostic. Left orchiectomy was eventually performed.</p><p id="Par9741"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination revealed dilated and prominent blood vessels with thrombi of clear RCC due to metastatic tumour to the spermatic vein, with no testicular pathology. The patient had a history of left radical nephrectomy and tumour thrombectomy 2 years ago, due to RCC.</p><p id="Par9742"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Inguinal/intrascrotal swelling is an uncommon symptom of RCC, due to tumour thrombus extending into the spermatic vein.

The lesions have been attributed clinically as sebaceous cysts, fibroma, and xanthoma.</p><p id="Par9756"><bold>Method:</bold> Here is reported 4 patients with scrotal calcinosis at the institution. One of patients has observed relapsing lesion 6 years later.</p><p id="Par9757"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient’s age range was 38–54 years. Two of them were solitary and two of them were multiple lesions. Measuring of the nodules was between 0,1 and 4 cm. One of the four patients had scrotal epidermoid cyst with intact epithelial walls. Varying stages of inflammation and foreign body giant cell reaction were seen around the scrotal calcinosis areas.</p><p id="Par9758"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although many mechanisms have been proposed in the pathogenesis, underlying mechanisms are still controversial at the present time. Some investigators suggest that SC is truly a late presentation of epidermal inclusion cysts that have undergone dystrophic calcification. So-called idiopathic scrotal calcinosis does not appear to be idiopathic, but rather a process of dystrophic calcification of epidermal cysts. But others reviewed the histologic data and found no evidence of an epithelial lining, residual cysts, and lipid or organisms, and concluded that the calcification was idiopathic introducing the term “idiopathic scrotal calcinosis.”</p><p id="Par9759"><bold>PS-25-133</bold></p><p id="Par9760"><bold>Leiomyoma of the prostate: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par9761"><underline>Y.

Recent studies have highlighted the relevance of CA19-9 in determining the evolutiveness of BT. The aim of our work was to study the immunohistochemical expression of CA19-9 in BT and its correlation with tumour grade, tumour stage and evolution (recurrence and metastasis.</p><p id="Par9780"><bold>Method:</bold> We carried out a retrospective study of 74 cases of BT diagnosed following endoscopic resection and radical cystoporostatectomy between 2011 and 2013. Immunoexpression of CA19-9 in tumours was considered positive in the presence of intense or intermediate immunoreactivity with diffuse distribution. Correlation between CA19-9 immunoexpression and tumour grade, tumour stage and evolution (recurrence and metastasis) was assessed.</p><p id="Par9781"><bold>Results:</bold> Our results showed that the immunohistochemical expression of CA19-9 was inversely proportional to grade and tumour stage. The majority of low-grade tumours (<italic>n</italic> = 27/32, 89 %) and the majority of superficial tumours (<italic>n</italic> = 35/50, 70 %) were positive for CA19-9. The correlation was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0,005 and 0,04 respectively). Recurrence and metastasis were studied in 56 patients. The immunohistochemical expression of CA19-9 was proportional to tumour recurrence. The majority of recurrent tumours (<italic>n</italic> = 16/18, 89 %) were positive for CA19-9.

Routine and special stains (Trichrome, PAS, and Alcian blue) have been performed.</p><p id="Par9823"><bold>Results:</bold> The diagnosis of meningioma has been confirmed in 16 cases, representing approximate 0.4 % in our files. The age distribution ranged between 53 to 90 years old, with a male predominance (81.25 % vs. 18.75 %). Fifteen undiagnosed intracranial tumours have been diagnosed as meningiomas grade I (meningothelial, transitional, and psammomatous types) and one tumour as grade II (clear cell type).

It can be incidental finding associated with fibrocystic changes, fibroepithelial lesions, gynecomastia and invasive breast carcinoma. We report clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features in three cases of PASH.</p><p id="Par10031"><bold>Method:</bold> Three cases of PASH diagnosed at our institution in period of 3 years were grossly and microscopically analyzed and immunostained with a panel of antibodies: CD31, CD34, CD68, vimentin, actin, EMA, CKAE1/AE3, ER, PR, bcl2 and S-100.</p><p id="Par10032"><bold>Results:</bold> All patients in our study were women aged 17, 39 and 41 years, clinically presented with palpable, mobile, firm mass localized in left breast in two of the cases and in right breast in third case. All patients were treated with surgical excision. Frozen section done in one case was suggestive of benign lesion. Grossly tumours were well circumscribed, rubbery, tan-yellow in color, measuring from 4.5 to 11 cm in greatest dimension. Microscopically, all lesions were composed of complex network of slit-like spaces, lined by spindled cells that resembling vascular spaces, surrounded by dense collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemically stromal celss showed: strong positivity for CD34, vimentin and bcl2; actin was positive in single cells and other markers were negative. There was no reccurence in any of the patients after 12 months follow up period.</p><p id="Par10033"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PASH as a rare benign entity clinically must be differentiated from fibroepithelial lesions and histologically from low grade angiosarcoma, especially on frozen sections.

This report aims to describe clinical and histopathological features of this tumour and highlights the pathologist’s role in establishing the right diagnosis.</p><p id="Par10111"><bold>Method:</bold> We describe a case of EPC associated to both ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma of non-specific subtype (ICNSS) diagnosed in pathology and gynecology departments</p><p id="Par10112"><bold>Results:</bold> A 49-year-old-woman presented with a right breast lump. Physical examination found a-1 cm-firm-nodule occupying the upper-outer-quadrant of the right breast. Mammography and ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed hypo-echoic mass measuring 1 x 1 x 0,8 cm devoid of micro-calcifications graded with Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as class 4. DCIS of intermediate grade with a focus of ICNSS were found on core- needle-biopsy. Breast conservative surgery with lymphadenectomy was performed. Gross-examination revealed a 1 cm-well-circumscribed-white-tumour. The tumour corresponded histologically to an EPC with DCIS and ICNSS without lymph node involvement. The lack of immunohistochemical staining with myo-epithelial markers confirmed the diagnosis of EPC.</p><p id="Par10113"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EPC is a rare entity. Immunohistochemistry is mandatory to rule out other papillary-breast-lesions. Extensive specimen sampling is crucial to not misdiagnose associated invasive carcinoma.</p><p id="Par10114"><bold>E-PS-02-034</bold></p><p id="Par10115"><bold>CK7-negative metastatic breast carcinoma in axillary lymph nodes, with no clinical evidence of a primary carcinoma (occult breast cancer)</bold></p><p id="Par10116">B.

Surgical removal of the mass revealed two brownish nodules, measuring 6,5X5X3cm and 5X3X1cm.</p><p id="Par10120"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination revealed lymph nodes with metastatic infiltration of medium-high grade adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemisty was positive for CKAE1/AE3, CK8/18, ER, PgR, GCDFP-15 and mammaglobin and negative for CK7, CK20, CK5/6, CD10, TTF-1, Synaptophysin and ChromograninA. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis was metastasis from a primary breast carcinoma. We advised further diagnostic evaluation of the patient but primary breast tumour was not detected by any other examination.</p><p id="Par10121"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Occult breast carcinoma presents through regional nodal or distant disease, without clinical or mammographic evidence of a primary tumour. Its incidence is 0.3–1 % of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. The site of detected disease is almost always an axillary lymph node. Reported cases of CK7-negative breast carcinomas are usually neuroendocrine in differentiation. Differential diagnosis should be made from an adenocarcinoma of cutaneous eccrine glands with apocrine features. Although immunohistochemistry is not always conclusive, breast carcinoma remains the most possible diagnosis, unless proven otherwise.</p><p id="Par10122"><bold>E-PS-02-035</bold></p><p id="Par10123"><bold>Osteosarcoma or osseal metaplasia of the breast?</bold></p><p id="Par10124">N.

Tumours consisted of epithelial and mesenchimal components. Immunohistochemical study showed pronounced expression of pancytokeratin, СК 7 and 20 by tubular structures. Tumour cells expressed CK5/6 and vimentin, which is attributed to tumours with squamous and mesenchimal differentiation. This is a result of transition of mesenchimal component to squamous.

Expression of Her2, ER and PgR is variable within a tumour. Intratumoural morphological heterogeneity of ICNST manifests by presence of 5 different structures: tubular, solid, alveolar, trabecular and discrete nests of tumour cells. These cells have a full set of molecules for establishment of intercellular contacts (cadherin-catenin complex and integrins β1), as well as integrin receptors for contacts with connective tissue. In second subtype with solid and alveolar structures most of the cancer cells don’t have connections with stroma, except for the outer layer of cells.

The ultrasonography of the lesion revealed a solid, heterogeneous echogenic mass with smooth margins, BIRADS 3/4. A tumourectomy was performed on the right breast. Macroscopically, we find tumour node 9x6x4,5 cm, greyish white colored, oval shaped and encapsulated. Histopathologically, the tumour consisted of mammary glandular tissue in hyalinized fibrous stroma, interspersed with islands of mature fatty tissue. All lobules were structurally normal. Cystic ducts with apocrine metaplasia were evident in specific areas as fibrocystic changes. The lesion was well defined and had a pseudocapsule of compressed adjacent breast tissue. This case was diagnosed: Breast hamartoma (fibroadenolipoma).

The mean age was 43.6 years (25–71). Eleven patients (73.3 %) were premenopausal. The median tumour size was 6.7 cm (2–22 cm). Histologically, five patients (33.3 %) presented with benign, 1 (6.7 %) with borderline and 9 (60 %) with malignant phyllodes tumours. One malignant phyllodes tumour had an heterologous liposarcomatous element. Six patients (40 %) underwent mastectomy (all cases were malignant phyllodes) and 9 (60 %) underwent conservative surgery (5 benign, 1 borderline and 3 malignant). Thirteen cases (86.7 %) presented negative margins. None had lymph node metastasis. One patient with a malignant phyllodes tumour developed local recurrence after 5 months.

Areas of coagulative necrosis were seen, surrounded by granulation tissue and fibrosis. Contraction band necrosis was also noted. Additionally, multiple foci of extramedullary haematopoiesis was seen congregating around the infarcted areas.

Metastatic melanoma in the parotid gland usually arises from head and neck region. The purpose of this report is to describe a rare case of metastatic malignant melanoma in the parotid gland.</p><p id="Par10361"><bold>Method:</bold> Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a safe, rapid and easy method to diagnose the parotid gland lesions. The data about the metastatic melanoma in the parotid gland is limited in the literature. A 44-year-old male presented at our hospital with history of a painless mass which rapidly increased in size in parotid gland. The ultrasonographic examination revealed a well defined, approximately 21x13 mm hypoechogenic solid mass that suggested a pleomorphic adenoma as a first possible diagnosis. FNA was performed for the lesion.</p><p id="Par10362"><bold>Results:</bold> Cytological findings were evaluated as ‘malignant cytology’.We found that the patient was diagnosed as malignant melanoma in head region 2 years ago from the records. The immunohistochemical markers (HBM-45, Melan A, S100, PanCK, CD45) supported our diagnosis. With all of this findings, metastatic melanoma in the parotid gland was diagnosed.</p><p id="Par10363"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It should be kept in mind that malign melanoma can rarely make metastasis to parotid gland.

Eighty eight patients underwent surgery, including 25 with benign, 2 with atypia of undetermined significance, 14 with suspicious for a follicular neoplasm, 40 with suspicious for malignancy and 27 with malignant results. Histopathologically confirmed malignancy rates are 32 , 50 , 50 , 80 , 96 % in each category, respectively.

There was a %83.3 increase in the detection of ASCUS with the TPO compared to MM but according to reference results accuracy were higher for TPO than MM. We also noted a %33.3 increase in the rate of LSIL and %20 increase in HSIL by TPO. ASC/SIL ratio was &lt;2 for both of the methods (for MM: %0.9 and for TPO: %1.2). Concordance was best for TPO and reference cytologic diagnoses (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and kappa value = 0.631).

However, there are a certain number of indeterminate cases even though the specimens are examined by experts of cytology. Application of Raman spectrometry (RS) to cytology as an adjunct to morphology is expected to solve such a problem. It has been reported that RS could be applied to cervical and urine cytology, but to our knowledge, application of RS to pleural effusion cytology has not been reported. In this study, we measured Raman spectra of pleural effusion cells and tried to classify them into normal or cancer cells utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).</p><p id="Par10409"><bold>Method:</bold> Raman measurements were performed employing a confocal microspectrometer equipped with 532 nm laser excitation device. Pleural effusion cells were collected from a lung cancer patient and a non-cancer patient. Cytological diagnoses were made by a cytotechnologist (IAC) and a board-certified pathologist. Obviously cancerous cells and mesothelial cells without staining were submitted for the measurements. RS data were analyzed by PCA and LDA. The background spectrum was subtracted from the raw spectrum, and the intensity was normalized at 1086 cm-1.</p><p id="Par10410"><bold>Results:</bold> The spectra obtained from the malignant and benign cells did not seem to be visually different from each other.

The study aimed to examine CD3+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin and adjacent in situ squamous cell carcinoma (ISSCC), actinic keratosis (AK) and normal skin (NS).</p><p id="Par10481"><bold>Method:</bold> Paraffin tissue sections from 124 cases of INSCC, with adjacent ISSCC, AK or normal skin (NS), present in 51, 122 and 122 cases, respectively, were immunostained for CD3 and CD8. The lymphoid infiltrates were evaluated using the Klintrup-Makinen grading scheme. Statistical analysis was performed using Marginal Homogeneity test. p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p id="Par10482"><bold>Results:</bold> CD3+ and CD8+ T-cells were more numerous in INSCC, ISSCC and AK compared to NS (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0,001 for all comparisons), and in INSCC and ISSCC compared to AK (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0,001, for all comparisons, except for CD8+ T-cells in the ISSCC/AK comparison, where <italic>p</italic> = 0,002).</p><p id="Par10483"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CD3+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration of the skin increases from NS to AK, and IS/ SCC.

Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Warsaw, Poland</p><p id="Par10488"><bold>Objective:</bold> To report a case of Primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin (PMCS) - an uncommon tumour of sweat gland origin.</p><p id="Par10489"><bold>Method:</bold> The primary lesion - a right occipital skin nodule from a 70-year-old female was excised and assessed histologically and immunohistochemically. This followed by resection of enlarged regional lymph nodes, which were assessed histologically.</p><p id="Par10490"><bold>Results:</bold> Histology showed the 3.0 cm primary lesion to be a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma with dermal and subcutaneous tissue involvement. Immunohistochemistry was positive for: oestrogen and progesterone receptors, pancytokeratin (CK AE1/AE3), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), synaptophysin, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) but negative for: cytokeratin 20 (CK20), Her-2/neu, chromogranin A, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), mammaglobin. In situ component with a rim of myoepithelial cells was confirmed by cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and p63 stains. A diagnosis of PMCS was favoured. Subsequent lymphadenectomy specimen showed metastatic tumour with identical appearances. Clinical workup showed no other primary malignancies.</p><p id="Par10491"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The diagnosis of PMCS requires exclusion of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinomas from other sites, especially breast. Clinico-pathologic correlation is essential. Immunohistochemical confirmation of in situ component with myoepithelial layer, favours dermal origin. PMCS may recur and metastasise, thus, the follow-up and wide excision is recommended.</p><p id="Par10492"><bold>E-PS-05-010</bold></p><p id="Par10493"><bold>Case report: An 82-year old woman with an aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type</bold></p><p id="Par10494">M.

Microscopy revealed in dermis and hypodermis a diffuse lymphoid proliferation with medium to large sized lymphoid cells with centroblastic or immunoblastic apparence, uneven nuclei, frequently nucleolated and reduced citoplasma. The suprajacent epidermis was atrophic with no epidermotropism. On immunohistochemistry, the tumour cells were diffuse and intense positive for CD20, BCL-2 and BCL-6, and negative for CD10, CD138, CK AE1/AE3 and S100, all consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type.</p><p id="Par10499"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is a rare entity which should be differentiated from other cutaneous tumours.

It is defined loosely by small case series and reviews. Our objectifve is to determine the epidemiological, etiopathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of MCC.</p><p id="Par10505"><bold>Method:</bold> It is a retrospective study of 3 cases of MCC collected from our department over a 6-year-period</p><p id="Par10506"><bold>Results:</bold> There were a 64 year old male; 74 and 83 year old female. They presented a red, indurated skin tumefaction which was located respectively on the knee, on the leg and on the forearm. Clinical examination revealed well defined, painless nodule that measured between 2 and 3.5 cm. Patients underwent a wide local excision. The morphological aspects and the immunohistochemical profile are those of MCC.</p><p id="Par10507"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Merkel cell carcinoma affects predominantly the white advanced age population with male predilection. It presents mainly on the extremities and head and neck. Multiple factors contribute to the etiology of MCC such as ultraviolet radiation, immunosuppression. But since 2008 Merkel cell polyomavirus was found to be the main etiological agent of this skin cancer. Identification of this tumour virus has led to new opportunities for early diagnosis and targeted treatment of MCC.</p><p id="Par10508"><bold>E-PS-05-012</bold></p><p id="Par10509"><bold>Cutaneous chromoblastomycosis: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par10510">P.

Although it is endemic in certain parts of northern and southern America, there are very few reports of chromoblastomycosis in Turkey in literature. Because of that diagnostic challenges can arise.</p><p id="Par10513"><bold>Method:</bold> Sixty-seven year old male presented with a lesion of 5 years, locally excised, then recurred as pruritic erythematous plaque on his left arm. Biopsies were taken. Leishmaniasis, deep mycosis were considered, but being first two biopsies superficial, findings were nonspecific. Direct mycological examination was inconclusive. Another, deeper biopsy was performed.</p><p id="Par10514"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathological examination revealed pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia, dermal mixed inflammatory response causing abscess formation, and within this infiltrate, presence of brown, round contoured, thick walled fungal organisms. Fungal culture specimens were positive for organism of Fonsecaea spp.</p><p id="Par10515"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Among chronic fungal infections seen in Turkey, chromoblastomycosis is very rare.

Most are erroneously diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Indeed, MPTTs may demonstrate biologically more aggressive behavior than SCC. Herein, we report two cases of MPTT.</p><p id="Par10537"><bold>Method:</bold> First case is a 66-year old man presented with a nodular, well-circumscribed lesion of 22 mm in maximum diameter, located occipital region. The second case refers to a 96-year old woman who had a lump on the scalp with a maximum diameter of 50 mm. Both were excised.</p><p id="Par10538"><bold>Results:</bold> Both lesions consisted of intradermal mass composed of lobules of squamous cells. Peripheral palisading and widespread trichilemmal keratinization were seen. Tumoural cells demonstrated moderate degree of pleomorphism, hyperchromasia with focally infiltrative growth and extension into deep subcutaneous adipose tissue. Necrosis was seen and mitoses were numerous in both cases.</p><p id="Par10539"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> SCC and benign proliferating trichilemmal tumour should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MPTT. Trichilemmal keratinization and absence of a premalignant epidermal lesion are important indicators for the diagnosis of MPTT instead of SCC. Regular, non-infiltrative border and absence of cytological atypia distinguish benign PTT from MPTT.</p><p id="Par10540"><bold>E-PS-05-017</bold></p><p id="Par10541"><bold>Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans of the face: An uncommon presentation</bold></p><p id="Par10542">C.

Despite their rarity, primary mediastinal parathyroid tumours should be included in the differential diagnosis of anterior mediastinal tumours with or without symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.</p><p id="Par10604"><bold>E-PS-07-005</bold></p><p id="Par10605"><bold>Oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par10606">Z.

Histopathological examination was performed.</p><p id="Par10618"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination from the adrenal’s tissue fragment showed partial autolysis details, focal fibrosis, presence of inflammatory infiltrations, macrophages, hemosiderin granules and congested vessels with slightly thickened wall. Macroscopic examinations in both tissue fragments revealed, in an expanded almost universal extent, the presence of mature adipocytes together with extramedullary hematopoietic details. There were also observed haemorrhagic infiltrations, phagocytes, hemosiderin granules and the local presence of amorphous eosinophilic material.

Until date 35 cases sited different anatomical locations described in the literature. Retroperitoneal location and oncocytic features are extremely rare. We report 56 years old male presented have a mass in retroperitoneal fat tissue on abdomen magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Adrenocortical neoplasms are the most common tumours of adrenal cortex. Cortical tissue is found either seperately or with medullary tissue in ectopic adrenal rest. It may undergo hyperplasia, adenoma or carcinoma; hence surgical resection is necessary when they were detected.</p><p id="Par10625"><bold>Method:</bold> The surgical spesimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded.

During the rectosigmoscopy, a submucosal formation with a diameter of 1 cm was detected. Because of extreme similarity with submucous leiomyoma, a decision was made in favor of a wide excision of the nodule.</p><p id="Par10642"><bold>Results:</bold> Tumour consists of interlacing spindle-shaped cells, with a marked cellular pleomorphism, with large and hyperchromatic nucleus, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures (16 per 10 HPF) and atypical mitotic figures were also noted.

Heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) is rare, having been identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract, more frequently in oesophagus and duodenum, being unusual in the rectum (78 cases reported since 1939, 32 in patients under 16 years old).</p><p id="Par10650"><bold>Results:</bold> Typically, HGM is asymptomatic, nevertheless, when symptomatic, it can present rectal bleeding, stricture formation, or obstruction, being the reason why differential diagnosis with rectal ulcers, gastrointestinal infestations, congenital malformations or inflammatory bowel diseases should be included. The definitive diagnosis of HGM requires histopathological demonstration of gastric mucosa in rectum, with oxyntic mucosa as the most common histological type. Also, Helicobacter pylori and neuroendocrine cells have been identified in rectal HGM. Malignant degeneration of anorectal lesions has not been reported. The most accepted hypothesis for HGM is explained by the pluripotentiality of stem cells lining the primitive intestinal canal. Although the treatment of choice is resection, usually with optimal results, this patient has relapsed three times.</p><p id="Par10651"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HGM are infrequent lesions, being even more unlikely those located in rectum.

FCs are classified as bronchogenic, enterogastric or undifferentiated. Friedreich first described the lesion in 1857 and predicted its congenital origin. We present a FC that arised in the retroperitoneum and was difficult to separate from other retroperitoneal cystic mass lesions.</p><p id="Par10657"><bold>Method:</bold> A 27-year-old female presented with flank pain. Abdominal CT revealed a cystic lesion, measuring approximately 7.8 cm in diameter, located near the posterior stomach, superior pole of left kidney and pancreas. Total cystectomy was performed.</p><p id="Par10658"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopic examination revealed a 7.8x6 cm unilocular cyst enclosed by a thin capsule, which contained viscous, yellowish fluid. There was no solid component in the lesion. The surgeon confirmed no continuity of the cyst into the surrounding organs. Microscopy demonstrated the cyst to consist of four layers. In focal areas, seromucous glands were seen in the wall. There was no evidence of malignancy.

However, it is an exceedingly rare finding in colonic and rectal polyps, with only twenty-two cases reported to date in the English literature1, 2. We report a case of osseous metaplasia in an inflammatory caecal polyp.</p><p id="Par10681"><bold>Method:</bold> Case report: A 70 year-old male underwent a surveillance colonoscopy and was found to have a caecal polyp which has been excised. Macroscopically, the tan-brown coloured polyp measured 10 mm in diameter, was bisected and submitted for microscopic examination. Histopathologic examination revealed polypoid large bowel mucosa showing a surface cap of ulceration and granulation tissue. There were underlying irregular and dilated colonic crypts within the inflamed stroma. In addition, there was bone formation within the core of the polyp with the spicules of bone separated by loose myxoid stroma [Figure 1]. No dysplasia or malignancy was present. The appearances were interpreted as those of an inflammatory ulcerated polyp with osseous metaplasia.</p><p id="Par10682"><bold>Results:</bold> Conclusion: Occurrence of osseous metaplasia in colonic polyps is quite rare.

Metastasectomy and cutaneous nodule resection was done. The hepatic metastases were histologically confirmed. The tan-brownish nodule showed under microscope an intact epidermis. In the dermis, diffuse proliferation of histiocytes-like cells was observed. These cells were marked by CD68 and CD44 and showed aberrant cytoplasmic positivity for CDX2. No positivity for keratin AE1/AE3, keratin 20, CEA or S100 was observed.

Whether reactive or neoplastic, its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Few cases of primary gastric IMT have been described. Clinical presentation and imaging are non-specific, therefore histological examination is mandatory for the diagnosis. We present the case of a primary gastric IMT occurring in an infant with review of the literature.</p><p id="Par10729"><bold>Method:</bold> An 8 months old female infant presented to the emergency after episodes of hematemesis and melena. Clinical examination showed pallor, hypotonia, and tachycardia. Hemoglobin concentration was at 3.1 g/dl. CT Scan revealed a 10 cm exophytic left abdominal mass communicating with the greater gastric curvature. Partial gastrectomy was performed.</p><p id="Par10730"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination showed a proliferation of spindle cells accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. On immunostainings, the spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and negative for CD117. These features were consistent with IMT.</p><p id="Par10731"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> IMT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a gastric mass in children. Complete excision of the lesion is curative in most of the cases but the possibility of local recurrence justifies close follow-up.</p><p id="Par10732"><bold>E-PS-08-013</bold></p><p id="Par10733"><bold>Brunner’s gland hamartoma: Unusual presentation</bold></p><p id="Par10734">L.

He is alive without disease, 4 years after operation. Histologically, the tumour showed SqCC with gland-like structures in the tumour nests with keratinization, but there was neither evidences of mucin production nor true glandular differentiation, due to the negativity for both mucin stain and CK7, which is a marker for ductal differentiation.

Less than 100 cases have been reported in English literature (Bishop et al., 2015). Our aim was to present a case of ciliated hepatic foregut cyst in oncologic patient.</p><p id="Par10841"><bold>Method:</bold> Medical documentation, pathology slides and radiologic investigations were reviewed in the context of up-to-dated scientific literature.</p><p id="Par10842"><bold>Results:</bold> By computed tomography, a 55-year-old male was diagnosed with unspecified lesion in the liver segment IV. The patient suffered from rectal cancer (T4N1M1G2R0) since 2013, thus liver metastasis was suspected. The pathological hepatic focus was resected. Grossing revealed a cystic lesion (1.2x1.2x2cm) with greyish mucinous content. Microscopic examination showed cyst lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with isolated goblet cells. Cellular atypia or mitoses were absent; proliferation fraction was low. Subepithelial connective tissue and isolated bundles of smooth muscle were also found within the cyst wall. Thus, diagnosis of ciliated hepatic foregut cyst was issued.</p><p id="Par10843"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Due to variable radiographic appearance of ciliated cyst, diagnosis can be difficult necessitating differentiation from wide spectrum of hepatic lesions, mostly—primary or secondary tumour. Here we have demonstrated recently originated ciliated hepatic foregut cyst in patient with rectal cancer history, further complicating diagnostic considerations.</p><p id="Par10844"><bold>E-PS-09-003</bold></p><p id="Par10845"><bold>Congenital poorly differentiated cystic adrenal neuroblastoma with liver metastases: Case report</bold></p><p id="Par10846">M.

One major activity in every cell is translation of mRNA to the corresponding protein, which plays an important role in cancer development. Crucial for translation process are eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), which are regulated by the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)-pathway. Mutations or deregulated expression of eIFs influence cell growth and proliferation, contributing to carcinogenesis. We aimed to investigate the eIFs function in NETs development.</p><p id="Par10857"><bold>Method:</bold> Gastroenteropancreatic NETs (G2) and their corresponding liver metastases from four individuals, as well as 2 different NET cell lines were analyzed on protein expression level for various eIFs and mTOR members by Western Blot compared to non-neoplastic tissue.</p><p id="Par10858"><bold>Results:</bold> eIFs were altered in primary NETs.

Chronic inflammation is a main risk factor for CCC development. This process is, among others, regulated via the IL-6/IL-6R/JAK/STAT pathway which is supposed to be activated through either classic or trans-IL-6 signaling. Classic IL-6 signaling is guided by the membrane-bound Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), whereas the soluble receptor mediates IL-6 trans-signaling. We hypothesize classic and trans-IL-6 signaling to differently impact the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p id="Par10953"><bold>Method:</bold> Survival analysis was achieved using data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. In vitro studies were performed using Tocilizumab, IL-6 and HyperIL-6.

The initial diagnosis, based on a limited immunohstochemical study, was undifferentiated endometrial stromal sarcoma. A second endometrial curettage for an endometrial polypoid mass of 8,34 mm, accompanying with pelvic lymph nodes excision, was performed. A combined chemotherapy (R-CHOP) was administered. After a 2 year follow-up period, the patient is without signs of disease.</p><p id="Par11090"><bold>Results:</bold> On histology, endometrial stroma was diffusely infiltrated by large lymphoid cells with centroblastic morphology. Frequent mitotic figures, apoptotic bodies and necrosis were observed. Tumour cells were immunoreactive for LCA, CD10, CD20, BSAP, Bcl2 Bcl6, MuM1. Pelvic lymph nodes were uninvolved. Thorough clinical and imaging investigation showed no evidence of extra- uterine disease.

The clinical diagnosis is not difficult for the echinococcal cyst, because is a zoonotic parasitic disease. The nonparasitic cysts are a rare condition that represent 10 % of all benign splenic cysts and their management is controversial: cystectomy, fenestration, percutaneous drainage and post-splenectomy sclerotherapy. Using IHC markers, the 2 mesothelial cysts are positive for anti-CKAE1/AE3, HBME-1 and negative for CD31, CD34; the 4 epithelial cyst are positive for CKAE1/AE3 , p63 and negative for calretinin.</p><p id="Par11139"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The benign cystic lesions of the spleen are very rare, the majority of the lesions diagnosed were parasitic cysts.

This represents a diagnostic challenge. This study (NCT01969578) aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADT (experimental arm) vs chemotherapy (standard arm) in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic, AR expressing SGC by demonstrating a 15 % improvement in PFS rate at 6 months in favor of ADT.</p><p id="Par11209"><bold>Method:</bold> In this multicenter, randomized, phase II intergroup study treatment naïve patients (Cohort A) will be randomized to receive ADT or platinum-based chemotherapy. Previously treated patients will be enrolled in Cohort B will receive ADT. Patients randomized to chemotherapy can enter Cohort B at disease progression. Central testing of AR expression is based on staining intensity (0 = negative to 3 = strong) and percentage of positive nuclear stained cells (0 = =10 % to 3 = =70 %). AR expression requires a total score of 6.

These samples are invaluable genetic resource for retrospective molecular genetic analysis. However, FFPE tissue samples are considered problematic starting material for most of the molecular genetic techniques due to the relatively low quality of extracted DNA.Therefore, our study is addresing the effects of tissue fixation procedures and DNA extraction methods of the DNA obtained for downstream analysis.</p><p id="Par11361"><bold>Method:</bold> Surgical specimens of colorectal cancer were fixed in 10 % buffered or nonbuffered formalin for 1, 12 to 24 hrs, or 48 to 60 hrs at 4oC or at room temperature (RT).

We aim to report a case of Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS), a rare variant of IMT with predilection for male patients, distinctive morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic features and malignant behavior.</p><p id="Par11465"><bold>Method:</bold> Six month-old boy, with abdominal swelling, performed an ultrasound that showed a 11x9cm well-defined hepatic mass, suggesting hepatoblastoma. CT-scan displayed a large intra-abdominal neoplasm (10x11x8cm) without infiltration of adjacent organs. A biopsy was performed and a diagnosis of IMT was rendered. He underwent surgical excision of the mass and multiple peritoneal implants.</p><p id="Par11466"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, the neoplasm was composed of spindle/round cells with vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and scanty cytoplasm, admixed with polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate. Immunoexpression for desmin and ALK (cytoplasmic, with perinuclear accentuation) was observed. FISH showed rearrangement of ALK; karyotype demonstrated an inversion of chromosome 2, involving ALK e RANBP2 genes. A final diagnosis of EIMS was made. The patient underwent chemotherapy (Euro-Ewing protocol). Three years after diagnosis he is alive without evidence of disease.</p><p id="Par11467"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EIMS is a rare and highly aggressive variant of IMT.

The different subtypes vary greatly with regard to site of involvement, morphologic appearance, and behavior. We summarized the problems and controversies in diagnosis of adipocytic tumours in daily practice.</p><p id="Par11497"><bold>Method:</bold> A series of 35 patients with lipomatous tumours diagnosed in 2014–2016, at Theageneion Cancer Hospital was studied.

Surgical excision was performed, consisting of a segment of the tibia with 6 cm. Cut sections revealed eccentric lesion with whitish, homogenous and elastic tissue, involving the soft tissue in a width of 0,8 cm. Histopathologically showed clusters of epithelial cells with peripheral palisading in a fibrous stroma with haphazard osteoid deposition, without squamous differentiation.

The aim of this case report is to raise awareness regarding this unusual entity and its clinical implications.</p><p id="Par11593"><bold>Method:</bold> A 54 year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an intramural small intestinal tumour causing intussusception.</p><p id="Par11594"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, the tumour was well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated, with tan-white cut surface, and measured 2.1 cm. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of scattered, bland, spindle cells arranged in bundles within hyalinized collagenous stroma. No cellular atypia or mitotic activity was present. On immunohistochemical stains, these neoplastic cells expressed vimentin, and were negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, caldesmon, β-catenin, ALK-1, CD117, CD34 and S-100 protein. Histochemical stains (Congo red and Verhoeff–Van Gieson) did not reveal amyloid or degenerated elastic fibers.

They are preferentially located in the head, neck and axilla in children. However, lymphangiomas in the peritoneal cavity are extremely rare, particularly in adults. In the abdomen, lymphangiomas occur most commonly in the mesentery, followed by the omentum, mesocolon and retroperitoneum. Most reports show female predominance.</p><p id="Par11601"><bold>Method:</bold> A 46-year-old male patient presented complaining of a painfull abdominal mass. The cystic mass was 22 cm in diameter and it was removed.</p><p id="Par11602"><bold>Results:</bold> The histopathological examination of the resected specimen was consistent with typical findings of a CL: dilated lymphatic vessels, lined with flattened endothelial cells without atypia, and with abundant lymphoid tissue. In addition, smooth muscle cells and foam cells containing lipid material were reflected in the wall.</p><p id="Par11603"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diagnosis of intra-abdominal CL is difficult because of its rarity. The intra-abdominal lymphangiomas are essentially located in the mesentery, but may relate to the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, liver, kidneys, adrenals and pancreas. Retroperitoneal location appears to be rare. We are presenting this case because of its rare localisation.</p><p id="Par11604"><bold>E-PS-16-025</bold></p><p id="Par11605"><bold>Primary neoplasm of the liver with perivascular epitheliod-cell differentiation (PEComa): A case report</bold></p><p id="Par11606">Z.

They can arise in different anatomic locations but hepatic PEComas are exceedingly rare.</p><p id="Par11609"><bold>Method:</bold> A 46-year-old man presented with an atypical abdominal pain for the last few months. Clinical examination revealed a palpable liver mass. Laboratory examination, including tumour markers, was normal. CT scan showed a heterogeneously enhanced mass, located between the I and IV segments. The patient had no history of cirrhosis or hepatitis. A left hepatectomy was performed.</p><p id="Par11610"><bold>Results:</bold> Gross examination revealed a soft lesion measured 8.4X7.3X4.7 cm, with rather demarcated margins and whitish in color. Histologically, the tumour was composed of nests and sheets of large epitheliod cells with abundant eosinophilic/pale cytoplasm, round nuclei and rare mitoses. A sinusoidal vascular network and radial cell arrangement around blood vessels were apparent. Necrosis or other tissue elements were not identified. Immunohistochemically, the cells exhibited expression only for vimentin, HMB45, Melan-A and SMA.

The history revealed that the patient was a victim of torture in Sudan, who sought refuge in Greece. The knees were edematous and radiography revealed complete dislocation of the knee joints. On histological examination, the signs of severe degenerative joint disease were all present; fissures and clefts at the articular cartilage, duplication of the tidemark, cyst formation and severe thickening of the synovial bursae.</p><p id="Par11626"><bold>Results:</bold> Knee dislocation usually happens on a background of acute injury. In our case it was the sustained torture which caused the dislocation of the knees and, subsequently, the severe degenerative joint disease.

Further diagnostic tests revealed increased serum PSA (46.7 ng/ml), numerous enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes, hypodense lesion in the liver and massive metastatic lesions in bones of the pelvis. Hormonal therapy resulted in an initial 4-fold decrease of serum PSA, followed by another rise after 4 months. The patient is currently treated at the Chemotherapy Clinic at the University Hospital, Wroclaw.</p><p id="Par11715"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Conclusions: Prostate cancer metastases should be always considered in males with focal neurological symptoms and in histopathological diagnosis of intracranial tumours.</p><p id="Par11716"><bold>E-PS-18-009</bold></p><p id="Par11717"><bold>Fetal rhabdomyomatous nephroblastoma in an adult: A rare entity with a challenging diagnostic</bold></p><p id="Par11718">N.

Transurethral biopsy showed a high-grade micropapillary carcinoma with muscle invasion.</p><p id="Par11842"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, the malignant cells were arranged in small papillary clusters or tightly cohesive nests lying in clear spaces, exhibited high-grade nuclear features. Conventional transitional cell carcinoma elements were not found. The immunohistochemical profile (positivity for p63, cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20) suggests an urothelial origin. Due to other health problems, the patient received only actinotherapy, with no tumour recurrence or metastasis after 4-months follow-up.</p><p id="Par11843"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, we present a rare case of primary micropapillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder. In such cases, pulmonar and peritoneal origins must be excluded. Although its rarity, it should be kept in mind when dealing with high-grade urothelial tumours, because even focal presence of micropapillary pattern in an otherwise conventional urothelial carcinoma, is associated with advanced tumour stage and poor prognosis.</p><p id="Par11844"><bold>E-PS-18-026</bold></p><p id="Par11845"><bold>A benign tumour of the epididymis; Leiomyoma; Case report</bold></p><p id="Par11846">S.

Dere</p><p id="Par11847">*Mugla Sitki Kocman University, Pathology, Turkey</p><p id="Par11848"><bold>Objective:</bold> Epididymal tumours are very rare with the rate of 5 % of intrascrotal tumours and 75 % of them are benign. The most frequent benign tumours are adenomatoid tumours and leiomyomas.</p><p id="Par11849"><bold>Method:</bold> Case Report: Our patient is a 41-year-old man. He was admitted to urology clinic with a 1-year history of a slow-growing, painless mass in his left scrotum. Ultrasonographic examination revealed a well-circumscribed, solid, hypoechoic mass with a diameter of 1,5 cm in his left epididymis. The mass at the tail of the epididymis was excised with its well-circumscribed borders.</p><p id="Par11850"><bold>Results:</bold> The histopathological evaluation; revealed a well-circumscribed neoplastic proliferation of spindle cells with deeply eosinophilic, fibrillar cytoplasm arranged in intersecting fascicles. Nuclear atypia, mitosis or necrosis were not present. The neoplastic cells showed strong cytoplasmic staining for desmin, Smooth-muscle-actin(SMA) and Caldesmon. As Ki-67 proliferation index was 1 %, the lesion was diagnosed as Epididymal Leiomyoma(EL).</p><p id="Par11851"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EL is a benign tumour that can be cured through simple, organ-preserving surgical excision. It is the second most common neoplasm of the epididymis, following adenomatoid tumour and represents 6 % of primary epididymal tumours. Although it is a rare lesion, EL should be considered in differential-diagnosis of scrotal masses in order to provide testicular preservation.</p><p id="Par11852"><bold>E-PS-18-027</bold></p><p id="Par11853"><bold>Concordant occurrence of RCC and angiomyolipoma in the same kidney</bold></p><p id="Par11854">M.

Although its clinical course is usually benign, it may be associated with various adverse outcomes.</p><p id="Par11857"><bold>Method:</bold> A 52-year-old female patient underwent nephrectomy due to kidney tumour. Two histologically different tumours were found directly next to each other. RCC was 3.5 cm in diameter (pT1aNXMX, G3) and angiomyolipoma diameter was 7 cm.</p><p id="Par11858"><bold>Results:</bold> Both tumours were c-Kit and CK20 negative, and Vimentin positive. Angiomyolipoma showed immunohistochemical positivity to the MSA, SMA, HMB45, Melan A and CK AE1 / AE3, while it was negative for EMA, RCC and CK7. Renal cell carcinoma showed immunohistochemical positivity for EMA, RCC, CK AE1 / AE3 and CD10 and focal positivity for CK7, while being negative for MSA, SMA, S-100, HMB45 and Melan A.</p><p id="Par11859"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The paper presented a rare example of simultaneous appearance of two histologically and immunohistochemically different tumours in the same kidney, which were observed and documented with extensive immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par11860"><bold>E-PS-18-028</bold></p><p id="Par11861"><bold>Nephrogenic adenoma of the prostatic urethra: A case report</bold></p><p id="Par11862">S. Y. Celik*, Ö. Ilhan Çelik, Y. Dere, L. Tekin</p><p id="Par11863">*Mugla Sitki Kocman University, Pathology, Turkey</p><p id="Par11864"><bold>Objective:</bold> Nephrogenic adenoma(NA) is a rare proliferative lesion of the urothelium. It is described in the urinary bladder. Nonspesific symptoms such as hematuria, dysuria and bladder-irritability are the most frequent complaints of the patients.</p><p id="Par11865"><bold>Method:</bold> Case Report: Our patient is a 64-year-old man. He was admitted to urology clinic with the complaints of dysuria, pollakuria and frequency continuous for 2 weeks. He had a history of transurethral-resection(TUR) for prostatic nodular hyperplasia. Cystoscopy was performed and small suspicious papillary-lesions in the prostatic urethra were noticed and TUR was applied.</p><p id="Par11866"><bold>Results:</bold> In the histopathological evaluation; tubular structures lined by cubic-epithelium and vascular-like tubules lined by flattened epithelial cells or mucin containing signet-ring like cells in between the prostatic glands were seen. There was no cellular atipia and mitosis. As P63, High-Molecular-Weight-Cytokeratin(34bE12) and AMACR(alpha-methylacyl-CoA-racemase) were positive in the lesion, it was diagnosed as NA.</p><p id="Par11867"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> NA; which can be seen anywhere with urothelial-lining, is accepted as a reactive-lesion caused by a previous damage (trauma,TUR, surgery for lithiasis, renal-transplantation, etc.). As it is a benign condition, no treatment is needed after the excision for the diagnosis. It is rarely seen in prostatic-urethra; however should be considered in differential-diagnosis of suspicious-papillary lesions of the urothelium.</p></body></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Medicine &amp; Public Health</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Pathology</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">Virchows Archiv</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2017</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"/><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
