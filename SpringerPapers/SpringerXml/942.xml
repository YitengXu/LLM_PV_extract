A variable-speed offshore wind turbine (OWT) with electrical torque control is used in the integrated offshore power system whose dynamic models are detailed. By considering the control system as a partially-observable Markov decision process, an actor-critic architecture model-free DRL algorithm, namely, deep deterministic policy gradient, is adopted and implemented to explore and learn the optimal multi-objective control policy. The potential and effectiveness of the integrated power system are evaluated. The results imply that an OWT can respond quickly to sudden changes of the inflow wind conditions to maximize total power generation. Significant oscillations in the overall power output can also be well suppressed by regulating the generator torque, which further indicates that complementary operation of offshore wind and PV power can be achieved.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Offshore wind turbine</kwd><kwd>Offshore photovoltaic power</kwd><kwd>Deep reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>Deep deterministic policy gradient</kwd><kwd>Multi-objective optimal control</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>25</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Power System Protection and Control Press</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41601_2023_Article_298.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Decarbonization of electricity production is critical for addressing the issues of climate change and global warming. Improvements in the efficiency and stability of renewable power generation such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) energy enable a more rapid and lower-cost transition to a decarbonized energy system. The joint operation of wind and PV power systems is especially effective in increasing renewable power production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Based on their complementary nature, the integration and coordinated operation of wind and PV power ensure a reliable and adequate power supply, while adhering to the grid requirements by enhancing the peak power shaving capacity. The integration of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) with offshore PV can potentially enhance energy output and reduce overall project cost because of the shared seawater space, power infrastructure and mooring system. In addition, offshore PV can be complementery to OWTs in aspects of increasing the planned cable capacity factor and improving the turbine design life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the integration of offshore wind and PV systems will be beneficial in both economical and technical terms.</p><p id="Par3">Recently, a variety of methods have been investigated, primarily directed at the optimization and coordinated operation of complementary wind-PV systems to ensure power generation quality and efficiency. A multi-objective model is established to maximize power generation and minimize output fluctuations of a hydro-wind-photovoltaic power system in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], whereas in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the feasibility of adding an offshore floating solar farm to an existing Dutch offshore wind farm under the constraint of a certain fixed cable capacity is evaluated. The optimal size and operation of complementary hydro-wind-PV power systems are explored to provide reliable and adequate power for the grid in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], while [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] presents a model for estimating emissions of electricity from systems that couple photovoltaic and wind generation with lithium-ion and vanadium redox flow batteries. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the potential of combining offshore wind and solar power is explored based on the technical specifications of commercial wind turbines and PV panels, while in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a two-stage evaluation mode-based fuzzy multi criteria decision making method is proposed to select the optimal site of wind-PV power plants given the different attitudes of decision makers. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] suggests a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method to enhance the operation of a wind farm and a PV array with a battery energy storage system, while [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] presents the analyses of large-scale integration of wind and PV power into a Danish reference energy system by considering certain ancillary services to identify optimal mixtures from a technical point of view. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it shows that renewables could provide a source of power competitive with fossil-based alternatives in India by using a cost optimization model.</p><p id="Par4">Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] uses a mathematical tool, Copula, to unscramble the dependencies between the power of wind and PV plants and introduces a probability method to analyze how power and energy are compensated at a certain confidence level. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], fault detection, classification, and location for a PV-Wind-based microgrid are presented, whereas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] proposes a damping method for low frequency oscillations by incorporating a supplementary damping controller with a PV generating station whose parameters are coordinated with a power system stabilizer. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] proposes a 2-degree of freedom combined proportional-integral and derivative control scheme for the frequency and power control of a wind integrated interconnected power system.</p><p id="Par5">However, most recent works mainly focus on the economic/technical planning and feasibility analysis of the onshore wind-PV systems at the planning level, while the real-time operation and optimization of the offshore integrated wind-PV system to improve energy efficiency and to smooth power oscillations have not been well investigated. There has been limited attention to the multi-objective real-time operations of the integrated offshore wind and PV power system by considering the intermittent and stochastic nature of wind and solar PV facilities, and hence the real-time complementary potential has not been fully explored. In addition, the conventional proportional-integral and derivative control methods, which have been widely employed in the current literature, may not fulfill the high-quality joint control objectives of the optimal wind power capture and power oscillation smoothing for an integrated OWT and PV power system.</p><p id="Par6">This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for the joint operations of the integrated offshore wind and PV power system. Inspired by behavioral psychology, DRL has exhibited high potential in dealing with sequential complex decision-making problems such that the cumulative reward can be maximized when interacting with an uncertain environment. DRL is also adaptive and model-free, and does not need prior knowledge of the environment, as it can learn the generalized optimal control strategy from historical data. By using DDPG for real-time control, the OWT rotor speed can be varied according to inflow wind conditions while the generator rotation speed can be synchronized with the grid frequency, and the complementary operation and oscillation suppression of the OWT and the photovoltaic power can be well achieved. The potential and effectiveness of the integrated OWT and PV power system are evaluated based on design experiments.</p><p id="Par7">The main novelties and contributions of this work are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par8">A control framework for the real-time operation and optimization of an offshore integrated wind-PV system to jointly improve energy efficiency and smooth power oscillations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">The DDPG methodology design for achieving a tradeoff between the power generation and power oscillation damping performance of the integrated OWT-PV power system.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Verifications of the DDPG approach in simultaneously improving the power capture efficiency and power smoothing capability of the integrated power system using only the generator torque control.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Integrated offshore wind and photovoltaic power</title><p id="Par11">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a sketch of the integrated offshore wind and PV power system which consists of an offshore variable speed wind turbine and PV panels that are arranged in an array. All the PV panels are connected to each other and are fixed to the floating wind turbine platform (not shown). By regulating the generator torque, the turbine rotor speed can be continuously varied according to inflow wind conditions, while the generator rotation speed can be kept constant. The PV power system also includes a boost converter connected with the DC link and DC-AC inverter tied to the grid through a transformer. The boost converter acts as a step-up converter and performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation of the PV panels. In order to develop the DRL control strategy to promote the complementarity operation of this offshore wind and PV resources and to reduce energy instability, it is essential to consider the system dynamic response and construct a control-oriented model.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The integrated offshore wind and photovoltaic power system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2023_298_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Dynamic model of the offshore wind turbine</title><p id="Par12">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the dual-stage mechanical transmission and the electrical generator are important elements for the integrated power system. By varying the generator torque, the rotational speed of the turbine rotor varies, and hence the combined power output of the integrated system can be continuously varied accordingly. When the rotational speed of the wind turbine is changed according to the inflow wind condition to maximize the wind power capture, the rotational speed of the generator is kept constant for connection with the grid. When there is insufficient PV power, the turbine rotor speed and generator power can be directly regulated such that the overall power generation of the integrated power system will be kept stable.</p><p id="Par13">In this paper, the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine is considered for the integrated power system. The wind turbine has a rotor radius of about 63 m, the rated rotor speed is 12.1 rpm, with a rated generator speed of 1173.7 rpm, and gearbox ratio of 97:1. The control of the wind turbine and the integrated power system is focused on region 2 in which the generator torque is controlled to be proportional to the square of the filtered generator speed to maintain a constant (optimal) tip-speed ratio for optimizing power capture and smoothing the overall power output. In this region, the peak power coefficient of 0.482 occurs at a tip-speed ratio of around 8 and a rotor-collective blade-pitch angle of 0.0°.</p><p id="Par14">By neglecting the damping of the mechanical transmission, the dynamic model of the mechanical transmission can be generally formulated as:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mfenced open="{"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mtext>a</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mtext>L</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mtext>g</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mtext>g</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mtext>h</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mtext>g</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The DDPG algorithm and MDP are implemented by using the Tensorflow in Python. The MDP model is designed with a discrete time step of 0.1 min and the simulation time period is 6 min. All the DDPG parameters have been carefully tuned to obtain satisfactory performance of the integrated power system. Both the actor and critic networks have five fully-connected layers with 50 neurons adopted by rectified linear units to each layer.

A variable-speed OWT with electrical generator torque control has been used in the integrated offshore system for active power regulation and oscillation damping. The results from design experiments indicate that the OWT responds quickly to maximize the total power generation when using the DDPG control, while the power oscillations can also be better damped by regulating the generator torque when using the DDPG control. The results indicate the potential for synergies between offshore wind and PV power utilization, and it is clear that the complementary operations of the integrated system can achieve peak power shaving performances. In future work, a scaled-down prototype of the offshore WT and PV station will be built and experimental verifications of the proposed control approach will be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported by “the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.
