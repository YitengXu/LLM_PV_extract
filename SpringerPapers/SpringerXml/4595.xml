Climate goals such as carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards require continuous improvements in technology, operations, infrastructure, and most importantly, reductions in aviation fuel life cycle emissions. The Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation of the International Civil Aviation Organization provides a global market-based measure to group all possible emissions reduction measures into a joint program. Using a bottom-up, engineering-based modeling approach, this study provides the first estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum jet fuel on regional and global scales. Here we show that not all petroleum jet fuels are the same as the country-level life cycle emissions of petroleum jet fuels range from 81.1 to 94.8 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>, with a global volume-weighted average of 88.7 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>. These findings provide a high-resolution baseline against which sustainable aviation fuel and other emissions reduction opportunities can be prioritized to achieve greater emissions reductions faster.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">This study presents a global well-to-wake assessment of jet fuel greenhouse gas emissions with a range of 81.1-94.8 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has estimated that petroleum jet fuel (hereafter referred to as “jet fuel”) consumption could be 2.2-3.1 times higher than its 2015 level by 2045 (based on a pre-COVID-19 annual growth rate of 4%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, this global connectivity of people and goods has significant climate impacts. Civil aviation via jet fuel combustion accounts for 2% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although aviation is not directly included in the Paris Agreement, the aviation sector set three goals in 2009 to address their GHG emissions: improving fuel efficiency by 1.5% annually; implementing carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards; and cutting 2005 emissions levels in half by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although the fuel efficiency target has been constantly met with a 2.4% average annual improvement via advancements in technology, operations, and infrastructure, the remaining two goals have yet to be achieved. In addition, the IPCC AR6 report notes that a rapid and far-reaching energy transition is required to ensure global warming is held to 1.5–2 <sup>o</sup>C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In response to mounting climate concerns, the Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was adopted as a voluntary carbon offset and emissions reduction program in 2016 and has been applied to international aviation since 2019. As a global market-based measure, CORSIA can assist the ICAO’s goal of carbon-neutral growth via CORSIA-eligible fuels (CEFs) to reduce the industry’s emissions offsetting requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">CEFs can be classified into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and lower carbon aviation fuel (LCAF). SAF is produced from biomass or waste-derived sources such as biofuels or via power-to-liquid processes (i.e., low-carbon synthetic fuels produced from CO<sub>2</sub> and renewable hydrogen via electrolysis). It meets the CORSIA sustainability criteria and can be directly used as drop-in fuel without engine or system modifications. ICAO has advanced the development of a process-based attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to calculate the baseline life cycle GHG emissions of jet fuel and GHG emissions of biomass-based SAF throughout the supply chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The results can be used to calculate emissions reductions from SAF against the conventional jet fuel life cycle GHG emissions baseline of 89.0 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup> as adopted in Annex 16 Vol IV to the Convention of International Civil Aviation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Biomass-based and power-to-liquid SAF can cut up to 80-90% of petroleum baseline emissions, however, concerns have been raised about high production cost and low scalability. There are additional potential constraints on biomass-based SAF, such as large variability in emissions reduction potential, supply shortages, land-use change impacts, and the demand for fertilizers and pesticides to produce biomass feedstock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. LCAF is a petroleum-based jet fuel with at least 10% life cycle GHG emissions reduction from the same baseline (89.0 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Such reductions can be achieved‒for example, through carbon capture and storage (CCS) and renewable energy utilization in the oil supply chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. LCAF was approved as CORSIA Eligible Fuel in Annex 16 Vol IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and the development of LCA methods to assess its climate benefits is ongoing.</p><p id="Par5">In meeting the emissions reduction targets set by ICAO and International Air Transport Association (IATA), and informing regional low-carbon jet fuel policies and measures, there is an increasing need to transparently demonstrate baseline life cycle GHG emissions and potential reductions of jet fuel at both global and regional scales. There have been numerous life cycle carbon footprint studies on SAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> but the understanding of LCAF has been limited due to the lack of geographically rich data (e.g., crude intake and jet fuel yield by refinery) and inconsistent assumptions (e.g., system boundary and allocation method) that result in a wide range of life cycle emissions estimates varying up to five-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. To fill these gaps, we perform a first-of-its-kind LCA that estimates the life cycle (i.e., well-to-wake, which describes the life cycle inventory) GHG emissions of petroleum jet fuel (rather than SAF) on a global scale. By applying engineering-based tools (i.e., OPGEE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, COPTEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and PRELIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, see Methods) using public and commercial datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, we provide traceability of the carbon footprint of each jet fuel pathway from the market to its source oil field. More importantly, such a high-resolution baseline can help the aviation industry prioritize SAF and other emissions reduction opportunities to achieve climate goals faster and more effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Global jet fuel market</title><p id="Par6">Global jet fuel consumption was ~6.7 million barrels per day (Mbbl d<sup>−1</sup>) in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Oil Statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Most countries produce the jet fuel they consume. On average, domestic production represents 81% of the jet fuel consumed in a country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A country’s jet fuel consumption is highly dependent on its GDP, with a Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> equal to 0.98. The US and China are the largest consumers of jet fuel, and they both have a disproportionately high number of deep conversion refineries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which are geared to make more light and middle distillates. Among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the US, Japan, and South Korea have the highest potential to be self-sufficient in jet fuel refining, with domestic production representing over 90% of their demand. The noticeable exceptions are France (58%), Germany (54%), Italy (53%), the UK (43%), and Australia (40%).</p><p id="Par7">The global jet fuel trade was ~2 Mbbl d<sup>−1</sup> in 2017. In order of export and import volumes, South Korea, the US, Netherlands, Singapore, India, China, and UAE are leading exporting countries. At the same time, the UK, the US, Germany, Australia, and France are the top importing countries. As the world’s largest jet fuel exporter, South Korea’s exports represent 70% of its domestic production, making up 16% of global exports and 58%, 86%, and 48% of the US, Japan, and Australia’s imports, respectively. Major European OECD countries, including the UK, Germany, France, and Italy, on the other hand, rely heavily on imports that meet 50-70% of their demand (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This lack of self-sufficiency in jet fuel may be due to refining capacity constraints, market demand and pricing for refined products, and jet fuel price differential across the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In 2017, the refinery throughput and petroleum product demand in the EU were 686 and 762 million tonnes, respectively, indicating a small gap between local production and consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, this small gap is widening as EU refining volumes decline. It also hides the increasing imbalance between the demand and supply of different refining products. For example, EU relies heavily on diesel/jet fuel imports from Russia, the U.S., and the Middle East while gasoline overproduction has caused uneconomic conditions in many refineries in EU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Also, the well-to-wake CI calculated for jet fuel produced by each refinery has a much more noticeable variation (77.3-112 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>) than the aggregated country-level results (81.1-94.8 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). This facility-level variation is mainly due to the production emissions associated with their crude slates and, more importantly, their choice of the primary stream of their jet fuel. Four main streams that can be blended into jet fuel in increasing refining CI are jet separated from the atmospheric crude distillation unit (CDU jet), jet from the kerosene hydrotreater (KHT jet), jet from the diesel hydrotreater (DHT jet), and jet from the distillate hydrocracking unit (DHCU jet). The stream-level and facility-level variations are almost identical, implying that the choice of jet fuel source can be a determining factor. For example, a refinery may produce jet fuel via more emissions-intensive processes (e.g., DHCU) to meet market demand or product quality standards (e.g., sulfur content). The choice of jet fuel source can also help SAF substitution that offers substantial climate benefits, depending on the fuel type (e.g., hydro-processed esters and fatty acids).

This implies that a portion of current jet fuel production has the potential to meet the ICAO’s sustainability criteria as LCAF with investment in supply chain decarbonization.

Although moderately correlated with the well-to-wake CI (<italic>R</italic> = 0.34), a sensitivity analysis shows that the refining CI is affected by the allocation method applied, the energy use of key process units, and the indirect emissions of natural gas (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). It is worth noting that switching from the process unit-level (adopted as the default in this study) to the refinery-level allocation can drastically increase jet fuel refining CI because jet fuel, in general, is processed by less units than other major refinery products (e.g., gasoline and diesel). Fig <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> presents refining CI by jet fuel source (i.e., characterized by crude oil fractions and process units). Deep conversion refineries that process more heavy crude oils are in general more energy- and emissions-intensive than medium conversion and hydroskimming refineries that generally handle lighter crude oils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Each jet fuel source also has different refining CI. DHCU jet has the highest refining CI, ranging from 9 to 11.5 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup> depending on refinery configuration, followed by DHT jet (3.4-7.5 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>) and KHT jet (3.1-4.8 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>), whereas CDU jet has the lowest CI, approximately 1 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>. DHCU jet, DHT jet, and KHT jet are processed by more units and thus require more hydrogen and heat than CDU jet. As a result, the amounts of jet fuel produced from DHCU and CDU are most influential to a refinery’s jet fuel CI (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). SMR hydrogen production is one of the most energy- and emissions-intensive refinery processes. It represents almost 60% of the refining CI of jet fuel produced from DHCU but less so for those from DHT and KHT because hydrocracking (e.g., DHCU) in general consumes more hydrogen than hydrotreating (DHT and KHT). The global volume-weighted average refining CI is estimated to have the potential to be reduced to 4 and 2 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup> under the low and high technology improvement scenarios, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Jet fuel refining CI breakdown and jet fuel composition.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Volume-weighted average jet fuel refining energy use and CI breakdown by process unit, refinery configuration, and jet fuel source.

Over 90% of the global jet fuel production by volume is from medium and deep conversion refineries. Hydroskimming refineries generally produce jet fuel from the CDU unit. In contrast, deep conversion refineries produce more KHT jet and DHCU jet. One may argue that all refiners should produce as much CDU jet as possible to reduce the carbon footprint of jet fuel. However, refineries, in general have limited control over the composition of jet fuel, which is primarily determined by the quality of crude supply and required specification of all products via product blending. Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> confirms that the greater the refinery complexity, the less likely refineries are solely dependent on CDU jet. The portion of refineries that only produce KHT and DHT jet, in contrast, seems irrelevant to refinery complexity. From a regional perspective, 39-56% of refineries in Asia and Oceania, Latin America, and Africa only supply CDU jet to the market, higher than the global average of 29%.

It is assumed that all CC equipment is powered by low-carbon utilities.</p><p id="Par48">In this study, for the refining stage under the low technology improvements scenario, we assume that post-combustion CC is only applied to fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCC) and steam methane reformer (SMR) for all refineries. This is because these two are usually the most emissions intensive units across any given refinery and it is technically feasible to install CC equipment under most circumstances. FCC in general converts heavy oil fractions to value-adding light products that can be either blended as gasoline and diesel or processed for producing LPG and petrochemical feedstock. The most important emissions source of FCC is the carbonaceous deposit (coke) on the surface of the catalyst that needs to be burnt off regularly. On the other hand, SMR produces hydrogen from natural gas and high temperature steam (also produces CO<sub>2</sub> as a by-product). It is the main hydrogen source that provides hydrogen for hydroprocessing and is usually responsible for 30%-50% of the GHG emissions from a refinery. The reaction process is endothermic, which means there needs to be a heat source. In PRELIM, we assume natural gas and refinery fuel gas are combusted to satisfy this heat requirement. Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> from both combustion and chemical conversion of natural gas and refinery fuel gas are available for CC.</p><p id="Par49">For the refining stage under the high technology improvements scenario, in addition to CC being applied to FCC and SMR, we assume CC is also applied to capture and sequester CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion for providing heat to key process units including atmospheric tower, vacuum tower, coker, residue hydrocracker, gasoil hydrocracker, all hydrotreaters, naphtha reformer, desalter, kerosene merox unit, alkylation unit, isomerization unit, and fuel gas treatment unit. In addition, low-carbon electricity and steam are adopted for crude oil refining. Low-carbon electricity is available from resources such as nuclear- or renewable-powered electricity generating facilities, while lower-carbon steam may be generated from CHP systems or renewable driven heat-generating facilities. Emissions not captured (but counted as refining emissions) are indirect (Scope 2) emissions associated with electricity and natural gas production, and support services emissions (flaring and fugitive emissions).</p><p id="Par50">We assume an amine-based post-combustion CC with an 85% capture efficiency as suggested by literature recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Hot flue gas captured from combustion processes passes through a waste-heat steam generator first, followed by CO<sub>2</sub> absorption in aqueous monoethanolamine. The absorption medium can be regenerated via heat. To meet water and pressure specifications, CO<sub>2</sub> compression and dehydration are also required. Energy (5.97 MJ steam and 0.2 kWh electricity per kg capture CO<sub>2</sub> as suggested by Motazedi et al., 2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>) required by the CC equipment is assumed to be provided by low-carbon electricity and steam as described above.</p><p id="Par51">For emissions reductions associated with crude oil production and transportation, based on literature recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, we assume a 16.7% emissions reduction through routine gas flaring minimization for the low technology improvement scenario.
