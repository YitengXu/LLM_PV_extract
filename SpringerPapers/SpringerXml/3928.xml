The majority of experimental electrocatalysis studies use conventional one-sample-at-a-time methods without providing spatially resolved catalytic activity information. Herein, we present the application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for simultaneous screening of different catalysts forming an array. We demonstrate the potential of this method for electrocatalytic assessment of an array consisting of three Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to formate (CO2RF). Simultaneous SECM scans with fast scan (1 V s<sup>−1</sup>) cyclic voltammetry detection of products (HCOO<sup>−</sup>, CO and H<sub>2</sub>) at the Pt ultramicroelectrode tip were performed. We were able to consistently distinguish the electrocatalytic activities of the three compositionally and morphologically different Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> catalysts. Further development of this technique for larger catalyst arrays and matrices coupled with machine learning based algorithms could greatly accelerate the CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction catalyst discovery.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Experimental methods to evaluate electrocatalytic performance typically only address one sample at a time.

In one approach, excess renewable electrical energy is used to electroreduce carbon dioxide to formate in aqueous media. The stored liquid formate solution is then electro-oxidized in either a direct formate fuel cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> or in a CO<sub>2</sub> redox flow battery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> when and where energy is needed, while also contributing to a carbon neutral energy cycle. The electrochemical production of formate from CO<sub>2</sub> has been hampered by catalyst related issues such as low catalytic activity, durability and selectivity. One of the most promising catalysts for this process is Sn/SnO<sub>2</sub>, which has shown high selectivity and low overpotential for CO2RF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The adsorption and surface interaction of the radical anion CO<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> is a key step in the reaction mechanism influencing the overall reaction rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The nature of the catalytic active sites can include an active, nascent, Sn surface formed in situ by oxide reduction and the oxide itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. It has been proposed that maintaining the stability of the surface tin oxide structure is important for the long-term catalytic durability in CO2RF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The experimental variables influencing the performance of CO2RF catalysts are: catalyst material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, co-catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, support (e.g., C-black vs. graphene), catalyst size and morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, oxidation state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, surface defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and electrolyte composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Since these variables can be used in combination with one another, optimizing the catalyst performance will be a slow, tedious process if each catalyst formulation is experimentally tested one at a time in half-cell experiments using techniques such as linear or cyclic voltammetry at static and rotating disk/ring-disk electrodes (RDE/RRDE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Generally, a major hindrance for new electrocatalyst discovery is the lack of high-throughput experimental screening methods. On the theoretical side of catalyst discovery important advancements are made with accelerated machine learning based methods coupled with density functional theory computations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The accelerated theoretical findings can guide the experimental studies in efficiently narrowing the range of investigated catalyst formulations. However, at present there are only a few multi-electrocatalyst screening methods that could be used. Optical screening methods are fast, but are limited to optically active reaction systems. Multi-electrode array cells might also be used, but their application to complex catalyst systems is limited by the array manufacturing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Scanning probe microscopy methods, such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and the more complex scanning flow cell (SFM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, have had widespread application in electrochemistry, but none have been used to screen multiple CO2RF electrocatalysts at the same time. SECM has been used for screening of catalysts for a few reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and formic acid oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. SECM studies of CO2RF catalyst characterization were focused on individual carbon nanomaterials (graphene, nanotube) or precious metal catalysts (Ag, Au, Pd)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.Mirroring the RRDE technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, combinations of SECM and ultramicroelectrode (UME) tip CVs were used for in-situ rapid product analysis for single CO2RF catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, no report exists of this technique being extended to the simultaneous analysis of multiple CO2RF catalysts.</p><p id="Par5">The goal of our work is the investigation of SECM as a product selective screening method of catalyst arrays for CO2RF using catalyst compositions and morphologies of practical relevance as opposed to model (e.g., smooth single crystal) surfaces. The focus here is on Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> catalysts and their activity for CO2RF. Arrays composed of three Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> surfaces were fabricated by a novel method based on different electroreduction pre-treatments of each sample, thus, each catalyst had different surface composition and morphology. We demonstrate that simultaneous SECM scanning of the array gave consistent results proving the suitability of this technique for fast evaluation of electrocatalytic activities for different catalysts composing the array.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and characterizations of Sn/SnO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> catalyst arrays</title><p id="Par6">Flat, mirror polished, Sn substrates with native oxides (SnO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic> = 1 and 2) on the surface were prepared and used as catalyst precursors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The morphology of the polished substrate is typical of a heavily worked Sn surface; with a few identifiable shallow, oriented polishing scratches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In order to produce different surface morphologies and compositions that are expected to have an effect on the CO2RF activity, the polished precursor substrate was modified by pre-electroreduction in a N<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KHCO<sub>3</sub> solution (pH 8.75) for 30 min at 293 K. Note the term pre-electroreduction is used to indicate the surface pre-treatment preceding the actual CO2RF experiment. The pre-electroreduction potentials of −1.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl and −3 V vs. Ag/AgCl were chosen based on surface pre-treatment screening experiments (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), in order to produce two types of morphologies: micro-scale spherical particles and nanoparticles, respectively. As shown by Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, pre-electroreduction at −1.25 V (or more generally between −1 and −2 V, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) generated a roughened surface with some larger spherical aggregates with diameters from 100 nm to 200 μm, whereas pre-electroreduction at −3 V (or −3.5 V, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) produced a surface covered by spherical nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 30 to 70 nm. Nanoparticle formation by electroreduction has been previously reported for indium-tin oxide (ITO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We also observed similar nanoparticle surface coverage when pre-electroreduction at −3 V was applied to either chemically or electrochemically formed tin oxide (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The mechanism for ITO nanoparticle formation during electroreduction was proposed to be due to dissolution-precipitation of the dissolved metallic ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We propose that a similar mechanism is at play here as well for the pure tin oxide. The high local pH created at −3 V by the H<sub>2</sub> evolution reaction rapidly etches and dissolves the native oxide from the surface since SnO<sub>2</sub> is unstable at pH ≥10.5 forming Sn(OH)<sub>6,(aq)</sub><sup>2− </sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The preferential dissolution of SnO<sub>2</sub> most likely happens at grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This is followed by fast nucleation and deposition of nanoparticles but nanoparticle growth is hindered by the high H<sub>2</sub> gas surface coverage produced at −3 V starving the sites from Sn(OH)<sub>6,(aq)</sub><sup>2−</sup> needed for further growth. Therefore, the diameter of nanoparticles produced at −3 V is only between 30 to 70 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> catalyst array characterization.</title><p><bold>a</bold> SEM imaging, (<bold>b</bold>) XPS spectra and deconvolution at the Sn 3d5/2 orbital with surface molar compositions calculated based on peak surface areas.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42004_2020_399_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">The XPS characterization of the three surfaces is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. Tin oxide surface films are commonly composed of three tin species: Sn, SnO, and SnO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The relative contribution of each species was obtained by deconvoluting the XPS spectral peak associated with the Sn atom 3d5/2 orbital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The blank polished surface is covered by a native passivating oxide layer that halts further atmospheric oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The surface with the highest proportion of SnO<sub>2</sub> is surprisingly the one pre-electroreduced at −1.25 V, a potential at which SnO<sub>2</sub> should be thermodynamically unstable in the KHCO<sub>3</sub> solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This unexpected increase in SnO<sub>2</sub> has been explained by the atmospheric oxidation of freshly reduced metallic Sn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The pre-electroreduction at −1.25 V strips off part of the passivating layer, which partly uncovers the pure metallic tin grain, all the while leaving the more stable oxide on the surface. After drying, the freshly exposed tin metal reacts readily with atmospheric oxygen, oxidizing it to SnO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This yields a final surface richer in SnO<sub>2</sub> than the unreduced native (blank) sample. Furthermore, through this process of electrochemical stripping of the oxide, followed by atmospheric oxidation, it is likely that surface defects are also introduced that can also impact the electrocatalytic activity. The same phenomenon is at play for the substrate pre-electroreduced at −3 V, which has the lowest oxide fraction. In this case, the very negative electroreduction potential completely strips the surface of its oxides and the subsequent atmospheric oxidation would be unable to completely balance the loss of oxide incurred during the pre-treatment. This phenomenon yields a surface that still has a high proportion of oxides despite the strongly reducing condition of the pre-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of the Pt ultramicroelectrode (SECM Tip) for probing CO2RF</title><p id="Par8">In this study, SECM is used in the substrate generation/tip collection mode (SG/TC) where both the tip and substrate potential are independently controlled, and the tip current is recorded (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The tip moves in an XY plane parallel to the plane of the substrate array, while electrochemically probing the chemical species in the diffusion shell created by the reaction at the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Ideally, dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> is reduced solely to formate and the resulting formate is oxidized at the tip (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The ability for the Pt ultramicroelectrode (UME, 10 μm diameter) to act as a probe for formate detection in SECM was investigated. To evaluate the response of the Pt UME to formate in order to serve as a reference for the in situ detection, cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded with a scan rate of 1 V s<sup>−1</sup> in both CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KHCO<sub>3</sub> with varying concentration of externally added potassium formate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). The N<sub>2</sub> purged KHCO<sub>3</sub> solution represents model conditions, while the CO<sub>2</sub> purged KHCO<sub>3</sub> solution represents the real conditions encountered during in-situ detection associated with the SECM scan.

This oxidation peak becomes a broad wave (extending between tip potentials of −0.6 V and 0.6 V) in the case of substrate potentials of −1.5 and −1.6 V, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The broad oxidation wave is a feature of the electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO2RR), since Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref> with externally added formate do not show the same broad oxidation wave on the anodic scan. The latter wave is due to a combination of formate oxidation plus interference from oxidation of the H<sub>2</sub> evolved (particularly at lower tip potentials starting at approximately −0.6 V) and contributions from the adsorbed CO peak at high tip potentials (between 0.3 and 0.6 V)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. At more negative catalyst substrate potentials H<sub>2</sub> production is favored over CO2RR, which explains the large anodic scan oxidation current on the Pt tip around −0.5 V. The reaction mechanism for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation on Pt has been thoroughly studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, but it can also influence the competitive adsorption and oxidation of formate and CO on Pt (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). However, in spite of these inherent complexities, sufficient information can be gained from the anodic and cathodic scan directions in the fast CV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) to obtain a reasonable assessment of the product specific electrocatalytic activities.</p><p id="Par13">At more positive substrate potentials (−1.2 V and −1.4 V, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), CO is oxidized on the tip as a clearly distinguishable separate peak which is lumped into the broad wave at more negative substrate potentials (−1.5 V and −1.6 V, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The CO response can be due to two sources: oxidation of CO produced as intermediate of the formate partial oxidation on the Pt tip and CO produced by CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction on Sn/SnO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). It is difficult to accurately and quantitatively separate these two contributions. Comparing Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the CO oxidation wave emerging from the formate pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) is smaller even at high formate concentrations compared to the CO peak recorded during in-situ tip detection of CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction products (e.g., at −1.4 V substrate potential Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that the CO peak at the tip is mostly due to CO generated from CO2RR on Sn/SnO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>.</p><p id="Par14">Given the presence of CO<sub>ad</sub>, we investigated conditions that minimized the activity loss of the Pt UME tip for detection throughout the duration of the SECM scan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Multiple sets of CVs were obtained on the tip placed close (100 µm) to an unreduced, native, Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> catalyst held at a potential of −1.5 V. First, we tested the effect of starting potential. Two series of fifty CVs were performed, one starting at −1.0 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) and the other one starting at 1.2 V.

Before each series of cycles, the tip was held for 10 s at the starting potential of the CVs to mimic the conditions between each data acquisition during SECM. The 10 s rest period at 1.2 V also serves a tip cleaning purpose. Thus, the stability of the tip response over fifty scans was much higher for a starting potential of 1.2 V indicating much less interference from CO<sub>ad</sub> poisoning. This observation was further substantiated in a series of extensive CV-SECM scans showing excellent reproducibility for three identical catalyst samples (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Effect of starting potential and repetitive cycling on the Pt UME tip CV for in-situ detection of products generated on the native (unreduced) Sn/SnO<sub>x</sub> catalyst.</title><p>Overlay of 50 CVs. <bold>a</bold> Starting potential: −1.0 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>, (<bold>b</bold>) Starting potential: 1.2 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>.

The CO<sub>ad</sub> tip response is comparable for each catalyst, with the substrate pre-electroreduced at −1.25 V exhibiting slightly higher CO oxidation current densities. More interestingly, the wave associated with H<sub>2</sub> oxidation is lacking for the sample pre-electroreduced at −1.25 V indicating virtually 100% Faradaic efficiency for CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to carbonaceous products (formate and CO). For the other two catalysts (pre-electroreduced at −3 V and the native surface, respectively), as the CV-SECM scan proceeds, the H<sub>2</sub> response increases while the formate response decreases a bit over time, indicating a slight degradation of the activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). This could be attributed to time dependent changes on the catalyst surface of the metastable Sn oxides. As the experiment proceeds with continuous exposure of the substrate at −1.5 V, in case of the high surface nanoparticle based catalyst prepared at −3 V with low initial SnO<sub>2</sub> content (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), more of the metastable oxides are reduced to metallic Sn.

However, the catalyst prepared by pre-electroreduction at −1.25 V with the highest initial SnO<sub>2</sub> content (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), is more stable under CO<sub>2</sub> reduction conditions and the activity toward formate generation is superior (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This ranking remained consistent throughout multiple trials. The catalyst produced by pre-electroreduction at −3 V was always less active for formate generation than the others in spite of its higher surface area.

The approach curve consisted of holding the Pt ultramicroelectrode tip at a constant <italic>XY</italic> position and slowly decreasing the Z position, all the while holding the tip at a constant potential where the oxygen reduction reaction takes place under diffusion-controlled conditions (−0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Note: all potentials from here on are referenced against Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated. Initially, the tip was outside of the cell and the substrate was inside the cell. The electrolyte solution was poured inside the cell slowly. Once the solution contacted the substrate and the reference electrode, the remaining solution was poured very quickly to also contact the counter electrode (Pt wire, 1 mm diameter, 40 mm long). The tip was then lowered into the bulk solution far from the substrate array surface. A CV at the tip was obtained (scan rate: 50 mV s<sup>−1</sup>, scan range: 0.0 to −1.0 V for 3 cycles).

This inflection point indicates the position at which the tip hits the resin’s surface. At this position, the resin’s surface obstructs the diffusion of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> from the bulk solution to the tip electroactive surface, limiting the absolute current at the tip. An approach curve was done at each corner of the scan area (Scan area equal to: 1000 × 2250 μm), to determine the tilt of the array surface with respect to the SECM apparatus.

The tip was moved up 2000 μm from the surface, the Pt tip potential was changed to −0.5 V and the 0.1 M KCl solution was pumped out of the cell through a previously installed Pasteur pipette inside the cell. The solution level in the cell was kept such as to prevent breaking the electrical circuit between the bi-potentiostat and both working electrodes (i.e., tip and substrate). The new electrolyte solution, (0.1 M KHCO<sub>3</sub>) was poured gently inside the partially empty cell to top off the solution level. CO<sub>2</sub> was bubbled inside the cell through another Pasteur pipette to agitate the solution. After 5 min. the cell was again partially emptied and topped-up again with the new electrolyte solution. In total the cell was partially emptied and refilled four times. After this, the substrate potential was changed from −1.0 V to −1.5 V to pre-emptively reduce potential unstable tin oxide species that might dissolve and reprecipitate on the tip during the SECM scan. After waiting 20 min., the tip was brought back at 100 μm from the surface. Before the CV-SECM scan was performed, a constant potential SECM scan is performed with a tip potential of −0.5 V. The scan lasted 35 min. Results of these constant tip potential SECM scans are not presented in this work since the fast CV tip detection was preferred for selective product characterization (described below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>CV-SECM scans</title><p id="Par31">In this case, the SG-TC mode of SECM was used. The CV-SECM scan was performed after a constant potential SECM (described above). The substrate potential was held at −1.5 V. The tip CV sweep consisted of recording a single CV (between 1.2 to −1.0 V, with a scan rate of 1 V s<sup>−1</sup>) at each 250 μm in the forward <italic>X</italic> direction at a constant <italic>Y</italic> position. Between each acquisition point the tip was at a constant potential of 1.2 V for cleaning<sub>.</sub> This was followed by a scan along the same <italic>Y</italic> coordinate, but in the backward <italic>X</italic> direction. Once both scans were acquired, the tip was moved 250 μm in the <italic>Y</italic> positive direction. Once at the new position, the single line scan procedure was repeated until ten backward and ten forward <italic>X</italic> direction scans were completed. The total scan area was 8750 μm by 2250 μm, which yielded 36 acquisition points per line scan. A complete scan lasted for 2.5 h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>SECM redox mediator feedback scan</title><p id="Par32">After the SECM experiment, the tip was removed from the cell and the substrate potential was held at −1.5 V. The electrolyte solution was removed from the cell and topped off with DI water without breaking the circuit. This was repeated three times over the span of 20 min. while N<sub>2</sub> gas was bubbled through the cell, mixing the solution. The last top-up involved a N<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KCl, 3 mM ferrocene methanol solution instead of DI water. A freshly polished tip of known electroactive diameter was inserted in the cell, followed by a tip CV scan (−0.2 to 0.6 V, 50 mV s<sup>−1</sup>, 3 cycles). Limiting current was extracted from the CV and used to determine the concentration of ferrocene methanol in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. An approach curve was performed (<italic>E</italic><sub>tip</sub> = 0.3 V) toward the resin surface of the array to determine the new position of the substrate with respect to the tip. Using the new surface position and previously determined tilt, an SECM scan was performed over the array (<italic>E</italic><sub>tip</sub> = 0.3 V, <italic>E</italic><sub>sub</sub> = −1.5 V). This scan was used to detect any distortion in tip-substrate distance, or any other artifact that could have developed during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>XPS analysis sample preparation</title><p id="Par33">Samples for XPS analysis were prepared by polishing Sn (Alfa Aesar 99.99%) pieces of 10 × 10 × 1 cm which were inserted into a specialized electrochemical cell. The specialized cell assembly enables connection to the potentiostat while preventing contamination of the sample. The substrate electroreduction was performed with the same procedure as for the substrate arrays (presented before). At the end of the electroreduction procedure, the sample was removed from the solution and washed with DI water. The substrates were stored individually in a glass Petri dish, with their backside glued to the back of the Petri dish with double sided carbon tape. XPS analysis was performed about a week after the substrate pre-electroreduction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The financial support from NSERC Canada through the Discovery Grant program (awarded to E.G. and separately to E.A.) is gratefully acknowledged.
