Despite numerous existing studies and increasing applications of sludge treatment reed bed in both developed and developing countries, the lack of standard system configurations and operating regimes led to several operational problems, including bed clogging and poor dewatering and mineralisation efficiency. Sludge dewatering and stabilisation in STBRs are complex processes governed by system- and operation-related factors such as the substrate media, macrophytes, loading regime, sludge characteristics, and climate conditions. Rather than the complex experimental study, process-based modelling has become a promising approach to investigating the influence of specific factors on the efficiency of sludge dewatering and stabilisation. This paper presents an overview of the critical system and operating parameters in sludge treatment reed beds and a summary of the interactions between the factors. Then, a framework of process-based modelling is proposed, which provides a useful platform to study the interactions of operating parameters and other factors in the complex processes of sludge dewatering and stabilisation, which supports the system design and optimisation of sludge treatment reed beds.

Sewage sludge is a semi-solid by-product generated from sewage treatment that exists in a volatile form. In developing countries, sewage sludge is generated from sewage treatment plants and onsite sanitation systems (Tayler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>). For the sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant, the most common sludge includes primary and secondary sludge, where the primary sludge is the sludge collected from the primary clarifier, and the secondary sludge is the surplus-activated sludge (Nielsen and Stefanakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2020</xref>). As for the onsite sanitation system, the sludge is known as faecal sludge. Since the septic tank is a standard onsite sanitation system, the sludge produced is also called septic sludge or septage (Chandana and Rao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Sewage sludge management must comply with the policies, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>). According to the National Water Services Commission guidelines in Malaysia, the sludge must be dewatered and treated, where the total solid content in liquid form must not exceed 4.0%. Besides, it must attain a dry solid content of at least 20% before being disposed of or used for other purposes. Generally, centralised treatment plants equipped with mechanical dewatering devices are considered the ideal practice for sludge treatment. However, the cost of capital investment and energy consumption of the centralised treatment plant has always been a concern for sewage sludge management in developing countries. In contrast with the high capital and operating expenditures of conventional centralised sludge treatment facilities, decentralised systems utilise simple construction, operation, and maintenance methods, as well as involve lower sludge transportation costs, and have attracted more and more attention as a result (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). In addition, the decentralised sludge management system could bring considerable additional income from the sludge treatment process, in which the treated sludge can be applied for agricultural purposes.</p><p id="Par4">The sludge treatment reed bed (STRB), which is an engineered system combining the concepts of conventional drying beds and vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCW), has been proven to be a promising technology for sludge management. Sewage sludge is loaded onto the top surface of the reed beds intermittently, where it is dewatered through drainage and evapotranspiration, and the sludge residue is simultaneously stabilised. Studies have shown that the sludge dewatered via STRB can reach a dry solid content of 25–40%, which is comparable to mechanical dewatering techniques such as belt presses and centrifuges (Nielsen and Stefanakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2020</xref>). Since the STRB is a chemical-free system, the sludge residue could be recovered as biosolids for agricultural purposes (Collard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>; Kołecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). In addition to the promising dewatering performance, the STRB can also treat the supernatant (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). The liquid percolates through the reed bed and is treated along the way; thus, the final effluent, so-called leachate, is generally desirable in quality. Tayler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>) indicated that the concentration of Total Solids (TS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Biological Oxygen Removal (BOD) in the effluent from STRB were found to be lower than that of the mechanical dewatering methods. In general, the COD concentration in the sludge can be reduced by at least 60%, and most of the ammonium nitrogen is nitrified (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). A review article also showed that many studies presented more than 90% removal for TS and COD in the leachate, as well as promising removal efficiencies for nutrients and other pollutants (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Although the capital cost for a STRB is often higher than a mechanical dewatering device due to its large land requirement and footprint, it offers high energy efficiency and chemical-free dewatering and treatment processes. Further, the overall cost for sludge dewatering by mechanical techniques is 50% to 90% higher than the STRB, mainly due to the high energy input and chemical dosages (Nielsen and Stefanakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2020</xref>; Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). These economic savings are crucial for developing countries, where aspects such as operational costs must be weighed against capital expenditure on sludge management facilities. Therefore, the STRB is widely regarded as an eco-friendly solution for sludge treatment due to its natural processes and economic and environmental advantages (Kołecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">There are no standard design and operational parameters for the STRB, and the application is hindered by several operational problems, including poor macrophyte growth, bed clogging, and slow dewatering and mineralisation rates (Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>). These problems require further studies to improve the competitiveness of STRB against centralised wastewater treatment plants by optimising the technology’s design, operation, and monitoring. Although there have been several review articles on the STRB, standard system configurations and operating strategies have not materialised due to its highly dynamic performance (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>; Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>; Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2015</xref>). Sludge dewatering and stabilisation of the reed bed system is a complex process involving physical and biochemical mechanisms. Its efficiency is affected by various system- and operation factors, including sludge characteristics, reed bed characteristics, loading rate, loading frequency, and climate (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). These factors interfere with each other and increase the STRB’s design and operation complexity. For example, although frequent loading and a high loading rate reduces land area requirements, such a loading pattern results in thicker sludge residues and extends the dewatering time needed (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>; Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Rather than the laboratory- and pilot-scale experimental study, process-based modelling has become a promising approach to investigating the performance and aiding the design of the system and operational parameters of STRBs (Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>; Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). Process-based modelling can relate sludge dewatering, including the moisture content and organic content of sludge residue and the quantity and quality of supernatant, to the system-related factors such as reed bed properties and thickness, and operation-related factors such as loading rates and drying period. However, there are only a limited number of numerical models for STRBs. Uggetti et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2012</xref>) developed a model using Terzaghi’s consolidation theory to simulate sludge dewatering via gravity drainage and evapotranspiration. Tan (2016) adopted the Richards equation and the Activated Sludge Model to predict the leachate flow rate and nitrogen dynamics in a reed bed treating septic sludge. Meanwhile, He et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>) also applied the Activated Sludge Model to analyse the stabilisation of sludge residue on the reed beds.</p><p id="Par8">However, these numerical models still lack the capability to assess the interference between the system and operation parameters in STRBs on the sludge dewatering and treatment performance. Therefore, this study aims to review the performances of the STRB and associated systems and operation parameters in recent articles, and recommend the crucial parameters and their interactions with other factors in the process-based modelling of the sludge dewatering and treatment performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par9">There are numerous publications on sludge dewatering and stabilisation in STRBs in scientific research databases. The publications were collected from the databases of Web of Science and Scopus, where only articles in English were considered. The keywords used to perform the articles search include: “Sludge Treatment Reed Bed”, “Sludge Drying Reed Bed”, and “Sludge Treatment Wetland”. Only the studies published in the recent ten years were considered to ensure the latest developments of STRB are reviewed. In addition, criteria were set to decide whether the publication is taken into consideration, including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par10">The studies included were limited to treating sewage sludge, including faecal sludge, septic sludge, primary sewage sludge, and surplus-activated sludge.

It is important to highlight that a few publications were found with the same system and operational parameters. These publications were still considered but regarded as the same system; thus, 51 sets of the system and operational parameters were included in the analysis. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the location of the selected publications, where most studies were from Asia and Europe, with 24 and 20 publications, respectively. In Asia, China had fourteen publications, followed by Malaysia with seven publications. Denmark and Poland contributed five publications each for Europe, while three studies were conducted in Italy. In Africa, three STRB studies were from Burkina Faso, while there were two from Cameroon. Brazil was the main contributor in South America with three publications. There was only one publication from Canada for North America. Among these studies, only twelve systems were operated at full-scale, while the remaining were pilot-, mesocosm-, or laboratory-scale systems. Most of the full-scale STRBs in the selected studies were located in Europe.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Location of selected publications</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13762_2023_5063_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">Since the number of publications in the last ten years has been relatively low in number, some comparisons were made against research articles published between 2008 and 2012 to examine the roles of the system and operational parameters in STRBs. In this review study, a set of crucial parameters that govern the performance of sludge dewatering and stabilisation were identified. These parameters were further compared with simulation studies to propose a process-based model framework for dewatering and stabilisation processes in STRBs. Due to limited modelling studies for this particular system, simulation studies of similar systems, including treatment wetlands and drying beds, were taken into consideration in the framework development of process-based modelling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sludge characteristics</title><p id="Par17">As mentioned previously, the primary source of sewage sludge includes onsite sanitation systems and sewage treatment plants. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the classification of sludge types in this review study. There are 37% (19 out of 51) STRB systems treating sludge from various onsite sanitation systems, where the majority were treatment of sludge removed from septic tanks, so-called septic sludge. Meanwhile, four studies investigated sludge treatment from both septic tanks and pit latrines, which were regarded as faecal sludge in this review. A total of 57% (29 out of 51) of STRB systems were categorised as sludge treatment systems for sewage treatment plants. These systems were further classified into the treatment of surplus-activated sludge from secondary treatment only, and a mixture of sludge from primary, secondary, and other treatment processes in the sewage treatment plants. In addition, three systems acted as secondary treatment units following the primary STRBs or other sludge management facilities, which were considered “Other” in this review.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sludge types in the selected studies (<italic>n</italic> = 51)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13762_2023_5063_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">In STRBs, the priority of the design goal is to achieve desirable sludge dewatering and stabilisation performance. Therefore, the solids content is the foremost parameter in terms of sludge characteristics. The characteristics of septic sludge, faecal sludge, surplus-activated sludge, and the mixture of sludge from primary, secondary, and other treatment processes reported in the selected studies are summarised in Table S1 in the online resource. In terms of solids content, total solids (TS) or dry matter (DM) is the common parameter indicating the total amount of solids in the raw sludge, which provides crucial information for considering operational parameters of STRBs for solid–liquid separation (Chandana and Rao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">The average TS concentrations for septic sludge in most references are above 10,000 mg/L, where the highest TS concentration was 57,600 mg/L from Miri, Malaysia (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). In contrast, the TS concentrations of septic sludge in Belo Horizonte were generally below 2400 mg/L, and the average concentration was as low as 706 mg/L (Calderón-Vallejo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). The wide range of TS concentrations in the selected studies reflects the high variability in septic sludge quality. Several factors, such as tank dimension, desludging frequency, user habits, and climate, have significantly influenced septic sludge quality (Vincent et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2011</xref>). Total suspended solid (TSS) is another quality parameter indicative of solids content, and the TSS concentration of septic sludge was typically 70–90% of TS (Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>; Sonko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2014</xref>; Jong and Tang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014b</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">On the other hand, the average TS concentration of faecal sludge was higher than the septic sludge, as Osei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>) reported an average concentration of 52,857.6 mg/L. It is consistent with the findings of Jain et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>) and Pandey and Jenssen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>), where the septic sludge typically has a more extended stabilisation duration than the faecal sludge removed from the pit latrines, resulting in a better solid decomposition. The faecal sludge quality also varied significantly, depending on the removal mechanism and frequency. In contrast, the TS concentrations of surplus-activated sludge were significantly lower than the septic sludge and faecal sludge, where the concentrations were typically below 8000 mg/L. Troesch et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2009</xref>) indicated that septic sludge is produced from the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and sediments of inert solids composed of many fine and coarse particles that result in a high TS concentration.</p><p id="Par21">Meanwhile, Vincent et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2011</xref>) indicated that the extracellular polymeric substances produced in the activated sludge process stimulate the flocculation of microorganisms and organic matter, leading to a more consistent particle size distribution. The same study also highlighted that the high specific surface areas of the fine particles in the septic sludge characterise high water retention capacity, resulting in poorer dewaterability. However, the TS concentrations of sewage sludge from an activated sludge treatment plant reported by El-Gendy and Ahmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>) were as high as septic sludge, where it was attributed to the mixing of surplus-activated sludge with the primary sludge, as well as the preliminary thickening of sludge in conventional drying beds.</p><p id="Par22">Volatile solid (VS) is the quality parameter that measures the amount of organic solids in the raw sludge, where the efficiency of sludge stabilisation in STRBs is usually evaluated based on the decrease in VS/TS ratio of the sludge residue over the loading-resting cycle. Based on Table S1, the VS/TS ratios of septic sludge ranged from 44 to 60%, and only one study showed that the ratio reached 68% (Meng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>). The mixture of sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines had VS/TS ratios between 55 and 66%. Compared to the faecal sludge in pit latrines, the relatively low VS/TS ratio of septic sludge is due to the prolonged anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the septic tanks. The ratios of surplus-activated sludge varied widely in the selected studies, ranging from 40 to 70%. Vincent et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2011</xref>) demonstrated that the VS/TS ratio of surplus-activated sludge was generally lower than septic sludge, where the concentrations depended on the scale of sewage treatment plants, sewage characteristics, and sludge age.</p><p id="Par23">Based on the summary of sludge characteristics, the concentration levels of a wide range of hazardous pollutants in the sewage sludge, including chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nutrients such as total nitrogen (TN), ammonium (N-NH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrate (N-NO<sub>3</sub>), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate (P-PO<sub>4</sub>), and pathogenic compounds such as total coliforms and Escherichia coli were much higher compared to the high-strength wastewater as stated in Henze and Comeau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). These quality parameters, in particular COD, were crucial in designing STRBs in terms of the leachate treatment capability. The highest average COD concentration of septic sludge reached 35,526 mg/L (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>), but an average COD of below 500 mg/L was also reported (Calderón-Vallejo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). The COD levels in the septic and faecal sludge were generally proportional to the TS concentrations. However, although the TS concentrations of surplus-activated sludge were relatively low, the COD concentrations were usually high. For instance, Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2022b</xref>) indicated that the TS concentrations of the surplus-activated sludge were between 7500 mg/L and 15,000 mg/L, but the COD concentrations ranged from 27,400 mg/L to 35,600 mg/L. Zhong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2021</xref>) also observed the same trend, where the average COD and TS concentrations were 46,380 mg/L and 9424 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of nutrients in sewage sludge, particularly TN and TP, were also relatively high compared to high-strength wastewater, but the concentrations varied from batch to batch. The highly variable concentrations of COD and nutrients make it challenging to ensure that leachate treatment in STRBs meets effluent standards.</p><p id="Par24">Recent studies have highlighted that the treatment of heavy metal content in dewatered sludge is critical if the sludge was to be utilised for agricultural applications as compost, as high concentrations can lead to toxicity and be hazardous to the environment (Boruszko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>). However, the selected studies did not report heavy metal contents in the raw septic and faecal sludge. Chandana and Rao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>) indicated that heavy metal concentrations in septic and faecal sludge were usually below 1 ppm, and thus, the contamination caused by the heavy metals could be negligible in the management. However, a wide range of heavy metals was detected in the surplus-activated sludge in Table S2 of the online resource. The results among these studies are consistent, where most studies found a very high concentration of iron (&gt; 40 mg/L), while manganese and zinc concentrations were lower (close to 1 mg/L). Other heavy metals remained at a low concentration in the raw surplus-activated sludge. In addition, the detection of emerging pollutants, including antibiotics (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>), was also reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>System and operating parameters</title><p id="Par25">A conventional STRB consists of several key components: a reed bed composed of multi-layer granular porous media, macrophytes and a sludge distribution and drainage system. The STRB does not require pre-treatment other than a screen that removes large objects that can damage the sludge distribution devices. Some designs divide STRB into two treatment stages: the first stage dewaters the raw sludge, while the second stage treats the supernatant from the first stage treatment (Jong and Tang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014a</xref>; Chen and Hu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>; Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). The dewatering of sludge in STRB is through draining and evapotranspiration (Kołecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). In a conventional STRB, a distribution system is used to discharge the sludge to the top of the reed bed. During the loading period, the particulate matter in the influent sludge is physically retained on the top surface of the reed bed, producing a layer of sludge residue, also known as a sludge deposit or sludge cake (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). Then, the liquid component, which is also known as leachate, percolates through the reed bed and is released via the drainage system for disposal or further treatment (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). This liquid–solid separation through draining is the primary dewatering mechanism in STRB. Some systems recirculate the leachate to the reed bed to ensure the effluent quality is up to standard (Magri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Typically, the STRB is fed intermittently in batches to enhance the sludge dewatering and stabilisation efficiency, where the loading rate and frequency are the most critical operational factors. The STRB operation by controlling the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) is the most straightforward, as the amount of sludge to be fed is directly measured by volume. However, such an operation regime might lead to a large variability of the resulting solids load in each loading cycle due to the varying sludge characteristics (Calderón-Vallejo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). On the other hand, the operation of the STRB by solids loading rate (SLR) is more conventional, where the loading volume is determined based on the total solids concentration of the raw sludge. This approach has been proven to be a better operating regime for controlling the buildup of sludge residue and improving long-term performance (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). The climate is a crucial factor in the selection of SLR, where Gholipour et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2022</xref>) concluded that the average SLR in tropical climates could be up to 101 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>yr, while it is only 70 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>yr in the temperate region. However, measuring the solids content of the raw sludge to control the SLR is time-consuming, so the HLR operating regime is still a viable method when the sludge characteristics are relatively constant (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">As mentioned, the STRB is loaded alternatively, and the dry period between two consecutive loads is known as the resting period. During the resting period, evaporation and transpiration release the residual liquid in the sludge residue on the top surface of the bed, which is another important dewatering mechanism in STRB (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). Nielsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>) and Jong and Tang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>) emphasised the importance of alternating loading and resting periods to reduce the risk of overloading and waterlogging in the bed. At the same time, the sludge residue also undergoes aerobic mineralisation that stabilises the volatile substances to improve the quality of the final sludge residue (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). The intermittent loading regime creates a saturated–unsaturated cycle that promotes an aerobic condition in the reed beds, which improves the removal efficiency of the organic matter in the leachate. Therefore, the duration of this dry period is a key factor in the rate of sludge residue accumulation, sludge dewatering by evapotranspiration, and the stabilisation of volatile substances in the sludge residue (Kołecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">With regards to the system configuration, the reed bed, also known as substrate media, is a multi-layered granular media that acts as a filter to retain the particulate pollutants physically. This granular media is also an attached growth reactor that removes dissolved pollutants from the leachate through biological and chemical reactions. The substrate materials generally include gravel and sand (Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>), but materials such as biochar (Greenway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2022</xref>; de Rozari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>), zeolite (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2022a</xref>), and palm kernel shell (Jong and Tang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>) were also adopted to enhance the pollutant removal capacity of the system. The particle size of the granular material is crucial to the permeability and filtration efficiency of the STRB system, but substrate thickness does not significantly affect the dewatering and stabilisation performance (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). As mentioned, the filtration of particles produces a sludge residue layer at the top surface of the substrate, which reduces the permeability of the bed. The excessive accumulation may eventually lead to waterlogging (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). Accordingly, the sludge residue layer is usually considered part of the substrate as it governs the filtration efficiency and hydraulic retention time, and it is even referred to as an indicator of the bed’s acclimatisation status (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2022a</xref>). In general, sludge residue is removed when the depth causes bed clogging, where prolonged surface ponding is observed.</p><p id="Par29">Numerous studies have highlighted the role of reeds in promoting transpiration to improve dewatering efficiency and alleviate clogging problems with the extensive root system in the STRB (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>; Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). A rhizosphere layer formed by the extensive growth of reed roots also stimulates air exchange in the substrate and increases the surface area for biofilm development (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). Although there have been many other macrophytes used in the study of STRB, the common reeds (<italic>Phragmites</italic> species) are the common option mainly due to their excellent tolerance to high-strength influent, micropollutants, and fluctuations in influent flow, as well as their capability of removing the pollutants with high efficiencies (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>; Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">b</xref>). Furthermore, the installation of ventilation pipes through the bed vertically has become more common as it enhances the aerobic mineralisation of organic matter by creating efficient air exchange, ensuring a better quality of sludge residue and leachate in the STRB (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). Recently, several studies modified the conventional STRB by introducing earthworms (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">b</xref>), active aeration (Plestenjak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021</xref>), electro-oxidation (Wang et al. 2021), and biological power generation (Zhong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2021</xref>) to improve the system performance. Gholipour et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2022</xref>) referred to these studies as the state-of-the-art system configuration in STRBs. In this review article, these advanced features are not considered as there is insufficient research to determine their roles in sludge dewatering and stabilisation. Thus, it is difficult to include them as input parameters in the proposed modelling framework. A summary of the system configurations and operational parameters of the STRB systems among the selected studies is presented in Table S3 of the online resource.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Substrate media</title><p id="Par30">A full-scale STRB system consists of several reed beds arranged in parallel to implement an alternating loading-resting cycle in each bed (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). It was reported that the number of beds is usually at least eight, with some even up to 24 (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). The number of beds is subject to the duration required for the desired degree of sludge dewatering and stabilisation, where the properties of substrate media play vital roles in controlling the influent infiltration and retention time, filtering the particles, and acting as a reactor for leachate purification through physical and biochemical reactions (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>; de Rozari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). The selection of substrate media, including the materials, grain sizes, and depth, is a critical technical issue in STRB and is mainly based on the principle of attached growth systems for wastewater treatment. In general, the substrate media is a multi-layered granular media, and the upper layer of the substrate media is known as the filter or growth layer, where the macrophytes are found. The grain size of the medium in this layer is often small to enhance the filtration capacity and provide water retention to support the macrophyte growth (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>; Troesch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2009</xref>). Underneath the top layer, one to three layers with different sizes or materials (also known as the main substrate layer) are usually filled for the purpose of influent percolation and treatment. Then, a drainage layer is created at the bottom of the reed bed to maximise the outflow of the leachate from the bed (Kołecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the typical substrate materials and thicknesses in STRBs among the selected studies. Natural materials such as gravel and sand are the most common substrate materials in the selected studies since they are abundant, relatively low in cost, and promising in retaining pollutants. A total of 35% of the studies (18 out of 51) involved STRBS consisting only of gravel in the substrate and involved at least two substrate layers with different grain sizes, where the size distribution usually increases with depth to achieve a high degree of water permeability (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). The only exception is Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2022b</xref>), which employed a single-size substrate media. The gravel used in the selected STRB systems varied in grain size, ranging from 2 to 100 mm. Kołecka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>) explained that the dewatering rate of STRBs is dependent on the grain size of the substrate media, and the coarse-grained materials used resulted in large pore spaces and higher hydraulic conductivity, which is vital to ensure that sufficient dewatering takes place (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; Stefanakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). However, the pollutant removal could be limited by the low filtration capacity and low surface area of the coarse-grain substrate media in biofilm development and sorption, and the low water retention capability could also lead to plant wilting. In addition, according to Nielsen and Stefanakis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2020</xref>), heavy metals are likely to be bound to the gravel media, thus filtering them out of the drainage system with less than 16% of the final heavy metal mass leaving the bed.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Materials and depth of substrate media in the selected studies (<italic>n</italic> = 51)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13762_2023_5063_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par32">Sand has a smaller grain size than gravel, typically less than 2 mm in diameter, with characteristically low permeability (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2019</xref>). A total of 33% of the selected systems (17 out of 51) adopted a top sand layer on the media, which acts as the primary filter layer. There are insufficient data to conclude the effect of the sand layer on the sludge dewatering efficiency, but the advantage of the sand layer in improving pollutant removal due to better filtration capacity has been highlighted (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2019</xref>; Panuvatvanich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2009</xref>). In addition, the sand layer acts as an interphase that separates the granular medium and the sludge residue layer and prevents the solids from entering the deeper substrate layer of the STRBs. It enables the restoration of the reed bed from clogging by simply replacing the sand layer (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">A total of 14% of the selected systems (7 out of 51) employed industrial by-products or artificial materials such as slag, zeolite, ceramsite, graphite, palm kernel shell, biochar, and activated carbon in the substrate media of STRBs to improve the removal of organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals in the leachate (Greenway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2022</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2022a</xref>; Zhong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2021</xref>; Jong and Tang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014a</xref>). The significant advantages of these materials include better sorption capacities due to the greater surface area, chemical reactivity, and cation exchange capacity (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>). Although favourable results were obtained, the cost and local availability of these materials are important concerns (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2019</xref>), so these materials were mostly found in state-of-the-art systems with electro-oxidation (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2022a</xref>) and biological power generation (Zhong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2021</xref>). In addition, the long-term performance of sludge dewatering and leachate purification, including the permeability and sorption capacity of the substrate media over the treatment durations, requires further studies.</p><p id="Par34">Among the selected studies, most systems had substrate media depths greater than 0.5 m (23 out of 51), where the vast majority were between 0.60 and 0.69 m (10 out of 51). Although the substrate media with a depth between 0.30 and 0.49 m have been found in thirteen studies, the number of systems with a substrate media depth below 0.30 m has been relatively low. The depth of the substrate media is variable, and it has been reported to have a limited effect on the performance of STRBs (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). For example, a STRB system in Brazil has a 0.75 m substrate media (0.45 m large gravel layer, 0.20 m small gravel layer, and 0.10 m coarse sand layer from bottom to top) (Magri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>), and its removal efficiency of TS and COD were similar to the system in Palestine with a 0.40 m substrate media (0.15 m gravel layer (Ø 25–40 mm), 0.15 m gravel layer (Ø 10–25 mm), and 0.10 m fine sand layer from bottom to top) (Afifi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>) in treating the septic sludge with similar characteristics. Panuvatvanich et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2009</xref>) also indicated that the reed bed with a 0.20 m sand layer has a better nitrogen removal efficiency than a system with a 0.10 m sand layer, but there is no further improvement when the sand layer was increased to 0.40 m. Accordingly, a substrate media depth between 0.40 and 0.50 m should be sufficient to deliver promising sludge dewatering and leachate purification, while the selection of substrate materials and grain sizes is more critical to the system’s performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Macrophytes</title><p id="Par35">The roles of macrophytes in STRBs are summarised as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par36">The presence of the macrophytes provides a large surface area of the leaves that ensure a high transpiration rate that helps in sludge dewatering (Hu., Chen and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>; Rozkošný et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2020</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">The root penetration and stem movement due to wind create cracks in the sludge residue and substrate media, enlarging the openings for influent infiltration and improving the sludge dewatering via draining (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">Macrophytes release oxygen to the sludge residue through the extensive root system, which creates an oxygen-rich layer that enhances aerobic mineralisation (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>; Pandey and Jensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>; Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39">The rhizosphere of the macrophytes acts as a site for biofilm attachment for the leachate treatment (Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">The macrophytes uptake the pollutants, such as nutrients and heavy metals, subsequently improving the leachate purification efficiency (El-Gendy and Ahmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2009</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par41">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the species of macrophytes used in the STRBs in the selected studies. The number of systems with common reeds (<italic>Phragmites</italic>, <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>, and <italic>Phragmites karka</italic>) outnumbered those with other macrophytes (28 out of 51). Common reeds have been widely used in the STRB systems regardless of climate types because of their excellent productivity, extensive root development, and wide availability in the local area. According to Bakhshoodeh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>), the root of the common reeds can easily penetrate up to 0.6–1.0 m deep and withstand a wide pH range (pH 4.8–8.2). Its adaptability to different climates is also an important feature as the macrophytes in STRBs. In addition, common reeds demonstrated excellent tolerance to high-strength influents, micropollutants, and fluctuations in influent flow (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>).

In addition, Jong and Tang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014b</xref>) further commented that the continuous growth of roots and rhizomes in the sludge residue layer and the filter media, as well as the movement of the reed stems, prevent the bed from clogging and keep the bed under an aerobic condition. However, a study indicated that macrophytes played a minor role in maintaining the drainage rate of the reed beds during the loading period, as no significant difference was observed between the planted and unplanted systems (Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>).

The climate is one of the crucial factors in selecting macrophytes in the STRBs, where the growth of a particular type of macrophytes could be unfavourable under low temperatures and high humidity and may eventually wilt during the winter.

The analysis revealed that 39% of systems (20 out of 51) adopted HLR in operating the STRBs, whereas 28% (14 out of 51) used SLR as the loading regime. In addition, there is an increasing trend that the amount of sewage sludge fed on the STRBs was dependent on the sludge production at the source (Mariñelarena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>; Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2019</xref>; Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Loading strategy of selected studies (<italic>n</italic> = 51)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13762_2023_5063_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">SLR is a conventional way to describe the treatment capacity of an STRB, which is given as kg of total solids (TS) or dry matter (dm) per square metre per year (kg TS or DM/m<sup>2</sup>/yr) (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). Climatic conditions and sludge quality are the governing factors for selecting SLR (Gholipour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2022</xref>; Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). A hot and dry climate and raw sludge typically guarantee a faster dewatering rate and produce a relatively dry biosolids in the stabilisation process (Khomenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>). Accordingly, the SLRs for the STRB systems in the regions with tropical, subtropical and arid climates were usually high, ranging from 100 to 350 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr (Nzoubet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2022</xref>; Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>; Magri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>; Pandey and Jensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>; Afifi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). However, excessive sludge loading jeopardises the sludge dewatering efficiency and leads to an operational problem of bed clogging (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). A study revealed that the high SLR significantly reduced the dewatering efficiency of STRB, as the average percentage of supernatant reduced from 66.56% to 22.82% when the SLR was increased from 100 to 350 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). Several studies also observed a lower dewatering efficiency in the systems with SLR of 150 kg—200 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr (Magri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>; Pandey and Jensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>; Sonko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2014</xref>). Accordingly, an extended resting period should be provided to ensure appropriate liquid lost through draining and evapotranspiration in the system with a high SLR to meet the targeted dewatering efficiency (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). In addition, Sonko et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2014</xref>) found that clogging is more frequent in beds with a high solid load in the sludge application, even though a longer resting period was provided. This finding further emphasises the importance of SLR in the dewatering efficiency of STRBs.</p><p id="Par45">The SLR of the STRB systems located in the temperate regions with continental, Mediterranean and hemiboreal climates, ranged from 25 to 75 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr (Kowal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2021</xref>; Meng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>; Masciandaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2015</xref>; Caicedo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>; Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2013</xref>). Many studies recommended that the SLR for temperate climate conditions should be at a maximum of 60 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr (Tayler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>; Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>), as evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and microbial activity rates are significantly reduced under low temperatures, especially during the winter in temperate regions (Varma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021</xref>). However, it was also reported that a low loading rate could hinder the growth of macrophytes (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). Stefanakis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>) determined that a SLR below 60 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr was too dry for a system under the Mediterranean climate, causing the common reeds in the system to wilt and decrease the evapotranspiration rate and overall dewatering efficiency.</p><p id="Par46">In addition to sludge dewatering, SLR is also a key factor in the removal efficiency of pollutants in the leachate. An operational concern is that the optimum temperatures for the primary biological processes in the STRB are within the range of 15–30 °C. However, it is difficult to maintain the efficiency of leachate purification in most temperate countries due to the change in temperature over the year, so the SLRs should remain below 60 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr to ensure the desired treatment efficiency (Stefanakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). On the other hand, it was also observed that the increasing SLR was capable of achieving excellent removal efficiency for TS, COD, and TN (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>; Magri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>; Afifi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). Further, a high solid load increases the accumulation rate of sludge residue on the reed bed, subsequently improving the system’s filtration capacity and treatment efficiency (Molle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2014</xref>). Based on the literature review, SLR ranges of 50–60 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr and 100–150 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr were widely referred to in evaluating the operation of STRBs in temperate and tropical regions, respectively.</p><p id="Par47">Recent studies suggested that the HLR is a more appropriate loading regime than SLR in the design of STRBs due to its simplicity in operation (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>) and significant impact on the drainage rate (Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>). The HLR is presented as the volume of sludge per square metre of reed bed per day (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/day) or per loading over the loading-resting period (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/loading), which is usually simplified as the depth of sewage sludge fed per day (cm/day or mm/day). Kinsley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>) observed that the variation in the drainage rate of STRBs depended on the HLR, while SLR has limited influence on such a dewatering mechanism. However, Tan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>) observed that the drainage rate did not significantly vary with the HLR, where the dewatering efficiency was affected by other factors, such as the accumulation rate of sludge residue and rest periods between the loadings. In fact, some studies assessed the adequacy of HLR in dewatering performance by estimating the corresponding solids load from the TS concentrations of the raw sewage sludge (Osei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2022</xref>; Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">b</xref>). Accordingly, the effect of HLR and its interaction with other factors on the overall dewatering efficiency of STRB still requires further studies.</p><p id="Par48">Many studies have discovered that a high HLR deteriorates the removal efficiency of organic matter and nutrients in the leachate by creating a faster percolation rate over the substrate media, which shortens the contact time of the pollutants with the attached biofilm (Karolinczak and Dabrowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>). However, a low HLR also influences the leachate purification performance as it causes water shortage in the reed bed and hinders the growth of macrophytes, which in turn affects the development of attached biofilm and pollutant uptake (Hu and Chen 2018). For the STRB systems located in tropical and semi-arid regions, the HLRs were mainly above 10 mm/day, with the highest reaching 57 mm/day (Osei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>; Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>; Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>; Kouawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>). On the other hand, HLRs below 5 mm/day were reported for STRB systems in temperate regions (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">b</xref>; Rozkošný et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2020</xref>; Chen and Hu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Mennerich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>); Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>) to over 10 mm/day (Zhong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2021</xref>; Plestenjak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>; de Rozari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>; Calderón-Vallejo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>), to even be as high as 100 mm/day (Karolinczak and Dabrowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>). In summary, the HLRs adopted in the selected studies varied widely, and only a limited number of studies proposed the design of HLRs for the STRB under particular climates (Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">There is also an increasing trend that the loading regime of STRBs was not controlled by either SLR or HLR, but rather depended on the amount of sewage sludge received from the source. Such a loading regime was usually observed in full-scale systems (Mariñelarena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>; Kołecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>; Boruszko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Masciandaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2015</xref>; Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>; Nielsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014</xref>). In septic sludge management, different trucks were used to remove sludge from various origins, where highly variable volumes and characteristics in its composition were expected, restricting the control of hydraulic and solid loads in the operation of STRBs (Calderón-Vallejo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). For example, the loading of a STRB system treating septic sludge depended on the sludge collected by the clean-pit truck, which resulted in a significant difference in HLR, ranging from 6.3 to 21.4 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, corresponding to SLRs of 10.5–914.5 kg TS/ m<sup>2</sup>/yr (Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). The highly variable HLR and SLR were also observed in the STRB treating surplus-activated sludge (Mariñelarena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>; Masciandaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2015</xref>; Nielsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014</xref>). Although the average SLR of these systems were comparable to the recommended loading rate, uncontrolled loading poses a higher risk of overloading the reed bed, which can lead to insufficient sludge dewatering and stabilisation and poor leachate purification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Resting period</title><p id="Par50">The duration of the drying period between loading periods, the so-called resting time or resting period, is a key design parameter to ensure sufficient sludge dewatering and stabilisation in STRBs (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). In general, sludge dewatering through drainage is observed at the beginning of the resting period, followed by further moisture content reduction through evapotranspiration (Iannelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). The solid loading rate is a prerequisite in determining the resting period of STRBs, and so climate conditions are critical factors for the design of loading frequency (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>). During the resting period, the residual water content in the reed beds continuously drains out or is released via evapotranspiration, so the resting period is typically longer than the loading period (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). The formation of surface cracks in the sludge residue layer due to the continuous loss of water content is crucial in maintaining the dewatering capacity and enhancing the stabilisation of sludge at a deeper level (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>; Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>; Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). If the beds are overloaded and are without a sufficient resting period, waterlogging could lead to anaerobic conditions in the reed beds, subsequently reducing the efficiency of stabilising volatile organic matter in the sludge residue (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). Pandey and Jenssen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>) further highlighted that a longer resting period reduced the volume of sludge residue in the reed beds, eventually extending the system’s lifetime and reducing the maintenance cost.</p><p id="Par51">There are no standard design criteria for the resting period, but the duration of the resting period is usually longer than the loading period. Among the selected studies, only one system has a more extended loading period than a resting period. The loading regime of the STRB is based on the ease of the operation, where the bed was loaded for five days (weekdays) and rested for two days (weekend) to align with the working hours of the operators (Karolinczak and Dabrowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>). However, overloading and poor leachate quality were observed during the loading period due to insufficient rest time. To simplify the operation, approximately 30% of STRB systems in the selected studies (16 out of 51) adopted a weekly basis loading regime with a one-day loading period followed by a six-day resting period (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2022a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2022b</xref>; Osei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>; Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>; Pandey and Jensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>; Jong and Tang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014b</xref>; Sonko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2014</xref>). However, the feasibility of this loading-resting regime has not yet been determined since the hydraulic performance of the STRBs still relied more on the loading rate, as low water recovery through drainage was still observed when high SLR was applied (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). In temperate regions, a longer resting period was usually implemented to enhance the sludge dewatering and stabilisation (Velychko and Dupliak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2021</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>; Masciandaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2017</xref>; Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017</xref>; Collard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>; Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>;), where the longest loading-resting period can be up to one-day loading period followed by a 28-day resting period (Plestenjak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021</xref>). It is also a common practice to have a final resting period ranging from several months to year before the emptying of sludge residue to ensure adequate dewatering as well as stabilisation of volatile matter and heavy metals (Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>; Magri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>; Pandey and Jensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">The climate is crucial to the dewatering of sludge residue during the resting period, as Kim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>) reported that the dry matter content may reach 30% with a 3-day loading period and 15-day loading-resting period during the summer, but the dry matter content only achieved 20% during the winter and rain events. In a full-scale STRB system, a 7–10 days resting period was implemented during the summer season, while the resting period was extended to 14–20 days during the autumn, winter, and spring (Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>). The maturity of the reed bed also plays a vital role in selecting a resting period. Due to better evapotranspiration after the growing period of the macrophytes, a shorter resting period can be practised to enhance the treatment capacity (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>; Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>). Hu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>) and Sonko et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2014</xref>) observed that a shorter resting period was beneficial to the growth of macrophytes in the reed beds, which in turn improved the dewatering efficiency due to the better evapotranspiration rate. Therefore, it is still challenging to determine the optimum resting period and loading frequency due to the complex processes in the STRBs, which are also controlled by factors such as the loading rate, climatic conditions, and growth of plants and biofilms in the STRBs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sludge residue layer</title><p id="Par53">The application of sewage sludge leads to the accumulation of sludge residue on the reed bed as a result of solids sedimentation and filtration. Andrade et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>) found that a SLR of approximately 80 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>.yr resulted in a rate of sludge residue accumulation of about 7 cm/yr in a system located in subtropical regions, while Calderón-Vallejo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>) showed an accumulation of 12 cm/yr with an average SLR of 75 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>.yr. On the other hand, Brix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) reported that a 10 cm/yr residue accumulation was obtained with SLRs of approximately 50–60 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>.yr under a temperate climate, which agreed with Nielsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014</xref>). Kinsley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>) estimated an average rate of 5.7 cm of sludge accumulation per m of septic sludge applied, corresponding to 0.21 cm per kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>. The difference in the sludge accumulation rate is attributed to the high evapotranspiration rate under the hot climate, which leads to significant water loss that reduces the depth of the sludge residue layer due to the shrinkage effect (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">The sludge residue layer is crucial to the dewatering efficiency of STRB, as the continuous loading of sludge compacts the layer and reduces the effective void space, subsequently increasing the filtration capacity and deteriorating the permeability, so-called specific cake resistance (Christensen and Keiding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>). The hydraulic properties of a sludge residue layer are highly dependent on the organic content, where the sludge residue with high VS content characterises low permeability and subsequently limits the dewatering efficiency (Khomenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>). In other words, raw sewage sludge with high concentrations of fats and oils directly reduces the dewaterability of the sludge residue. In addition, this sludge residue is rich in nutrient content, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, which could lead to excessive biofilm growth and further reduce permeability (Pucher and Langergraber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2019</xref>). Therefore, the excessive sludge residue on the top surface of the reed beds due to high SLR is the root cause of bed clogging, which can be observed through prolonged surface ponding and a low drainage rate (Molle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2014</xref>). However, the sludge residue could be beneficial to leachate purification, as it not only increases the filtration capacity of the reed bed but also improves the removal of dissolved organic and nitrogen compounds. The slow leachate percolation rate due to the low permeability of the thick sludge residue layer extends the hydraulic retention time of the leachate in the bed, which could enhance interaction between the pollutants and the attached biofilm in the substrate medium to deliver a more complete treatment process (Varma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021</xref>; Bakhshoodeh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">The permeability of sludge residue could vary over the resting period due to the formation of shrinkage cracks and extensive root system of macrophytes, which creates preferential flow pathways for the influent and alter the drainage efficiency of the reed beds (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). The high volatile solid (VS) content in the influent results in more water-bound due to the capillary action (Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). Accordingly, the continuous loss of capillary-bound water in the sludge residue through transpiration via macrophytes is crucial to dewatering, which eventually leads to deformation and shrinkage of the sludge residue when a sufficient resting period is provided (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). The shrinkage of sludge residue usually causes cracks, allowing the influent to “bypass” the sludge residue layer and accelerate the drainage flow following feeding. Such a deformation in the sludge residue layer creates a “preferential flow pathway” (PFP) which has a positive impact on the drainage rate of the STRB system. However, these PFPs are undesirable for leachate purification, as the hydraulic conductivity increases drastically with the presence of PFPs, reducing the treating duration and the efficiency of sludge dewatering.</p><p id="Par56">Based on the selected studies, the resting period is the primary factor that affects the stabilisation of sludge, which is usually measured as the reduction of VS content in the sludge residue. Therefore, the depth of the sludge residue was found as a factor of sludge stabilisation as the bottom layer experiences a longer resting period (Caicedo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). Kołecka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>) observed a higher organic content in the top layer (71.9 ± 6.0%) compared to the bottom layer (52.4 ± 4.9%). In addition, the stabilisation efficiency was also found to be better when the sludge residue was deeper in the reed beds (Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2019</xref>). Due to the varying degrees of stabilisation across the depth and bed maturity, many studies suggested a final resting period ranging from a few months to a year for complete stabilisation of persistent organic compounds and faecal bacteria indicators in the sludge residue (Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">Besides, sludge dewatering has been found to directly affect the stabilisation performance. The current study has proven that the decomposition of these organic matters is at optimum under aerobic conditions, where the residual water content in the sludge residue decreases the mineralisation efficiency as it prevents atmospheric aeration (Plestenjak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021</xref>). Brix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) emphasised the importance of cracks in the sludge residue layer as their presence promotes oxygen diffusion and aerobic decomposition. In addition, the installation of vertical ventilation pipes is suggested to enhance the mineralisation of the sludge residue in the deeper layers, which has been observed with higher VS and organic matter removals (Meng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">The removal of total organic materials is generally up to 25% via sludge mineralisation in the STRBs (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). The STRB is also believed to be efficient in eliminating pharmaceutical compounds, hormones, and wastewater toxicity, where it can remove most of the heavy metals found in the influent sludge (Moreira and Dias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>). Therefore, the final sludge residue of an STRB with low hazardous organic compounds and heavy metals allows it to be used in agricultural activities (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interactions of system and operating parameters</title><p id="Par59">The design objective of STRBs is to deliver sufficient dewatering that transforms the sludge from liquid to sludge residue with minimum moisture content, as well as stabilises the volatile content in the sludge residue so it can be safely applied as organic fertiliser for agricultural purposes or disposed of without creating environmental problems (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). Sludge dewatering and stabilisation in STBRs are complex processes governed by many factors, including the properties of substrate media, loading regime (sludge loading rate and resting period), macrophytes, as well as raw sludge characteristics (solids content and influent quality), and climate conditions (Plestenjak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021</xref>). In order to formulate a mathematical model for STRBs, it is essential to assess the interactions between these factors in the dewatering and stabilisation processes.</p><p id="Par60">Velychko and Dupliak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2021</xref>) divided the dewatering process into three stages: the formation of surface ponding on the reed beds, the leachate discharge with the solids retention in the reed beds, and the evapotranspiration in the surface pond and sludge residue layer.

This equation shows that the dewatering efficiency, which is measured as the water lost through drainage and evapotranspiration, can be reduced by the surface ponding and water content remaining in the sludge layer as bound water. However, the direct monitoring of the evapotranspiration rate is always tricky due to the influence of macrophytes and weather, so the typical indicators of sludge dewatering include the volume of outflow leachate and the TS contents in the sludge residue layer (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>; Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par61">Gravity drainage is the primary dewatering mechanism in which the solids remain on the bed surface while the liquid is lost as leachate by percolating through the sludge residue layer and substrate media. Then, evapotranspiration releases the residual liquid content in the sludge residue and the upper layer of the substrate medium. In general, the permeability of the substrate medium governs the leachate outflow, but it has no obvious effect on the evapotranspiration rate. However, it has been found that the sludge residue accumulation on the bed surface, which results in a much lower hydraulic conductivity, imposes a specific resistance that limits the water infiltration and drainage efficiency (Christensen and Keiding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>). Besides, the physical filtration of solids in the substrate medium gradually fills the void spaces and decreases the porosity, subsequently reducing the permeability of the reed beds (Vymazal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2018</xref>). Therefore, a high solid load due to the high loading rate or high solid contents in the raw sewage sludge could decrease the permeability of the reed beds, resulting in low dewatering efficiency through drainage (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>). In addition to the solids load, studies also indicated that the high VS content in raw sewage sludge increased the bound water in the sludge residue, which could also limit the sludge dewatering (Khomenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>; Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par62">The hydraulic loading rate significantly affects the drainage rate of the reed beds (Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>). Since the STRB is usually loaded intermittently in batches, a higher load generally produces deeper surface ponding on the bed during the early loading phase, where faster leachate outflow is observed due to the larger hydraulic head difference. As the sludge continuously infiltrates, the head difference decreases, gradually slowing down the outflow rate (Molle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>). On the other hand, if the resting period is not long enough to dry out the prolonged surface ponding due to the high hydraulic load over the resting period, waterlogging in the reed beds could lead to a severe overflow problem (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; Pandey and Jenssen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>). As a result, the duration of the resting period is closely related to the hydraulic loading rate, where the resting period must be sufficient for the complete infiltration of sewage sludge loaded, so evapotranspiration can take place to release the residual water content in the sludge residue (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2012</xref>). The varying permeability of the sludge residue layer over the resting period due to the formation of shrinkage cracks could also lead to an arbitrary leachate outflow rate from the STRBs (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). A review article has emphasised the importance of macrophytes types and density in the evapotranspiration rate (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>), and the presence of macrophytes also favours the drainage efficiency of the reed bed by creating preferential flow paths in the sludge residue layer through the stem movements and the extensive root system (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par63">Sludge stabilisation is a combined process of mineralisation and humification of volatile organic matter in the sludge residue as a result of the biochemical reactions stimulated by microorganisms and macrophytes. Accordingly, the sludge characteristics, particularly the influent VS concentration, govern the sludge stabilisation efficiency in STRB (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>). In addition, the solids loading rate governs the accumulation of sludge residue in the bed and determines the degree of stabilisation required (Kinsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>). Peruzzi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>) identified the specific pathways of sludge stabilisation, where the mineralisation of fresh organic matter and stable organic matter was observed during the initial commissioning and operating phases of the STRBs, respectively. However, the humification process that stabilises the persistent organic compounds and faecal bacteria was only prevalent during the final resting period. Therefore, the rest period is also one of the crucial parameters for sludge stabilisation in STRBs. Raw sewage sludge is continuously loaded on the sludge residue formed by previous operations, so the degree of stabilisation also varies across the depth of the sludge residue, where the mineralisation of stable organic matter is usually observed in the bottom layer (Nielsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014</xref>). An extended resting period ranging from a few months to a year is generally needed to ensure that the sludge residue is safe to be applied as biosolids or disposed of (Peruzzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>). It is important to highlight that the duration of the resting period is closely related to the solids loading rate, as a longer period is needed for the sludge stabilisation when more solids are retained in the bed (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par64">On the other hand, substrate media and hydraulic loading rate have no direct effect on sludge stabilisation. Nevertheless, the high water content of sludge residue may slow down the mineralisation of organic matter because it hinders oxygen diffusion and the occurrence of aerobic mineralisation. Accordingly, the permeability of substrate media and hydraulic load, which are the critical parameters for the drainage rate of the STRBs, indirectly affects the performance of sludge stabilisation. Moreover, the formation of cracks in the sludge residue layer due to the water loss during the resting period is vital to ensure the desirable mineralisation of organic matter by promoting aerobic mineralisation in the deeper layer (Brix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). The extensive root system of macrophytes across the sludge residue also creates an oxygen-rich condition that enhances sludge stabilisation (Nielsen and Larsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par65">The simultaneous purification of the leachate produced from the dewatering process is another important feature of STRB. Solids, COD, BOD, nitrogen compounds (including organic nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrate), phosphorus, and faecal bacteria are the main pollutants in the raw sewage sludge. As mentioned previously, the high solids load increases the accumulation rate of sludge residue, which enhances the reed beds’ filtration capacity and improves the solid removal rate in the leachate. Since the biological process is the primary removal pathway for dissolved pollutants such as COD and ammonium, a dependency between influent concentration and removal efficiency was also observed, where a higher pollutant load promotes biofilm growth in the substrate media, subsequently increasing the removal rate (Karolinczak and Dąbrowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>). The grain size of the granular medium determines the specific surface areas of the substrate, which is crucial to the biofilm development and sorption capacity, eventually governing the degree of leachate treatment.</p><p id="Par66">The drainage rate controls the hydraulic retention time of the leachate in the bed and, ultimately, the treatment efficiency of the leachate. The extended hydraulic retention time has been found to promote more extensive interaction between the contaminants and the attached biofilm in the substrate medium, resulting in more complete pollutant removals (Varma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021</xref>). Karolinczak and Dąbrowski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>) indicated that a higher HLR reduced the removal efficiency of TSS, BOD, and COD. In contrast, the high hydraulic load improved total nitrogen removal efficiency, as the high moisture content in the substrate media limited oxygen diffusion and favoured denitrification. The restoration of aerobic conditions in the reed beds mostly takes place during the resting period, and the formation of shrinkage cracks in the sludge residue due to the continuous water loss has been found to enhance oxygen diffusion. The macrophytes provide additional surface area for biofilm attachment and transfer oxygen into the substrate through the extensive root system, thereby facilitating the aerobic decomposition of pollutants (Bui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). In addition, the macrophytes improve the leachate quality by absorbing the pollutants such as nutrients and heavy metals.

of the process-based modelling of the STRB system is the highly nonlinear sludge dewatering and stabilisation process, where the sludge residue layer is usually regarded as a “black box” in the analysis (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>). The existing sludge dewatering (Uggetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2012</xref>) and sludge mineralisation models (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>) were still incapable of integrating the key factors in investigating the adequate loading rate and resting period. Process-based numerical models could be a better tool for analysing the dewatering and pollutant degradation mechanism in STRBs. This study proposed a modelling framework to numerically describe the processes of sludge dewatering, stabilisation, and leachate purification by considering the interactions between the crucial system and operating parameters shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Generally, the model should consist of several sub-models, including a porous media flow sub-model, an evapotranspiration sub-model, a reactive transport sub-model, a sludge cake sub-model, and a bio-kinetics model. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the modelling framework developed based on the sub-models proposed.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>framework for process-based modelling of STRBs</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13762_2023_5063_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Porous media flow sub-model</title><p id="Par68">The porous medium flow sub-model shall characterise the water infiltration and percolation in the reed bed, which is crucial in predicting the dewatering efficiency through drainage. Typically, the sewage sludge is loaded in the STRB intermittently while the leachate is freely drained, and thus, the drainage flow rate is described by the passage time of percolates through the substrate media. During the loading period, temporary surface ponding occurs due to the low permeability of the sludge residue layer, and the leachate outflow reaches the maximum rate immediately after the discharge is observed due to the largest hydraulic head difference (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). Then, the continuous infiltration of the sludge reduces the head difference and slows down the leachate outflow rate, where the flow pattern is very similar to the VFCW treating sewage (Giraldi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>). Accordingly, Richard’s equation is a viable model for simulating the transient variably saturated flow in the STRB with intermittent loading, which has been proven to be effective in describing the hydrodynamics in the VFCW (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2020</xref>). It is a partial differential equation that relates the water percolation in the unsaturated porous medium to the hydraulic head difference between two points, which includes the effect of gravity and water pressure, and the associated hydraulic conductivity.

This method has been found to be adequate for a range of one-dimensional moving boundary problems, including the finite difference Richards Equation model (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>).

Several studies experimentally proved that the permeability of the sludge residue layer was significantly reduced due to the compression, eventually becoming impermeable at high concentrations (Jadhav et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>). Therefore, a compressible cake filtration model (Christensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>) is a viable alternative to predict the accumulation of sludge residue in STRBs. However, this model consists of several equations that assume the sludge residue as a compressible layer that traps incoming solids above the filter medium, in which the variation of filtration capacity under the feeding condition can be promisingly predicted to improve its accuracy. This model is fundamentally based on gravity drainage theory (Severin and Grethlein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1996</xref>), which considers the compressibility of organic compounds, the settling rate of particles in influent, and the changes in specific resistance due to the buildup of sludge residue. Nevertheless, further studies are still required to include the variations in permeability due to the formation of shrinkage cracks in the simulation of hydraulic behaviour, where the plastic limit of the sludge residue could be a reference to predict the occurrence of cracks (Vincent et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Evapotranspiration sub-model</title><p id="Par74">There are several well-established models for the evapotranspiration rate.

Although this transpiration model provides a more comprehensive simulation in the study of dewatering across the reed beds, the calibration and validation are challenging because direct measurements of transpiration rates and water content are often expensive and time-consuming.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Bio-kinetics sub-model</title><p id="Par78">The primary degradation mechanism of organic and nitrogen compounds in STRBs is through microbial processes. In the numerical model, the fate of the pollutants is determined by a set of mass balance equations, which include multiple reaction processes that either consume or produce the pollutant under specific conditions (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2021</xref>). The bio-kinetics sub-model is usually integrated with the transport sub-model to simulate the transport and fate of pollutants in the substrate media at the same time, and thus, the leachate quality can be assessed based on the discharge standards. Most bio-kinetic sub-models for VFCWs were developed based on the Activated Sludge Model (ASM) (Henze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>), which simultaneously predicts the fate of different pollutants with the presence of microbes to predict the degradation through several biochemical processes, including hydrolysis, aerobic decomposition of organic compounds, and nitrification. CW2D (Langergraber and Sˇimunek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>) was regarded as one of the most advanced models considering the microbial degradation of organic, nitrogen, and phosphorus compounds in VFCWs under aerobic conditions. In addition to the leachate purification, ASM is also implemented to model the sludge stabilisation process in STRB. He et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>) modified the ASM1 and ASM3 to simulate the degradation of volatile organic matter based on two cell decay theories, namely death-regeneration and endogenous respiration. The model delivered promising results for the stabilisation process, and it can also be used as a tool to study the roles of several parameters in sludge stabilisation, including the loading rate, moisture content, and influent concentrations. However, further studies are required for the dependency of sludge stabilisation on the dewatering efficiency, especially the formation of shrinkage cracks which could promote oxygen diffusion and enhance the stabilisation of volatile organic matter.

(3) The loading regime based on hydraulic load rate (HLR) is gaining popularity over conventional solid load rate (SLR) in STRBs because of its ease of operation and significant impact on drainage rate and macrophytes growth. However, the HLRs adopted in the selected studies varied widely, and the current review only observes that a high HLR deteriorates the leachate quality due to the shorter hydraulic retention time in the substrate media, while the influence on drainage rate still requires further study. (4) SLR ranges of 50–60 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr and 100–150 kg TS/m<sup>2</sup>/yr were widely used to operate STRBs in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, as the temperature is a factor in evapotranspiration and microbial activity rates. (5) The loading rate is a prerequisite in determining the resting period of STRBs, where the resting period must be sufficient for the complete infiltration of sludge loaded so evapotranspiration can take place to release the residual water content in the sludge residue. A weekly loading regime with a one-day loading period followed by a six-day resting period was a common loading regime for STRBs to simplify the operation, but a longer resting period was usually needed in temperate regions to ensure a complete sludge dewatering and stabilisation. (6) The accumulation of the sludge residue layer imposes a specific cake resistance on the top surface of the reed bed that increases the filtration capacity while deteriorating the permeability. (7) The characteristics of the sludge residue layer vary over the resting period due to the formation of shrinkage cracks, which enhances the sludge dewatering through gravity drainage by creating preferential flow pathways and promotes stabilisation of volatile solids due to the extensive oxygen diffusion.
</p><p id="Par80">This study proposes a modelling framework that comprise five sub-models to develop a process-based model, which can be a useful platform to study the interactions of operating parameters and other factors in the complex processes of sludge dewatering and stabilisation in STRBs and support the system design and optimisation. For the sludge dewatering, the porous medium flow sub-model is aimed to simulate the gravity drainage flow from the reed beds. A sludge cake model is also needed to estimate the buildup rate of sludge residue due to the solid loads that affect the hydraulic performance, while integrating with the evapotranspiration model to describe the dewatering of sludge residue through the evapotranspiration process. In addition, the combination of the transport and bio-kinetics model simulates the transport and fate of pollutants in the substrate media, and thus, the leachate quality can be predicted. The bio-kinetics model can also be implemented to describe the stabilisation of organic matter in the sludge residue. These sub-models can adopt common models such as the Richard equation, the Penman–Monteith equation, the compressible cake filtration model, the advection–diffusion equation, and the activated sludge model (ASM).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support given by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2020/TK0/CURTIN/03/3) from the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia.
