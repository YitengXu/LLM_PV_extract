However, a cost-effective and scalable technique for synthesizing these nanosheets remains elusive. Here, we report a novel strategy for producing silicon nanosheets on a large scale through the simultaneous molten-salt-induced exfoliation and chemical reduction of natural clay. The silicon nanosheets thus synthesized have a high surface area, are ultrathin (~5 nm) and contain mesoporous structures derived from the oxygen vacancies in the clay. These advantages make the nanosheets a highly suitable photocatalyst with an exceptionally high activity for the generation of hydrogen from a water–methanol mixture. Further, when the silicon nanosheets are combined with platinum as a cocatalyst, they exhibit high activity in KOH (15.83 mmol H<sub>2</sub> per s per mol Si) and excellent photocatalytic activity with respect to the evolution of hydrogen from a water–methanol mixture (723 μmol H<sub>2</sub> per h per g Si).</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ResearchSummary"><title>Silicon nanosheets: splitting water</title><p id="Par2">A cost-efficient technique for turning clay minerals into active photocatalysts could benefit solar-based generation of hydrogen fuel. Light-sensitive, two-dimensional (2D) silicon nanosheets have been targeted as catalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting because their unique geometry enables ample interaction with water molecules. However, most synthetic routes to 2D silicon nanosheets require specialized reagents and conditions. Soojin Park and co-workers in South Korea have developed a strategy based on montmorillonite clay, an abundant mineral that contains 2D layers of silicon, oxygen and aluminum atoms. They found that reacting molten sodium chloride salts with the clay simultaneously exfoliated the natural 2D layers and reduced their chemical structure to produce ultrathin silicon nanosheets with a narrow size distribution.

result of limited natural fuel resources and environmental pollution problems caused by fuel combustion. Hydrogen is a promising alternative energy source with its high energy density, cleanliness and storability. Hydrogen production with the solar-driven water reduction system, which uses infinite solar energy and water, has been studied extensively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Silicon has been exploited as an attractive candidate for solar hydrogen production due to its great natural abundance, straightforward processing and high efficiency. Nanostructured silicon (for example, nanowires, nanotubes and porous structures) fabricated from p-type silicon wafers and the modification of its surface have been suggested for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Nevertheless, high hydrogen production efficiency, the complicated fabrication steps using silicon wafers and operating conditions (for example, use of an external bias and comprising circuit) remain challenges for practical application. Direct solar water reduction from a dispersed photocatalyst is a well-known, cost-effective and simple process.</p><p id="Par5">Direct solar water reduction using silicon-based materials is still an untapped area due to the intrinsic instabilities of silicon-based materials in aqueous solution via oxide formation. Silicon dioxide layers reduce the performance by blocking photo-generated carrier transfer from the photocatalyst to the electron accepter. Meanwhile, Dai <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> synthesized nanosized mesoporous crystalline Si powders using an unconventional approach, namely, the bottom-up self-templating method. These mesoporous crystalline Si powders showed an extremely high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in both a KOH etching system (1.33 mol H<sub>2</sub> per s per mol Si) and a solar water reduction system with methanol sacrificial reagent (882 μmol H<sub>2</sub> per h per g Si) under a 300 W xenon light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Among the various nanostructured Si materials available, two-dimensional (2D) Si nanosheets (SiNSs) are desirable as a photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction based on several advantages such as high surface area, facile accessibility of water molecules and compatibility with other exceptional 2D supports or cocatalysts.</p><p id="Par6">Numerous efforts have been devoted to synthesizing 2D SiNSs using a variety of methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> For instance, Okamoto <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> demonstrated that organosilicon (Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>2</sub>) nanosheets can be fabricated by the chemical reaction of polysilane (Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) and a Grignard reagent. This method is useful for forming regularly stacked structures of SiNSs with limited dimensions. However, this process cannot produce highly pure SiNSs on a large scale because the process involves metal doping or the use of methylamines. Recently, Kim <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> synthesized free-standing SiNSs through the chemical vapor deposition of SiCl<sub>4</sub> on various substrates in a high-flux H<sub>2</sub> environment without a catalyst and observed a distinctive photoluminescence (PL) behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> This gas-phase growth process, however, is limited because it produced SiNSs with a broad size distribution and thus is not suitable for cost-effective large-scale production. A more scalable way of synthesizing SiNSs is to combine the ball milling of commercial sands with a magnesiothermic reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> However, in spite of the simple nature of this process, the resulting SiNSs are almost all broken into small pieces and stacked in a large framework, limiting their use in various applications.</p><p id="Par7">One strategy for synthesizing ultrathin SiNSs is to employ natural clays, which commonly exist as layered silicate structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> One such clay, montmorillonite (MMT), is a three-layered mineral consisting of a central octahedral (aluminum–oxygen) layer sandwiched between two tetrahedral (silicon–oxygen) layers. Chemical bonds between the shared interior oxide anions and the metal cations (Si and Al) link the layers, yielding unique nanosheet-like structures with an overall basal spacing of ~2 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Different natural clays contain different elements such as Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Li and Na.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Most commercial clays exist as hundreds-of-micrometer-sized bulk particles stacked in the form of sheets. Thus, the clays must be exfoliated to obtain ultrathin sheets. Cation exchange between the interlocated metal cations and the bulk molecules (for example, long alkylamines and polymers, among others) and subsequent sonication is an established method for obtaining exfoliated clays consisting of only a few layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Thus, natural clays with an ultrathin 2D structure can be employed for synthesizing thin SiNSs on a large scale.</p><p id="Par8">Herein, we present an all-in-one strategy for the synthesis of high-purity SiNSs through the high-temperature molten salt (for example, NaCl)-induced exfoliation and simultaneous chemical reduction of clays. In this method, the metal salt serves two functions: it acts as a heat scavenger for the highly exothermic reduction reaction and as an exfoliation-inducing agent. The resulting SiNSs have a narrow size distribution (sizes of 1–5 μm) and are ultrathin (thickness of ~5 nm), owing to the penetration of the molten salt into the gallery of the clay. During the chemical reduction and the subsequent rinsing process, a mesoporous structure is formed within the SiNSs, resulting in the generation of specific surface areas as high as 300 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, the SiNSs thus synthesized exhibit a photoassisted hydrogen production rate of 486 μmol H<sub>2</sub> per h per g Si, owing to their large specific surface area and unique morphology. When the SiNSs are combined with Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as a cocatalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate increases significantly to 723 μmol H<sub>2</sub> per h per g Si under visible light (<italic>λ</italic>⩾400 nm); this rate is maintained for at least 26 h without significant degradation in the catalyst activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis of SiNSs</title><p id="Par9">MMT clay (15–35 wt% octadecylamine, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), magnesium powder (Sigma-Aldrich) and sodium chloride (NaCl, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in a weight ratio of 1:0.7:3. This mixture was transferred to a stainless-steel reactor in an Ar atmosphere. Next, this reactor was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 550–700 °C for 5 h. After the completion of the reaction, the resulting powder was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water under mild stirring for 3 h to remove the NaCl. Then, 1 <sc>M</sc> HCl was added to this solution, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 3 h to eliminate the by-product MgO and other possible impurities. Finally, the SiNSs were obtained by leaching with 0.2% HF, filtration and drying in vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. The production yield of the SiNSs as synthesized was ~40%. Owing to their intrinsic affinity for moisture and light, the SiNSs were stored in a light-shielded container in an inert atmosphere.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Synthesis of SiNS-650/Pt</title><p id="Par10">This synthesis follows the conventional platinum-coating process.

After rinsing with deionized water and drying, we could obtain Pt-decorated SiNS-650 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of mP-SiNP</title><p id="Par11">This synthesis follows the typical metal-assisted chemical etching process.

The dimensions and internal structures of the SiNSs were determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL-2100C, JEOL Ltd.) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. To investigate the microstructures and degrees of crystallinity of the SiNS samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Coventry, UK) were performed using Cu–K<sub>α</sub> radiation (<italic>λ</italic>=1.5418 Å); Raman spectroscopy (alpha300R confocal microscope, WlTec, Ulm, Germany) was also employed for this purpose. The pore sizes and surface areas were characterized using a surface area and pore size analyzer (BELSORP-mini II, MicrotracBEL, Osaka, Japan) at 77 K for P/P<sub>0</sub> of 0.05–0.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Fishers K-alpha, Grange, UK) was used to perform surface elemental analyses. Further, the elemental components were confirmed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ELAN DRC-II, PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA). The thickness of the sheets of the SiNS-650 sample was measured using an atomic force microscopy system (Nanoscope III, Digital Instruments, Tonawanda, NY, USA) in the tapping mode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title><p id="Par13">The light-induced hydrogen production was estimated in an Ar-saturated aqueous solution containing methanol (10 vol%, 100 ml) as a hole scavenger. The water/methanol mixture was purged with Ar for 2 h, and 0.1 g of the Si photocatalyst being tested was added in a closed Pyrex glass vessel (~193.5 ml). The photocatalytic water-reduction reaction was performed under ambient conditions using a Xe lamp (300 W, Oriel, Irvine, CA, USA) equipped with an optical ultraviolet (UV) cut-off filter (<italic>λ</italic>⩾400 nm) as a light source, with the mixture being subjected to mild stirring. Using Ar as the carrier gas, the amount of evolved H<sub>2</sub> gas was detected by a gas chromatography (GC) system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (HP 7890, molecular sieve 5 Å column, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To evaluate the long-term stability, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests were performed for three cycles of 6 h each, with the light turned off in the interval for 2 h with Ar pulsing to remove the hydrogen produced in the previous cycle. The time-profiled hydrogen production from the stoichiometric etching of Si using KOH was also measured using gas chromatography. All the chemical reactions were performed in a 190 ml glass flask with a tightly fitted rubber septum. The hydrogen production tests were repeated at least 10 times using a 1 <sc>M</sc> aqueous KOH solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>EIS measurements</title><p id="Par14">Electrodes of the four types of Si materials were fabricated by spreading a slurry mixture of the Si nanomaterial in question, polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt% in <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, Sigma-Aldrich) and super P carbon black (weight ratio of 80:10:10) on a piece of Cu foil. The slurry was mixed with a mixer (ARE310, Thinky, Laguna Hills, CA, USA) at a high speed (2000 r.p.m.) for 10 min to ensure a homogeneous blend.

When the temperature of the system approaches the melting point of Mg, solid Mg powders begin to be vaporized and adsorbed to the surface of adjacent clay minerals. Initially, Mg can react only on the exterior of the clay minerals. As the reaction proceeds, exothermic heat generated from the reduction reaction is transferred to the metal salt (NaCl), which becomes molten. The activated molten salt can easily be intercalated into alkylamine-containing clays. Accordingly, Mg reacts with the interior surface of the clay. Heat generated from the interior space would accelerate the exfoliation of clays to produce the SiNSs evenly reduced from the clays. Preferentially, we conducted a careful investigation on the clay mineral.

As expected, the magnesiothermic reaction generated a large amount of exothermic heat. Metal salts (for example, NaCl, KCl, and MgCl<sub>2</sub>) with a high melting point can be used as heat scavengers to reduce the exothermic heat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> NaCl was used as the metal salt in this system on the basis of the following criteria: (i) the melting point of NaCl (801 °C) is much higher than the melting temperature of the metal reductant used (Mg=650 °C), and (ii) MMT clay contains Na<sup>+</sup> cations and a small amount of alkylamines, which are exchangeable with NaCl. If the metal salt used has a lower melting point than the metal reductant used, the salt will not be able to function as a heat scavenger. The clay sample is covered completely with an excess amount of the salt before the chemical reduction process starts. From the viewpoint of the cation-exchange process, monovalent cations with a smaller size can penetrate more readily into the highly ordered interlayers of the clay. For these reasons, NaCl is the most suitable metal salt for penetrating the clay gallery and reducing the amount of exothermic heat generated during the chemical reduction reaction.</p><p id="Par18">When the MMT clay sample was reacted with Mg vapor at 650 °C for 5 h in the presence of NaCl as the heat scavenger (weight ratio of clay/Mg/NaCl=1:0.7:3) and subsequently rinsed with concentrated HCl, ultrathin SiNSs (referred to as SiNS-650) were obtained. As shown in the SEM image in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, SiNS-650 exhibited a 2D nanosheet structure and did not show significant aggregation when compared with bare clay. Although SiNS-650 appeared to be stacked and aggregated, the frame size of the sheets was greatly reduced from a macroscopic perspective. In addition, SiNS-650 had a size on the order of tens of micrometers, attributable to the reconstruction of the Si crystal structure from the silica and/or silicates. The by-product MgO, which was formed by the reaction between Mg and the oxygen in the silica/silicates, was removed completely by the HCl leaching process.

However, as the reaction temperature decreases to lower than the melting temperature of Mg, the metal salt (NaCl) has a higher priority in the reaction sequence. In other words, the metal salt covers almost the entire surface of the clay sample before the chemical reduction can start. Then, the partially vaporized Mg reacts preferentially with the exposed clay surface. However, the reaction temperature is not sufficient to reduce the entire clay sample. Consequently, the degrees of exfoliation and chemical reduction are lowered, and the resulting products contain a large amount of oxygen (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). SiNS-550, which was synthesized at a low temperature, contained sponge-like structures with a broad pore size distribution (average pore size of 9.02 nm) in the less-aggregated state (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3b and c</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">During the chemical reduction reaction, a large amount of thermal energy is transferred to the exfoliated clay, with the intercalation of the metal salt into the clay gallery occurring simultaneously. If either of these two processes does not take place, then exfoliation does not occur. From this perspective, the SEM image of SiNS-700 in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref> shows that exfoliation occurred successfully. In contrast to SiNS-550 and SiNS-650, SiNS-700 exhibited a large number of nanopores (average pore size of 12.18 nm), thicker sheets (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>) and higher crystallinity (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3f and g</xref>). Although the exfoliation of the clay sample and the chemical reduction reaction are synchronous processes, the release of an excess amount of thermal energy owing to the high reaction temperature causes aggregation, partial structural collapse and high crystallinity. Thus, the SiNS-700 was much larger, both microscopically (crystallite size of ~45 nm, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>) and macroscopically (sheet dimension of 2–7 μm); this was consistent with the crystal size (43 nm) estimated from the XRD analysis (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). These temperature-dependent variations in the sample structures (that is, degree of exfoliation) and reactivities (that is, degree of chemical reduction) are in line with the observations of the BET-specific surface areas and the BJH pore-size distributions (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). In the case of SiNS-550, the MMT clay was not converted completely into pure SiNS. As a result, sponge-like structures with a low BET surface area (215 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) were formed. In contrast, SiNS-700 contained a larger number of macropores, which caused it to have the lowest BET surface area (170 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p id="Par23">Further, we investigated the effects of the amount of salt used on the morphologies of the SiNSs at a fixed reaction temperature (650 °C) (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figures S6A–S6D</xref>). The introduction of even a small amount of the metal salt (weight ratio of clay/Mg/NaCl=1:0.7:0.5) during the chemical reduction process induced the exfoliation of the clay, resulting in the successful synthesis of the SiNSs. However, an upper limit exists for the amount of NaCl that can be used (weight ratio of clay/Mg/NaCl=1:0.7:5) because the salt can hinder the chemical reduction process as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figures S6E and S6F</xref>. When the amount of NaCl used was varied while keeping the other conditions constant, including the reaction temperature (650 °C) and reaction time (3 h), the porosity of the SiNS formed was not affected significantly (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S6E</xref>). In addition, other variables such as the batch size and reaction time did not have a significant effect on the morphology and porosity of the SiNSs (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">All the SiNS samples (SiNS-550, SiNS-650 and SiNS-700) exhibited similar light-absorbing properties, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>.

All the SiNS samples exhibited hydrogen evolution rates significantly higher than the hydrogen evolution rates of commercial SiNPs (153 μmol H<sub>2</sub> per h per g Si) for the same conditions. Of the various SiNS samples, the photocatalytic activity of SiNS-650 was the highest. This photocatalytic activity can be explained by the fact that (i) SiNS-650 consisted of ultrathin sheets (thickness of ~5 nm), which allowed for greater access for the reactants, (ii) SiNS-650 had a high specific surface area, which maximized the number of active sites, and (iii) SiNS-650 had a high crystallinity, which resulted in the effective separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. In contrast, the low crystallinity and incomplete reduction of SiNS-550 caused it to have poorer hydrogen evolution performance.

Thus, mesoporous SiNPs were also prepared via a typical metal-assisted chemical etching process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Unlike the morphology of pristine SiNP (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>), mesoporous SiNPs as prepared have numerous mesopores on the surface (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S13A</xref>). However, BET analysis (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>) does not manifest a clear difference in surface area (both BET surface areas before and after etching were ~80 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>). Thus, the SiNPs, which are of a size &lt;50 nm, are quickly etched out at an early stage of the etching process. Unlike the pristine SiNPs, the pore size distribution shows the clear generation of mesopores centered at ~10 nm. When the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of prepared mesoporous SiNPs is measured under the same conditions, its hydrogen production rate is remarkably increased to 356 μmol H<sub>2</sub> per h per g Si (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>), which is comparable to the SiNS-650’s value. However, SiNS-650 has the morphology of an ultrathin sheet, which brings easy accessibility to the electrolyte along with a large number of active sites, resulting in highly superior photocatalytic activity compared with SiNPs.</p><p id="Par31">This logical aspect was further verified through potentiostatic EIS measurements using the same amounts of the active materials. The electrodes of the Si materials were held at 0 V<sub>RHE</sub>, which was assumed to be the theoretical potential for the evolution of hydrogen under dark conditions. The Nyquist plots of the Si electrodes are shown in SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>. The impedance value of the SiNPs was greater than the impedance value of SiNS-650, indicating that the former had a larger resistance or fewer active sites. For further analysis, the EIS data were fitted using a simple equivalent circuit (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> value, that is, the left convergence point in the Nyquist plot, represents the sheet resistance of a half-cell test system. The values of the charge-transfer resistance and the constant phase element (<italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>/CPE) are related to the properties of the catalysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> In the case of SiNS-650, <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> was significantly lower (by a factor of ~4.5) than the <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> of the SiNPs, while CPE was higher by a factor of ~6.7. The higher CPE value of SiNS-650, which was indicative of an imperfect capacitor, suggests an increase in surface heterogeneity and roughness, among other things.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> The actual active surface area of a catalyst can be qualitatively determined from the double-layer capacitance in a pure supporting electrolyte. The unique properties of SiNS-650, such as the presence of ultrafine pores and the desirable shape, which maximized contact with the electrolyte, were responsible for the high CPE value. This result is consistent with the high hydrogen production rate during the KOH etching of Si (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>). Because hydrogen is generated from a stoichiometric reaction between KOH and the Si surface, the differences in the KOH etching rates are directly related to the differences in the active surface areas. The significantly higher hydrogen production rate of SiNS-650 (15.83 mmol H<sub>2</sub> s<sup>−1</sup> Si mol<sup>−1</sup>) relative to the hydrogen production rate of the SiNPs (7.5 mmol H<sub>2</sub> s<sup>−1</sup> Si mol<sup>−1</sup>) could be explained on the basis of the differences in the surface morphologies and surface-to-volume ratios of the two catalysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> In addition, because the crystallinity of SiNS-650 was higher than the crystallinity of the SiNPs (as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>), a greater number of the photoderived electron–hole pairs were generated in the former case, with their separation and migration also being easier, owing to the lower <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> In general, the <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> value of a catalyst depends on the state of the catalyst. Low crystallinity and the presence of a large number of defect sites inhibit electron transfer and facilitate the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Further, the PL spectrum of the SiNPs showed an asymmetric and broad emission peak, indicating the presence of defect sites, which suppress charge transfer and separation as trap sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>; this peak was not observed in the case of SiNS-650 (SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM15">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>). The symmetric and narrow PL spectrum of SiNS-650 is owed to the presence of fewer defect sites, as well as its high crystallinity, as was also indicated by its low <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> value. On the basis of these facts, the reasons that the SiNS sample exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activity compared to the SiNPs could be considered as follows: (i) the novel 2D sheet structure of the SiNS maximizes contact with the electrolyte, (ii) the large active surface area and mesopores allow easy access for the reactant, and (iii) the high crystallinity of Si and the presence of few defect sites promote the transfer/separation of photogenerated charge carriers and prevent their recombination.</p><p id="Par32">In summary, the synthesized SiNSs are an attractive photocatalyst for water reduction and can be used for the photoassisted splitting of water in combination with other promising water oxidation photocatalysts (such as BiVO<sub>4</sub>, TaON and other n-type semiconductors) using the Z-scheme system. Furthermore, because of the abundance of the raw materials, the low fabrication cost and excellent hydrogen production performance, SiNSs have great potential for use as a photocathode material that compares favorably with other top–down-processed Si materials for PEC water-splitting systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JSL was supported by the Korean Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (NRF-2011-C1AAA0001–2011–0030278), which is funded by MISIP, and through Project No. 10050509 of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea.
