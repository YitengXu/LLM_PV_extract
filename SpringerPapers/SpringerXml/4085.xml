However, most microbes lack photoactive proteins and require synthetic photosensitizers that suffer from photocorrosion, photodegradation, cytotoxicity, and generation of photoexcited radicals that are harmful to cells, thus severely limiting the catalytic performance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for biocompatible photoconductive materials for efficient electronic interface between microbes and electrodes. Here we show that living biofilms of <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic> use nanowires of cytochrome OmcS as intrinsic photoconductors. Photoconductive atomic force microscopy shows up to 100-fold increase in photocurrent in purified individual nanowires. Photocurrents respond rapidly (&lt;100 ms) to the excitation and persist reversibly for hours. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum dynamics simulations reveal ultrafast (~200 fs) electron transfer between nanowire hemes upon photoexcitation, enhancing carrier density and mobility. Our work reveals a new class of natural photoconductors for whole-cell catalysis.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Despite enormous potential of solar-driven biocatalysis, most living systems lack photoactive proteins and require toxic and expensive synthetic materials limiting the performance.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Living cells have been incorporated with quantum dots and nanostructures for fluorescent labelling and drug delivery for over two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, light-absorbing nanostructures have not been used to drive catalytic reactions inside of cells due to lack of biocompatibility and high cytotoxicity of foreign materials, such as photosensitizers, inside the cell which often limits the operational efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, inherent defects in synthetic photosensitizers cause several problems such as photocorrosion, photodegradation and the generation of photoexcited radicals, which results in low stability, irreproducibility and lack of sustainability of biohybrid materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Some bacteria produce light-absorbing centers but suffer from low electron transfer efficiency and a lack of durability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Natural electron transfer proteins such as azurins, myoglobin and c-type cytochromes do not show photoconductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> due to picosecond carrier lifetimes of the heme iron which typically inhibits any charge separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Covalently linking artificial photosensitizers to these proteins yields low electron transfer rate on the 10 ns timescale or slower, greatly limiting their applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is not feasible to use longer excited state lifetimes, such as electron injection from the triplet states due to rapid degradation caused by reactive oxygen species produced in these processes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel biomaterials capable of ultrafast primary electron transfer to achieve efficient charge separation, followed by sequential secondary electron transfer for long-lived charge separation and charge accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To evaluate the use of engineered living materials as living photoconductors, we chose the electroactive soil organism <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic> because it has evolved the ability to export electrons, derived from metabolism, to extracellular acceptors such as metal oxides and electrodes in a process called extracellular electron transfer (EET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Bacteria establish direct electrical contact to electron acceptors via micrometer-long, polymerized cytochrome nanowires, called OmcS, which eliminates the need for diffusive redox mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Hemes in the OmcS nanowire form a parallel, slipped-stacked pair with each pair perpendicular (T-stacked) to the next pair, forming a continuous chain over the entire micrometer length of the nanowire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). The minimum edge-to-edge distances is 3.4–4.1 Å between the parallel-stacked hemes and 5.4–6.1 Å between the T-stacked pairs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Living photoconductors.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Measurement schematic.

We further analyzed the possibility that surrounding protein causes the observed photoreduction of OmcS hemes. Several aromatic amino acids, including tryptophan and tyrosine, are within 5 Å of the hemes in the OmcS. Although excitation of either tryptophan or tyrosine is not possible at the wavelengths used in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, we considered a possibility that electron transfer can quench a photoexcited heme in a manner similar to flavins in a cryptochrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

The most likely amino acid candidate for radical formation is tryptophan because its radicals have absorbance which would explain the 367 nm species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. While the formation of such radicals is possible, the signal strength in fs-TA measurements is determined by the molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the (transient) species.

Therefore, the number of tryptophan radicals created from electron transfer needs to be larger than the number of excited hemes in OmcS if the radical species at λ = 367 nm arises from tryptophan.

This model is focused on the singlet states and not triplet states because these states are spectroscopically dark, and would be less pronounced due to their lower energies. As these nanowires transport charges through seamless stacking of hemes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), our prior experiments have shown that they can be treated as redox conductors, with the long-range charge transfer governed by a theoretically-predicted hopping mechanism with negligible carrier loss over micrometers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. All hemes in the nanowires are initially oxidized and in their ground state as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Upon applying a bias, electrons are injected from the electrode into the nanowire, creating a reduced state that travels through the nanowire (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The photoexcitation triggers an ultrafast charge transfer resulting in an additional reduced state that persists for picosecond timescale, without any applied bias, far away from the electrode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This newly formed reduced state will have a mobility similar to the electrode-injected state as they both are present in the same nanowire with identical structure. Therefore, upon photoexcitation, the density of reduced states is increased, thus increasing the carrier density of the OmcS to generate photoconductivity in nanowires. The photoreduction observed in our fs-TA is consistent with this model.</p><p id="Par28">In addition to the higher carrier density due to photogenerated electrons, it is likely that the mobility of electrons increases upon photoexcitation due to increased driving force for charge transfer in the excited state of hemes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Upon photoexcitation an electron is promoted from the ground state to an excited state.

The OmcS nanowires transport charges via a hopping mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>—a process in which a charge (electron or hole) temporarily resides at a heme, changing its redox state. The driving force for charge transfer depends on the redox energies of the electron donating and accepting hemes. Therefore, the charge transfer rate is directly related to the mobility.</p><p id="Par30">For the fully oxidized (non-excited) state, this process initiates at the electrode surface where injected electrons hop to nanowire redox sites, creating locally reduced hemes. For the photoexcited state, this process is enhanced because transferring an electron to the double-oxidized species, and removing an electron from a reduced heme, are significantly more favorable in the illuminated nanowire than for the oxidized nanowire in the dark. The increased likelihood for charge transfer upon photoexcitation will then result in increased mobility. Furthermore, the initial ultrafast charge transfer between hemes increases the lifetime of the photogenerated state. Both the generation of a “new” mobile charge and the increase in its mobility will contribute to the observed increase in conductivity upon photoexcitation.</p><p id="Par31">In summary, we demonstrate, for the first-time, significant photoconductivity in a living system due to ultrafast light-induced charge transfer within protein nanowires. The surprising origin of photoconductivity in these natural systems lies in the higher carrier density and mobility upon photoexcitation.</p><p id="Par32">Although ultrafast electron transfer can occur in monomeric cytochromes, it typically requires incorporated dyes as photosensitizers and sacrificial electron donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> which can be toxic to cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In contrast, we find that the protein nanowires intrinsically exhibit robust and ultrafast charge transfer without any need for such site-selective labeling. Our studies thus establish OmcS nanowires as photoconductors intrinsic to cells with capability of ultrafast electron transfer, thus eliminating the need for foreign materials such as molecular dyes or inorganic nanoparticles that limit the catalytic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">Furthermore, our studies show that sub-ps charge transfer is possible in natural proteins in an excited state. Prior ultrafast electron transfer studies have reported the ground state rates of 15–90 ps in the closest-stacked hemes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This difference is likely because excited-state rates are known to be faster due to higher energy and larger orbital delocalization compared to the ground-state rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">Although many bacterial EET studies remain focused on electrons, protons play a very important role, not only in bacterial energy generation, but also in the electronic conductivity of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. For example, through measurements of the intrinsic electron transfer rate, we previously found that both the energetics of a glutamine (proton acceptor) and its proximity to a neighboring tyrosine (proton donor), regulate the hole transport over micrometers in amyloids through a proton rocking mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is very important to couple electron/proton transfer to accelerate EET and for the development of electronically conductive protein-based biomaterials.</p><p id="Par35">The high surface area of these nanowires, combined with their biocompatibility and lack of toxicity, make them attractive candidates for an emerging field of light-driven whole-cell bioelectrocatalysis for a wide range of applications such as water splitting, chemical sensing and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and production of chemicals, fuels and materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

For nanowires, a quartz slide was cleaned with ethanol and 2 µl of 80 µM protein was dropped on this slide and then dried for 20 min in the desiccator. Another 2 µl was dropped on the same spot and again dried in the desiccator for 20 min. The spectrum was collected for the air oxidized sample. Then 40 mg/ml of sodium dithionite in water was dropped to cover the protein spot (2–3 µl). The dithionite caused a chemical reduction of the hemes in the protein. The spectrum of the reduced material was then recorded. All spectra were normalized such that the minimum and maximum absorbance values for wavelengths above 380 nm were set to zero and 1, respectively. The biofilm solid state measurements were taken on a FTO electrode in hydrating conditions with the background of a clean FTO electrode subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Electrode fabrication</title><p id="Par38">Three different types of electrodes, based on gold (Au), Tungsten (W) and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), were used. The designs consisted of interdigitated electrodes, which create a “finger” pattern in which every odd-numbered line is connected to one pad, and every even numbered to the opposite electrical contact. This dense electrode packing ensures a large number of electronic contacts. The measured data are averaging over 132 wire connection pairs and provides superior signal compared to a single electrode device.</p><p id="Par39">For the gold-electrodes, the spacing between each line was 5 µm, and for the tungsten and FTO-electrodes, the spacing was 10 µm. For all cases, the electrode (the metalized part) was 10 µm wide.</p><p id="Par40">The gold and tungsten electrodes were fabricated using UV-Lithography on thermally oxidized Silicon wafer. The thermal oxidation created a 300 nm silicon oxide layer which provides a plain and electrically insulating substrate. The metal electrodes were fabricated by spin coating a double resist, consisting of LOR 5-A and S1805. LOR 5-A was coated at 3000 rpm for 1 min followed by 5 min heating at 180 °C. Following this baking step, a second resist layer S1805 was applied at 3000 rpm for 1 min and cured at 120 °C for 2 min. Afterwards, the resists were exposed to UV radiation through a shadowmask and developed in MIF 319 developer for 2 minutes. The structured photoresists were then metalized using 5 nm Ti or Cr and 40–60 nm Au or W. A lift-off in heated (80–120 °C) NMP removed the metalized resists and resulted in the final microstructure electrode. A protection coating was then spin coated onto the device. This coating was washed off with acetone before using the electrode. Each electrode was tested prior to protein deposition to ensure proper electric insulation between the two electrodes.</p><p id="Par41">For the FTO IDE electrodes, commercially available FTO on Quartz glass was used. S1805 resist was spin coated and structured as previously described. After structuring this resist was used as a soft mask in reactive ion etching. The etching was carried out in an Oxford Plasmalab 100 RIE with a chamber pressure of 8 mTorr, and a gas flow of 8 sccm Cl<sub>2</sub> and 40 sccm Ar. The etching was carried out until the unwanted FTO was completely removed. The remaining photoresist was cleaned off in hot NMP (120 °C) and the final devices was covered with protective coating.

Connections to device electrodes were made with a probe station (MPI TS50) inside a Dark Box which formed a Faraday cage and also blocked background light. Current and voltage were applied using a semiconductor parameter analyzer with preamplifiers (Keithley 4200 A-SCS) allowing for 1 fA current and 0.5 μV voltage resolution. Two-point DC conductance measurements utilized two probe needles to contact the device on two adjacent electrodes. A fixed voltage in the range of ±0.3 V was applied to the two electrodes for a minimum of 100 s in sampling mode until a steady current was reached. Voltage-current points were fit with a line, and the slope was used to determine conductance (G).</p><p id="Par43">Devices were prepared by dropping 0.5 µL of 8 µM nanowires in 150 mM ethanolamine pH 10.5 on to the device and let dry in ambient atmosphere overnight. The drop formed on the material had a diameter of 1.4 ± 0.1 mm. The electrode area was 2 × 2 mm, which ensured that all the material was electrically contacted.</p><p id="Par44">To perform photoconductivity measurements, the previously described probe station was equipped with a diode laser, with an average output flux of 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and a center wavelength of 408 nm. This laser spot was adjusted to be larger than the electrode area which ensured a homogenous excitation of the material. The laser beam was blocked/released using an optical shutter with a 1 ms response time.</p><p id="Par45">Conductance measurements on reduced nanowires was performed by mixing 0.25 µL of a concentrated solution of sodium dithionite with 9.75 µL of nanowires in an anaerobic environment such that there was 50-fold molar excess of dithionite to heme concentration in the final solution. 0.5 µL was dropped onto an electrode and dried in the anaerobic chamber overnight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Transient Absorption (TA) Data Collection</title><p id="Par46">The transient absorption spectra were collected at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), part of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Further data was collected at Drexel University. The signal to noise ratio of the commercial CFN spectrometer was superior to the data from Drexel, hence the data collected at Drexel were solely used in the supplement of this manuscript. The detailed description refers to the data collection at CFN.</p><p id="Par47">The TA spectra were collected using a Helios (Ultrafast Systems) TA spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was generated in a TOPAS OPA. The probe pulse was generated via supercontinuum in calcium fluoride.</p><p id="Par48">For each measurement, spatial overlap was optimized for strongest signal. Each set of data was iterated for several hours. Each iteration was then compared to the mean of the iteration to ensure long-time stability of the spectrometer and the sample material.</p><p id="Par49">The sample was prepared by drop casting 5 µl of protein solution onto a freshly cleaned quartz substrate. The samples were allowed to dry for 60 minutes in a desiccator. This deposition was repeated to create thicker films. Based on the optical transmission a location on the sample with sufficient Soret band absorption and acceptable scattering was chosen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Transient Absorption (TA) Data Processing</title><p id="Par50">The collected TA spectra were processed using three softwares: Surface Xplorer (Ultrafast Systems), MATLAB, and Glotaran. Surface Xplorer was used to visualize the data and select measurements with adequate signal to noise. This selection reduced the number of processed spectra to 15. Of these measurements seven were pumped at 545 nm (shown in the main text) four pumped at 530 nm (shown in SI) and four pumped at 400 nm (shown in SI). All these measurements were evaluated to determine kinetics and dynamics of the spectral evolution. The main evaluation was performed for a pump wavelength of 545 nm, as this was depositing the lowest energy and therefore heating into the sample material. The other two wavelength confirmed the determined kinetics.</p><p id="Par51">Surface Xplorer was used to compensate for spectral chirp associate with wavelength dependent dispersion in the used sample and the quartz substrate. This correction ensured that the time zero point was independent of the wavelength. After this initial processing, the measured 1024 wavelength points were adjacent averaged to 512 points, resulting in a wavelength resolution of approximately 1 nm.</p><p id="Par52">The preprocessed data were then imported into the MATLAB. Six measurements at 545 nm pump were averaged into a single set (after accounting for time-zero jitter). These data sets are shown in the main text. The dynamics at 410 nm, 367 nm, and 424 nm was simultaneously fitted with a double exponential function convoluted with the instrument responds function and an instantaneous injection model as Heaviside function. The lifetimes from this simple three wavelength dynamic fit are used as starting points for the detailed target analysis using Glotaran.</p><p id="Par53">The preprocessed data (from the Surface Xplorer data processing) were then loaded into Glotaran and truncated to −2 ps to infinity in time and 340-505 nm in the wavelength space. This software was used for global analysis. The model assumes a global decay dynamic defined by a fixed number of decay constants. Based on our model we decided that a sequential analysis is best suited to describe the processes in photoexcited OmcS.</p><p id="Par54">The sequential model, however, cannot directly separate the individual species from the ground state bleach of the main species. This is caused by the temporal overlap between the decays and the parallel decay into the ground state from the excited heme species which is not completely undergoing a charge separation step.</p><p id="Par55">The sequential model assumes an excitation, which fitted to 19 ± 23 fs. This is faster than the instrument responds function of 100 ± 10 fs. The excitation can therefore be considered to be instantaneous (justifying the used Heaviside approximation in the preliminary analysis in MATLAB). Following the excitation, the charges are transferred from one heme to another within 212 ± 27 fs. The corresponding spectra are a superposition of a ground state bleach and the appearance of a new feature around 367 nm, which is identified as a double oxidized heme (according to the presented spectral simulation). This charge transfer results in the formation of a reduced heme in the excited state. A second decay with a time constant of 1 ± 0.1 ps describes the relaxation of the excited reduced heme. A final third time constant with 7.9 ± 0.3 ps describes the relaxation of the system to its initial state, including charge back transfer to the single oxidized heme ground state.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Photoconductive AFM (pc-AFM)</title><p id="Par56">Topography and electrical conductivity of nanowires on the gold surface were both measured using conventional tapping (AC) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM, ORCA™) measurement modes with a commercially available AFM (Cypher ES, Oxford Instruments Asylum Research, USA) equipped with blueDrive™ photothermal excitation. The probe was a commercially available ASYELEC-01-R2 probe (Asylum Research) with Ti/Ir coating and nominal resonant frequency <italic>f</italic> = 75 kHz, spring constant <italic>k</italic> = 2.8 N/m, and tip radius <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>tip</italic></sub> = 28 ± 10 nm; measured values were <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> = 86.6 kHz and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> = 5.8 N/m for the specific probe used in these measurements. In order to bias the sample, a small neodymium magnet (1/32” x 1/16” diam., K&amp;J Magnetics) was both adhered and electrically contacted to the top surface of the nanowires-on-gold sample using silver paint (PELCO® Leitsilber, Ted Pella).</p><p id="Par57">For tapping mode topography, the probe was driven with piezo actuation at a scan rate of 1 line/s, a free amplitude of 120 nm (0.58 V at a sensitivity of 207 nm/V), and a ~100 nm setpoint (0.5 V) to keep the tip-sample interaction very gentle in the so-called “attractive” or “non-contact” state to avoid damaging the nanowires.</p><p id="Par58">Following the topographical scan, cAFM was used with a force setpoint of 50 nN to execute point I-V measurements on individual nanowires to measure their conductivity (<italic>n</italic> = 15 nanowires), with a sample voltage sweep of ±0.5 V at 1 V/s sweep rate for 20 sweep cycles at 2 kHz acquisition rate (1 kHz lowpass filter). The additional effects of photoexcitation on nanowire conductivity were examined by toggling the blueDrive™ laser as the excitation source (405 nm, 10 mW DC, with a spot diameter of 2 ± 1 µm) on at least 20 sequential I-V sweeps. This was accomplished using the provided 0.01X filter cube (Asylum Research) and positioning the laser spot at the very apex of the probe tip (rather than using it as the probe oscillatory excitation); this provides [10e-3 W]/[π*(1e-6 m)<sup>2</sup>]*0.01 = 32 µW/µm<sup>2</sup> illumination on the nanowires.</p><p id="Par59">For control experiments in these pc-AFM measurements, a fresh template stripped gold sample (identical to the surface that the nanowires were deposited on) was also prepared with an electrical contact as above.

As a negative control for photoconductive measurements, the tip-gold conductivity was measured at the same conditions (50 nN loading force, ±0.5 V at 1 V/s, 20 cycles) with the blueDrive excitation sequentially toggled on and off to confirm that there was no change in tip-gold conductivity from the 405 nm excitation in the absence of nanowires.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>pc-AFM data analysis</title><p id="Par60">At each collection point on an individual nanowire, at least 20 IV curves were collected. The last half of all the current voltage curves collected (minimum 10 curves) at a single point were used to calculate conductance. The IV curves were then sorted by nanowire and the slope of each curve was measured to get the conductance. For all nanowires, any outliers in conductance were removed by three median absolution deviation analysis on the log<sub>10</sub> of conductance. All the remaining individual conductance values for each nanowire were averaged to get the mean conductance of the single nanowire. The analysis for the laser OFF and laser ON current voltage curves was identical.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Laser characterization</title><p id="Par61">When interpreting photoexcitation experiments it is crucial to verify whether the experiment was performed in a linear or non-linear excitation regime. In the later the photoexcitation would be strong enough to trigger non-linear effects (i.e., saturable absorption) or cause electron-electron interaction (e-e scattering, Auger-effect, etc.). These effects would make a conclusive discussion of the experiments more challenging. In the linear regime, only a small percentage of molecules is excited, while the majority remains in their ground state. While there is no ultimate threshold for the linear vs non-linear regime, it is common to accept less than 1% excitation as linear.</p><p id="Par62">We calculated the percentage excitations based on the known optical power density 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the total lifetime of the photoexcited system (τ = 7.9 ps).
