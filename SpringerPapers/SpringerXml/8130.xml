For this purpose, DUNE is optimised for the measurement of weak gravitational lensing but will also provide complementary measurements of baryonic accoustic oscillations, cluster counts and the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect. Immediate auxiliary goals concern the evolution of galaxies, to be studied with unequalled statistical power, the detailed structure of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and the demographics of Earth-mass planets. DUNE is an Medium-class mission which makes use of readily available components, heritage from other missions, and synergy with ground based facilities to minimise cost and risks. The payload consists of a 1.2 m telescope with a combined visible/NIR field-of-view of 1 deg<sup>2</sup>. DUNE will carry out an all-sky survey, ranging from 550 to 1600 nm, in one visible and three NIR bands which will form a unique legacy for astronomy. DUNE will yield major advances in a broad range of fields in astrophysics including fundamental cosmology, galaxy evolution, and extrasolar planet search. DUNE was recently selected by ESA as one of the mission concepts to be studied in its Cosmic Vision programme.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cosmology</kwd><kwd>Dark energy</kwd><kwd>Dark matter</kwd><kwd>Legacy survey</kwd><kwd>Wide field imager</kwd><kwd>Visible and near infra-red</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2007</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2009</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2008</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/10686_2008_Article_9106.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2009</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2009</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Astronomy, Observations and Techniques</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>The DUNE collaboration</p></notes><notes notes-type="Misc"><p><bold>Co-investigators:</bold> A.

Cosmologists have agreed on a standard model that matches a wide range of astronomical data (eg. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). However, this ΛCDM concordance model relies on three ingredients whose origin and nature are unknown: dark matter, dark energy and fundamental fields driving a period of inflation, during which density fluctuations are imprinted on the Universe. All these elements of the model represent new aspects of fundamental physics, which can best be studied via astronomy. The nature of the dark energy, which now comprises the bulk of the mass-energy budget of the Universe, will determine the ultimate fate of the Universe and is among the deepest questions in physics.</p><p>The most powerful tool that can be brought to bear on these problems is weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies; this forms the core of the DUNE mission.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Gravitational deflection of light by intervening dark matter concentrations causes the images of background galaxies to acquire an additional ellipticity of order of a percent, which is correlated over scales of tens of arcminutes. Measuring this signature probes the expansion history in two complementary ways: (1) geometrically, through the distance-redshift relation, and (2) dynamically, through the growth rate of density fluctuations in the Universe.</p><p>Utilisation of these cosmological probes relies on the measurement of image shapes and redshifts for several billion galaxies. The measurement of galaxy shapes for weak lensing imposes tight requirements on the image quality which can only be met in the absence of atmospheric phase errors and in the thermally stable environment of space. For this number of galaxies, distances must be estimated using photometric redshifts, involving photometry measurements over a wide wavelength range in the visible and near-IR. The necessary visible galaxy colour data can be obtained from the ground, using current or upcoming instruments, complementing the unique image quality of space for the measurement of image distortions. However, at wavelengths beyond 1 <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Combining these independent cosmological probes, DUNE will tackle the following questions: What are the dynamics of dark energy? What are the physical characteristics of the dark matter? What are the seeds of structure formation and how did structure grow? Is Einstein’s theory of general relativity the correct theory of gravity?</p><p>DUNE will combine its unique space-borne observation with existing and planned ground-based surveys, and hence increases the science return of the mission while limiting costs and risks. The panoramic visible and NIR surveys required by DUNE’s primary science goals will afford unequalled sensitivity and survey area for the study of galaxy evolution and its relationship with the distribution of the dark matter, the discovery of high redshift objects, and of the physical drivers of star formation. Additional surveys at low galactic latitudes will provide a unique census of the Galactic plane and earth-mass exoplanets at distances of 0.5–5 AU from their host star using the microlensing technique. These DUNE surveys will provide a unique all-sky map in the visible and NIR and thus complement other space missions such as Planck, WMAP, eROSITA, JWST, and WISE. The following describes the science objectives, instrument concept and mission profile (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for a baseline summary).

Its aims are twofold: first study dark energy and measure its equation of state parameter <italic>w</italic> (see definition below) and its evolution with a precision of 2% and 10% respectively, using both expansion history and structure growth, second explore the nature of dark matter by testing the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm and by measuring precisely the sum of the neutrino masses. At the same time, it will test the validity of Einstein’s theory of gravity. In addition, DUNE will investigate how galaxies form, survey all Milky-Way-like galaxies in the 2<italic>π</italic> extra-galactic sky out to <italic>z</italic> ~ 2 and detect thousands of galaxies and AGN at 6 &lt; <italic>z</italic> &lt; 12. It will provide a detailed visible/NIR map of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies and provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses above 0.1 Earth mass and orbits greater than 0.5 AU.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Understanding dark energy</title><p>A variety of independent observations overwhelmingly indicate that the cosmological expansion began to accelerate when the Universe was around half of its present age. Presuming the correctness of general relativity this requires a new energy component known as dark energy. The simplest case would be Einstein’s cosmological constant (<italic>Λ</italic>), in which the dark energy density would be exactly homogeneous and independent of time. However, the description of vacuum energy from current particle physics concepts conflicts by 120 orders of magnitude with the observed value, and the discrepancy is still not understood. Cosmologists are thus strongly motivated to consider models of a dynamical dark energy, or even to contemplate modifications to general relativity. Explaining dark energy may well require a radical change in our understanding of Quantum Theory or Gravity, or both. One of the major aims of DUNE is to determine empirically which of these alternatives is to be preferred. The properties of dark energy can be quantified by considering its equation of state parameter <italic>w</italic> = <italic>p</italic>/<italic>ρc</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>p</italic> and <italic>ρ</italic> are its effective pressure and density. Unlike matter, dark energy has the remarkable property of having negative pressure (<italic>w</italic> &lt; 0) and thus of driving the Universe into a period of accelerated expansion (if <italic>w</italic> &lt; − 1/3). The latter began relatively recently, around <italic>z</italic> ≤ 1. If the dark energy resembles a cosmological constant (<italic>w</italic> = − 1), it can only be directly probed in the low-redshift Universe (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This expansion history can be measured in two distinct ways (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): (1) the distance-redshift relation <italic>D</italic>(<italic>z</italic>); (2) the growth of structure (i.e. galaxies and clusters of galaxies). The <italic>D</italic>(<italic>z</italic>) relation can be probed geometrically using ‘standard candles’ such as supernovae, or via measures of the angular diameter distance from gravitational lensing or from the “standard rod” of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The accelerated expansion slows down the gravitational growth of density fluctuations; this growth of structure can be probed by comparing the amplitude of structure today relative to that when the CMB was formed. Many models for dark energy and modifications to gravity have been proposed in which the equation of state parameter <italic>w</italic> vary with time. A convenient approximation is a linear dependence on the scale factor <italic>a</italic> = 1/(1 + <italic>z</italic>): <italic>w</italic>(<italic>a</italic>) = <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> + (<italic>a</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> − <italic>a</italic>)<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, where <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> is the value of the equation of state at a pivot scale factor <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (close to 0.6 for most probes) and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> describes the redshift evolution. The goal of future surveys is to measure <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> to high precision. To judge their relative strengths we use a standard dark energy figure of merit (FoM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which we define throughout this proposal as: FoM = 1/(<italic>Δw</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub><italic>Δw</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>), where <italic>Δw</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and <italic>Δw</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> are the (1<italic>σ</italic>) errors on the equation of state parameters. This FoM is inversely proportional to the area of the error ellipse in the (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> − <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) plane.

DUNE has thus the advantage of probing the parameters of dark energy in two independent ways. A single accurate technique can rule out many of the suggested members of the family of dark energy models, but it cannot test the fundamental assumptions about gravity theory. If general relativity is correct, then either <italic>D</italic>(<italic>z</italic>) or the growth of structure can determine the expansion history. In more radical models that violate general relativity, however, this equivalence between <italic>D</italic>(<italic>z</italic>) and growth of structure does not apply (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For this purpose, DUNE will use a combination of the following cosmological probes. The precision on Dark Energy parameters achieved by DUNE’s weak lensing survey and complementary probes described below is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

The weak lensing method measures this distortion by correlating the shapes of background galaxies to probe the density field of the Universe. By dividing galaxies into redshift (or distance) bins, we can examine the growth of structure and make three-dimensional maps of the dark matter. An accurate lensing survey, therefore, requires precise measurements of the shapes of galaxies as well as information about their redshifts. High-resolution images of large portions of the sky are required, with low levels of systematic errors that can only be achieved via observations from a thermally stable satellite in space. Analyses of the dark energy require precise measurements of both the cosmic expansion history and the growth of structure. Weak lensing stands apart from all other available methods because it is able to make accurate measurements of both effects. Given this, the optimal dark energy mission (and dark sector mission) is one that is centred on weak gravitational lensing and is complemented by other dark energy probes.</p></sec><sec><title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)—An Expansion History Probe:</title><p>The scale of the acoustic oscillations caused by the coupling between radiation and baryons in the early Universe can be used as a ’standard ruler’ to determine the distance-redshift relation.

All-sky coverage in the NIR enabled by DUNE, impossible from the ground, is crucial to reach the necessary photometric redshift accuracy for this BAO survey.</p></sec><sec><title>Cluster Counts (CC)—A Growth of Structure Probe:</title><p>Counts of the abundance of galaxy clusters (the most massive bound objects in the Universe) as a function of redshift are a powerful probe of the growth of structure.

Its presence indicates either space curvature, a dark energy component or a modification to gravity. The ISW effect is measured by cross-correlating the CMB with a foreground density field covering the entire extra-galactic sky, as measured by DUNE. Because it is a local probe of structure growth, ISW will place complementary constraints on dark energy, at higher redshifts, relative to the other probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Understanding dark matter</title><p>Besides dark energy, one major component of the concordance model of cosmology is dark matter (~90% of the matter in the Universe, and ~ 25% of the total energy). The standard assumption is that the dark matter particle(s) is cold and non-collisional (CDM). Besides direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments, its nature may well be revealed by experiments such as the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN, but its physical properties may prove to be harder to pin down without astronomical input. one way of testing this is to study the amount of substructure in dark matter halos on scales 1–100\u2033, which can be done using high order galaxy shape measurements and strong lensing with DUNE. Weak lensing measurements can constrain the total neutrino mass and number of neutrino species through observations of damping of the matter power spectrum on small scales. Combining DUNE measurements with Planck data would reduce the uncertainty on the sum of neutrino masses to 0.04 eV, and may therefore make the first measurement of the neutrino mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Understanding the seeds of structure formation</title><p>It is widely believed that cosmic structures originated from vacuum fluctuations in primordial quantum fields stretched to cosmic scales in a brief period during inflation.

Various modifications to gravity on large scales (e.g. by extra dimensions, superstrings, non-minimal couplings or additional fields) have been suggested to avoid dark matter and dark energy. The weak lensing measurements of DUNE will be used to test the underlying theory of gravity, using the fact that modified gravity theories typically alter the relation between geometrical measures and the growth of structure (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). DUNE can measure the growth factor exponent <italic>γ</italic> with a precision of 2%.</p><p>Meeting the above cosmological objectives necessitates an extra-galactic all-sky survey (DASS-EX) in the visible/NIR with galaxies at a median redhift of <italic>z</italic> ~ 1.

DASS will cover a 10,000 times larger area than other optical/near-IR surveys of the same or better resolution, will be 4mag deeper than the GAIA photometry and six times higher resolution than the SDSS. In the infrared, DASS-EX will be nearly 1,000 times deeper (in J) than the all-sky 2MASS survey with an effective search volume which will be 5,000-fold that of the UKIDDS large area survey currently underway, and 500-fold that of the proposed VISTA Hemisphere Survey. It would take VISTA 8,000 years to match DASS-EX depth and 20,000 deg<sup>2</sup> area coverage.

A large area survey is required for rare but important events, such as the merger rate of very massive galaxies. DUNE will deliver this key capability.</p><p>Using DUNE’s weak lensing maps, we will study the relationship between galaxy mass and light, the bias, by mapping the total mass density and the stellar mass and luminosity.

DUNE will thus enable the most comprehensive stellar census of late-type dwarfs and giants, brown dwarfs, He-rich white dwarfs, along with detailed structural studies, tidal streams and merger fragments. DUNE’s sensitivity will also open up a new discovery space for rare stellar and low-temperature objects via its H-band imaging. Currently, much of Galactic structure studies are focussed on the halo. Studying the Galactic disk components requires the combination of spatial resolution (crowding) and dust-penetration (H-band) that DUNE can deliver.</p><p>Beyond our Milky Way, DUNE will also yield the most detailed and sensitive survey of structure and substructure in nearby galaxies, especially of their outer boundaries, thus constraining their merger and accretion histories.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Search for exo-planets</title><p>The discovery of extrasolar planets is the most exciting development in astrophysics over the past decade, rivalled only by the discovery of the acceleration of the Universe. Space observations (e.g. COROT, KEPLER), supported by ground-based high-precision radial velocity surveys will probe low-mass planets (down to 1 <italic>M</italic><sub> ⊕ </sub>). DUNE is also perfectly suited to trace the distribution of matter on very small scales those of the normally invisible extrasolar planets. Using microlensing effect, DUNE can provide a statistical census of exoplanets in the Galaxy with masses over 0.1 <italic>M</italic><sub> ⊕ </sub> from orbits of 0.5 AU to free-floating objects. This includes analogues to all the solar system’s planets except for Mercury, as well as most planets predicted by planet formation theory. Microlensing is the temporary magnification of a Galactic bulge source star by the gravitational potential of an intervening lens star passing near the line of sight. A planet orbiting the lens star, will have an altered magnification, showing a brief flash or a dip in the observed light curve of the star (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Because of atmospheric seeing (limiting the monitoring to large source stars), and poor duty cycle even using networks, ground-based microlensing surveys are only able to detect a few to 15 <italic>M</italic><sub> ⊕ </sub> planets in the vicinity of the Einstein ring radius (2–3 AU). The high angular resolution of DUNE, and the uninterrupted visibility and NIR sensitivity afforded by space observations will provide detections of microlensing events using as sources G and K bulge dwarfs stars and therefore can detect planets down to 0.1 − 1 <italic>M</italic><sub> ⊙ </sub> from orbits of 0.5 AU. Moreover, there will be a very large number of transiting hot Jupiters detected towards the Galactic bulge as ‘free’ ancillary science. A space-based microlensing survey is thus the only way to gain a comprehensive census and understanding of the nature of planetary systems and their host stars. We also underline that the planet search scales linearly with the surface of the focal plane and the duration of the experiment.

In addition to shape measurements, wide area imagining surveys use photometric information to measure the redshift of galaxies in the images. Accurate measurements of the photometric redshifts require the addition of NIR photometry (an example of this is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, right panel, and also Abdalla et al.

The spacecraft consists of a Payload Module (PLM) that includes the instrument (telescope hardware, focal plane assemblies and on board science data management) and a Service Module (SVM). The SVM design is based on the Mars Express parallelepiped structure that is 1.7 × 1.7 × 1.4 m, which accommodates all subsystems (propulsion, AOCS, communication, power, sunshield, etc) as well as the PLM.

Detailed analyses show that DUNE high pointing performance is comparable in difficulty to that achieved on GAIA during science observations. Similarly to GAIA, two pairs of dedicated CCD in the visible focal plane are used for measuring the spacecraft attitude speed vector. Hybridisation of the star tracker and payload measurements is used to reduce the noise injected by the star tracker in the loop. For all other operational phases and for the transition from coarse manoeuvres to the science observation mode, the attitude is controlled using the Mars Express propulsion system. The attitude estimation is based on using two star trackers (also used in science observing mode), six single-axis gyros and two sun sensors for monitoring DUNE pointing during manoeuvres with a typically accuracy better than 1 arcmin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Functional architecture: propulsion and electrical systems</title><p>The star signal collected in the instrument is spread on the focal plane assembly and transformed into a digital electrical signal which is transferred to the Payload Data Handling Unit (PDHU), based on Thales/AlienaSpace heritage.

Electrical power is generated by two solar arrays (2.7 m<sup>2</sup> each), as used in the Mars Express and Venus Express ESA spacecraft. The control of their orientation is based on the orientation of the whole spacecraft towards the Sun.

The allocated bandwidth for payload telemetry is 375 MHz and high rate transmitters already exist for this purpose. The X-band 155 Mbits/s TMTHD modulator can be reused from Pleiades spacecraft. A single fixed HGA of 30 cm diameter can be used (re-used from Venus Express). The RF power required is 25 W, which also enables the re-use of the solid state power amplifier (SSPA) from Pleiades. The transmitted science data volume is estimated at 1.5 Tbits per day. The baseline approach consists in storing the science data on board in the PDHU, then to downlink the data twice per day. This can be achieved naturally twice per orbit at 06 and 18 h local time and using the rotation degree of freedom about the satellite-sun axis for orienting the antenna towards the ground station. The total transmission duration is less than 3 h. The spacecraft attitude variation during transmission is less than 30 deg (including AOCS margins). Twenty kilograms hydrazine propellant budget is required.

This will leave the dark energy dominated low redshift Universe as the next frontier in high precision cosmology. Constraints from the radiation perturbation in the high redshift CMB, probed by Planck, combined with density perturbations at low redshifts, probed by DUNE, will form a complete set for testing all sectors of the cosmological model. In this respect, a DUNE+Planck programme can be seen as the next significant step in testing, and thus challenging, the standard model of cosmology. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> illustrates just how precise the constraints on theory are expected to be: DUNE will offer high potential for ground-breaking discoveries of new physics, from dark energy to dark matter, initial conditions and the law of gravity. Our understanding of the Universe will be fundamentally altered in a post-DUNE era, with ESA’s science programmes at the forefront of these discoveries. As described above, the science goals of DUNE go far beyond the measurement of dark energy. It is a mission which: (1) measures both effects of dark energy (i.e. the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of structure) by using weak lensing as the central probe; (2) places this high precision measurement of dark energy within a broader framework of high precision cosmology by constraining all sectors of the standard cosmology model (dark matter, initial conditions and Einstein gravity); (3) through a collection of unique legacy surveys is able to push the frontiers of the understanding of galaxy evolution and the physics of the local group; and finally (4) is able to obtain information on some of the lowest masses astronomy extrasolar planets, which could contain mirror Earths.</p><p>DUNE has been selected jointly with SPACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme for an assessment phase which lead to the Euclid merged concept.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank CNES for support on an earlier version of the DUNE mission and EADS/Astrium, Alcatel/Alenia Space, as well as Kayser/Threde for their help in the preparation of the ESA proposal.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Abdalla, et al.: arXiv:astro-ph/0705.1437 (2007)</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Albrecht, A., et al.: arXiv:astro-ph/0609591 (2006)</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Amara, A., Réfrégier, A.: MNRAS <bold>381</bold>, 1018 (2007)</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Amara, A., Refregier, A.: arXiv:astro-ph/0710.5171 (2007)</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Cimatti, A., et al.: arXiv:0804.4433 (2008)</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Douspis, M., Castro, P.G., Caprini, C., Aghanim, N.: arXiv:0802.0983.
