Due to the high risk of exposure to various contaminants in drinking water, point-of-use (POU) drinking water treatment is rapidly growing in popularity in the U.S. and beyond. POU treatment technologies include various combinations of string-wound sediment filters, activated carbon, modified carbon, ion exchange and redox media filters, reverse osmosis membranes, and ultraviolet lamps depending on the contaminants of concern. While the technologies are well-proven, highly commoditized, and cost-effective, most systems offer little in the way of real-time performance monitoring or interactive technology like other smart home appliances (e.g., thermostats, smoke detectors, doorbells, etc.). Herein, we review water quality regulations and violations in the U.S. as well as state-of-the-art POU technologies and systems with an emphasis on their effectiveness at removing the contaminants most frequently reported in notices of violations. We conclude by briefly reviewing emerging smart water technologies and the needs for advances in the state-of-the-art technologies. The smartness of commercially available POU water filters is critiqued and a definition of smart water filter is proposed.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>53</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41545_2021_Article_128.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water Quality/Water Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water Industry/Water Technologies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Waste Water Technology / Water Pollution Control / Water Management / Aquatic Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="CrossLinking"><sec><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-022-00159-0" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-022-00159-0</ext-link>.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Access to clean water is of utmost importance for human health and society at large. References to water purification and filtration methods can be traced back to ancient Sanskrit and Egyptian writings—including descriptions of boiling, solar heating, and sand filtration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Hippocrates, often referred to as the “father of medicine,” found that water could be made purer by filtering it and, in 500 BC, he designed a simple sediment filter by running water through cloth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In modern times, sand filters were first documented as a water treatment device in 1804. By 1852, the Metropolis Water Act in London required the use of sand filters in part of the city<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The filters removed suspended solids, but did not address pathogenic microorganisms or chemical contaminants since microbiology and analytical chemistry were not yet adequately established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the United States, drinking water standards were gradually developed over the 20th century, culminating in the passage of the Clean Water Act (1972) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974), which were part of a landmark decade of promulgating new environmental regulations.</p><p id="Par3">Water quality can be broken into numerous physical, biological, and chemical components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Physical water quality descriptors include turbidity, total, settleable, filterable and dissolved solids, color, taste, odor, and temperature. Biological quality refers to protozoan, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Biological contamination is often an immediate health risk: crippling outbreaks of typhoid, cholera, salmonella, and other diseases have been spread through contaminated water supplies. Chemical components include trace organic and inorganic compounds, which may be toxic to humans and can also cause discoloration, poor taste, or odor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Toxic chemicals may lead to both acute and chronic health effects. Water quality regulations in the U.S. were developed to address all three classes of contaminants. Primary drinking water standards are defined by maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The standards focus on biological and chemical contaminants. The trace chemical contaminants are sometimes less than one part per billion and may be set at or near the limits of analytical detection methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Physical water quality components are mainly covered by the U.S. EPA’s secondary drinking water standards, which are unenforced unlike their primary counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although water quality is well-regulated in the U.S., there is considerable variation in contaminant levels by location. Consequently, consumers who are concerned about the quality of their water supply often purchase bottled water or various water-filtration devices to remove any remaining impurities. For instance, a recent set of studies conducted in Los Angeles, CA, USA has determined the following<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par5">Levels of distrust in tap water are high, especially among households of color (e.g., LA County had 2nd highest level of distrust among urban areas in the country before Flint).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par6">Equating distrust with misperception in all cases (as many water systems and public health agencies do) is incorrect and generic “education” approaches to improve trust are neither effective nor respectful.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7">Much of distrust appears “rational” and stems from past/present experience of unclean, if not unsafe (we draw a distinction here) drinking water, much of it from premise plumbing.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Solutions to issues of premise plumbing are tough especially due to tenancy split-incentive issues, but legal and especially financial incentive approaches from other sectors can be brought to bear.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">The consequences of distrust are severe for household health, finances, trust in the government, and the environment.</p></list-item></list>Since water quality degradation may occur in the distribution system, one solution could be widespread implementation of point-of-entry (POE) water treatment where a POE system is installed at a household’s or building’s water main intake ahead of the structure’s taps, faucets, or other dedicated outlets used to dispense water for drinking, cooking, and bathing. However, degradation can occur in premise plumbing (e.g., copper pipes) in older buildings, and hence, it may make the most sense to deploy point-of-use (POU) water treatment just ahead of the tap, faucet or dispensing outlet. In this review, we focus on POU water treatment.</p><p id="Par10">Typical POU systems contain water treatment technologies such as media filtration, reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, UV disinfection, and remineralization (particularly after RO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Large particles, rust, and debris are first removed by filtration through string-wound sediment filters. Next, some form of selective separation may be employed such as redox media, activated carbon (AC), and/or ion exchange (IEX). Membrane technology, most commonly RO, removes nearly all suspended and dissolved contaminants such as dissolved organic chemicals, dissolved metals, minerals, and salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. UV disinfection inactivates pathogenic microorganisms, rendering them non-infectious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Remineralization after RO filtration is often used to add back the minerals removed by earlier stages to provide pH-buffered, better-tasting water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In each step, there are various technologies available with different contaminant removal efficacies to satisfy a variety of situations and needs. In addition, emerging POU treatment technologies such as capacitive deionization (CDI) are attracting attention because of their selective contaminant removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">The rapid development of Internet technologies has encouraged many home-appliance manufacturers to provide “smart” products, including “smart” POU filters. There are various definitions of smart home appliances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The consensus is that if a product is smart, it is one that can be remotely controlled by the user via a smart phone, tablet, or other device. Connectivity and interaction with the user via an “app” is achieved using WiFi or Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> technology. Smart filter systems take many forms and have differing levels of sensor integration, but information on which filter media and sensors are included in home water treatment systems has been lacking. Moreover, different manufacturers seem to have different views on the smartness of water filters. Some products claim themselves to be “smart” because they can provide water with better quality, which does not satisfy the connectivity requirement of other smart home appliances.</p><p id="Par12">This study reviews U.S. federal and (several) state regulations, the frequency and nature of water quality violations in the U.S., state-of-the-art POU water treatment technologies and their contaminant removal capabilities, especially emerging contaminants. Further, representative commercially available POU systems are compared, making note of filter types, any sensors employed, expected service life, and other details. Finally, the smartness of commercially available POU water filters is critiqued and a definition of smart water filter is proposed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Water quality regulations, violations, and hazards in the US</title><p id="Par13">Access to clean drinking water is imperative because of the potential for both acute and chronic health risks associated with drinking contaminated water. Federal regulations serve the purpose of reducing the likelihood of becoming ill from drinking the tap water. The EPA regulates contaminants by establishing MCLs for microbiological, organic, and inorganic contaminants based on health guidelines, research, and feasibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These standards delineate the maximum amount of a contaminant that can be allowed in drinking water to minimize exposure. States may build on the EPA’s standards by adding additional contaminants not regulated at the federal level and by further reducing MCLs for federally regulated contaminants.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Federal drinking water regulations</title><p id="Par14">To regulate drinking water, the EPA establishes primary and secondary drinking water standards. Primary standards are enforceable by law and apply to all the U.S. public water systems; their goal is to limit levels of harmful contaminants in drinking water. The EPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> has a list of 88 contaminants regulated in the primary standards with the following contaminant categories and numbers: 3 disinfectants, 4 disinfection byproducts (DBPs), 16 inorganic chemicals, 8 microorganism categories, 53 organic chemicals, and 4 radionuclides. The EPA regulates most of these contaminants by establishing MCLs that can be present in the effluent of drinking water treatment plants. These MCLs are intended to keep people safe, but they are not necessarily safe. The maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) is the amount of a contaminant in drinking water at which there is no known or expected risk. MCLs are determined by feasibility of measurement, removal, and enforcement in combination with MCLGs, so there may be some health risks even with MCLs in place.</p><p id="Par15">To supplement the enforced primary standards, the EPA sets unenforced secondary drinking water standards. They are intended to improve aesthetic qualities of water such as taste, color, and odor. According to the EPA, these standards are important because if water looks, tastes, or smells bad, people may not drink it even if it is perfectly safe. Some other secondary standards help control scaling, which restricts water flow and corrosion, which can cause pipes to wear out or dissolve harmful contaminants previously fixed within the mineral scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">The EPA also maintains a contaminant candidate list (CCL) for compounds that are not currently regulated but are expected to be found in public water systems and may require regulation in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The CCL serves an essential purpose in the process of enacting water quality regulations. Every 5 years, the EPA decides if it will regulate or not regulate at least five contaminants on the CCL. In February 2020, the EPA made preliminary decisions to regulate perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but not to regulate six other chemicals including dichloroethane and acetochlor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. They make these decisions using data collected about these contaminants and compare it to the criteria for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The CCL must be updated every 5 years, and the contaminants with the greatest potential health risks in drinking water shall be placed on the list<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Once the EPA decides to regulate a contaminant, it can take years before a regulation is enacted. For example, the EPA decided to regulate perchlorate in 2011, but as of 2020, the EPA still has not set a MCL for perchlorate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Because it takes many years to regulate a chemical that it deems to be unsafe for human consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, there may be chemicals present in drinking water for which negative healthy effects are known, but no action has yet been taken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>State drinking water regulations</title><p id="Par17">States are required to have standards at least as strict as EPA standards for primary drinking water treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Yet, state standards may vary from the EPA standards, providing room for states to regulate certain contaminants more strictly or address contaminants that are not yet federally regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For example, in California, contaminants are regulated because of determinations made by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, which sets public health goals based on the health impacts of individual contaminants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For carcinogenic contaminants, they create regulations based on the risk of cancer from exposure to different amounts of the contaminant. Typically, the acceptable risk is for—at most—one person in a million to get cancer upon exposure over 70 years. After proposing a standard based on current research, they consult a group of scientific experts, make further revisions, and finally allow public comment. After setting a goal, they can establish an enforceable standard that is as close as possible to the goal while considering economic and technical feasibility. This process is similar to how the EPA sets its MCLs, but because it is separate from the EPA, they can regulate chemicals of local concern such as agricultural contaminants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Table S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> compares the EPA’s primary drinking water standards to the drinking water regulations of several states; it also displays the health effects of exposure and the origins of these contaminants. Alaska, Texas, and California exhibit an exemplary range of different state’s approaches to regulations, with California being the most stringent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Exposure to regulated contaminants can cause a variety of health issues including cancer, kidney problems, nervous system problems and more, which is why these chemicals are regulated by the EPA and states. In addition, one clear commonality amongst the origins of these contaminants is that they frequently come from industrial operations that discharge waste into the environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Violations of standards</title><p id="Par19">Even though regulations exist to limit exposure to toxic contaminants, sometimes public water utilities violate existing standards. Public water utilities are categorized by the EPA as community water systems (CWSs), transient non-community water systems (TNCWSs), or non-transient non-community water systems (NTNCWSs) (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).

The filter functions by mechanically trapping particles that are larger than the characteristic space between strings; sometimes thinner string is used near the core center and thicker string on the outside. In this way, the string-wound sediment filter can capture particles not only on the cartridge surface, but also through its depth and at the core surface.</p><p id="Par45">The first string-wound filter cartridge entered the U.S. market around the mid-1930s.

AC is created from charcoal by treating it with extremely hot gases, leaving pure carbon with many microscopic pores. Granular activated carbon (GAC) is a ubiquitous form of AC water filters in residential water filter systems. The carbon particles repel water and strongly attract nonpolar organic compounds via intermolecular Van der Waal’s and hydrophobic interactions. Van der Waal’s interactions are almost universally attractive and based on permanent, temporary, and induced dipole interactions between the atoms of the GAC and chemical compounds; hydrophobic attraction occurs between nonpolar compounds or nonpolar moieties within complex molecules. Highly polar and charged compounds can experience electrostatic and hydrophilic repulsion, which makes them less likely to be well removed by GAC. The surface area available for adsorption is extremely large due to the large quantity of micropores in the carbon. GAC is thus used to remove organic contaminants, some heavy metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, and DBPs such as trihalomethanes (THMs).</p><p id="Par49">In addition to bare GAC, several surface modification methods have been researched to enhance the affinity to different impurities, including chemical treatment, impregnation, and plasma treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).

Many consumers find less expensive filters sufficient for their needs. However, RO units produce purer water than other commercially available technologies. Also, pre-treatment is necessary during this process; otherwise, membrane fouling or damage can quickly occur. Given sufficient pressure, nearly all dissolved solutes can theoretically be removed, but realistic removal rates on the order of 90–99% are possible for contaminants that cannot be removed by other filtration methods. RO systems are thus in demand among those with a high standard for water quality. Some water filter companies address differing customer standards by selling versions of systems that differ only in the inclusion of a ROM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>UV disinfection</title><p id="Par57">UV irradiation has been increasingly used in water disinfection to inactivate microorganisms because it adds no chemicals, does not produce harmful DBPs, and does not cause disinfectant resistance in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>.

countertop, etc.), and how they are combined to create various POU water filtration systems. Mass-produced water filters need to be effective at removing contaminants, and also, must be compact, low-cost, and easy to maintain. These constraints place some limits on the purification technologies that consumers can access, which drives most consumer products to use highly commoditized filter media. We compiled data from 11 POU water filter companies’ websites, and the configurations of their systems are summarized below. Individual filters and system components are listed in order when they could be determined. Price ranges are listed where available; the range of products were selected to reflect the lowest and highest priced products within the category. The prices shown were listed on the companies’ websites, including discounts, as of December 2020.

Most households with these systems use untreated tap water for most of their water needs (such as showers and washing machines) and a small amount of filtered water for drinking and cooking. Under-the-sink filters are designed to purify only a few hundred gallons of water before needing replacement of filter media. They may be further divided based on the number of filtering stages or the presence of a ROM. There is considerable flexibility in the number of stages depending on the needs of customers, but may comprise up to seven stages including a sediment prefilter (SED), ion exchange (IEX), KDF or GAC media filters, activated carbon block (ACB) filters, RO membrane (ROM), remineralization media filters (ALK), UV sterilization (UVS) and/or postfiltration activated carbon (PAC) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Under-the-sink RO filtration.</title><p>There is considerable flexibility in the number of stages depending on the needs of customers, which may contain up to seven stages including a sediment prefilter (SED), ion exchange (IEX), KDF or GAC media filters, activated carbon block (ACB) filters, RO membrane (ROM), remineralization media filters (ALK), UV sterilization (UVS) and/or postfiltration activated carbon (PAC) (reprinted with permission from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref></sup>; Copyright<sup>©</sup> Express Water Inc., 2020).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41545_2021_128_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par69">Table <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">12</xref> summarizes the abundance of under-the-sink water filter media across several brands.

Some are pressurized and are essentially compact versions of under-the-sink systems. However, many are not pressurized: tap water is poured in and gravity alone moves the water through a small filter. Gravity-only filters are very popular and sold in retail hardware, grocery, and mega-stores; water filtration can be slow and most are designed to improve water taste (with some health protection benefits) removing residual chlorine, dissolved organics, and some metals like lead and copper. For some pitcher filters, the filtration process takes only around 30 s. Customers can simply pour water into the pitcher, then get clean drinking water in the pitcher reservoir as feedwater passing through the filter cartridge. In addition, the price of a common water filter pitcher is relatively lower than other filter types, typically less than $40. However, since most pitcher filters only contain GAC, IEX, and/or KDF media, not all contaminants are removed, especially some heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and hormones.<table-wrap id="Tab13"><label>Table 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Product summary of filter media in countertop and pitcher systems.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Brands</p></th><th><p>Filter type</p></th><th><p>Model configuration</p></th><th><p>price</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>APEC</p></td><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>Sediment filter + GAC + RO + GAC</p></td><td><p>$230</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>Sediment filter + GAC + RO + GAC + additional case</p></td><td><p>$270</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>Sediment filter + GAC + RO + remineralization</p></td><td><p>$250</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>Sediment filter + GAC + RO + remineralization + additional case</p></td><td><p>$290</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Aquasana</p></td><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>Three models, all GAC (without pump)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$57</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>Three models, all GAC (with pump)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$130</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PUR</p></td><td><p>Pitcher</p></td><td><p>Five pitcher models with tap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$17–40</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brita</p></td><td><p>Pitcher</p></td><td><p>Numerous pitcher models (more than ten, no clear count available) with integrated sediment filter, GAC, and ion exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$20–45</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>iSpring</p></td><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>One single-stage carbon block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$41</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>One two-stage GAC and carbon block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">218</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$80</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kinetico</p></td><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>One customizable model with five stages, storage tank, and tap: prefilter (sediment or carbon/sediment), two auxiliary filters (antimicrobial, volatile organic compounds, arsenic, perchlorate, chloramine, remineralization), RO between auxiliary filters, activated carbon postfilter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>One single-stage GAC model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pelican</p></td><td><p>Countertop</p></td><td><p>One GAC model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref></sup></p></td><td><p>$56</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Refrigerator water filters</title><p id="Par72">Many refrigerators are designed to deliver filtered cold water and ice.

The expectation about “smart” is higher now with the expansion of Internet coverage and WiFi technology. Nonliving things are becoming animate and “smart” through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) by interacting with human beings. Therefore, the present study proposes a new, expanded definition for “smart” with the following equation: Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting + Interaction with Human through Internet = SMART. In recent years, “smart” is an increasingly attractive product description for home equipment and appliances, including water filters. According to Investopedia.com<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, “smart home” refers to a convenient home setup where appliances and devices can be automatically controlled remotely from anywhere with an Internet connection using a mobile or other networked device. Devices in a smart home are interconnected through the Internet, allowing the user to control functions such as home security systems, access to the home, temperature, lighting, music, and home theater equipment. Here are a few key takeaways about smart home technology.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par76">A smart home allows homeowners to control appliances, thermostats, lights, and other devices remotely using a smartphone or tablet through an Internet connection.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">Smart homes can be set up through wireless or hardwired systems.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par78">Smart home technology provides homeowners with convenience and cost savings.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">Security risks and bugs continue to plague makers and users of smart home technology.</p></list-item></list>Further, “smart products” include features such as context awareness through data collection, autonomous operation via AI/ML algorithms, and WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity and connection to other devices and/or the Internet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref></sup>. For example, one smart air filter can not only actively track the filter life, but also provide environmental air quality information and tips for the user through a convenient mobile app<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref></sup>. Similar to a smart air filter, a smart water filter could allow the user to control the appliance remotely and keep track of important details such as filter lifespan and filtered-water quality. However, there is little consensus on what constitutes a smart water filter. Moreover, current smart water filters are not actually smart based on the fact that they can neither be remotely controlled nor provide necessary water quality information to the consumers.</p><p id="Par80">Most “smart” water filter systems in the U.S. market only have a timer, flow counter, or “# of times used” counter to remind the user when to replace a filter. These rely on preset assumptions of filter usage and water quality, and do not directly measure the quality or quantity of water consumed. Water filter companies which use a battery-powered timed replacement feature include GE, Pelican, and Whirlpool. Kinetico claims to use a smart reminder, but its products simply use a flow counter to shut off the system when a prespecified number of gallons have been used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref></sup>. Flow sensors record the rotation of an impeller wheel as water moves through the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref></sup>. Brita pitchers use a different method: a sensor in the lid counts how many times the lid has been opened to fill the pitcher, approximating the output of a flow sensor. Some sensors, such as those used in PUR faucets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref></sup>, track both time and water flow. While more sophisticated than a time-based reminder, a flow-based reminder still does not use actual water quality information to assess filter performance or treated-water quality. Moreover, water quality can vary considerably between different households in different regions with different water quality and based on the age of premise plumbing. Pre-programmed filter change reminders have limited ability to adapt to local water quality or assess whether a system is functioning as designed.</p><p id="Par81">It seems obvious to incorporate smart technology and elements into POU water filters, in particular, to reliably notify the user when to replace the filter. Conductivity, pH, and ORP sensors are widely available and some for less than $10 (presumably even less when purchased in bulk). However, we find limited evidence of such technologies in any commercially available POU products. A filter’s ability to remove lead, arsenic, and other harmful contaminants may be well-advertised, but it is not clear for how long that performance persists in a given household installation. A time- or flow-based change reminder is consistent in that a manufacturer can expect attentive customers to buy a replacement at predictable time intervals. This increases the ability of the manufacturer to plan their production and finances. Many customers may never replace their filter cartridges due to inconvenience or switching to a different filter brand. Customers in this group would also be unlikely to benefit from a more intelligent reminder system.</p><p id="Par82">It seems likely that most consumers who will eventually replace their filters would prefer to do so when their system wears out or breaks rather than at a predefined time interval. If a product is developed which includes this feature, perhaps including sensors more sophisticated than TDS (total dissolved solids) (conductivity), then these capabilities could prove attractive. Users could be warned that contaminants have reached unacceptably high levels at the filtration system’s output, providing a more compelling reason to replace one or more components. The availability of in-line TDS sensors which can be plugged into existing water supplies indicates that measurement capabilities are in demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref></sup>.

Many sensors have been developed to measure physical qualities of water or the presence of chemical contaminants. These include sensors for electrical conductivity (EC)—a surrogate for TDS, ORP, pH, turbidity, ion-selective electrodes as well as emerging optical, fluorescent, and spectrophotometric devices. Adding these sensors to water filter systems could allow users to check the quality of their water without worrying about silent product expiry. Moreover, the widespread use of sensors could push manufacturers to improve removal efficacy and address more diverse contaminants. Moreover, even if sensors like those described below were to be deployed in POU water treatment systems, they would not be truly SMART until they communicate to the system owner directly through some smart device like an Internet connected phone, tablet, or PC.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>TDS sensors</title><p id="Par84">One of the most common sensors is an EC sensor, which requires only a pair of electrical contacts to measure the resistance of water by applying a small current. EC can be closely correlated with TDS because dissolved ions in water allow electricity to flow more freely between the contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref></sup>. For instance, there is a fairly robust conversion factor from EC to TDS for fresh water, namely 1 mS/cm EC = 640 ppm TDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref></sup>. However, this is a crude measurement because conductivity fails to account for the specific ionic composition of the water. The TDS sensor is small and cheap, with simple versions available for close to $10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref></sup>. The least expensive sensors can measure TDS within 10% accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref></sup>, while more expensive ones can achieve 1% accuracy or better<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref></sup>. Multiple forms of the sensor are available; Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref></sup> depicts one sensor with exposed metal contacts and one in-line sensor which covers the contacts in a way that allows them to be placed in series with a water supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref></sup>. Due to their simplicity and adaptability, TDS sensors are one of the most common devices for measuring water quality. HM Digital<sup>TM</sup> TDS Meter can achieve EC-to-TDS conversion easily, and some meters can even have selectable conversion factors. The Dual Inline TDS Meter is different from the first one as it can measure two different water lines together. As a result, customers can get TDS information about both tap water and filtered water at the same time.</p><p id="Par85">Uncharged contaminants such as soluble hydrocarbons, DBPs, and some pharmaceuticals and pesticides cannot be detected by conductivity sensors because they do not change the ability of water to conduct electrical current. Some charged contaminants such as lead, chromium (VI), and arsenic—while they can be ionic—are toxic at levels in the parts-per-billion range, too small to be detected by all but the most precise conductivity sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref></sup>. Despite limitations, an EC/TDS sensor’s measurements could be used to evaluate whether a filter system is working. If an ROM is breached, downstream EC/TDS sensors would register an increase in the measured EC, which would indicate system performance has declined or failed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref></sup>. Other filter stages such as WAC/SAC or SBA/WBA IEX resins may become less effective at removing ions from water when nearing saturation, and this difference may be indicated in conductivity measurements. Conductivity thus provides useful information on the status of a filtration system in the absence of more comprehensive water quality data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>pH and ORP sensors</title><p id="Par86">Other types of water quality sensors, which do not appear to be implemented in any commercial POU systems, include pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref></sup> and ORP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref></sup> sensors. Several types of pH sensors are available, of which the most common variation is the combination pH sensor. Two electrodes measure either side of a specially designed glass membrane, which contains a reference solution. The measured electrical potential is proportional to the pH of the test solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref></sup>. Like conductivity measurements, pH measurements can also indicate the successful operation of a RO Or IEX system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref></sup>. Like pH probes, ORP probes consist of a test and reference electrode. The test electrode either gains or loses electrons from the solution, resulting in a measurable potential across the two electrodes. ORP is measured in millivolts and depends on the substances present in the solution as well as their concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref></sup>. These sensors are more complex and correspondingly more expensive, starting at around $30 for the cheapest pH sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref></sup> and $90 for the cheapest ORP sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref></sup>. Although not present in water filters due to their cost, the combination of pH and ORP measurements can provide significant insight into the chemical makeup of water such as speciation of metals (e.g., Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup>), oxyanions (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>/HAsO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>), and multi-protic anions (e.g., HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>) as well as corrosivity (e.g., Langlier saturation index).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Future smart POU system using nanotechnology-enabled sensors</title><p id="Par87">Nanomaterial-enabled sensors, also called nanosensors, are invented for high-efficacy, multiplex-functionality, and high-flexibility sensing applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref></sup>.

That said, violations for a wide array of regulated contaminants by public water systems, unregulated non-grid-tied groundwater wells, and unregulated emerging contaminants still pose serious acute and chronic health risks. For example, some very-high-profile cases of impaired municipal drinking water have occurred in recent years (e.g., lead in Flint, Michigan and Newark, New Jersey). Moreover, long timelines for implementing new regulations in the U.S. cause some concern over the purity and healthfulness of municipal drinking water, especially with so many toxic, carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting, and pharmaceutically active chemicals known to be in drinking water’s source waters. Treatment plants that use surface water as a source tend to have a higher frequency of violations compared to those using groundwater. For smaller systems, many of the violations are for lack of reporting versus reports of known violations, so the potential risk to the populations served is difficult to assess. As the size of treatment plants increase, the percent of violations and, in particular, those that use surface water both tend to decrease; however, the number of people potentially at risk is quite high due to the large populations served.</p><p id="Par93">These well-documented drinking water violations, unregulated off-grid groundwater wells, and emerging contaminants all give rise to consumers’ lack of confidence in drinking water quality and justify the use of POU drinking water treatment systems. Although there has been much research on the mechanisms and removal efficacies of the types of water treatment technologies employed in POU applications, most peer-reviewed studies are framed in the context of large-scale municipal or industrial treatment applications and few independent studies have evaluated their efficacy in POU water treatment applications. Components in commercially available POU water filter systems are highly commoditized and standardized across the industry. Sediment, KDF, AC (either GAC or ACB), RO, remineralization, and UVS are the most commonly employed technologies. This level of homogeneity in the production of filter systems is good in that it drives down costs to the consumer making POU water treatment widely accessible; however, the lack of regulations, monitoring and control of POU systems make it difficult to know if and when a POU system stops working as it was designed.</p><p id="Par94">The smartness of POU water filters may be defined as their ability to perform tasks such as monitoring and reporting water quality, monitoring filter performance and expected lifetime, controlling filtration remotely, and connecting with consumers through personal smart devices. By this definition, currently there are no commercially available SMART POU water filtration products. Sensors providing water quality information is an essential feature for a water filter to become SMART. However, a SMART water filter is also expected to be connected to WiFi or Bluetooth and deliver the information to a mobile app. Interaction and control through the use of Internet is a key characteristic of any smart home technology. Future design and production of SMART POU water treatment systems should consider moving beyond timers and counters to flow meters and (at least) basic water quality sensors (e.g., EC/pH/ORP) along with Internet connectivity and interactive consumer apps. Finally, these technological innovations must be accomplished at very low cost to assure widespread accessibility for the most vulnerable and underprivileged populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful for financial support for this study provided by Pacifica Water Solutions, the UCLA Samueli Engineering School, the UCLA Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, and the UCLA Sustainable LA Grand Challenge.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>E.M.V.H. devised the project, the main conceptual ideas and proof outline of this review work.
