It is crucial to develop new technologies for generating clean and efficient energy for society to avoid upcoming energetic and environmental crises. Sunlight is the most abundant source of energy on the planet. Consequently, it has captured our interest. Certain microalgae possess the ability to capture solar energy and transfer it to the energy carrier, H<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub> is a valuable fuel, because its combustion produces only one by-product: water. However, the establishment of an efficient biophotolytic H<sub>2</sub> production system is hindered by three main obstacles: (1) the hydrogen-evolving enzyme, [FeFe]-hydrogenase, is highly sensitive to oxygen; (2) energy conversion efficiencies are not economically viable; and (3) hydrogen-producing organisms are sensitive to stressful conditions in large-scale production systems. This study aimed to circumvent the oxygen sensitivity of this process with a cyclic hydrogen production system. This approach required a mutant that responded to high temperatures by reducing oxygen evolution. To that end, we randomly mutagenized the green microalgae, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, to generate mutants that exhibited temperature-sensitive photoautotrophic growth. The selected mutants were further characterized by their ability to evolve oxygen and hydrogen at 25 and 37 °C. We identified four candidate mutants for this project. We characterized these mutants with PSII fluorescence, P700 absorbance, and immunoblotting analyses. Finally, we demonstrated that these mutants could function in a prototype hydrogen-producing bioreactor. These mutant microalgae represent a novel approach for sustained hydrogen production.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>Hydrogen

id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Photosynthesis is one of the most important life-sustaining reactions on our planet. It provides the energy required for the survival of all life forms, and it underlies the accumulation of fossil fuels, the main source of energy for sustaining modern human lifestyles (Barber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>; Nelson and Yocum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). The evolution of photosynthesis is a prime example of a highly complex process that enabled the development of current life forms on earth. Photosynthesis was established on earth more than 3.5 billion years ago under anaerobic conditions (Falkowski and Isozaki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>; Blankenship and Hartman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>; Bendall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>). Oxygenic photosynthesis, which evolved shortly thereafter, used light energy and water to produce reducing equivalents. These equivalents could be used as chemical energy, and oxygen evolved as a by-product. About 1.5 billion years passed before metal compounds in the oceans and on the earth’s surface were oxidized, which allowed oxygen to accumulate in the atmosphere (Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). During that period, oxygenic photosynthesis was limited by a shortage of oxidized electron acceptors, which are plentiful on the current earth surface. Arguably, protons served as a sink for the excess electrons, resulting in hydrogen molecules, most of which left earth, due to their light atomic weight, which allowed it to achieve escape velocity (11.2 km/s) at normal temperatures (Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). Although this mechanism may not seem necessary in the present oxygen-rich atmosphere, it was discovered that some bacteria, microalgae, and cyanobacteria exhibited light-dependent hydrogen evolution (Gest and Kamen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1949</xref>; Lambert and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1977</xref>; Amon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1961</xref>). The enzyme responsible for this reaction uses electrons delivered by the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC), and this enzyme is highly sensitive to oxygen. Therefore, the reaction occurs strictly under anoxic conditions in the light. Within this framework, the notion of exploiting the photosynthetic apparatus to transform the most abundant energy source on our planet into the cleanest fuel is quite tempting (Kruse and Hankamer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Under strict anaerobic conditions, certain microalgae express the <italic>HYDA</italic> gene. This gene encodes a highly active, but oxygen-sensitive, [FeFe]-hydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to form H<sub>2</sub> (Happe and Kaminski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>). This hydrogenase is localized in the chloroplast stroma, coupled to the reducing site of the photosynthetic ETC (Winkler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). The photosynthetic ETC is composed of several enzymes, most of which are embedded in the thylakoid membranes. The ETC is powered by light, which excites the reaction centers of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI). Light excitation of PSII results in the oxidation of water and the released electrons are transferred to PSI. When PSI is excited by light, these electrons are used to reduce ferredoxin (Nelson and Yocum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>; Nelson and Ben-Shem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Amunts and Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>; Nelson and Junge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). Ferredoxin may then supply reducing equivalents to [FeFe]-hydrogenase, which reduces protons to form H<sub>2</sub> (Florin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>). PSI is indispensable for ferredoxin-dependent hydrogen production. Hydrogen production mainly takes place in the light (Redding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>). However, in the light, the hydrogenase is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by PSII-induced O<sub>2</sub> production (Ghirardi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>; Yacoby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). PSII is not directly essential for hydrogen production, because electrons from other sources can be fed into the ETC by transferring them to the PQ-pool (Stuart and Gaffron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1972</xref>; Melis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>). However, the main non-photosynthetic electron source for reducing the PQ-pool is starch, which is produced by PSII-dependent photosynthesis (Hemschemeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Before we can even consider the option of exploiting this mechanism for mass hydrogen production, we must overcome three major challenges. The first challenge is to spatially separate oxygen and hydrogen production to prevent combustion to water and to promote the required anoxic conditions. The second challenge is to convert light energy efficiently, to ensure that the process is economically viable. The third challenge is the inevitable sensitivity of the target organism to external agents, such as chemicals, viruses, and stress conditions.</p><p id="Par5">In an attempt to circumvent the oxygen sensitivity of photosynthetic hydrogen production, a system has been proposed that requires an organism with a temperature-sensitive PSII (Mazor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>). At low temperatures, this organism would perform regular oxygenic photosynthesis and accumulate starch; at high temperatures, PSII would be inactive, and anaerobic conditions would be sustained in the light. Then, hydrogen production could take place, provided that the photosynthetic electron flow is maintained by pumping electrons from starch through the plastoquinone. This kind of organism would be cycled between two growth chambers, with different temperatures; hence, it would alternate between aerobic biomass production and anaerobic hydrogen production.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we used random mutagenesis on the model organism, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, to generate an organism with a temperature-sensitive PSII. Mutated <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells with the required phenotype were selected, identified, and characterized. These mutants were able to produce hydrogen, and we constructed a prototype photosynthetic hydrogen-producing bioreactor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Random mutagenesis and screening</title><p id="Par7"><italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> wild-type, strain 1A+, was grown in liquid TAP medium (Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>) to mid-log phase.

After UV exposure, plates were maintained in the light at 25 °C, until the surviving cells grew to visible colonies. Single colonies were resuspended in water and re-plated on three TAP agar plates. Of these, two plates lacked acetate (photoautotrophic) and were maintained in light, one at 25 °C and the other at 35 °C; the third plate was maintained in light at 35 °C.

An important feature of our proposed hydrogen-producing bioreactor was the ability to exchange gases, particularly hydrogen, from the aqueous culture to the gas phase of the acclimated chamber. Therefore, we tested hydrogen production and diffusion through silicon tubes in a prototype bioreactor consisting only of the anaerobic hydrogen production chamber. The mutant TSP2 was adapted to 37 °C for 24 h and transferred to a sealed, anaerobic bottle. The adapted culture was pumped through the prototype bioreactor. The mutant could produce hydrogen in the silicon tubes, which diffused immediately into the anaerobic chamber, at the same rate achieved in a sealed bottle.

In contrast, these mutants maintained oxygen respiration at wild-type levels. Before the end of the 24-h incubation, all mutants, but no wild-type cultures, reached a point where oxygen uptake by respiration was higher than oxygen production. Thus, mutants exhibited net oxygen consumption in the light.</p><p id="Par21">The net oxygen consumption condition is absolutely necessary for our proposed system to maintain anoxic conditions and enable hydrogen production. In fact, at 37 °C, all four mutants evolved hydrogen continuously in the light, over the period of 3 days. The average hydrogen production rates during the most productive day ranged between 0.5 and 11.7 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>. With the addition of DCMU or in the dark, the hydrogen production rates were 0.5–1.5 or 0.13 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> in all mutant and wild-type cultures. Hence, the observed hydrogen production in the mutant cultures was mainly light dependent, and the hydrogenase received electrons through the photosynthetic ETC from residual PSII activity as well as from other sources. However, we observed different amounts of light-dependent hydrogen production among the various mutants, mainly due to a differential residual PSII contribution. This residual PSII activity raises the question of which reducing equivalent source was used for respiration to sustain anoxic conditions in the mutants. Acetate present in the media might have contributed to respiration. However, an acetate independent respiration would be desirable and starch accumulation remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par22">Each of the selected TSP mutants exhibited unique properties. They showed different PSII inactivation time courses, different changes in the amounts of PSII subunits, and different levels of oxygen evolution recovery upon return to the permissive temperature. Mutant TSP1 exhibited a reduced ability to evolve oxygen in light at 37 °C over the entire incubation time. In addition, PSII fluorescence decreased to 60 % of wild-type levels, and D1 and CP43 also decreased to minimal amounts. The oxidized half-life of P700 was unaltered, which suggested that, despite the lower PSII activity, these cultures maintained electron transfer to PSI. However, the amount of P700 was 30 % lower than that in wild-type cultures. Nevertheless, PSII independent hydrogen production reached the highest value in this mutant, suggesting that PSI is not a limiting factor. Still, residual PSII activity was the main contributor for hydrogen production, at a lower rate compared to the TSP2 and TSP3 mutants.</p><p id="Par23">In the TSP2 mutant, the OER decreased steadily, from 6 to 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, until it reached around 0 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, which was maintained thereafter. This scenario is optimal for our proposed system. Water oxidation continued to provide electrons for hydrogen production, but not at a rate that could compromise the maintenance of the required anoxic conditions. Fluorescence measurements and the detection of D1 and CP43 suggested that at least the core complex of PSII was not damaged at any point during the incubation. Furthermore, P700 levels are like in the wild type. These optimal conditions gave rise to the highest observed hydrogen production rate: 11.7 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p id="Par24">In the TSP3 mutant, the OER decreased steadily, as observed in the TSP2 mutant, until it reached an OER of around 0 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> at 24 h; thereafter it decreased only minimally. PSII fluorescence remained at wild-type levels up to 18 h of incubation, and then declined by 25 % at 24 h. Immunoblots revealed reduced D1 and CP43 levels at 24 h of incubation. TSP3 had 20–40 % higher amounts of P700 than wild-type microalgae, over the period of incubation, and they exhibited the same half-life for oxidized P700. The higher amounts of P700 did not increase significantly the PSII independent hydrogen production rate, suggesting again that P700 is not a limiting factor. As well in this mutant, PSII was the main contributor for hydrogen production. The productivity was somewhat higher than in the TSP1 mutant and quite lower than in the TSP2 mutant. This suggests a further decline of PSII after the adaptation time of 24 h.</p><p id="Par25">In the TSP4 mutant, the OER decreased to almost 0 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> after only 6 h of incubation; after 12 h, oxygen production was completely absent. PSII fluorescence was also completely absent, starting at 12 h and continuing throughout the study period. D1 and CP43 levels were practically undetectable on immunoblots. This most severe phenotype had also an effect on P700 reduction. After 12 h of incubation, the half-life of oxidized P700 was 12–14 ms, or about twice the half-life observed in wild-type microalgae. Furthermore, the amount of P700 decreased by 30 % after 12 h of incubation. These features resulted in a relatively low hydrogen production rate (0.5 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>). Nevertheless, this rate was higher than the rate achieved in the dark. Hence, although no electrons could be delivered from water oxidation, PSI delivered electrons for hydrogen production.</p><p id="Par26">A crucial element in our proposed cyclic hydrogen production system is the ability of mutants to return to the wild-type photosynthetic phenotype after a cycle of hydrogen production. This feature was achieved in all four mutants; after 24 h at 37 °C, all mutants recovered the wild-type phenotype upon incubation at 25 °C.</p><p id="Par27">Several previous studies were conducted to establish an economically viable method for large-scale photosynthetic hydrogen production systems. Many focused on generating an O<sub>2</sub>-insensitive hydrogenase (Bandyopadhyay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; Burgess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). That system would be beneficial, because it includes PSII to supply a maximal amount of electrons for hydrogen production. However, no significant decrease in O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity has been achieved; furthermore, that system would not include the necessary spatial separation of oxygen and hydrogen to prevent combustion.</p><p id="Par28">The most common protocol for achieving sustained H<sub>2</sub> production in the light was sulfur starvation (Melis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>; Melis and Happe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>). In that protocol, cultures are grown normally under aerobic conditions, and then they are centrifuged and resuspended in sulfur-depleted media. Upon sulfur deprivation, cells are unable to synthesize proteins that contain sulfur, like D1. Because the D1 protein of PSII has a short half-life, it must be continuously replaced by newly synthesized D1 to ensure PSII activity. Therefore, this protocol causes a reduction in PSII activity over the first 20–30 h, but oxygen respiration is maintained (Kosourov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>). As a result, anoxic conditions are reached in a closed environment, and hydrogen production takes place over several days, with maximal hydrogen production rates of 4–6 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> under standard conditions and up to 9.4 nmol µg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> under optimized growth conditions (Kosourov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>). Eventually, the cells die from sulfur starvation. In that system, the reduction in PSII activity causes a reduction in energy conversion efficiency; however, it enables sustained hydrogen production over a long period of time.</p><p id="Par29">It has been calculated that biophotolytic energy conversion efficiencies must be around 5 % for economic viability (Kruse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>); currently, efficiencies of around 1 % have been achieved with sulfur deprivation (Kruse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). Many different approaches to the sulfur starvation system have been investigated in endeavors to increase hydrogen production efficiencies (Burgess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). Those studies raised the hope that 5 % energy conversion efficiencies might be achievable in that system. However, the system may not be realizable at large scales, due to the impracticality of transferring cells into sulfur-depleted media. Furthermore, the cell death caused by sulfur starvation limits this system to a batch process. Therefore, direct regulation of PSII in a controlled, simple manner would be more practical in an analogous system. Rochaix and colleagues attempted the latter approach with an inducible promoter. That protocol proved to be an effective method for controlling hydrogen production without inducing fatal stress to the cells; thus, cyclic hydrogen production is achievable in that system (Surzycki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>). However, the promotor was induced by copper; therefore, cell transfer between copper-containing and copper-free media remains an obstacle for upscaling the protocol.</p><p id="Par30">The present study described a system that employed TSP mutants and induction of anoxic conditions by increasing the incubation temperature. These conditions triggered hydrogen production at the same rates achieved by the sulfur starvation protocol. However in our system, cells were not exposed to deadly stress, and they could be recycled by simply reducing the temperature. Thus, these TSP mutants provide a convenient platform for increasing hydrogen production by physical means to achieve 5 % energy conversion efficiencies in a platform that is amenable to upscaling.</p><p id="Par31">The upscale system would require two compartments: one for accumulating biomass and the other for producing hydrogen. The first compartment could be an open pond, which is currently used industrially to grow <italic>Dunaliella</italic> for producing B-carotene (Ben-Amotz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1989</xref>; Oren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>). The second compartment should be a tubular reactor composed of transparent, H2-permeable tubing. This reactor must be enclosed in a translucent, airtight chamber. The second compartment was successfully tested, on a small scale, in the present study. In the absence of air convection, the temperature could be increased in the second compartment without an external energy source; this feature could facilitate the development of the mutant phenotype and allow efficient hydrogen production. Hydrogen then could diffuse through the tubing and accumulate in the airtight compartment for collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">In this work, we created TSP mutants of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> that could alternate between oxygenic photosynthesis and anoxic hydrogen production, in response to changes in temperature. This approach represented a solution to the challenge posed by the oxygen sensitivity of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Our protocol was an analogous, however viable, alternative to the sulfur starvation protocol for sustained hydrogen production. Consequently, these mutants are an adequate system for upscaling sustained hydrogen production.
