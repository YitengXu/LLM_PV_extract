(QDs) as the light-absorbing material have seen rapid advances in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> from the first certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3% reported in 2010 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>) to &gt;7% last year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These high-performance certified devices have used PbS QDs, and are notable for their low cost of fabrication and ability to efficiently harvest the near-infrared portion of the solar spectrum. Furthermore, the measurement of external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) above 100% using PbSe QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> demonstrates the potential of these devices for surpassing the Shockley–Queisser limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> by employing carrier multiplication. Although recent progress in QD photovoltaics (PVs) based on Pb<italic>X</italic> (<italic>X</italic>=S, Se) QDs is promising, major challenges to reaching commercializable efficiencies remain. The primary factor limiting performance of these devices is high recombination losses in the active layer due to presence of charge traps that originate from surface states. This results in short diffusion lengths for minority carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> in QD solids and ultimately limits the thickness of the active layer to &lt;500 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), which is insufficient for complete absorption of incident photons. Furthermore, the <italic>p–n</italic> heterojunction architecture requires fine control over carrier doping in order to tune the depletion width, which is another outstanding challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The high atomic fraction of toxic lead atoms and the generally poor stability of Pb<italic>X</italic> QDs under ambient conditions further complicate commercialization of this emerging technology, although PbS QD solar cells have been demonstrated with 1,000 h stability under continuous illumination in air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Working principles of colloidal QD solar cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of a typical thin-film <italic>p–n</italic> junction QD PV (PbS QDs are purple circles, the contacts are omitted); high recombination losses due to the long paths for minority carriers to reach the electrode ultimately limit the thickness of the QD layer.

In sensitized PVs, a meso-porous (mp) TiO<sub>2</sub> anode decorated with a narrow-gap absorber is contacted by an electrolyte solution that provides a conductive pathway to a metal or semiconductor cathode (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This architecture avoids inefficient QD-to-QD carrier transport by employing discrete interfacial charge-transfer steps in which a photo-excited electron transfers from the QD to TiO<sub>2</sub>, while the remaining hole is reduced by the electrolyte (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Traditionally this device architecture has utilized dye molecules as light absorbers/sensitizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The best dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) reach efficiencies in excess of 10%, with a current record of 12.3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, despite the large promise, widespread application of DSSCs is complicated by inherent limitations of the dyes themselves, which usually contain low-abundance elements such as ruthenium, have limited absorption bandwidth and suffer from photo-bleaching and poor long-term chemical stability, particularly under strong illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">To circumvent the drawbacks of dyes, several groups have explored replacing them with QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The investigated approaches include infusion of pre-synthesized colloidal QDs into the mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) and direct growth of semiconductor clusters within the matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This latter method was used to achieve the highest reported (yet uncertified) efficiency of 5.6% in structures comprising PbS:Hg QDs deposited with a successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These devices however were highly unstable and degraded over a period of minutes, meaning that accurate characterization of their performance was extremely difficult due to transient changes in device characteristics.</p><p id="Par7">In principle, colloidal QD sensitizers can have several advantages over SILAR-deposited QDs that arise from the ability to synthesize them under optimal conditions. This allows for much better control over size, composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, shape and heterostructuring, and generally results in QDs with improved crystallinity and stability. Indeed, we recently reported proof-of-principle sensitized solar cells utilizing colloidally synthesized CuInSe<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub> (CISeS) QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This previous work was a synthesis-focused effort on optimizing QD structural parameters for achieving more complete coverage of the solar spectrum, enhancing QD surface chemistry for multi-day stability and maximizing the loading of QDs into the pores of the TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix. In the course of this study, we determined that the optimal QD parameters corresponded to the CuInSe<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub> alloy with <italic>x</italic>=1.4 and an averaged QD size of ~4.5 nm (in these pyramidal QDs, size is the measured length from an apex to the midpoint of the opposing edge of the triangular projections observed in TEM images). Without exploring the parameter space extensively, we also noted that exposing the QDs to Cd-oleate could be beneficial to QD-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) performance. With an energy gap (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>) of ~1.3 eV, the optimized CISeS QDs allowed for ~100% absorption and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~45% (at 3 eV) and an overall uncertified PCE of 3.5% in the best devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> QDSSCs based on CuInS<sub>2</sub> QDs (without Se) have also been reported in recent years with uncertified efficiencies as high as 4.7%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; however, the maximum photocurrent achievable for this material is roughly the same as for CdSe QDs due to the relatively large bulk band-gap.</p><p id="Par8">In the present report we reveal a crucial effect of CISeS QD surface properties on device performance. Specifically, by utilizing inorganic passivation of the QDs with partial cation exchange using Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions prior to sensitization, we suppress non-radiative recombination, which otherwise can outcompete fairly slow (&gt;5 ns) electron transfer into the mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode. Further, we demonstrate the importance of recapping with short ligands in order to achieve efficient sensitization via direct attachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In addition, we optimize the electrolyte composition and reveal the critical importance of improved wetting through methanol addition for achieving high performance in these liquid-junction solar cells. We find that in addition to improving short-circuit current, tuning electrolyte composition allows us to reduce series resistance of the devices and thus increase the fill factor (FF). A further improvement in FF is obtained via the utilization of a meso-textured, high-surface-area Cu<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S cathode. These coordinated efforts to understand and optimize the various stages of the photoconversion process have allowed us to achieve a record-long stability of several months under ambient conditions, the first-ever certified efficiency of 5.1% and a champion efficiency of 5.5%, which are record values for this emerging class of PV devices and among the highest reported for QD PVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and surface modification of CISeS QDs</title><p id="Par9">The synthesis of colloidal CISeS QDs uses 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) as an effective yet low-cost solvent, ligand and sulphur precursor; controlled amounts of trioctylphosphine selenide (TOP-Se) are added to produce an alloy of reduced band-gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This synthetic approach results in pyramidally shaped CuInSe<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub> QDs (inset in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) with <italic>x</italic> as high as ~1.6 (that is 80% Se anions, as measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)). Utilizing as-synthesized CISeS QDs results in relatively poor PV performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which is primarily due to significant non-radiative losses associated with surface traps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To address this issue, following the synthesis of the QDs, we treat them with a zinc oleate (Zn-oleate) solution, which results in temperature-controllable Zn<sup>2+</sup> exchange with surface Cu<sup>1+</sup> and In<sup>3+</sup>, cations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). This procedure leads to a strong reduction in surface-related trap states as evidenced by an increase in the PL intensity (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and a lengthening of the PL lifetime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The suppression of non-radiative recombination also manifests as increased open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, from 0.33 V for untreated QDs to as high as 0.54 V in the case of the optimal treatment with Zn<sup>2+</sup> at 100 °C) and short-circuit current (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>, from 2.7–6.0 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>) in devices (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; details can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). However, as the degree of cation exchange increases, a maximum in device performance is quickly reached, and <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> then decreases even as the PL efficiency of QDs in solution increases (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We attribute this phenomenon to partial suppression of electron transfer to TiO<sub>2</sub> by the increasingly thick Zn-rich surface layer, which serves as a barrier due to its significantly higher-lying conduction band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This observation suggests that electron transfer to TiO<sub>2</sub> is fairly slow, especially after cation exchange with Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and is likely characterized by timescales comparable to those of exciton recombination in the QDs (tens of nanoseconds)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Passivation of QD surfaces via cation exchange.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the QDs before and after exposure to Zn-oleate at various temperatures after recapping with tert-butylamine (tBA).

On the other hand, ZnS deposited by SILAR may provide the benefits of inorganic passivation but without creating a barrier at the QD/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In a comparison study, when a ZnS SILAR post-treatment (two monolayers) is applied to non-cation-exchanged CISeS QD-sensitized TiO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, orange curve), the enhancement is similar yet slightly less pronounced than the colloidal/cation-exchange method.</p><p id="Par11">While we have observed real performance enhancement using cation exchange with Zn<sup>2+</sup>, the tendency of thicker Zn-rich surface layers to act as barriers to charge extraction is ultimately limiting. An isovalent alternative to Zn<sup>2+</sup> is Cd<sup>2+</sup>; importantly, Cd(Se, S) has a lower-lying conduction band than Zn(Se, S) and therefore it might present a smaller (if any) barrier to electron transfer. We observe that the effect of cadmium oleate (Cd-oleate) exposure on CISeS QDs’ optical properties is approximately the same as with Zn-oleate (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>: absorption remains essentially unchanged, while the PL intensities (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and lifetimes dramatically increase. However, analysis of the composition with ICP-OES (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>) indicates that Cd-oleate is more reactive towards CISeS QDs at low temperature and results in a more aggressive exchange of cations. Comparing the performance of QDSSCs made from QDs treated with Zn-oleate (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) and Cd-oleate (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) at various temperatures, we find that while Zn-treated QDs (PCE of 1.91%) show a significant improvement over untreated QDs (0.38%), Cd treatment produces even a greater enhancement in the PV performance (3.34%). The best devices incorporated CISeS QDs treated at 50 °C, which corresponded to the mildest exposure to Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions with a resulting overall amount of cadmium in the sensitized film of &lt;0.5 atomic %. The extremely low content of Cd in these devices significantly reduces concerns of potential toxicity relative to the already widely used CdTe thin-film solar cells.</p><p id="Par12">After Cd-treated QDs are recapped with short ligands (chosen from those in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), they are incorporated into a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode via soaking in dilute QD–octane or methanol solutions. We found that the identity of the ligand had a major impact on device performance. We observe that <italic>tert</italic>-butylamine (tBA), <italic>n</italic>-butylamine (nBA) and <italic>sec</italic>-butylamine (sBA) are equally effective at achieving high QD-loading according to optical absorption measurements (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Unlike most QDSSC reports, we achieve this high degree of loading (using butylamine) by direct attachment without the assistance of a high electric field (electrophoretic deposition)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> or bifunctional linkers (for example, MPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the use of the native ligands (oleylamine and DDT), mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA) or pyridine resulted in much poorer loading. Accordingly, we found that the choice of the ligand did not affect <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, but did have a significant effect on <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Typically, improvement in only <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> would indicate that enhanced light-harvesting is the primary reason for the benefit of using the butylamines, rather than a reduction in recombination losses, which would be expected to impact <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> as well. However, in liquid-junction cells the absorber band-gap (that is, QD band-gap) can be well in excess of the maximum attainable <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, which is determined by the energy difference between the TiO<sub>2</sub> Fermi level and the redox potential of the electrolyte. In this case, the relationship between recombination, open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current is not as trivial as with solid-state solar cells, and so we can’t fully rule out differences in recombination using these ligands. In fact, we do observe differences in the absorption-normalized PL intensity (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) from QDs recapped with these ligands in solution (prior to sensitization), which indicates differences in non-radiative recombination related to surface traps. Therefore, in addition to differences in loading, <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> may also be impacted by non-radiative recombination within the QD absorbers. At this time we do not have a complete understanding of why sBA and nBA show poorer performance than tBA, but we note that the lower PL intensity (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) from QDs recapped with these isomers may implicate recombination as a factor. Furthermore, we find that devices made using QDs recapped with nBA show a surprisingly poor stability (blue curves on <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) compared with sBA and tBA, which could also be related to the particular ineffectiveness of nBA at surface-trap passivation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Organic passivation of QDs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Molecular structures of ligands investigated in this work.

In order to elucidate the importance of electrolyte parameters, we explored dilution of the electrolyte with methanol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Zewdu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> reported a synergistic effect of methanol in combination with a ZnS SILAR treatment of CdSe/CdS-sensitized TiO<sub>2</sub>, which was preliminarily attributed to improved wetting of the photoanode by the electrolyte. In our experiments, we observe a significantly greater improvement in the PV performance upon addition of methanol than previously seen. Specifically, as the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte (2 M Na<sub>2</sub>S and 2 M S) is diluted with methanol (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), the measurements of current–voltage (<italic>J–V</italic>) characteristics indicate a greatly increased photocurrent and a reduced series resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>series</sub>, determined as the inverse of the slope of the <italic>J–V</italic> curve at the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>), which leads to a higher FF. Reduced <italic>R</italic><sub>series</sub> is likely due to the lower viscosity of methanol (0.54 mPa s) relative to water (0.89 mPa s), enabling faster ionic transport (ionic mobility increases with decreasing solvent viscosity). The enhancement in the photocurrent however can be caused by several effects. In our studies, we have considered three possibilities: (1) methanol can potentially act as a sacrificial electron donor aiding in the reduction of photogenerated holes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; (2) it could improve electron injection efficiency by lowering the Fermi level of the TiO<sub>2</sub> film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and (3) it can lead to better contact between the QDs and the electrolyte due to improved wetting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Dependence of device performance on the electrolyte composition.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Current density versus voltage characteristics under simulated sunlight for QDSSCs with varying amounts of methanol in the electrolyte (reducing the polysulfide concentration by dilution).

Furthermore, we observe in a control study that the PL QY from QD-sensitized films immersed in water or methanol without electrolyte is more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of the same films with electrolyte (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Similar observations have been made in DSSCs where dye molecules remain oxidized for orders of magnitude longer timescales in the absence of a redox electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This result suggests that in pure methanol, holes are not removed from the QDs, which leads to a build-up of a net positive charge in photo-excited QDs and associated activation of a fast non-radiative decay channel via Auger recombination of charged excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">This assessment is confirmed by transient absorption (TA) studies of carrier dynamics in QD-sensitized films upon their exposure to various solvents (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b). In the case of dry methanol, the decay is dominated by a fast 20–50 ps component, which is consistent with Auger recombination of a positively charged exciton (positive trion), a process in which the electron-hole recombination energy is transferred to a pre-existing hole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (left inset in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). This suggests that the hole remaining in the QD following electron transfer to TiO<sub>2</sub> is not reduced by methanol in the absence of electrolyte and still remains in the QD when it absorbs the next photon. On the other hand, the QD hole is efficiently regenerated in the presence of electrolyte: the measured dynamics are nearly identical to those of isolated QDs dispersed in solution, which is dominated by recombination of neutral excitons (right inset in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). We also observe a less pronounced ~400 ps decay component in methanol that we attribute to surface traps that are effectively passivated by the electrolyte. Further, these TA measurements conducted on samples exposed to electrolyte also provide a lower limit for the characteristic time of electron transfer of &gt;5 ns, which is surprisingly long compared with some previous reports on photo-excited dynamics at QD-metal oxide interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, this long time scale is consistent with our observation that various types of QD surface modification lead to correlated changes in QD PL emission efficiency and their performance in PV devices. These correlations would not have been observed if electron transfer was significantly faster than competing recombination mechanisms in isolated QDs.</p><p id="Par18">Next, we analyse the potential effect of methanol on the Fermi level of TiO<sub>2</sub>. It is known that methanol can modify TiO<sub>2</sub> surface structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> or undergo photochemical reactions in the presence of a catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Reactions between TiO<sub>2</sub> and methanol could increase photocurrent yield if they lead to a lowering of the TiO<sub>2</sub> Fermi level (that is, if TiO<sub>2</sub> is oxidized as a result of the reaction), as this would make electron injection from QDs even more favourable. In order to see the effects of intentional oxidation of a TiO<sub>2</sub> anode, we use Li<sup>+</sup> ions that are known to effectively remove electrons from the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>). This approach has been utilized to realize ~100% electron injection efficiency in CdSe-QDSSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. When we add Li<sub>2</sub>S to the electrolyte at 50% methanol concentration, we do indeed observe an increase in <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>; however, it is accompanied by a reduction in the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Both of these are anticipated results of a lower TiO<sub>2</sub> Fermi level, which in addition to increasing <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> should also reduce the energy offset between the anode Fermi level and the electrolyte redox potential, decreasing <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>. If methanol were also oxidizing TiO<sub>2</sub>, then we would expect <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> to be reduced with increasing methanol content, which is not observed; in fact, increasing amounts of methanol, if anything, lead to higher V<sub>oc</sub> (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Finally, we analyse the third possibility, namely that improved wetting of the QD/TiO<sub>2</sub> surface by the methanolic electrolyte solution can facilitate hole extraction from the QDs and thus improve <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>. The degree of wetting of a solid material by a liquid depends on the relative surface tensions of the three joining interfaces (that is, <italic>γ</italic><sub>gas–liquid</sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub>gas–solid</sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub>liquid–solid</sub>). As the electrolyte solvent changes from water to methanol, only the two tensions involving the liquid will be modified. Estimating the surface tension of mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>/QDs with various solvents (that is, <italic>γ</italic><sub>liquid–solid</sub>) in an actual device is complicated by the high surface/volume ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, the hydrophobicity of the ligand-passivated QD surfaces within the sensitized film, and by dramatic changes in wetting behaviour (TiO<sub>2</sub> becomes amphiphilic) under ultra-violet irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, a comparison of the well-established surface tensions between air and most solvents (that is, <italic>γ</italic><sub>gas–liquid</sub>), can be instructional in this case. The three-fold greater surface tension at a water–gas interface (<italic>γ</italic><sub>air–water</sub>=72 mN m<sup>−1</sup>) than at a methanol–gas interface (<italic>γ</italic><sub>air–methanol</sub>=23 mN m<sup>−1</sup>) means that methanol wets most surfaces better than water. In a simple test of placing a droplet of both solvents on a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> film, methanol clearly demonstrated a greater tendency to wet the surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM882">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). As photocurrent relies directly on contact between the electrolyte and the QD surface (for hole extraction), our observations of increased <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> are consistent with improved wetting by the electrolyte.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Meso-textured Cu<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S cathode</title><p id="Par20">Another critical element of a sensitized solar cell is the cathode, which has a significant effect on the overall device performance through its influence on <italic>R</italic><sub>series</sub> and thus FF.

Our simple method for making the cathode is by chemical transformation of 100-nm thick thermally evaporated Cu (on FTO) by exposure to the polysulfide electrolyte. Based on EDX measurements, the Cu<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S has an <italic>x</italic>=1.0 stoichiometry upon fabrication (that is, covellite, a <italic>p-</italic>type metal), but it becomes sulphur enriched (<italic>x</italic> of <italic>ca</italic>. 0.8) after being used in a device.

As our QDs are synthesized under excess sulphur conditions, we expected that our CISeS QDs would be chemically stable in the presence of the sulphur-based electrolyte. However, as we added more Se to reduce the band-gap of the QDs, they became less stable in the electrolyte, probably due to the replacement of Se by S anions at the surface over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The chemical incompatibility problem is typically addressed in the QDSSCs by the application of a thin insulating ZnS layer deposited by SILAR. The partial cation exchange (with Cd<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>) of QDs in our devices prior to sensitization (discussed earlier) helps solve the stability issue, and allows for stable operation of the devices for 1–2 months instead of 1–2 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To further improve the stability, we deposit two monolayers of ZnS using SILAR on photoanodes after they are sensitized with Cd-treated and tBA-recapped CISeS QDs. Following this procedure, the initial performance of a device is unchanged. However, the thin layer of ZnS seems to act as a good chemical barrier, which complements the existing barrier due to cation exchange without appreciably suppressing hole extraction into the electrolyte (ZnS deposited by SILAR is not expected to influence electron extraction, as the QD-TiO<sub>2</sub> close contacts are established prior to ZnS application). Devices with the ZnS SILAR consistently showed prolonged stability under air exposure (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), although it is worth noting that even without the ZnS layer, some devices survived for up to 2 months (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This is in drastic contrast to previously reported high-performance QDSSCs that were stable for just a few minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

We demonstrated a nanostructured Cu<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S (where <italic>x</italic>&lt;1.0) cathode can be made by a simple low-cost method, and acts as an extremely effective reducing catalyst for the polysulfide electrolyte and enabled us to achieve series resistances on par with the best DSSCs that use platinum. Recognizing the challenges in accurately characterizing PVs, and thus the difficulties in comparing between various published results, we report the first certified performance of a QDSSC at 5.1% efficiency. Our champion efficiency approaches the highest reported values for any type of QD solar cells, yet our devices do not degrade for months even if stored in air: this is orders of magnitude longer than in any previous report on QD PVs. Given the fairly low EQEs even in our record devices, we expect that with further optimization, the performance of these novel PV devices can be enhanced considerably, making them competitive with well-established dye-sensitized solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Synthesis of CISeS QDs</title><p id="Par24">CISeS QDs were synthesized via a modification of the Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Typically, 1 mmol of copper iodide and 1 mmol of indium acetate are dissolved in 5 ml of 1-dodecanethiol and 1 ml of oleylamine, and the mixture is degassed under vacuum in a 50 ml flask at 100 °C for 30 min. The solution was heated to 130 °C until it became yellow and transparent, and then degassed again for 30 min at 100 °C. The flask is then slowly heated to a growth temperature of 230 °C, but at a temperature of 220 °C, slow injection of 6 mmol of 2 M TOP-Se (~12 ml h<sup>−1</sup>) begins. After 30 min the reaction was cooled and the QDs were cleaned by dissolving in chloroform and precipitation with methanol. The precipitated QDs were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was discarded. The QDs were stored in 5 ml of octane or ODE following cleaning. The synthesis typically results &gt;90% chemical yield of QDs (relative to the copper and indium precursors).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cation exchange and recapping of QDs</title><p id="Par25">For cation exchange with Cd<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, a stock solution of 0.5 M cadmium or zinc oleate was prepared with 3:1 oleic acid:Cd/Zn dissolved in ODE. 4 ml of the cleaned QDs in ODE solution (~50 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) were added to 4 ml of 0.5 M Cd or Zn-oleate solution and the temperature was set to 50–150 °C for 10 min depending on the desired degree of cation exchange. Following cation exchange, the reaction solution was dissolved in chloroform, and then acetone was added to precipitate the QDs. The precipitated QDs were collected by centrifugation, and then dissolved in chloroform.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ligand exchange of QDs</title><p id="Par26">Following cation exchange and purification of QDs, methanol was added to precipitate the QDs from chloroform. Precipitated QDs were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was discarded.</p><p id="Par27">For tBA, nBA, sBA and pyridine recapping, the ligand was used as a solvent to dissolve the precipitated QDs with sonication used to speed up dissolution and recapping. Then, methanol was added to precipitate the QDs, which were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was discarded. The ligand was again used as a solvent to dissolve the precipitated QDs and these solutions were sonicated for a few minutes at room temperature. Methanol was added to precipitate the QDs, which were collected by centrifugation. The above process was optimized to give the highest QD-loading in the mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> film for tBA-capped QDs. The optimal conditions may be different for the other ligands. Longer exposure of the QDs to the new ligands or heating during exposure might give more complete recapping, but resulted in poorer loading, probably due to partial aggregation of QDs during recapping. The recapped QDs were dissolved in octane (~0.05 g ml<sup>−1</sup>), and the solution was centrifuged to remove large aggregates that occasionally formed during recapping. Any precipitate was discarded. The QD–octane supernatant was diluted with octane to an optical density of ~0.2 (~0.01 g ml<sup>−1</sup>) at the 1S absorption peak (typically 850 nm), and used to prepare QD-sensitized mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> films.</p><p id="Par28">For MPA recapping, the QDs were recapped by dissolving precipitated QDs in a mixture of 1:1 chloroform and MPA, then precipitating by adding methanol, and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and the QDs were dissolved in the same total volume of MPA and methanol (1:1). The solution was sonicated for a few minutes. Chloroform was added to precipitate the MPA-capped QDs, and the QDs were collected by centrifugation. The MPA-capped QDs were dissolved in methanol (~0.05–0.1 g ml<sup>−1</sup>), and the solution was centrifuged to remove aggregates that formed during recapping and to remove partially recapped QDs. The QD–methanol supernatant was diluted with methanol to an absorbance of about 0.2 (~0.01 g ml<sup>−1</sup>) at the 1S absorption peak (typically 850 nm), and used to prepare QD-sensitized mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> films.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Fabrication of QDSSCs</title><p id="Par29">Scattering and non-scattering mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> films are prepared by automated, iterative screen-printing (LS-150, New Long Seimitu Kogyo Co.) of TiO<sub>2</sub> pastes containing ~20 nm and ~400 nm TiO<sub>2</sub> particles, respectively, on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass. A dense blocking layer of TiO<sub>2</sub> is not used. The α-terpineol based pastes are fired at 500 °C for 1 h under air. The 8 μm (or 13 μm with the scattering layer) thick mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> films are sensitized by soaking in dilute QD–octane solutions for 36 h. The films were then rinsed with octane (or methanol for MPA-capped QDs) to remove unattached QDs. The cathode is fabricated by thermally evaporating 100 nm of Cu onto a FTO-coated glass substrate, and subsequent immersion in an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte (aqueous 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>S plus 1 M S) for 15 min to form Cu<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>S/FTO. The device is completed by sandwiching the electrodes around a 40–50 μm Surlyn spacer (DuPont) and sealing by heating the polymer frame. Unless otherwise noted, the devices are filled with the polysulfide electrolyte composed of 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>S and 1 M S in methanol and water (1:1). For champion devices, silver paint and Cu wires was added to the contacts. The device active area is defined by a 0.47 cm by 0.47 cm (that is, 0.2209, cm<sup>2</sup>) black metal aperture, which is slightly smaller than the mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> area. The mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> scattering layer was only used for champion devices that were certified. As our device active area is relatively large we do not see significant device to device variations. However, we fabricated two devices for each case to confirm that any trends we observe are real. Duplicates of all devices were fabricated and tested for consistency and if the performance varied by &gt;5% we repeated the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p id="Par30">TEM samples were prepared from a dilute solution of NCs in chloroform drop-cast onto Cu grids (obtained from Ted Pella) with a thin carbon film on a holey carbon support.

The excitation beam was mechanically chopped at 3 kHz and the signal was measured using a lock-in amplifier. For PL quantum yield (QY) measurements, optically dilute samples were magnetically stirred and the QY values were measured using relative technique by comparing integrated PL intensities to an IR-26 dye standard.

A square black mask (0.2209, cm<sup>2</sup>) was attached to the solar cells to precisely define the active area of the device. An additional black cardboard mask (~5 cm by 5 cm outer edges) was placed on top of the contacted device (masking area outside the 0.2209, cm<sup>2</sup> mask) immediately prior to current–voltage measurement to prevent scattering of light into the device by the contacting alligator clips.
