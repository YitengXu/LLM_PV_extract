Although nanotechnologies have been less developed in agronomy than other disciplines, due to less investment, nanotechnologies have the potential to improve agricultural production. Here, we review more than 200 reports involving nanoscience in agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture. The major points are as follows: (1) nanotechnologies used for seeds and water improved plant germination, growth, yield, and quality. (2) Nanotechnologies could increase the storage period for vegetables and fruits. (3) For livestock and poultry breeding, nanotechnologies improved animals immunity, oxidation resistance, and production and decreased antibiotic use and manure odor. For instance, the average daily gain of pig increased by 9.9–15.3 %, the ratio of feedstuff to weight decreased by 7.5–10.3 %, and the diarrhea rate decreased by 55.6–66.7 %. (4) Nanotechnologies for water disinfection in fishpond increased water quality and increased yields and survivals of fish and prawn. (5) Nanotechnologies for pesticides increased pesticide performance threefold and reduced cost by 50 %. (6) Nano urea increased the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilization by 44.5 % and the grain yield by 10.2 %, versus normal urea. (7) Nanotechnologies are widely used for rapid detection and diagnosis, notably for clinical examination, food safety testing, and animal epidemic surveillance. (8) Nanotechnologies may also have adverse effects that are so far not well known.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nanoscience and

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Concept and definition of nanotechnologies</title><p id="Par40">The term “nanomaterial” is based on the prefix “nano,” which originates from the Greek word meaning “dwarf.” More precisely, the word nano means 10<sup>−9</sup> or one billionth of a meter. The word nanomaterial is generally used for materials with a size ranging between 1 and 100 nm (Rai and Ingle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2012</xref>). Nanotechnology may be used for observing, measuring, manipulating, and manufacturing objects at the nanometer (nm) scale. A nanometer is an SI (standing for Système International d’Unitès in French) unit of length referring to 10<sup>−9</sup> or a distance of one billionth of a meter (Mongillo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2007</xref>; Can et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>). These new materials are manufactured to have unique physical or chemical properties, which arise from their small size, shape, surface area, conductivity, or surface chemistry, and have been applied in numerous ways in fields such as textiles, electronics, engineering, and medicine (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2007</xref>). Nanotechnologies involve the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, namely, at dimensions between approximately 1–100 nm, where unique phenomena such as improved physical, chemical, and biological properties may enable novel applications (Vyom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2012</xref>). Since 2000, the governments of various countries, institutional frameworks, and enterprises all have attached great importance to the research, development, and application of nanotechnologies. Some countries have also enacted relevant strategies or plans and invested substantial sums of funds to seize the strategic highland of nanotechnologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Function of nanotechnologies</title><p id="Par41">Nanotechnologies, information science technology, and life science and technology are the current mainstreams of science development; the development of which will enable human society, our living environment, and science and technology themselves to attain a higher state of development. It has also been predicted that in the next 20 to 30 years, nanotechnologies will fundamentally change the understanding and conditions of mankind and create new development opportunities for physics, chemistry, materials, biology, medical science, and other fields. Nanotechnologies can be used to operate genes freely, to produce plant and animal species with its excellent properties, and nanoparticles can be used as vectors for treating various diseases. When nano biology develops to a certain level, nanotechnologies can be used to produce nano biological cells with recognition ability and can absorb biological medicine which can inhibit cancer cells, which may then be injected into the human body to directly destroy cancer cells.</p><p id="Par42">Nanotechnologies hold great potential for creating new materials with enhanced properties. A number of nanotech-based products are finding applications in industries such as medical devices, imaging, sports, biosensing, electronics, drugs, environmental cleanup, cosmetics and sunscreens (NCPI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2011</xref>; USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>), agriculture, textiles, food, etc. (Sharon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2010</xref>; Sastry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2011</xref>). In the future, the global economy will be increasingly influenced by nanotechnologies, as more products containing nanotechnologies move from research and development into production and commerce.</p><p id="Par43">Conventional techniques of nanoparticle synthesis, which usually employ atomic, molecular, and particulate processing in vacuum or in a liquid medium, are capital intensive (Mandal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2006</xref>; Anandan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>) and inefficient in terms of material and energy usage (Pugazhenthiran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2009</xref>). A large number of nanoparticles were synthesized by using fungi and widely used in all professions and trades at home and abroad (Kashyap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mechanisms of nanotechnologies</title><p id="Par44">The changes of water clusters treated with nanotechnologies through ultraviolet absorption spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The light absorption of water treated with nanotechnologies on ultraviolet absorption spectrum was strengthened at the wave band of 190–325 nm, which illustrated that the structure and energy state of water molecule had changed. <sup>17</sup>O-NMR half peak width of water became narrow and the chemical shift decreased and moved toward low field. Water treated with nanotechnologies had smaller micelle and higher activity (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2008a</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">The half peak width size of water <sup>17</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-NMR reflects the degree of association of water, which is the size of molecules (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2002</xref>). When the half peak width is large, the molecule size is also large and vice versa (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2004</xref>). The half peak width size of water without nanotechnologies treatment is 126 Hz; however, the half peak width sizes of water with treatments of different nano devices are 68–124 Hz, which is smaller than those of untreated water half peak width (decreased by 1.59–46.03 %), showing that the molecule size of water becomes smaller after nanotechnology treatment. The absorption spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance results demonstrated that the associative structure of the molecules was changed in water after nanotechnology (devices) treatment. The half peak width of the <sup>17</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-NMR became narrow, chemical displacement was decreased and moved to lower fields, and activity of water was enhanced (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2008a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Photocatalyst sterilization and promotion of photosynthesis</title><p id="Par46">Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is a kind of photocatalyst, it can stimulate electrons on material surfaces under ultraviolet radiation, which in turn may continuously induce energy transition, then causing electrons to escape and form a hole (positive hole), with strong oxidation ability and electrons with strong reducing ability.</p><p id="Par47">The photochemical reaction equation of hole/electron pair produced by photocatalyst (TiO<sub>2</sub>) under light is as follows: TiO<sub>2</sub> + light energy (hv) → electron (e<sup>−</sup>) + positive hole (h<sup>+</sup>). The hole/electron reacts with the object surface and water in the air, and then reactive free radicals (positive hole) are produced as follows: (h+) + water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O) → OH + H<sup>+</sup>, electron (e<sup>−</sup>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) → reactive oxygen species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>). The oxidation-reduction reaction takes place between the hole/electron pairs produced by photocatalyst reaction and organics on the matter surface and in the air, which may then be completely oxidized to water and other innocuous substances. On the other hand, reactive oxygen nanotechnologies, hydroxyl radicals [HO], and other active substances can be generated after the reaction of hole/electron pairs and on the matter surface and water in the air (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2005</xref>). The active substances have a strong oxygenation effect, which not only can oxidize and destroy the cell membranes of the organics of bacteria and fungi, solidify viral proteins, and kill bacteria, but also can decompose harmful complexes released by the microorganisms which have been killed. Furthermore, the active substances can completely oxidize and destroy organic chemical pollutants, so as to achieve effects of environmental cleansing and deodorization. The antibacterial property test results of the photocatalyst-spraying agents also indicated that the respective average bacteriostasis rates on <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> at 24 h were 97.7, 97.3, and 93.3 % after treatment with photocatalyst-spraying agents.</p><p id="Par48">Photosynthesis refers to a process in which green plants use solar energy and convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and release oxygen. 2H<sub>2</sub>O + chloroplast + light energy → 4H + O<sub>2</sub> + 4e − CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + green cells + light energy → (CH<sub>2</sub>O) + O<sub>2</sub>. Under ultraviolet light, TiO<sub>2</sub> can independently hydrolyze light into electrons, protons, and oxygen, in which the produced electron and proton go into an electron transfer chain of plants in the light reaction stage, thus improving the speed of photosynthesis (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2005</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2008c</xref>). Due to the fact that the photocatalyst TiO<sub>2</sub> is not involved in the above reaction process, the reaction may be repeated and the photocatalyst may play a role for a long period of time. Compared with that of the general antibacterial agent silver and copper, the TiO<sub>2</sub> has much more thorough bactericidal efficacy, and the sterilization effect may reach as high as 99.997 %.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The conditions of nanotechnologies in China</title><p id="Par49">The research on nanotechnologies date from the late 1980s, and development and application began in the middle of 1990s in China. At present, significant progress in the aspects of leading edge fundamental research of nanoscience, application and achievement transformation, and infrastructure construction have been obtained. China already has become world nanometer scientific and technological power; partial fundamental researches have occupied the international advanced level. A number of published papers which recorded by science citation index (SCI) which concern nanotechnologies published by Chinese scientists have exceeded the American’s, ranked no. 1, and the papers cited frequency ranked no. 2 in the world. The number of application for or authorization of patent for invention related to the nanoscience was increased significantly, ranked no. 2 in the world (Nanometer science and technology in China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The number of patent for invention related to the fields of superfine materials and nanotechnology which have opened to the public reached 1024: among them 827 were referring to the materials, which accounted for 80.8 % and occupied absolute dominant position; 28 (2.7 %) were referring to electron; 41 (4.0 %) were referring to medicine and drug; and 128 (12.5 %) were referring to others. The above results demonstrated that the investment in the research of nanomaterials is larger, while the research on the nano electronics, nano medicine, and nano pharmaceutics were weak. The investment of nanotechnologies in agricultural fields is much less, and the nano technologies and nano products were available for using less as well.

When the addition contents of Se in feed were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/kg, there were no significantly different effects among the three Se sources of sodium selenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>), selenomethionine, and nano Se on the growth performance of broilers at the same levels (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, when the addition amount of Se was 0.5 mg/kg, the growth performances of the broiler chickens in the nano Se group were significantly higher than those of the selenomethionine and sodium selenite group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, when the addition contents of Se in feed were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/kg, there were no significant difference among the effects of the three Se sources on glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of the sera and tissues of broilers at the same addition level (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, when the addition amount of Se was 0.5 mg/kg, then the effects of selenomethionine and sodium selenite on the activity of glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity were dramatically reduced in comparison to those with the addition of 0.5 mg/kg of the same source of Se (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05); in addition, the levels of reactive oxygen species and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while there were no significant changes in the nano Se group (Cai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Application of nanotechnologies in pig industry</title><p id="Par75">Diarrhea is a common intestina1 disease with high morbidity and mortality, seriously affecting the growth performance and survival of piglets. Due to the restricted use of antibiotics, new feed additives or drugs have been paid more and more attention. Nano-zinc oxide and montmorillonite were widely used as anti-diarrhea agents in piglets (Qing and Xiao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2013</xref>). Microelements of Se and Zn are the essential elements for the animals (Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">1993</xref>; Bian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>); they are the important additives of feed and prevent diarrhea and death of weanling pigs, and promote healthy growth of fattening pigs. Generally, the Zn element was added in the feed with common high Zn. This leads to the high toxicity to the pig; in addition, the high Zn cannot be absorbed sufficiently and waste the Zn source. Even more serious was that a mass of Zn was discharged with the feces and results in environment pollution. The supplementation of 500 mg/kg of Zn as nano-ZnO was as effective as 2000 mg/kg of Zn from ZnO for enhancing growth performance and alleviating diarrhea as well as improving intestinal microflora and barrier function of weanling pigs (You et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2012</xref>). The weaned piglets of 24 to 26 days old were used for the test. The control group was fed with the basal diet; groups 1, 2, and 3 were fed with the basal diet adding 2800 g/t zinc oxide, 800 g/t fat-coated zinc oxide, and 500 g/t nano zinc oxide, respectively. The results showed that the pigs’ average daily gain raised 15.3, 9.9, and 14.7 %, the ratio of feed to gain reduced 9.6, 7.5, and 10.3 %, the diarrhea ratio reduced 66.7, 55.6, and 55.6 %, respectively; compared with the control group, all were significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but groups of 1, 2, and 3 have no significant differences in average daily gain, ratio of feed to gain, and diarrhea ratio (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) among the zinc oxide, fat-coated zinc oxide, and nano zinc oxide.

Furthermore, it has a prooxidant effect, thus causing adverse effects on animals and environments (Zhu and Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2005</xref>). The effects of nano Se on fattening pig meat quality, growth, and antioxidant were explored with sodium selenite as the control. When the level of Se source was 0.4–1.0 mg/kg, then the growth performance of piglets, drip loss, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, T-AOC level, and muscle Se content of the longissimus in the nano Se group were significantly higher than those of the sodium selenite group, while the methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) and content of active oxygen in the nano Se group were significantly lower than those of the sodium selenite group (Xia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par77">As a fourth-generation trace element additive, nano zinc oxide (nano ZnO) possesses surface effect, volume effect, quantum size effect, and so on. These features provide broad application prospects in the feed industry. Nano ZnO can significantly improve animal production performance and reduce the diarrhea rate of piglets. It can also improve the absorption capacity of livestock and poultry intestines and stomach as well as absorption speed and rate, which greatly reduce ratios of feed to meat and feed to egg, thus reducing the production cost (Zhong and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2005</xref>). High zinc diets can prevent diarrhea and improve the production performance of piglets, but when its addition dosage is large, it will lead to adversely affect the environment and the pigs’ health. Nano ZnO has a unique advantage of physical and chemical properties, and its required dosage in the feed is lower, but it can achieve the same effects as with a high zinc daily diet. Therefore, it can replace the ordinary Zinc oxide (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par78">Supplementation of chitosan nanoparticle-loaded copper (CNP-Cu) increased average daily feed intake and average daily gain and decreased feed gain ratio and diarrhea rate, and the optimal supplemental level of chitosan nanoparticles loaded copper was 100 mg/kg (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that supplemental chitosan nanoparticle-loaded copper has beneficial effects on immune and antioxidant function in weaned pigs, which also can increase growth performance and decrease diarrhea rate. Accordingly, chitosan nanoparticle-loaded copper has a potential to substitute antibiotics (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2011a</xref>). An effective DNA vaccine for foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus was prepared using mannosylated chitosan nanoparticles to form the foot and mouth disease VpVAC-VP 1-OmpA complex particles. The immunological evaluation indicated that the 20 μg of DNA vaccine complexed with mannosylated chitosan nanoparticles was found optimum in inducing the immune response in G pig (Nanda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par79">A certain amount of classical swine fever peptides was adsorbed on calcium phosphate nanoparticles and the adsorption reached 70 %.

The increase of body temperatures postponed 16 h in calcium phosphate nanoparticle peptide vaccine group as compared with peptide alone group.

The inhibition zone diameter to the pathogenic bacteria of nano ZnO was twice that of the common ZnO. Under light conditions, the antibacterial effect of nano ZnO was better (Qu and Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2004</xref>). Crystal zinc Bei (nano ZnO, 300 mg/kg) and high-dose ZnO (3000 mg/kg) were used to feed weaned piglets aged 21 days in the early stages. The nano ZnO and high-dose ZnO were all capable of improving the daily gain of piglet, and the nano ZnO group was 27.9 % higher than that of the high zinc group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the feed meat ratio and diarrhea rate among various groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Comparative tests on the effects of added nano ZnO on production performance were conducted. Seventy-five piglets were divided into five groups, among which the fourth group was the high zinc group (Zn 3000 mg/kg), the fifth group (control group) was the normal zinc group (Zn 100 mg/kg), and the other three were “crystal zinc Bei” groups (group 1 with the addition of 250 mg/kg, group 2 with 375 mg/kg, group 3 with 500 mg/kg). The high zinc group and different concentrations of nano ZnO groups both could improve the daily gain of piglets.

For example, researches on nanotechnologies have been supported by the National Key Basic Research Development Plan (973-plan), National High-Tech Research and Development Program (863 plan), National Science and Technology Support Program, national public industry specific research, key projects, surface projects, and youth fund of the National Natural Science Fund project, provincial projects, city projects (funds), and special funds of colleges and universities. A new project of “Basic research on improving the effectiveness and security of agrochemicals by using nanomaterial and nanotechnology” was approved by “973-plan” in 2014 in China. The main purposes of the project are as follows: to improve the pesticide formulation and function of traditional agrochemicals and to develop a new type of efficient, security, and low-cost nano agrochemicals. In terms of the application of nanotechnologies, especially in agriculture, China may be at the forefront of the world as above introduction, which is likely due to the more lenient and flexible system of China.</p><p id="Par169">However, there is a dilemma in the selection and validation of the test methods for the characterization, dose selection, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity assessment of engineering nanomaterials, due to the altered behavior of engineering nanomaterials as compared to chemicals. A multi-disciplinary team effort including material scientists, molecular biologists, toxicologists, and physicists is necessary as it will facilitate the interlinking of different facets of nanotoxicologies, thus aiding in the understanding of cellular responses to nanomaterial exposure and the mechanisms involved (Vyom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par170">The small size and subsequent larger surface area of nanoparticles not only endows them with some highly useful and specific properties, but it also renders them biologically more active, leading to unanticipated consequences on interaction with biological systems. Their smaller size also imparts a different biokinetic behavior and ability to reach more distal regions of the body (Oberdorster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2005</xref>). Occupational exposure with nanotechnologies will increase with their growing production and use in society. On the other hand, environmental contamination caused by nanotechnology is yet another concern. In the water treated with nanotechnologies and used for crop seed treating, irrigation, and drinking and the feed (food) treated by nanotechnologies and used for feeding animals or direct eating by humans, whether or not they have short period or long terms and direct or indirect harm to crops or animals (people), the actual situation needs to be investigated and elucidated. These apprehensions have generated concern regarding the potential adverse effects of engineering nanomaterials on crops, human health, and the environmental safety.</p><p id="Par171">Although myconanotechnology is still in its infancy, potential applications provide exciting waves of transformation in agriculture and fascinate microbiologists and other researchers to contribute to providing incremental solutions through green chemistry approaches for advancing food security (Kashyap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are highly thankful to the projects for their kind support.</p><p>1.
