id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Due to the lack of high-power, tunable sources and fast, sensitive detectors, the terahertz (THz) region of the electromagnetic spectrum has been lagging behind from a technological point of view. The lack of suitable technologies led to the THz band being called the “THz gap.” This technological gap has been rapidly diminishing during the last three decades, giving rise to scientific opportunities that could not be considered in the past.</p><p id="Par3">THz radiation has got plenty of attractive applications, among which THz high-precision molecular spectroscopy has a central role. In this window, in fact, linestrengths of molecular transitions are generally larger than in the microwave region and comparable with the strongest fundamental ro-vibrational transitions in the mid-IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, Hz-linewidth transitions represent key molecular signatures and the THz range can well represent a novel molecular fingerprint region. For this reason, astronomy and space science have recently moved to THz technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a topical example, one half of the total luminosity of the galaxy and 98% of the photons emitted since the Big Bang fall into the terahertz gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Much of this radiation is emitted by cool interstellar dust inside our and other galaxies, and thus, the study of the discrete lines emitted by light molecular species can give nice insight into star formation and decay, despite the clear need of satellite platforms or high altitudes, due to the strong atmospheric absorption resulting from pressure broadened water and oxygen lines. Furthermore, terahertz thermal emission from gases in the stratosphere and upper troposphere such as water, oxygen, chlorine, and nitrogen compounds is useful for the study of chemical processes related to ozone depletion, pollution monitoring, and global warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Other spectroscopic applications include plasma fusion diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or identification of different crystalline polymorphic states of a drug. In this spectral range, natural transition linewidths can be as narrow as a few hertz; therefore, it is crucial to probe them with narrow-emission tunable sources, which have been studied throughout the years.</p><p id="Par4">Originally, incoherent thermal sources and Fourier-transform spectrometers were used to probe THz rotational transitions, requiring cryogenic bolometric detection. In order to achieve high resolution, inconveniently long mirror travel lengths were required and, therefore, obviously the need for a coherent source arose in this spectral range. The aim of this essay is to review the characteristics, the results, and the future perspectives of high-precision THz spectroscopy based on continuous wave (CW) sources.Free electron type sources like Klystrons, Traveling Wave Tubes (TWT), Backward Wave Oscillators (BWO), and Gyrotrons have been extensively studied since the mid of the past century to approach the high frequency part of the microwave region. Apart from Gyrotrons, which are generally designed to work in pulsed mode and to reach high average power, the above free electron sources suffer from simple physical scaling problems, metallic wall losses, and the need for high magnetic and electric fields, as well as high-electron current densities as the frequency is increased. For this reason, TWTs usually do not reach frequencies higher than 100 GHz, while BWOs, which can be tuned over tens of gigahertz by varying the accelerating potential, can cover the frequency range extending from 30 GHz to 1.2 THz.</p><p id="Par5">BWOs, actually, have been successfully used to perform precise THz spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, Winnewisser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] used tunable narrow-linewidth (&lt;20 kHz) backward-wave oscillator (BWO) to perform sub-Doppler saturation-dip spectroscopy of rotational transitions of CO to reveal the upper limit for the Doppler-free linewidths of 16 kHz at 230 GHz, 25 kHz at 461 GHz, and 32 kHz at 691 GHz.</p><p id="Par6">In this framework, however, we will focus on table-top sources, which can be ascribed to three main scenarios: (i) direct THz lasing action, (ii) frequency up-conversion of microwaves in solid-state diodes, and (iii) frequency down-conversion of visible/infrared light in non-linear media and photoconductive antennas, and of course hybrid setups that will also be discussed. We will start by reviewing the recent history of the three scenarios, giving particular importance to emission power, tunability, and spectral purity achieved by the different sources. Particular importance will be given to the demonstration and characterization of free-standing THz frequency comb synthesizer (FCS), and then we will review the results obtained by these setups and finally give out perspectives on possible future developments and applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Sources</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Direct THz Lasing Action</title><p id="Par7">The need for a coherent THz source was first satisfied by optically pumped Far-InfraRed (FIR) lasers. This kind of source provided high enough power levels, but was very limited in tunability ranges, being based on the emission of a finite set of discrete molecular transitions. Extended tunability has been achieved with the tunable far-infrared spectrometer (TuFIR) hybrid approach discussed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>.</p><p id="Par8">In an optically pumped FIR laser, the molecular gas is excited from its ground vibrational state to a higher vibrational state by an external laser source. Population inversion is then obtained between two rotational levels within the excited vibrational state. The pump source must be tuned so that its wavelength closely coincides with an absorption line in the molecular gas. Typically, the molecular absorption bands lie in the 10 μm region (0.1 eV). All infrared emitting lasers are potential candidates for FIR laser pumping, provided that the FIR laser medium absorbs the pump wavelength. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) lasers are powerful emitters of coherent radiation at a large number of discrete wavelengths around 10 μm. Since typical molecular absorption bands lie within the CO<sub>2</sub> laser spectrum, FIR laser pumps are almost exclusively CO<sub>2</sub> lasers. The energy difference between two rotational levels within one vibrational state is typically 0.01 eV, which is the energy of FIR photons. Stimulated Raman emission is also a contributor to the richness of FIR laser lines, especially at high pump power levels. However, even at low pump powers, laser emissions that cannot be assigned to a specific transition in the FIR laser medium are attributed to stimulated Raman. A vast number of polyatomic molecules have been found to lase when optically pumped by infrared lasers. Heavy molecules preferentially produce longer wavelengths. For example, formic acid, HCOOH, lases at longer wavelengths than the lighter methyl alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>OH. The heavier CF<sub>2</sub>Br, pumped by a CO<sub>2</sub>, laser yields the long FIR laser wavelength of 2140 μm (140 GHz). Despite the abundance of observed FIR laser lines, only a limited number of them are powerful enough to be used in practical applications. Usually, a FIR laser molecule only produces a few powerful laser lines. Due the complexity of its FIR molecular spectrum, and the consequent richness of FIR laser lines, methyl alcohol has become a favorite FIR laser medium. Normal (non-isotopic) CH<sub>3</sub>OH alone is responsible for more than 300 FIR laser lines, ranging from 30 to 1200 μm. In methyl alcohol, the overlap between the strongly absorbing CO-stretch band and the CO<sub>2</sub> laser spectrum is excellent; the CH<sub>3</sub>OH molecule shows fairly large permanent electric dipole moments both parallel and orthogonal to the axis of symmetry. Exchanging H by D in the CH<sub>3</sub>OH, thereby obtaining the deuterated species CH<sub>3</sub>OD, CH<sub>2</sub>DOH, CHD<sub>2</sub>OH, CD<sub>2</sub>OH, and CD<sub>3</sub>OD, does not shift the CO-stretch band appreciably; the absorption still falls within the CO<sub>2</sub> laser spectrum. On the other hand, different FIR laser lines do appear since the rotational and vibrational levels are affected. It is also possible to exchange the ordinary <sup>12</sup>C carbon atom by the <sup>13</sup>C isotope.</p><p id="Par9">In general, using an FIR laser involves bulky instrumentation, sophisticated operation, and is intrinsically limited by the active media transition frequencies. Consequently, availability of a new generation of compact, reliable THz sources is the key for the development of the largely underdeveloped THz range. In this framework and THz-emitting Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) are proving to be good candidates to fill this gap. For a dimension comparison between QCLs and molecular lasers, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The first report on QCLs operating at THz frequencies is relatively recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and, despite the cryogenic operation temperatures (&lt;199 K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], THz QCLs have attracted considerable attention thanks to the high output power (&gt;100 mW), spectral purity, stability, compactness, and reliability, and have now a realistic chance of making a deep impact on technological applications. Among the features that a THz QCL has to show to become a useful radiation source for many applications is a reliable, repeatable, and tunable single-frequency emission. Many quantum-design related approaches, technological solutions, and/or optical configurations have been indeed recently tested to tune the emission frequency of THz QC sources over quite a large bandwidth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between the bulky instrumentation of a molecular FIR laser, whose cavity length is in the order of 2 m, and a THz Quantum Cascade Laser, whose dimensions are in the millimeter range</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10762_2017_406_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">Design and fabrication of such long wavelength QC lasers have been challenging: the emission, at energies lower than the optical phonon one, makes e–e scattering a non-negligible energy relaxation channel; the huge free-carrier absorption becomes the dominant factor of the waveguide losses; anomalies in semiconductor dielectric constant further complicate laser action and must be taken into account for designing optical waveguides that overcome the high losses and the practical limitations induced by prohibitive layer thickness; the non-radiative lifetimes (~0.5 ps) of intersubband transitions become very short, and carriers tend to enhance the leakage channels. Also, it is important to stress that, at terahertz frequencies, the spontaneous emission lifetime is typically much longer (microseconds) compared to the non-radiative lifetimes (picoseconds), so that radiative relaxation does not play any role in transport below threshold.</p><p id="Par11">At this time, three active region types have successfully been used in terahertz QCLs: chirped superlattice, bound-to-continuum, and resonant phonon. In addition, a combined scheme of bound-to-continuum and resonant phonon, namely interlaced photon–phonon cascade, has been also developed. The first report on a THz QCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] exploited a careful design of the active region, based on a chirped superlattice and an asymmetric low-loss waveguide, and emission at 4.4 THz was achieved.</p><p id="Par12">The gain spectrum of THz QCLs can be engineered by quantum design to be broadband over a range even larger than 1 THz, or, alternatively, to be electrically tunable over a 240-GHz bandwidth, exploiting the Stark shift of the lasing transition.</p><p id="Par13">For reliable and repeatable single-mode tuning, QCL emitters based on external cavities can be realized using either a movable mirror to control the cavity length or a rotating grating for wavelength-dependent feedback. First-order and second-order DFB THz QCLs also provide stable single-mode emission, via temperature/current tuning, though usually on a more limited range, of only a few gigahertz. However, if coupled to an external microcavity, wider tuning ranges (≈20 GHz) can be achieved by mechanically changing the size of the external microcavity. As an alternative, the lateral size of the lasing mode can be manipulated in narrow (~<italic>λ</italic>/3) ridge, double-metal THz DFBs via electromechanical components, to tune the laser emission widely and continuously on a bandwidth of over 330 GHz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Another surprising characteristic of THz QCLs is their spectral purity. In fact, frequency- and phase-stabilized, high-power, and reliable solid-state terahertz sources can find application in a number of fields, spanning from far-IR astronomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and high-precision molecular gas spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to high-resolution coherent imaging and telecommunications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this context, knowledge of the intrinsic linewidth, ultimately related to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, plays a key role, determining the maximum achievable spectral resolution and coherence length in a free-running laser. Recently, the spectral purity of a THz QCL has been investigated via the measurement of its frequency–noise power spectral density (FNPSD), providing an experimental evaluation and a theoretical assessment of its intrinsic LW. Intensity measurements were performed to retrieve information in the frequency domain by converting the laser frequency fluctuations into detectable intensity (amplitude) variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These measurements led to a measured FWHM <italic>δυ</italic> = 90 ± 30 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This result has been later independently confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Experiments on frequency and phase stabilization of THz QCLs have involved right from the beginning some secondary frequency standards. In 2005, phase-lock of a 3-THz QCL to the 3.1059368 THz line of a methanol gas laser was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and, in 2009, frequency stabilization of a single-mode THz QCL against the 2.409293 THz line of a CH<sub>2</sub>DOH gas laser was obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In both cases, a narrowing of the beat signal was observed (65 and 3 kHz, respectively). The first THz QCLs locked to microwave-driven harmonically generated THz sources were demonstrated at 1.5 THz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], 2.7 THz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (phase locks), and 2.3 THz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (frequency lock). Despite the high complexity, the high electrical power consumption, and the very low efficiency with a few pW radiation powers, such kinds of sources provide a very narrow and absolute-frequency reference, suitable for mixing with the THz QCL in a sensitive detector such as a hot-electron bolometer. Frequency-locking of a THz QCL to a molecular reference was demonstrated in a first-derivative, direct absorption spectroscopy configuration, without any significant narrowing of the QCL emission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Phase-locking to an optical FCS (OFCS) was achieved only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] by locking a 2.5-THz QCL to the <italic>n</italic>th harmonic of the repetition rate of a mode-locked erbium-doped fiber laser. By implementing a technique first reported by Löffler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the comb generated by the mode-locked laser was mixed in a non-linear crystal with a CW THz QCL, thus generating THz sidebands around the near-IR carrier. The beating between the original comb and its shifted replicas provides the signal for closing the phase-lock loop. A similar scheme, but using a photoconductive antenna instead of electrooptic detection, was presented 1 year later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Despite the clear advantage of room temperature detection of the beat-note, the latter approaches are based on low-efficiency up-conversion processes, and they inherently require a CW THz power in the milliwatt range. This can represent a limitation in many cases, when enough output power is not available or when it is needed for other simultaneous applications (i.e., spectroscopy). One possible solution has been provided by moving to a THz detection, where the beat-note can be acquired by a square-law THz detector with much higher efficiency, therefore involving only a small fraction of the overall emitted QCL power. Of course, this detection involves a free-standing and air-propagating THz FCS.</p><p id="Par17">Coherent THz pulses are largely employed in time-domain spectroscopy, and even though this review focuses on CW sources, a focus on THz comb is needed for their importance in narrowing and referencing THz QCLs. In fact, the intrinsic comb nature of pulsed THz sources used in time-domain spectroscopy has been recently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and direct use of such sources as frequency “ruler” for a THz QCL has ever been reported in 2012, by phase-locking a single-frequency CW QCL emitting at 2.5 THz onto a single tooth of a THz FCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This allowed for not only the direct knowledge of the QCL absolute frequency, but also a narrowing of its emission linewidth down to around 130 Hz could be observed.</p><p id="Par18">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the THz comb generation is realized by optical rectification, in Cherenkov configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], of a femtosecond mode-locked Ti/Sa laser in a single-mode waveguide. The waveguide is fabricated on a MgO-doped LiNbO<sub>3</sub> crystal plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The generated radiation is a train of coherent THz pulses, carrying a very large spectral content (from few GHz up to more than 6 THz).

It is based on a synthesis of FIR radiation starting from infrared and microwave radiation mixed onto a non-linear device, namely the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diode. The MIM diode consists of an electrochemically sharpened tungsten whisker (25-pm diameter and 3 to 7 mm long) contacting a metal base. The metal base has a naturally occurring thin-oxide insulating layer. Both nickel and cobalt have been used as base materials, but cobalt is generally more consistent in the production of third-order FIR radiation. In a later version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], the TuFIR spectrometer produces radiation through non-linear mixing of three radiations (two from CO<sub>2</sub> lasers and one from a microwave source; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) in a third-order MIM diode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

A photomixer is a compact, solid-state device. The tuning range can be exceptionally broad provided that a high-quality, tunable, dual-frequency laser system is available. The primary disadvantage of this method is that the output power is relatively low compared with other techniques of CW THz generation. Its optical-to-THz conversion efficiency is 10<sup>−6</sup>–10<sup>−5</sup>, and the typical output power is in the microwatt range. Because photomixing requires continuous optical excitation, the maximum THz output power is limited by the low thermal conductivity of LT-GaAs (~15 W/mK).

A commonly used antenna structure for photomixing is the logarithmic uniplanar spiral antenna (log-spiral antenna) with interdigitated electrode fingers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. It has the advantage of a broad tuning range: its radiation pattern, impedance, and polarization remain virtually unchanged below 1 THz. The carrier lifetime of LT-GaAs and the RC time constant of a typical log-spiral photomixer are a few hundred femtoseconds; thus, frequency roll-off begins around 1 THz. The generated radiation power is proportional to ω<sup>−4</sup> at higher frequencies. At the expense of a broad tuning range, the log-spiral antenna has low output power due to the relatively low radiation resistance.

These setups can achieve output powers of a few milliwatts at 1.9 THz with intracavity power as high as 500 W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The generated power scales with the product of the intensities of the two pump beams; as a consequence, the emitted THz power can be also enhanced by confining the THz radiation in a small space.

They have widespread applications over the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from microwaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>] to UV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>], while record-level optical finesse were achieved in the visible/near-IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>], especially thanks to the advent of whispering gallery mode resonators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. In this context, the THz portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is still lacking such tools. Design and fabrication of cavities efficiently resonating at THz frequencies is challenging, due to the technological gap of THz materials and optical components, compared to other spectral regions. As concerns cavity mirrors, highly reflective dielectric coatings are scarcely developed at THz frequencies, and at present only, metallic coatings can be used, with a maximum reflectivity limited to 99.6% for gold. In addition, metallic mirrors are not suitable as input/output couplers, because of unavoidable substrate absorption losses, and also the solutions commonly adopted at microwave frequencies (hole output coupling) have proven to be quite unsuitable for THz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">An alternative approach consists in using a wire-grid polarizer (WGP) as input/output coupler: if the electric field component is parallel to the metal wires, electrons are free to flow along the wires, and the incoming field experiences an almost complete reflection. However, a small amount of radiation leaks through the grid, allowing for the coupling of light in and out of the cavity. This approach has been adopted in a very few early experiments in far-IR spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>], where finesses of about 14 and 3 were achieved at 690 GHz and 1.5 THz frequencies, respectively (corresponding to Q-factors of about 7000 and 1500, respectively). Braakman et al. demonstrated that, in the sub-THz range (around 300 GHz), resonant cavities based on WGPs can achieve Q-factors as large as 10<sup>5</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>], sufficient for a relevant enhancement. More recently, in the group led by Paolo De Natale, resonant cavities with different setups, specifically a V-shaped and a ring-shaped cavity, have been developed, and have been coupled to a THz QCL.Q-factors of about 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> have been reached, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. At the same time, these cavities have been for the first time used to influence the QCL emission, paving the way to cavity linewidth narrowing. Finally, another cavity setup has been developed by the same group, which has reached for the first time an unprecedented Q-factor of 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>, based on a bow tie design (Campa et al., submitted for publication).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Two different THz resonators setup and acquisitions: V-shaped cavity on the left with 2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> achieved quality factor and ring-shaped setup on the right, with 2.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> achieved quality factor.

Thus, <italic>N</italic> is greatly enhanced if the state under investigation is the ground state, or a state that is energetically close to the ground state, compared with k<sub>B</sub>T.

Moreover, lower velocities yield reduced Doppler broadenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The coldest molecular species attainable to date are the ultracold alkali dimers created by associating ultracold atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. They have been employed, for instance, in the studies of ultracold bimolecular reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>] and have been trapped in optical lattices to analyze their quantum dynamics, which represents the first step toward using these systems to explore many-body dynamics in regimes that are inaccessible to current theoretical techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. However, as interesting as these species are in the quest for new physical phenomena, they have not been at the focus of the spectroscopists’ attention. Instead, their attention has been directed at less exotic molecular species, cooled by direct methods.</p><p id="Par55">A conceptually simple method for preparing cold molecules is buffer-gas cooling, pioneered by J. Doyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. Cooling is achieved via collisions with cryogenically cooled helium atoms, and the temperature of the cold molecules is typically around 1 K. A large variety of atoms and molecules has been cooled using this technique, ranging from atoms and dimers to benzonitrile, fluorobenzene, anisole, for instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. Further, buffer-gas cooling has been used for the production of molecular beams both of gaseous precursors and of laser-ablated species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. If curved guides are coupled to this kind of sources, the subset of molecules that are moving sufficiently slowly are extracted from the output of the source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. Spectroscopy on buffer-gas cooled species has been performed both inside the cooling cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>] and on the molecular beam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. Only very recently, cavity ringdown detection has been successfully used in a beam of buffer-gas cooled of acetylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Supersonic molecular beams are a classical method to produce cold molecular samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. A molecular beam is generated by letting a gas expand from a high-pressure source into a low-pressure ambient background via a nozzle. Basically, a supersonic molecular beam is a fast-moving beam of internally cold molecules and it facilitates spectroscopic studies by providing molecules in an almost collision-free environment, thus with a strong reduction of inhomogeneous broadening. However, typical molecular beams have speeds of the order of 300–1000 m/s and several techniques have been developed to manipulate and control their motional degrees of freedom.</p><p id="Par57">Stark and Zeeman effects are common methods to manipulate polar and paramagnetic molecules with electric or magnetic fields, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. In Stark decelerators, molecules with a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) convert part of their kinetic energy into Stark energy upon entering an electric field, if they are in an appropriate quantum state. If the electric field is switched off before the molecule has left the electric field, the lost kinetic energy will not be returned. This process can be repeated over multiple stages until the molecules reach the desired final velocity. Once the average velocity is low enough, molecules can be loaded in a trap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>], for instance. Zeeman deceleration is entirely analogous, except that the force is exerted by a magnetic field on a magnetic dipole moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. As a viable alternative to abruptly switching between different static field configurations, molecules can be captured in traveling potential wells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>], directly from the supersonic molecular beam, and then decelerated. These methods are used to prepare a molecular beam in a single quantum state and at a mean speed typically adjustable between 400 and 500 m/s to rest, with a translational temperature tunable from 1 K to 5 mK. High-resolution mid-IR spectroscopy of decelerated species has been performed for NH3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>] and hydroxyl radicals (OH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">In these experiments, an interaction time as long as 1 ms was obtained. In 2008, Stuhl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>] identified a class of diatomic molecules that presented almost-cycling transitions, which can be used for laser cooling. A couple of years later, DeMille group demonstrated the action of a radiative force acting on strontium monofluoride (SrF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>] and then transverse laser cooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>] and deceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>] of a SrF beam.

Typical temperatures reached with all these techniques are in the range of a half to about 100 mK, whereas the densities are in the range of 10<sup>7</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>. Applying high-precision THz spectroscopy techniques to these cold molecule sources could in principle lead to an actual improvement for accuracy of at least two orders of magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Frequency Referencing Improvement</title><p id="Par59">As previously discussed, the frequency standard in the THz region relies on Global Positioning System (GPS) dissemination of frequency standards, which is ubiquitous at present, providing the most widespread time and frequency reference for the majority of industrial and research applications worldwide. On the other hand, the ultimate limits of GPS presently hinder further advances in high-precision, scientific, and industrial applications relying on this dissemination scheme. This is not yet the case of THz technologies, as the actual frequency accuracy limit of 10<sup>−9</sup> is not yet comparable with the accuracy given by GPS clock, but nevertheless far more accurate standards will become crucial in the next future. A timely exploitation of the continuous advances in the realization of new frequency standards is inherently tied to the uncertainty with which the standard is delivered from metrological institutes to the end users. Presently, GPS allows for traceability to the second in the International System of Units (SI) with a typical fractional frequency uncertainty of 10<sup>−13</sup> on a day average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>]. This remarkable result can be obtained with a very simple equipment, consisting only of a receiver without any feedback from the user to the reference clock infrastructure. However, GPS dissemination severely limits the accuracy of current frequency standards and, even more, that of new optical atomic clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>], which have already shown fractional accuracy capabilities of 10<sup>−18</sup> in a few hours of measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. This is the main reason why the development and characterization of long-haul optical fiber links (OFLs), rather than microwave satellite links, recently featured a substantial thrust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>]. Indeed, in the last years, OFLs have shown undoubted effectiveness in comparing remote atomic clocks beyond the ultimate limit of GPS-based comparisons, attaining precision levels not limited by the frequency transfer method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>], and are also envisioned as key elements for the development of a new kind of high-accuracy relativistic geodesy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>]. Besides optical clock comparisons, short-range OFLs have recently been exploited in order to increase the spectral performance of a local laser and to allow for precision molecular spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>].

One of the main objectives is to build THz QCLs able to operate at room temperature. In this regard, a very promising kind of source is based on intracavity difference frequency generation between two mid-IR QCLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>].

A careful characterization of these devices, regarding both their tunability characteristics and their spectral purity has been very recently performed by (Consolino et al., submitted for publication), showing that not only these devices are able to work at room temperature, but that they are also suitable for metrological grade applications.</p><p id="Par61">Another interesting and promising technology for THz high-precision spectroscopy is continuous-wave multimode broadband QCLs, whose operation has only recently been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">211</xref>].
