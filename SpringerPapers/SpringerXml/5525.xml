Ordinarily, energy planners use modelling software to simulate the integration of this potential into the electricity generation network. In 2018, Ringkjøb et al. identified 75 energy modelling software. The study simulates the integration of the city renewable energy potential in the electricity generation network, using three energy planning software. The main finding is the approach, which is embedded in the software programming interface, affects the model results in terms of competitiveness of renewable energy technologies when compared to existing energy technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy planning</kwd><kwd>Energy software</kwd><kwd>System simulation</kwd><kwd>Computational equilibrium</kwd><kwd>Agent-based modelling</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-68410-5_Chapter_9.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Since the 1970s, energy software has been used to describe, plan, and monitor energy systems. The first energy modelling software appeared between the oil crisis of 1973 and the energy crisis of 1979, with the Market Allocation model known as MARKAL (1978) and the Wien Automatic System Planning Package known as WASP III (1979). Since then, the number of energy software has constantly increased, and in 2018, Ringkjøb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>) identified 75 energy modelling software. However, the weight of the model’s approach on the energy systems computed is still unclear.</p><p id="Par3">A previous study (Fall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>) assessed the potential of renewable energy resources in Dakar and demonstrated a technically achievable potential on solar photovoltaic, waste-to-energy, and wind energy resources. This study uses the figures associated with this potential to explore how different modelling approaches affect energy metrics depending on the software used. The study hypothesized that the modelling approach affects the city energy metrics, and different software can result in different portraits of the future energy system, which, together, affect policy recommendations for transition to sustainability. Most publications on energy modelling software emphasize the modeller’s responsibility as a probable cause for this discrepancy; the selection of a modelling software only depending on the user’s preferences. However, these preferences do not necessarily translate into an informed decision considering all alternatives, but more than often relates to the accessibility of the modelling software (free download or paid licence), technical knowledge of model operations (inputs and outputs), previous exposure to the software environment (e.g training), etc.</p><p id="Par4">The first objective of the chapter is to introduce MoCES, which approach considers individual agents having rules in planning city energy systems. With this software, the authors bring innovation in the field of energy modelling as agent-based modelling is not frequently used in planning energy systems, despite its popularity in economics. The second objective of the paper is to compare MoCES computation results with two renowned energy planning software that feature different approaches: LEAP and ENPEP-BALANCE. The rationale of this study is to quantify the tractable implications of the modelling approach in planning the transition to energy sustainability for the city.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodological Approach</title><p id="Par5">The study compares three sample energy software in modelling a future energy system from a single reference energy scenario (2016) and using the same renewable energy technologies.

The user inputs data of the baseline year in the Current Accounts and includes changes in scenarios in the form of numerical values. In the analysis window (View) of LEAP, the user can input the system energy demand, transformation (conversion from primary energy resources to secondary energy production), and resources potential. The software features a Technology and Environmental Database (TED) that enables the user to connect appliances, devices, fuels, and technologies entered in the model to a database that includes metadata such as pollutant emissions of these appliances, devices, fuels, and technologies. LEAP also provides an option to optimize the energy system modelled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Energy and Power Evaluation Programme: ENPEP-BALANCE (Argonne National Laboratory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>)</title><p id="Par11">ENPEP-BALANCE’s approach is the optimization of an energy network made of energy production (resources), conversion, transport, distribution, and end-use nodes, as well as the flows of energy and fuels among those nodes. Opposite to LEAP and MoCES, the software interface is an empty workspace that the modeller fills in configuring an energy network with embedded nodes and links. ENPEP-BALANCE simultaneously finds the intersection of supply and demand curves for all energy supply sources and all energy uses included in the network. Equilibrium is reached when the model finds a set of market-clearing prices and quantities that satisfy all relevant equations and constraints entered by the user.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Modelling Cities Energy Systems: MoCES (Fall et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>)</title><p id="Par12">MoCES is an agent-based modelling software that aims at computing the city energy network based on individual agents’ energy choices.

Moreover, it particularly shows that different pathways exist to reach the same objective of transition to energy sustainability in the city network, and each produces different externalities. LEAP produces the most secure future energy scenario for the city by only using domestically available resources, but it is also the most expensive option. ENPEP displays the cheapest future energy scenario for the city, but it is also a less secure option as it continues to rely on imported sources that are cheaper than domestically available resources. MoCES displays results somewhere between security (more wind in supply) and affordability (presence of diesel).</p><p id="Par88">Still, existent software also features limitations. These limitations include the abstraction of relevant energy parameters that affect the future system modelled by the software and the absence of flexibility in integrating different (agents) rationales on energy demand and supply options. Energy is a social good, as individual agents produce and consume its services; therefore, a relevant modelling approach should integrate the complexity of these agents’ rationales to produce and/or to consume it. The cities’ efforts to achieve energy sustainability (SDG-7) and urban liveability (SDG-11) by 2030 require relevant accounting methodologies and consistent model metrics (Grubler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). MoCES, with an agent-based modelling approach, is a contribution to addressing both the relevance and consistency issues in energy planning models.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Agence Nationale des Statistiques et de la Demographie</collab></person-group><source>Rapport global du Recensement général des Entreprises</source><year>2017</year><publisher-name>Agence Nationale des Statistiques et de la Demographie</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>ANSD</collab></person-group><source>Dakar: situation economique et sociale regionale 2016</source><year>2018</year><publisher-name>Agence Nationale des Statistiques et de la Demographie</publisher-name><comment>Consulté le November 23 2019, sur http://www.ansd.sn/ressources/ses/SES-Dakar-2016.pdf</comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>ArgonneNational Laboratory</collab></person-group><source>ENPEP-BALANCE software</source><year>2019</year><publisher-name>Lemont</publisher-name><comment>Retrieved October 23, 2019, from ww.anl.gov</comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>CRSE</collab></person-group><source>Bilan des activites de SENELEC 2014–2016</source><year>2017</year><publisher-name>Commission de Regulation du Secteur de l'Energie</publisher-name><comment>Consulté le June 10, 2019, sur https://www.crse.sn/sites/default/files/2017-04/RevisionTarifaire-2016b_0.pdf</comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fall</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><source>Techno-economic assessment of renewable’s energy potential of the city:Examples of solar photovoltaic, waste-to-enery and wind energy</source><year>2020</year><publisher-name>Unpublished</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fall</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ndiaye</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mbodji</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><source>Democratization of energy planning: On a new planning tool tailored to the needs of developing countries</source><year>2020</year><publisher-name>Unpublished</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR7"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grubler</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Buettner</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhakal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisk</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ichinose</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Grubler</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Chapter 18–urban energy systems</article-title><source>Global energy assessment–toward a sustainable future</source><year>2012</year><publisher-name>Cambridge University Press</publisher-name><fpage>1307</fpage><lpage>1400</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1017/CBO9780511793677.024</pub-id><comment>Retrieved from http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/10067/1/GEA%20Chapter%2018%20Urban%20Energy%20Systems.pdf</comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR8"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Ministere en charge des Energies</collab></person-group><source>Rapport SIE Senegal 2016</source><year>2018</year><publisher-name>Ministere en charge Energies</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR9"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ringkjøb, H.-K., Haugan, M., &amp; P., &amp; Solbrekke, I.
