However, few studies have carefully explored the effects of humic acid fertilizer on soil temperature, radiation, and the physiology of plant leaves, especially when coupled with different irrigation methods. To provide a better growing environment for crops and explore the best regulation method of humic acid fertilizer and irrigation in the farmland soil environment on the Songnen Plain, China, through field experiments, we selected rice as the test crop and applied humic acid fertilizer to the soil with different irrigation methods. The effects of different humic acid fertilizers and irrigation methods on the soil temperature and radiation changes during different growth stages were examined, and the subtle differences in agronomic and fluorescence characteristics in different growth stages of rice plants were compared. The results showed that the soil temperature was not significantly different among all the treatments. However, radiation interception was obviously different, and the best value was observed in the CT5 treatment. The fluorescence indices and leaf chlorophyll relative content (<italic>SPAD</italic>) differed with the change in humic acid fertilizer application and irrigation methods. At the jointing and heading stages, the <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub><italic>/F</italic><sub>m</sub> values of the CT5, FT5 and WT5 treatments were larger than those of the other treatments, and the best value was recorded in the CT5 treatment. The differences in <italic>NPQ</italic> at these two stages were significant, and the <italic>NPQ</italic> in the CT5 treatment was significantly higher than that in the other treatments (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In general, the <italic>Q</italic><sub>P</sub> under control irrigation was greater than that under flood and wet irrigation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences among the gradients under the different humic acid fertilizer application methods in terms of <italic>Q</italic><sub>P</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Additionally, <italic>SPAD</italic> values were higher under the CT5 and FT5 treatments.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>16345</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_20764.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the past 30 years, farmland has been rapidly developed and used, with a large number of fertilizers and pesticides applied to the soil, which not only accelerates the degradation of land<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> but also causes ecological environmental pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, leading to a decrease in agricultural product quality and production efficiency. Therefore, agricultural production capacity and sustainable development face severe challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The core problem of farmland soil degradation is the decline in the quantity and quality of organic matter; therefore, guaranteeing the stability of organic matter in farmland soil is one of the key factors. There is also an important factor of ensuring the safety of farmland soil, that is, water resources, in which the decline of the groundwater level is accelerating on the Songnen Plain, China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; therefore, it is necessary to develop water-saving irrigation in this region to promote water resources and protect the safety of farmland soil.</p><p id="Par3">By reviewing the literature, we found that most experiments have only studied the effects of humic acid fertilizer on crops and farmland soil environments. For example, Li<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> found that applying humic acid fertilizer to farmland soil could not only optimize the farmland soil structure and increase the utilization rate of fertilizers but could also promote the growth of crops. Meng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> applied humic acid fertilizer to saline-alkali soil, and the results indicated that it could enhance salt leaching and inhibit nitrogen loss in the topsoil. The results of Yan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and Li<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> showed that farmland soil nutrient contents, yield and quality of crops were increased by the application of humic acid fertilizer.</p><p id="Par4">Meng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> showed that because of the application of humic acid fertilizer, farmland soil microaggregates increased by 77.59–125.58%. In addition, l salehi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> considered that the different rates of humic acid fertilizer could improve morphological and biochemical traits in nasturtium flowers. Ren<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> showed that humic acid fertilizer could reduce farmland soil pH and increase organic matter under certain circumstances thus enhancing growth and increasing the yield of rice. Gu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and Chen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> concluded that humic acid fertilizer could improve farmland soil physical and chemical properties, reduce compaction, increase farmland soil fertility, stimulate plant growth and increase plant stress resistance. Liu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and Qian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> found that plant height, stem diameter, ratio of root to shoot, and root activities were significantly increased by the addition of humic acid fertilizer. In summary, studies examining the influences of different humic acid fertilizers and irrigation techniques on crops have been minimal, especially in paddy fields. Therefore, on the basis of these studies, we explored the effects of different humic acid fertilizers and irrigation methods on paddy fields. To maintain farmland soil tillage and the health of the growing environment, we determined the best regulation methods of humic acid fertilizer and irrigation for farmland growing environments that are suitable for the Songnen Plain through field experiments.</p><p id="Par5">We selected humic acid fertilizer and irrigation methods for a field rice-planting experiment, and we made the following hypothesis: (1) whether different humic acid fertilizers and irrigation methods could affect temperature and radiation interception; (2) whether an appropriate amount of humic acid fertilizer and irrigation methods would promote rice growth and have a positive impact on agronomic traits; and (3) whether different humic acid fertilizers and irrigation methods on the fluorescence of plants were diverse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>General description of the experimental area</title><p id="Par6">The experiment was performed for two years at the National Key Irrigation Experimental Station located on the Songnen Plain in Heping town, Qing'an County, Suihua, Heilongjiang, China, with a geographical location of 45° 63′ N and 125° 44′ E at an elevation of 450 m above sea level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The average temperatures of the soil layer during the entire growth period of the plant are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Across all treatments, the soil temperature showed the same trend, which was generally divided into two parts. The first part, from 5 to 15 cm, was the soil surface in which the soil temperature gradually decreased, and the decrease in temperature was approximately 3–4 °C. In the second part, from 15 to 25 cm, the soil temperature rose slowly and continued to increase, and the temperature increase was below 1 °C. Under the different humic acid fertilizer and irrigation method conditions, the temperature differences from 15 to 25 cm were smaller than those from 5 to 15 cm. The surface soil temperature (5 cm and 10 cm) under the five humic acid fertilizer application methods showed a general trend of change in the order T2 &gt; T3 &gt; T1 &gt; T4 &gt; T5, while under the three irrigation conditions, the general trend showed the order C &gt; W &gt; F. Based on the above data, among all the different humic acid fertilizer and irrigation methods, although there were differences, we did not find statistical significance at the 5% probability (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).

According to the results, we found that the main factors influencing temperature were the external environment, such as atmospheric temperature. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the soil temperature was significantly positively correlated with atmospheric temperature, while the water layer was also the main factor that affected the soil temperature. Under the control irrigation conditions, there was no water layer in the field and the specific heat capacity of the soil was small, absorbing heat quickly. With flood and wet irrigation, due to the existence of the water layer, heat absorption was slower than in the soil; therefore, temperature was lower than that with control irrigation. However, due to the different growth statuses of rice among the different humic acid fertilizer treatments, the leaf area index exhibited a large difference, which affected the interception of solar radiation and therefore affected the surface temperature of the soil. However, there was no significant difference among the different treatments.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Analysis of influencing factors.

The CT5 treatment was higher than the other treatments. Humic acid fertilizer is a plant biostimulator that can promote seed germination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, stimulate plant root growth, and promote the growth of aboveground plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Plant height is often regarded as a measure of the photosynthetic and respiratory capacity of plants. Relatively tall plants have more plentiful branches and leaves and thus capture a greater amount of solar radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In our experiment, plant height increased with the increase in humic acid fertilizer application, and in both years, the highest value was recorded in the T5 treatment. Among the three irrigation methods, under the control irrigation conditions, the plant height was larger than that under flood and wet irrigation. Humic acid fertilizer can be absorbed by plant roots, and the humic acid fertilizer adsorbed on the cell wall can increase the number of proton pumps on the plasma membrane, which can promote the output of H<sup>+</sup> to the cell, acidify the cell wall, hydrolyse the polysaccharide, soften and relax the cell wall, and easily elongate and divide the cell, thus promoting plant growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The growth and development of plants are inseparable from photosynthesis. Chlorophyll and carotenoids are the main pigments of leaf photosynthesis, and they are the basis for plants to absorb, transmit and convert light energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that humic acid fertilizer could significantly improve the <italic>SPAD</italic> of pepper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and the results were similar to our experiment. In our study, from the tillering to ripening stages, the highest value of <italic>SPAD</italic> was in the T5 treatment, and under different irrigation conditions, control irrigation was the best. When humic acid fertilizer coupled with the irrigation method was added to the soil, the fluorescence parameters increased significantly, which indicated that the photosynthetic apparatus of leaves was healthy and had good function. Therefore, it had a higher opening degree and excitation energy capture efficiency; at the same time, the excitation energy of the reaction centre increased promoting the formation of plant photosynthetic capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par23">During the two-year experiment, we studied the effects of different humic acid fertilizers and irrigation methods on farmland soil temperature, radiation and rice growth. The main results could be summarized as follows: (1) Across all treatments, temperature was not significant, while the surface soil temperature was higher than that in the other soil layers. (2) The change in radiation interception was nonlinear over time, and radiation interception differed under the influences of the different humic acid fertilizer and irrigation methods. However, the changing trend of radiation interception under the different treatments was synchronous. (3) At the jointing and heading stages, the <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub><italic>/F</italic><sub>m</sub> values of CT5, FT5 and WT5 were larger than those of the other treatments. The differences in <italic>NPQ</italic> at these two stages were significant, and that in the CT5 treatment was significantly higher than that in the other treatments. In general, the <italic>Q</italic><sub>P</sub> under control irrigation was greater than that under flood and wet irrigation. Moreover, there were no significant differences among the gradients under humic acid fertilizer conditions. Additionally, <italic>SPAD</italic> values were higher under the CT5 and FT5 treatments. Overall, the humic acid fertilizer and irrigation method could affect the soil temperature, radiation and rice growth, and we found that the CT5 treatment was better. It is feasible to completely replace chemical nitrogen fertilizer with humic acid fertilizer in the short term; however, it is impossible for crops to obtain higher yields without chemical nitrogen fertilizer for a long time. Therefore, to provide a basis for scientific fertilization, we should further verify the year in which the yield decreases significantly under the condition of humic acid fertilizer completely replacing chemical nitrogen fertilizer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was jointly supported by the Basic Scientific Research Fund of Heilongjiang Provincial Universities (2021-KYYWF-0050).
