Currently, explorations of intelligent thermal management and control strategies prevail among car manufacturers in the context of climate change and global warming impacts. Therefore, major cutting-edge systematic approaches in electrified powertrain are summarized in the first place. In particular, the important role of heating, ventilation and air-condition system (HVAC) is emphasised. The trends in developing efficient HVAC system for future electrified powertrain are analysed. Then electric machine efficiency is under spotlight which could be improved by introducing new thermal management techniques and strengthening the efforts of driveline integrations. The demanded integration efforts are expected to provide better value per volume, or more power output/torque per unit with smaller form factor. Driven by demands, major thermal issues of high-power density machines are raised including the comprehensive understanding of thermal path, and multiphysics challenges are addressed whilst embedding power electronic semiconductors, non-isotropic electromagnetic materials and thermal insulation materials. Last but not least, the present review has listed several typical cooling techniques such as liquid cooling jacket, impingement/spray cooling and immersion cooling that could be applied to facilitate the development of integrated electric machine, and a mechanic-electric-thermal holistic approach is suggested at early design phase. Conclusively, a brief summary of the emerging new cooling techniques is presented and the keys to a successful integration are concluded.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par23">The phase-out of diesel and petrol cars proposed by quite a few countries has actually given an imperative impetus for achieving electrified propulsion systems in automotive sectors. Last decades saw a great momentum of successful research and development on new electrified vehicular powertrains, such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and full battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Unlike the conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs), the newly developed electric powertrains mostly have much higher energy efficiency which means more effective work to wheels under electrified driveline. Ultimately, it is expected that both automotive industries and consumers around the world can benefit from the carbon dioxide reducing endeavours. To achieve this, the effort to improve the powertrain system is always continuing, and higher performance and reliable components and subsystems are emerging everyday to the end-users in the market. Thermal management improvement is one of the research focuses that could potentially provide more temperature regulating solutions to achieve these targets. Indeed, it may not be simply achieved by changing or developing a single material or component; new thermal management systems and control strategies will emerge along with new HEV/EV architectures with higher voltage products. Therefore, a comprehensive review is introduced on current thermal management technologies and a helicopter view on the trends in this area in future. It is noteworthy that the thermal management for battery is out of scope here due to already existed publications. Instead, electric machine, power modules and powertrain systems are our selected topics in respective sections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Thermal Management Systems in Powertrain</title><p id="Par24">The significance of vehicle thermal management system is to improve the automotive thermal efficiency, as well as to achieve passenger comfort and long-lasting component reliability. There are increasing researchers exploring advanced approaches to vehicle thermal management to increase fuel economy while maintaining passenger comfort. The effectiveness of vehicle thermal management systems can be evaluated by the thermal load reduction for automotive powertrains and the thermal comfort improvement in cabins. In the same time, an efficient vehicle thermal management system can boost the automotive thermal efficiency which leads to higher fuel economy of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) or miles per charge of electric vehicles (EVs); therefore, an optimised vehicle thermal management system is crucial for both ICEVs and EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The difference between the thermal management solutions for ICEVs and EVs is also obvious, which exists in the energy source, powertrain and HVAC system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The energy of propulsion in ICEVs comes from the combustion of fossil fuel in ICE. With regard to EVs, this energy is provided by batteries instead of engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The elimination of engine waste heat, combined with advanced thermal management requirements in electrified powertrain, leads to new challenges in thermal load reduction and cabin comfort in EVs. According to the difference in operating temperature, EVs have two separate loops for cooling batteries, electric motors and power electronics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The battery thermal management system has seen decent development during the last few years. Many contributions have been made in research of controlling battery-operating temperature and improving battery temperature consistency by global research institutions and car manufactures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There are plentiful studies reviewing the recent development of battery thermal management for EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; therefore, the present work will mainly focus on the thermal management of electrified powertrain and HVAC system for EVs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of a thermal management system for electric vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Thermal Management in Electrified Powertrain</title><p id="Par25">The powertrains for ICEVs and EVs are completely different, thus resulting in requirement of different thermal management systems. With regard to ICEVs, ICE is the core component for generating work and the focus of thermal management. A typical ICE produces enough excess mechanical power to drive water pump, compressor and other heat dissipating components to control the temperature of engine and cabin. Different from ICEVs, batteries are the main power source of EVs; therefore, the thermal management of batteries is more important in EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, although the electric power components can achieve higher power efficiency with relatively lower heat generating rate, the high temperature sensitivity and low operating temperature range of these components require that the thermal management system must have quick real-time response to the vehicle driving condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Motor, power modules and transmission are three major components that need to be cooled down by the thermal management system in electrified powertrain.</p><p id="Par26">With the development of EVs, the modern electrified powertrain is highly integrated. The integration of motor, power module and transmission takes the advantages of downsizing layout space, reducing the total weight of powertrain and flexibility for different platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The cooling circuit of thermal management system will also be simplified as a result of highly integrated electrified powertrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Normally, there is a low-temperature water circuit for cooling the silicon steel sheets in the stator of the motor and power module and a high-temperature oil circuit for cooling copper winding in the motor and transmission box. Because of the integration, the water circuit and oil circuit can be combined together; the heat will be exchanged between these two circuits to achieve the operating temperature for each component, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.Â 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Distribution of cooling circuits in integrated electrified powertrain</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">Therefore, the thermal management for an electrified powertrain should consider the cooling for each component as well as the distribution of cooling circuits, in order to achieve the best thermal performance with the lowest pumping power and maintain the temperature of each component at its optimal value. The detailed review on the thermal management technologies for motor and power modules will be presented in the following section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>HVAC System in Electric Vehicles</title><p id="Par28">The HVAC systems in cars provide heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (AC) in the cabin of all the vehicles. It is necessary to control the interior thermal environment of the vehicle and ensure safety in visibility. The difference between the HVAC systems in ICEVs and EVs can be well summarised as follows. Firstly, the difference in driving power for compressor needs to be noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The compressor in ICEVs is a belt-driven component mechanically coupled to the engine crank shaft; the performance is directly related to the vehicle speed; while in EVs, an electricity-driven compressor is utilised and thus the speed of compressor can be adjusted independently to meet the cooling and heating loads. However, the recharge mileage of an EV is reduced drastically when the AC system is operating. Secondly, the waste heat from combustion in ICEVs can be reused for warming up the air in the cabin without further consumption of fossil fuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; whereas, in the EVs, different heating schemes and sources are necessary in order to heat vehicle cabin as the waste heat gained from the motors and battery is normally far less than the demand of heating cabin. Therefore, EVs are faced with a particular challenge to the development of more efficient AC systems. The configuration of AC system in ICEVs and EVs is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.Â 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Difference between the configuration of AC system in ICVs (<bold>a</bold>) and EVs (<bold>b</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par29">There are mainly two solutions for AC system in EVs, namely AC system based on vapour compression (VC) cycle or AC system without VC cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The VC cycle is still dominant in the AC systems for EVs. There are two different methods for heating the air in cabin. One is the vapour compression refrigeration-dedicated heater (VCR-DH) system, which uses electricity or fuel-operated heater to warm cabin air; the other is the vapour compression heat pump (VC-HP) system, which achieves the heating by adopting a compressor controlled by the inverter and a four-way valve to reverse the direction of refrigerant flow. The basic structure of VCR-DH system and VC-HP system is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.Â 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure schematic for AC systems based on VC cycle: <bold>a</bold> VCR-DH system and <bold>b</bold> VC-HP system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par30">The VCR-DH system is advantageous for the EVs owing to its reliability and simplicity, but this solution suffers the defect of drastic recharge mileage reductions caused by large electricity consumption of heating, especially in cold districts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Normally, the driving range decreases by about 15% and 45% when cooling system and heater are operated, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There are plenty of efforts having been made to improve the thermal efficiency of the VCR-DH system. In Toyota Prius, a two-phase ejector was employed to improve the system efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The ejector was integrated into the evaporator to reduce the volume of the device. The ejector reduces compressor power consumption by 11%, 18% and 24% at different temperature ranges for the Prius HEVs. The different coolant operating model could also play an important role in improving thermal efficiency. The coolant flow can be coordinated by a valve to link or unlink with the battery cooling system, in order to get a shorter warm-up phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. High-voltage layer heater is another technology that can reduce the energy consumption by about 18% in the warm-up phase than other comparable technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, this innovative high-voltage layer heater can achieve the power density of 3.2Â W/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is almost twice of that achieved by the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heater, with less weight added to the whole vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The improvement in sintering process or coating to enhance heat transfer between surfaces is another optimisation mechanism to the energy consumption of the EVâs heating system. Shin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Bauml et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] carried out a series of studies on sintering and coating process, reducing energy consumption of the VCR-DH system by 70% and 50%, respectively.</p><p id="Par31">The VC-HP system is promising owing to the prospects of energy efficiency and compact system; however, there are many obstacles that prevent this system from practical application, such as decrements of heating capacity in cold weather and defrosting of exterior heat exchanger. The basic VC-HP AC system of EV is similar to the residential heat pump AC system, and according to the research from Clodic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] the driving range of EVs can be decreased by 10% in winter and by 15% in summer with the employment of the reversible VC-HP system. Obviously, the heat pump system is a practical and promising solution to the AC systems in EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the aim of the VC-HP system in EVs is suggested generally to be focused on demisting and dehumidifying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The improvement on thermal efficiency of VC-HP systems is divided into different routes. Several technologies, such as hybrid systems with an electric heater, economised vapour injection (EVI) and waste heat recovery, have been utilised to improve the heating performance at low ambient temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] presented a combined system consisting of a heat pump and a PTC heater as a heating unit in EVs. Experimental results showed that the heating capacity was increased by 59% for the combined system and the coefficient of performance (COP) was also increased significantly in heat pump system. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] designed an air-source heat pump based on a scroll compressor operating with EVI cycle for EVs and carried out a series of simulation and experimental studies.

Thermal limit of each component is a key factor that indicates the quality of whole module packaging process.</p><p id="Par54">Mainly, the heat losses can be divided into two categories: (1) conduction lossesâvoltage drop across the IGBTs or MOSFETs depending on the conducted current; (2) switching lossesâon and off stages of the modules depending on the current, duty cycle, switching voltage and switching frequency. In some MOSFETs, only electrons flow during forward conduction without minority carriers. Therefore, switching frequency of MOSFETs is only limited by the applied charges and the capacitances itself. This means it could be applied under higher switching frequency with less parasitic heat losses. On the other hand, IGBTs could achieve higher current density and capability than MOSFETs, and it could achieve much lower on-state voltage decrease. So the balance in trade-offs between switching and conduction losses needs to be carefully evaluated when selecting the proper products to match specific performance requests such as family cars or roadsters in different niche markets.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Power Module Cooling Challenges: A Power Density Problem</title><p id="Par55">The heat transfer path through source to heat sink is usually evaluated by lumped parameter analysis. There are many 1D, 2D, pesudo-2D and full 3D thermal resistance models available, following the basic structure as depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>. Traditionally, the thermal resistance of baseplate from case and heat sink to ambient creates most cause of temperature difference; research focuses on various cooling methods or new materials to enhance the heat transfer in order to minimise the thermal impacts including adopting SiC, AlN, GaN or other advanced wideband gap materials. Although not all performance problems are caused by thermally related issues, the whole packaging lifespan will eventually be reflected thermally in real operations such as wiring lift-offs, solder creeping/climbing, layer delamination and cracks due to rapid and frequent thermal shocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig.Â 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conventional air-cooled power module structure</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par56">Heat flux in power modules is varied which depended on the duty cycle and real-time switching frequency; it range from below 10Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> to 1000Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> in microseconds.

In most designs, the worst-case scenario is usually selected and studied when sizing the thermal management system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In other words, unfortunately, the thermal imbalance problem remains unsolved in most cases. It is suggested here that both thermal load and temperature distribution issues should be comprehensively considered. Localised hotspots around junctions should be tackled with appropriate heat spreading techniques, and the abundant thermal layers like baseplate could be removed or integrated into heat sinks. Higher thermal conductivity materials, such as aluminium nitride (AlN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], are being explored in order to replace aluminium oxides (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) ceramic substrates.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig.Â 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Example of heat flux versus switching frequency in different duty cycles for a typical IGBT (<italic>V</italic><sub>off</sub>â=â600Â V, <italic>I</italic><sub>c</sub>â=â120 A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cutting-Edge Power Electronic Cooling Solutions</title><p id="Par57">The choices of cold source in the automotive are quite different from other sectors. The parasitic heat loss from vehicle will be dissipated into ambient air ultimately even if energy storage systems are involved. Therefore, cooling thorough ventilation is the most economical way to have a system built upon. Such single-phase cooling technologies including air and waterâglycol are mostly used in thermal management of power modules as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>. With increasing heat dissipation rate, however, it is predicted that conventional air cooling solution fails to meet cooling demand sufficiently, especially when the power dissipation exceeds up to 1500Â W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Micro- and mini-channel liquid cooling solutions were focused over the past decade. It has a major advantage of simplicity of heat sink design due to compactness and lightweight. It can also offer a higher cooling capacity (typically 120Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>) in comparison with that of air cooling (typically 50Â W/cm<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Yin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] designed a rectangular micro-channel heat sink fabricated directly in the AlN layer of substrate. The simulation results showed that the thermal resistance of the proposed structure was 0.128Â K/W at a pressure drop of 66.6Â kPa, which was reduced by 80% compared with conventional structure. Stevanovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] developed an integral micro-channel heat sink for power electronics. An array of sub-millimetre channels was directly fabricated on the back side of the substrate. The junction to fluid thermal resistance for IGBTs was 0.17Â Â°CÂ·cm<sup>2</sup>/W. Vafai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] proposed a numerical model to analyse two-layered micro-channel heat sink with respect to thermal performance and pressure drop. It was found that the streamwise temperature rise on the base surface and pressure drop were both reduced in comparison with the one-layered heat sink. Naqiuddin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] reviewed micro-channel design for high heat flux applications such as solar cell, fuel cell, heat exchanger and medical system. However, low temperature uniformity caused by flow redistribution, channel clogging erosion and low-term reliability still need to be carefully considered. In particular, heat transfer coefficient of micro-channels strongly depends on the size of channel and fluid flow rate, whereas pumping power inevitably increases with heat transfer rate. In order to decrease the working load of pump, jet impingement becomes an attractive cooling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. It is able to generate high flow rate of fluid with lower pump pressure and yield high local heat transfer rate. JÃ¶rg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] developed a direct single impinging jet for cooling of a MOSFET power electronic module. Heat transfer rate could be as high as 12,000Â W/m<sup>2</sup>Â·K. Nonetheless, temperature distribution of the cooled surface is non-uniform because cooling performance rapidly degrades when it is away from the center of the jet region. In order to improve temperature uniformity, array impingement cooling should be paid more attention. Bhunia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] carried out an experiment about an array impingement cooling system employing 441 nozzles, each with a diameter of 200Â Âµm. Results indicated that the average heat transfer coefficient was not largely reduced and it was capable of cooling a few square centimetre area to hundred square centimetre area. Gould et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] contrasted thermal performance of cold plat cooling, micro-channel cooling and the array jet impingement cooling of silicon carbide power conversion module for vehicle application. The jet impingement cooling reduces junction to coolant thermal resistance by 2.8 and 1.7 times compared to cooling plate and micro-channel cooler. In general, heat flux levels of around 250Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1000Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> for water have been reported for single-phase and phase change impingement, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Although jet impingement can achieve a very high heat transfer coefficient, the applicability of this strategy is limited by problems of high cost, complex cooling flow redistribution, cooling loop leakage and channel blockage. Therefore, economical but more reliable thermal management device is needed for power module cooling purpose. Phase change cooling strategy becomes more attractive under higher thermal demands. Nonneman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] applied a model-based study on different cooling performance of power modules that integrated phase changing cooling which could match with such power density problem. Hou et al.

Vapour chamber is a vacuum metallic container with wick structure lining the internal walls saturated with working fluid. It utilises cyclic phase change heat transfer process which can absorb much more heat than single-phase heat transfer process. Generally, a vapour chamber effective thermal conductivity is in the range of 1000Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> to 50,000Â W/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref> illustrates the operational principle of a vapour chamber. In this case, as heat dissipated by IGBT chips and diodes is applied, the working fluid will immediately vaporise to fill the vacuum. Then, vapour releases its latent heat of vaporisation and condenses when it comes into contact with a cooler wall surface. Cyclically, condensed fluid returns to the heat sources due to capillary action in sintered copper wick structure lined inside wall, ready to be vaporised again and repeat next cycle. The capillary force of wick structure enables vapour chamber to overcome gravity and work in any orientation.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig.Â 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustrative schematic principle of vapour chamber with bonded IGBT substrates</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig16_HTML.png" id="MO16"/></fig></p><p id="Par59">The size of vapour chamber is compact and the same as the area of IGBT module. The most common envelope/wick and working fluid combinations are copper/water for electronics cooling. Compared with copper baseplate, vapour chamber has much higher thermal conductivity, better uniform temperature distribution, better durability and lighter weight. Moreover, vapour chamber can be integrated in many heat sinks such as pin fin structure. Li et al. and Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] conducted many research on vapour chamber and heat pipe with respect to wick structure and ultra-thin flattened heat pipes.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] proposed a heat pipe directly integrated in DBC for cooling of power semiconductor module packaging. As a result, it can reduce the high heat flux to a lower and manageable level which can be dissipated through traditional cooling solution. Bose et al.

As an example, the EV/HEV segment is driven technologically by CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction targets, higher efficiency requirements or less dependency on the fossil fuel industry. The electrification of passenger vehicles is revolutionising the power electronics industry from market and business perspectives, as well as from technology innovations. With improved power density of electronic modules, it is more sensible to integrate them into the electric machine for energy efficiency improvement.</p><p id="Par61">New semiconductor materials, wideband gap semiconductors, SiC and GaN, are intrinsically advantageous compared to silicon due to their higher band gaps, higher thermal conductivity, lower conduction losses and higher electron mobility. This gives the possibility to reduce the components size and passiveÂ devices since the switching frequency can be increased while having overall less parasitic heat losses which in turn could make the powertrain system more efficient. Wideband gap manufacturers may still have few years before mass production in automotive sector since they are very active and many pioneering prototypes are in development with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).</p><p id="Par62">In addition, new dies attachment technologies, new mould packages and packing technologies will raise new thermal challenges; such miniaturisation efforts will lead to significant power density increase. For example, new thinner film insulators, new bond-free interconnection method and new substrate material will change the thermal path completely. WithoutÂ comprehensive understandings of the thermal behaviours of new materials, it is critical for thermal engineering to provide appropriate cooling solutions to the integration efforts. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref> shows a prevailing research development among car manufacturers implying that a common cooling source linking all heat sources needs to be found. As configured, the cooling fluid, oil, waterâglycol or other advanced heat transfer fluid could be considered to extract the heat losses from inverter (high heat flux), motor (high loss) and gearbox (lubrication). In addition, the fluids could be the same from battery cooling. The overall cooling loops could be simplified with lighter pipes, valves and sensors in the HVAC subsystem. Therefore, it is imperative to find a fluid with wider range of operational condition. Working temperature range in different components varies. Batteries provide high-voltage DC with optimal temperature from 15 to 45Â Â°C; junction temperature in dies needs to be constantly below 150Â Â°C for products in current generation. Therefore, coolant temperature could reach the boiling point before entering the casing channels and internal structure in which windings temperature is designed to maintain below 180Â Â°C for continuous operations. When temperature increases over the Curie points, magnetic materials in motor could experience irreversible losses in performance which cannot be repaired by remagnetisation. In some high-speed induction motors, the AC losses could also cause significant temperature increase that leads to performance loss or even hazardous consequences. Currently, many heat transfer fluids, such as mineral oil and dielectric lubricants, could perform at higher flashing points. Without the delicate consideration of gearbox cooling and lubrication, plentiful fluids are available in the market. However, the stringent lubrication requirement imposes another difficulty on the fluid selection and mechanical design process. Usually, the oil temperature should be below 90Â Â°C, while a warm-up may still be needed in some extreme cold weather. The properties of oil or heat transfer fluids, such as viscosity, should be rationally reviewed at wider temperature range.<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig.Â 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustrative schematic of cooling concept of critical components in powertrain</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42154_2020_124_Fig17_HTML.png" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par63">Last but not least, the choices of integrating power electronics into electric motors are flexible and depend on the specific performance requests.
