Solid waste is one of most important sources of biomass potential in Algeria, which can be used as renewable energy sources.</p><p>With economic development and the evolution of population, the quantity of solid waste is increasing rapidly in Algeria; according to the National Cadastre for Solid Waste Generation, the overall generation of municipal solid waste was more than 10.3 million tons per year, and the amount of industrial solid waste, including non-hazardous and inert industrial waste was 2,547,000 tons per year, with a stock quantity of 4,483,500 tons. The hazardous waste generated amounts to 325,100 tons per year; the quantities of waste in stock and awaiting a disposal solution amount to 2,008,500 tons. Healthcare waste reaches to 125,000 tons per year.</p><p>The management of solid waste and its valorization is based on the understanding of solid waste composition by its categories and physicochemical characteristics. Elimination is the solution applied to 97% of waste produced in Algeria. Wastes are disposed in the following ways: open dumps (57%), burned in the open air in public dumps or municipal uncontrolled ones (30%), and controlled dumps and landfill (10%). On the other side, the quantities destined for recovery are too low: only 2% for recycling and 1% for composting.</p><p>Waste to energy is very attractive option for elimination solid waste with energy recovery. In this paper, we give an overview for this technology, including its conversion options and its useful products (such as electricity, heat and transportation fuel), and waste to energy-related environmental issues and its challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Algeria</kwd><kwd>Renewable energies</kwd><kwd>Solid waste</kwd><kwd>Physicochemical properties</kwd><kwd>Waste management</kwd><kwd>Valorization</kwd><kwd>Waste to energy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>33</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2012</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2012</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40095_2012_Article_14.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1186/2251-6832-3-17" ext-link-type="doi">10.1186/2251-6832-3-17</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Review</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to use the enormous source of renewable energies, Algeria has created a green momentum by launching an ambitious program to develop renewable energies (RES) and promote energy efficiency. This program leans on a strategy focused on developing and expanding the use of inexhaustible resources, such as solar, biomass, geothermal, wind, and hydropower, energies in order to diversify energy sources and prepares Algeria for tomorrow.</p><p>The program consists of installing up to 22,000 MW of power-generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030, of which 12,000 MW will be intended to meet the domestic electricity demand and 10,000 MW destined for export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This last option depends on the availability of a demand that is ensured on the long term by reliable partners as well as on attractive external funding. In this program, it is expected that about 40% of electricity produced for domestic consumption will be from renewable energy sources by 2030.</p><p>Solid waste is one of most important sources of biomass potential in Algeria, which is a by-product from human activities, and is characterized by the negative impacts that may affect man and the environment when disposed in an inappropriate way without treatment. Due to the continuously increasing amount of solid waste generated, particularly in capitals and major urban centers, the challenge for the governments is to reduce the waste’s harmful impacts to both health and the environment. This paper is an investigation on the possibility to use solid waste as a source of bioenergy in Algeria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Country profile</title><p>Algeria, situated in the center of North Africa between the 35° to 38° latitude north and 8° to 12° longitude east, has an area of 2,381,741 km<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the west, Algeria borders with Morocco, Mauritania, and Occidental Sahara; in the southwest, with Mali; in the east, with Tunisia and Libya; and in the southeast, with Niger (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The geographic location of Algeria signifies that it is in a position to play an important strategic role in the implementation of renewable energy technology in the north of Africa.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Map of Algeria.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2012_Article_14_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The climate is transitional between maritime (north) and semi-arid to arid (middle and south). The mean annual precipitation varies from 500 mm (in the north) to 150 mm (in the south). The average annual temperature is around 12°C.</p><p>Algeria has a strongly growing population, with 36,275,358 inhabitants in 2011 according to Population Reference Bureau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the last 25 years, it has almost doubled. Though we notice a slowing down in the 1990s, the last statistics (sizable increase in marriage rate and in fertility rate) indicate that it is a short-term phenomenon, and the population growth is taking a turn towards fast growth. Algeria is characterized by a young and growing population and a fast urbanization. This situation puts certainly a lot of pressure on the energy, food supply, and even on the environment by increasing the generation of waste and residues.</p><p>Algeria plays a very important role in the world energy markets, both as a significant hydrocarbon producer and as an exporter, as well as a key participant in the renewable energy market. According to the 2011 BP Statistical Energy Survey, in 2010, Algeria had proved a natural gas reserve of 4.5 trillion m<sup>3</sup> and natural gas production of 80.41 billion m<sup>3</sup> with consumption of 28.87 billion m<sup>3</sup>. Algeria had proved an oil reserve of 12.2 billion barrels at the end of 2010 and produced an average of 1,809 thousand barrels of crude oil per day, according to the same survey; Algeria consumed an average of 327.03 thousand barrels a day of oil in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Promotion of renewable energies in Algeria</title><p>Algeria’s location has several advantages for extensive use of most of the RES, in which it has very important potential of renewable energies including thermal solar (169,440 TWh/year), photovoltaic solar (13.9 TWh/year), and wind energy (35 TWh/year).</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Solar energy</title><p>Fortunately, Algeria has enormous potential of solar energy.

The map also shows that the south-western region experiences high wind speeds for a significant fraction of the year. The Algerian RES program plans at first, in the period of 2011 to 2013, the installation of the first wind farm with a power of 10 MW in Adrar. Between 2014 and 2015, two wind farms with a capacity of 20 MW each are to be developed.

It includes mainly household (domestic waste), commercial, and institutional wastes (generated from shops and institutions). These wastes are generally in solid or semi-solid form. It can be classified as biodegradable waste that includes food and kitchen waste, green waste, and paper (can also be recycled); recyclable materials such as paper, glass, bottles, cans, metals, certain plastics, etc.; inert waste such as construction and demolition wastes, dirt, rocks, and debris; composite waste which includes waste clothing, tetra packs, and waste plastics such as toys; domestic hazardous waste (also called ‘household hazardous waste’); and toxic waste like medication, e-waste, paints, chemicals, light bulbs, fluorescent tubes, spray cans, fertilizer and pesticide containers, batteries, and shoe polish.</p><p>According to the National Waste Agency (AND), Algeria produces 10.3 million tons of MSW each year or 28,219 tons per day, with a collection coverage of 85% in urban areas and 60% in rural areas, and a rate of 0.9 kg/inhabitant/day for urban zones and 0.6 kg/inhabitant/day for rural zones. In the capital (Algiers), the production is close to 1.2 kg/inhabitant/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The composition of MSW is closely related to the level of economic development and lifestyle of the residents. In different districts of the same city, the composition of MSW will be different.

However, the WTE facilities must operate under strict standards, which will minimize environmental impact and adhere to the precaution principle.</p><p>Implementation of landfill disposal techniques should be encouraged for the valorization of biogas.</p><p>Waste-to-energy and valorization of Algerian solid waste is a new subject that needs to be developed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Authors’ information</title><p>BTE received his masters degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2011 from the University of Mentouri in Algeria, and he started his doctorate in the same year.
