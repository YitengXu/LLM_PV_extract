In a nanometal medium, light can be guided, confined, and focused far beyond what conventional dielectric technology offers. Whereas in a dielectric medium, focusing is wavelength-limited (diffraction-limited) to ~300 nm at best, in a nanometal medium it is independent of the incoming wavelength, with no limit as it is only limited by the size of the nanostructure, practically confining light into super intense “hot-spots.” Moreover, nanometal shows strong color change and becomes hot and highly interactive with the environment upon light illumination. On the other hand, upon miniaturization, semiconductors provide strong size-dependent luminescence covering the full range of the RGB colors of light; becoming much brighter and may turn material from dull to glowing nature; and upon functionalization can be made highly selective in its interaction with the environment. Finally synergetic functionalities have been observed upon integration of the functionalities of nanometal and semiconductor. As to application, these novel and unprecedented functionalities have the potential to enable exciting applications in service of fields as diverse as electronics, opto- and photo-electronics, elementary particles, biomedicine, nanolithography and fabrication, and energy harvest and lighting. Finally the article presents a brief discussion of the use of nanometal lighting effects in ancient stained glass and lusterware pottery as well as a historical perspective on the development of light–matter interaction since the pioneering work of Alhazen, a millennium ago.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-319-31903-2_Chapter_10.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>output-medium</meta-name><meta-value>Online</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Optics is one of the most important branches of physics. It involves the study of the behavior and properties of light in vacuum as well as the study of its interactions with matter in the gas, liquid, and solid states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, the field encompasses the construction of instruments that use or detect light that may serve many other fields, over a wide range of the electromagnetic waves from UV to infrared light.</p><p id="Par4">Nanotechnology or nanoscience and technology, on the other hand, aims at construction, understanding, and putting to use ultrasmall particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Miniaturization of all types of matter including dielectrics, metals, semiconductors, polymers, etc., affords interesting novel properties, especially optical properties. The novel size regime is intermediate between the largest molecules and 100 nm. In this regime, phenomenon may not be as predictable as those observed at larger scales. Using nanoparticles as building blocks to construct advanced devices that exploit their novel properties is at the heart of nanotechnology.</p><p id="Par5">It is to be noted that naturally existing colloids, micelles, polymer molecules, and phase-separated regions in block copolymers, for example, fall in this size regime. More recently, naturally unknown but interesting classes of nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], silicon nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], metal nanoparticles and nanorods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and compound semiconductor quantum dots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have been designed and fabricated. The application of such extremely small particles can find applications across all fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this article we will focus on how miniaturization down to the nanoscale regime impacts the behavior, properties, and interactions of light with matter, especially metals and semiconductors, and how it enables novel advanced devices with application in electronics, photonics, energy and lighting, and biomedicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Optics in Nanometals: Nature of Interaction of Light with Metal</title><p id="Par6">In a dielectric, all electrons are bound in atoms; and each atom interacts with light individually through the interaction of a single bound electron. The total effect in a sample is simply the sum of the individual atomic responses. In a metal solid, some electrons are bound to atoms and others are not bound in specific atoms or ions. Upon interaction with light, two processes can take place in metal. In interband transition, bound electrons, i.e., electrons in the valence band can be promoted due to light absorption to an empty level in the conduction band where they become not bound to a specific ion. Interband absorption forms a significant loss mechanism in metal at optical frequencies. On the other hand, in a metal solid, electrons that are already in the conduction band form a see or cloud of electrons not bound to specific atoms or ions. The cloud can interact with and move under an external electric force collectively at the same time.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plasma Model</title><p id="Par7">
Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">10.1</xref> (left) shows a schematic of the lattice of bulk metal where electrons are subjected to a force created by the electric field of light. Free electrons move opposite to the direction of the electric field while positive ions are stationary, thus causing a shift between the center of distribution of the negative charge and the positive charge. In the absence of the force the centers of the two distributions coincide. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">10.1</xref> (right) shows the same situation for a very small sphere of metal, namely a nanoparticle.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 10.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sketch of metal lattice subjected to a force created by an electric field.

This has been called a <italic>plasma model</italic>. In the model, details of the lattice potential and electron–electron interactions are not included explicitly; rather they are simply incorporated into the effective optical mass <italic>m</italic> of each electron. Under irradiation, the negative electron’s see or cloud gets pushed back and forth relative to the fixed background of positive ion at the frequency of oscillation in the electric field of the electromagnetic light wave. In addition, the cloud experiences an effective drag force due to collisions with the positive ion core which tends to slow it down. According to the plasma model, electrons oscillate and their motion is damped with a characteristic collision frequency <italic>γ</italic> as high as 10<sup>14</sup> per second (100 THz) (corresponding to the frequency of infrared light). The time elapsed between two consecutive collisions, <italic>τ</italic> = 1/<italic>γ</italic> = 10<sup>−14</sup> s, is known as the relaxation time of the free electron gas.

Instead the motion is actually similar to a mass being dragged in a viscous fluid. If the light has a frequency above the plasma frequency (in the ultraviolet (UV) range for metals), electrons will not even oscillate and the light will simply be transmitted or absorbed in interband transitions of the metal. If the light has a frequency below UV, electrons will oscillate out of phase with the incident light, causing a strong reflection. At the plasma frequency, the dielectric function is 0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Thin Film or Sheet (2D)</title><p id="Par12">When bulk metal is shrunk to a thin film of a few nm thicknesses, electrons cannot move very far in the direction normal to the film. In this case there will be electron oscillations upon light exposure; but they will only exist at the surface of the film. This is accompanied with propagation of charge waves along the film. This is known as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) as sketched in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">10.4</xref> (left). In fact, detailed Maxwell’s theory shows that the surface waves can propagate along the surface with a broad spectrum of frequencies from 0 up to <italic>ω</italic><sub>p</sub>/√2, where <italic>ω</italic><sub>p</sub> is the plasma frequency defined above. At <italic>ω</italic><sub>p</sub>/√2 the dielectric function is −1 with a charge-wave wavelength shorter than the wavelength of the incident light. The combined effect is a mixed or hybrid light-electron-wave-state. This results in intense light–matter interactions with unprecedented optical response. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">10.4</xref> (right), the intense optical field resulting from the hybrid field is a local one, extending outside the thin film into the dielectric only few nanometers, a distance much less than the wavelength of the incident light (<italic>d</italic> « <italic>λ</italic>

Thus visible light, which has a wavelength of approximately half a micrometer, can be concentrated by a factor of nearly 100 to travel through metal films just a few nanometers (nm) thick.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 10.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of light interaction with a few nm thin metal films (<italic>left</italic>) shows electron oscillations at the surface of the film, accompanied with propagation of charge waves along the film.

For example, chemically prepared silver nanowires ~100 nm diameters were fabricated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The wires were found to support surface plasmon modes propagating along the wires. The wavelength of the propagating charge wave is shortened to about half the wavelength of exciting light. The propagation length of SPP is about 10 μm. The reflectivity at both ends of the wire is about 25 %. Those characteristics are sufficient for the wires to be used as an optical instrument, namely surface plasmon Fabry–Perot resonators. Wires can also be in the form of a cylindrical shell of metal. The shell may have an inner dielectric jacket, such as glass (silicon oxide). The bore of the system may be filled with a semiconductor, such as Si or CdSe. More complicated variations of these architectures have been fabricated to accommodate ports for light entry or extraction.

Because the size of the particle is small compared to the wavelength the incident electric field will be constant across the nanoparticle, inducing a uniform displacement of the electron density, making the electron motion in phase (collective cloud motion). Because electrons are confined within the small particle, they will oscillate while being accompanied by a strong restoring force from specific positive ionic core background (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">10.5a</xref>). The restoring force leads to non-propagating (also called evanescent) collective oscillation of the surface cloud with a characteristic oscillation frequency similar to a simple harmonic oscillator. This is unlike bulk which does not have a specific oscillation frequency. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">10.5b</xref> shows representative field lines, effectively resembling those of an oscillating electric dipole. Another striking effect is that the collective oscillations lead to a large absorption and scattering cross section, as well as an amplified local optical electromagnetic field. The electric field has its maximum strength just outside the nanoparticle and drops rapidly with distance extending only to ~30 nm. For small particles less than ~15 nm, light absorption dominates; whereas for nanoparticles greater than ~15 nm scattering dominates. In fact, detailed Maxwelĺs theory shows that surface waves can be resonantly sustained with frequency at <italic>ω</italic><sub>p</sub>/√3, which corresponds to dielectric function of −2. We should stress because the evanescent light is non-propagating it is localized within the approximate radius of the particle, even if the size of that particle is much smaller than the incident light wavelength (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">10.5c</xref>). The region where the non-propagating evanescent light is localized is related only to the object’s size and not to the wavelength, which can be considered as light with no diffraction limit. The nanoparticle practically confines light into super intense “hot-spot.”<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 10.5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of the interaction of a gold nanoparticle with linearly polarized light beam.

(1) Consider the hollow cone of metal shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">10.7</xref> (left). The radius of the cone gradually decreases from 50 nm to 2 nm, for example. When light strikes the cone and a plasmonic resonance is excited at the opening of the cone, a surface plasmonic polariton (SPP) propagates towards the tip. This causes accumulation of energy resulting in a giant local field at the tip, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">10.7</xref> (left). Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">10.7</xref> (right) displays the amplitudes of the local optical field in the cross section of the cone for the normal and longitudinal (with respect to the axis) components of the optical electric field. The magnitude of the field grows significantly as the oscillations approach the tip. The transverse x component grows by an order of magnitude, while the longitudinal <italic>z</italic> component, which is very small far from the tip, grows relatively much stronger at the tip. This causes the local field to increase by nearly 3 orders of magnitude in intensity and four orders in energy density. It should be noted that the propagation is slowed down and asymptotically stopped when it approaches the tip. It never actually reaches the tip (the travel time to the tip is logarithmically divergent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The cone as such may represent a tapered plasmonic waveguide.

When light, in the wavelength range of 700–860 nm, for example, is normally incident on the thin film on the right of the chain, charge oscillations are induced on the surface of the film which travel or propagate to the left towards the chain (surface plasmon polariton or SPP).

At plasmon resonances they have a negative index. In fact those may be considered as a class of more general material called metamaterials that exhibit properties beyond those found in nature. In 1967 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] Victor Veselago theorized that material with negative refractive index would exhibit optical properties opposite to those of dielectrics, such as glass or air. Contrary to dielectrics, when light propagates in metamaterial (1) light refracts on the other side of the normal to the interface, that is, energy is transported in a direction opposite to the dielectric case, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10.10</xref>; (2) light produces negative pressure, which pulls metamaterial towards it instead of positive pressure which pushes away as in conventional material. The basic principle behind all of the opposite effects is closely related to the above plasmonic effect. They are due to the collective interaction of the light with the electron clouds at the surface of the conductor. This photon–plasmon interaction generates intense, localized optical fields. The waves are confined to the interface between metal and insulator. This narrow channel serves as a transformative guide that, in effect, traps and compresses the wavelength of incoming light to a fraction of its original value.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10.10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of light refraction at a plane interface of dielectric—dielectric interface and at a dielectric—metamaterial (negative index) interface</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/370011_1_En_10_Fig10_HTML.gif" id="MO11"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Heat Loss: Are Plasmonic-Based Devices Practical?</title><p id="Par22">One pivotal problem inherit in plasmonic technology is heat loss.

Among all metals, noble metals of gold and silver show the least energy loss. That is why gold and silver are used in most common plasmonics. Even in gold and silver, losses in the optical range including near- and mid-infrared (IR) regions are effectively still too high to make practical plasmon-based devices.

Separation of the electron from the positive charge leaves behind in the valence band what is called a positive hole. The electron as well as the positive hole are free to move away from their original common site; but they move together as an electron–hole pair or exciton, with the electron orbiting around the hole at an average distance or exciton Bohr radius. In silicon, for example, the Bohr radius is 4.2 nm. The exciton structure is actually an “atom” which in some respect resembles the structure of a hydrogen atom, but 100–200-fold larger. Because of the large size, excitons are less bound and more fragile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Direct and Indirect Bandgap Materials</title><p id="Par26">The interaction (absorption or emission) of light with matter must satisfy the conservation of energy and momentum. The ability of meeting these conservations laws depends on the type of material. Two classes of semiconductors are interesting in this regard: indirect bandgap materials such as silicon and direct bandgap semiconductor such as CdSe (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">10.12</xref>). The bandgap is called “direct” if the momentum of electrons and holes is the same in both the conduction band and the valence band. In this case an electron can directly emit a photon, which conserves energy while the momentum is automatically conserved, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">10.12</xref> (left). In an “indirect” gap material, the momentum of electron and hole are not the same; hence a photon cannot be readily emitted because, to conserve momentum, the electron must pass through an intermediate state and transfer momentum in the form of phonon quanta to the crystal lattice, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">10.12</xref> (right). The probability of coincidence of three particles: electron, hole, and phonon with specific properties is significantly lower than the coincidence of only two such particles (electron and hole). Thus, the probability of emission of a photon is much lower in indirect bandgap semiconductors than in direct bandgap ones. Bulk silicon is therefore a very poor light emitter, while in most cases, the direct bandgap semiconductors are good light emitters. Direct bandgap material is therefore used in light emitting devices, while indirect bandgap material is used in electronic devices.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 10.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of the band structure showing the conduction and valence bands for direct bandgap material and indirect bandgap material</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/370011_1_En_10_Fig12_HTML.gif" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Enhancing and Blue Shifting of Luminescence by Quantum Confinement</title><p id="Par27">
As we shrink the size of direct semiconductor material, novel optical properties begin to emerge as we approach a certain characteristic size scale. The characteristic scale is the electron–hole distance (the Bohr radius) of the material. For example, for CdSe the Bohr radius is 5.6 nm. In this regime, the interaction of light with the material gets modified because quantum quantization of the energy levels of the electron as well as that of the hole according to Pauli’s exclusion principle becomes important. A simplified treatment considers the energy of the electron and the hole as the energy of the charge in an infinite well (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">10.13</xref>). The top well is for an electron and the bottom inverted well is for a hole.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 10.13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simplified infinite well model of the energy of the electron and the hole in a quantum dot.

Strong ultrasound was used to shatter porous silicon into micro- and nanoparticles. But the particles do not have specific configuration or uniformity because silicon is a hard material and the particles are basically a result of mechanical stress and shattering of the interconnected skeletal backbone. In 1997, a new self-limiting etching procedure was developed by the Nayfeh’s group at the University of Illinois which produced on the silicon wafer disconnected individual spherical nanoparticles of preferred or magic configuration or sizes, which can be softly retrieved and stored in a liquid of choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Moreover, excitons get more strongly confined spatially, causing the momentum of the electron and hole to spread out appreciably according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, such that their momentum distributions can overlap. In the overlapping region, the momentum conservation may be readily satisfied; thus recombination of the electron and hole to turn the excess energy into light becomes stronger and faster than producing vibration and heat. In this case a photon (light) is produced, with the energy of the emitted photon (color of the light emitted) depending on the size of the particle.</p><p id="Par34">For a nanoparticle size of 1 nm, for example, emission of blue photons dominates the production of vibration and heat making it very bright with a performance that matches particles of direct bandgap material as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">10.18</xref> (top left) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

A considerable amount of basic knowledge as well as novel functions of nanomatter has accumulated over the past 20 years. Some applications have already reached the practical level, while others are futuristic. In this section we briefly present some practical applications of optics in nanotechnology in service of fields as diverse as electronics, opto- and photo-electronics, elementary particles, biomedicine, energy harvest and lighting, and art as in stained glass and lusterware pottery.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Integration of Optics and Electronics</title><p id="Par39">Bulk semiconductors, especially silicon, form the backbone of modern electronics and computing. Bulk silicon, however, is a very dull material, being an especially poor emitter of light, turning added energy into heat. This makes integrating electronic and photonic circuits a challenge. There have been several proposals to alleviate this problem. One approach involves doping silicon with other materials. However, the emitted light is not in the visible rather in deep infrared. Moreover, the emission is not very efficient and can degrade the electronic properties of silicon. Another approach is to use nanotechnology by making silicon devices that are very small, such as using luminescent nanoparticles, five nanometers in diameter or less as introduced above. As we have seen above, at that size quantum confinement effects allow the device to emit light. But making electrical connections at that scale is not currently feasible and may compromise the optical activity of the nanomaterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], as well as afford very low electrical conductivity.</p><p id="Par40">Another scheme involves subjecting bulk silicon to concentrated fields of plasmonics. The high fields afforded by plasmonic nanometal material can cause distortion and modification of the crystal structure, hence the interaction with light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. We describe briefly an architecture that demonstrates some of these effects. First a pure silicon nanowire is wrapped with a coating of glass, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">10.20</xref> (left). Then it is mounted on a glass substrate. Then it is coated with silver. Because of the glass substrate, silver does not wrap completely around the wire, effectively making the silver coating take the shape Ω. This leaves a narrow transparent glass window through which a laser beam can be sent in and emitted light can be extracted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Practically, this narrow window did not compromise the silver coating from acting as a plasmonic cavity. When a narrow band blue laser beam is sent through the window, the silicon wire produces white light that spans the visible spectrum, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">10.20</xref> (right). It is to be noted that bare silicon wires do not produce such white light when excited by the blue laser, indicating plasmonic effects.

The designation “strong field” applies to an external electromagnetic field that is sufficiently strong to cause significant alterations in atomic or molecular structure and dynamics of the material. Present-day laser technology as well as light enhancement due to plasmonic effects has made it possible to study the behavior of atoms and molecules in fields that have peak electric field strength of the order of atomic fields inside atoms or molecules.

As discussed above, hybrid-plasmonic monolithic nanowire optical cavities highlight recent progress made in tailoring light–matter coupling strengths.</p><p id="Par43">Detailed Maxwell’s theory was used to calculate the enhancement in intensity of light and the corresponding electric fields of light in the proximity of gold nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

The enhancement based on these theoretical estimations can be as large as a factor of 10, which provides enhancements of two orders of magnitude in intensity.

Because of the short range of the field, it interacts only with nanostructures next to it, within ~10–30 nm. Thus it provides spatial nanoresolution. This opens up many applications, especially those optical processes or phenomena that depend very sensitively on the magnitude of the electric field, such as fluorescence, Raman scattering, and infrared absorption, resulting in plasmon-enhanced fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy.</p><p id="Par45">The Raman scattering effect, for example, depends on the fourth power of the field; thus they are enhanced if scattering is performed with the confined light near a metal nanoparticle rather than with ordinary propagating light. The Raman scattering effect is used for sensing and identification of substances. When a substance is irradiated with light, it scatters light called Raman light at a wavelength or frequency slightly shifted from the wavelength of the original irradiated light by an amount equal to the natural frequency of molecules that make up the substance. So, detecting the Raman light and analyzing its spectrum allows the identification of the substance. Since Raman light is usually very weak, detecting its intensity directly is quite difficult. If the electrical field strength is increased 10 times by surface plasmon resonance, then the Raman light is intensified 10<sup>4</sup> times so the intensity becomes 10,000 times higher.</p><p id="Par46">Another interesting phenomenon of strong fields is the ability to optically manipulate the structure of molecules. Since the electric field in the vicinity of the plasmonic nanoparticles drops very rapidly over 10 nm, different parts of large molecules will experience different electric field strengths hence different electric stress. This causes distortion within the molecules and consequently causes new ways to deliver energy to the molecule including vibrations, nonlinearities, and electronic structure, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">10.22</xref>.

Below the tip is a conducting substrate at a distance of 1 nm. When the tip is biased by 1–3 V, an electric field is setup in the gap which can reach more than 100 MV/cm. An intense pulsed laser light bathes the metal tip and the gap and the substrate. The electric field in the vicinity of the gap is very strong due to the dc field of the tip as well as to plasmonic fields. The combined effect of the light and electric field is confined to a nanospace and will be very intense on atoms or molecules falling in this space near the tip. The intense pulsed laser light can be tuned to resonate with a certain state in an atom or molecule, promoting them to high-lying excited states while the combined electric field can assist in stripping the excited electron to produce a single ionization event of a free electron and a free ion. Since the electric field is focused or confined to nanoscale then the atomic ion is accelerated, pushed, and guided to the surface with nanoscale resolution. Programming the position of the tip allowed the Nayfeh’s group to make nanopatterns on the surface with atomic resolution.

A thin film of silicon nanoparticles or capsules of silicon nanoparticles, for example, are placed on top of a silicon-based p-n junction (amorphous, polycrystalline, or monocrystalline silicon solar cell). When light strikes the nanoparticles some light is absorbed. As a result, electron hole (e–h) pairs (excitons) are produced in the nanoparticles. If the electron and hole are separated from each other completely before they could recombine to produce light (luminescence) or recombine non-radiatively to produce vibrations and heat then the electrons and holes may be transported, collected, and stored on two external electrodes appropriately constructed and positioned.

Light emitting diodes (LED) are chips powered by electricity. They produce light of specific color in the UV, blue, green, or red light range. White light bulbs for domestic use can be manufactured by combing light from three LEDs: blue, green, and red. Because the emission of each LED is not wide enough, the mix produces “finger shaped” spectrum, not smooth as normal sun light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">10.27</xref> middle). The problem has been somewhat alleviated and simplified in recent years by using a single blue LED source and a wide band green/orange phosphor converter, which combines to a better filled spectrum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">10.27</xref> bottom right). Although the mix produces a “hand-shaped” spectrum and short of full match with sun light as it is missing a red component, the developers of this process Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura were awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. The first LED (red) was invented by Nick Holonyak at the University of Illinois several decades earlier (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.led50years.illinois.edu/nicks-story.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.led50years.illinois.edu/nicks-story.html</ext-link>), but it was deemed that the more recent blue LED (invented by the awardees) and its use in this configuration afforded a very important service, namely filling the world with new “white” light. A third solution is a UV LED and three wide band phosphor converters (blue, green, and red phosphor). However, there is a problem with red phosphor converters as they are based on europium (Eu). In addition to problems of availability and stability, those provide spectra dominated by sharp red lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">10.27</xref> bottom left), which produces a mixed spectrum with sharp lines not smooth enough as normal white sun light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">10.27</xref> top).

Secondly, the distribution of nanoparticles was programmed to include multilayers such that luster decoration color can change depending on the angle from which it is observed. An example of these types of ceramic decorations is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig31" ref-type="fig">10.31</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The color change is spectacular and brilliant. A variety of very intense colored metallic shine including golden-yellow, blue, green, pink, etc., can be observed.

For centuries to follow, artists kept mixing silver and gold powder with glass or ceramics to fabricate colorful glass or pottery while no body was able to produce a scientific reason as to how these ingredients worked. The first step towards explaining the phenomenon had to wait until 1908 when Gustav Mie developed a theory of the optical properties of metallic colloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. He showed that the color of a metal nanoparticle depends on its size as well as on the optical properties of the precursor metal and the adjacent dielectric materials.

One of the major scientific anniversaries that will be celebrated during the 2015 International Year of Light is the works on optics by Alhazen (Ibn Al-Haytham) (1015).

Moreover, 1001 Inventions and the King Abdulaziz Center for World culture in partnership with UNESCO and the IYL2015 are planning to produce a short film on his work.

Newton 600 years later used manufactured glass prisms which became available then to deliberately disperse light into its components and to introduce the seven color names red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet for segments of the spectrum. Nearly 300 years after Newton Theodor “Ted” Hansch and Arthur Schawlow of Stanford University and John “Jan” Hall of the University of Colorado set out to achieve big strides in the quest to disperse light and isolate extremely narrow components using much more advanced electronics and optics capabilities, such as prisms, gratings, interference filters, spectrographs, and telescopic light expanders. But such a highly pure color components would have extremely weak intensity, which would necessarily require amplification if it is to be a practical light source. In 1972, the Stanford group dispersed the red fluorescence from a chemical dye into much finer components while simultaneously being amplified using the very advanced light–matter interaction concepts of stimulated emission (introduced by Einstein) and laser gain (Schawlow inventor) to produce a narrowband directed red laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation). Pulses or flashes of red light of 8 ns durations with a record color definition (bandwidth) of 0.0004 Å (or 0.001 cm<sup>−1</sup> or 30 MHz) and energy of ~1 nJ per pulse were achieved (Hansch laser). In addition to being narrow band, the laser allows for change (tuning) of wavelength with good control and precision, a pivotal property for matching (resonating with) and studying electronic structure of atoms and molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. John Hall, on the other hand, used a different approach by starting out with the red light of a helium–neon gas laser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. This red laser light at a given time is narrow band (very pure in color) but it is practically not as narrow over longer times because its frequency or wavelength drifts as a result of drift in ambient conditions (temperature, vibrations, etc.). Using advanced optical and electronic equipment he succeeded in making the frequency or wavelength practically stand still for long times. This high finesse light source is extremely useful but it is not tunable in wavelength.</p><p id="Par80">The two groups used these advanced devices in which the color of light has been defined much more precisely to perform high resolution laser spectroscopy measurements of unprecedented accuracy and intrinsic physical interest. Jan Hall used his source to measure accurately the speed of light, allowing a re-definition of the SI meter. It should be mentioned here that the first version of the helium–neon laser was invented in 1960 by Ali Javan (Azerbajani born in Tehran, Iran) at Bell Labs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. However the laser produced invisible light at 1.15 μm. Only 18 months later in 1962, Javan’s colleagues White and Rigden of Bell Lab constructed the visible He–Ne laser which is more exciting, captivating, and convenient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">The Stanford group utilized the tunability of the Hansch laser in a Doppler free technique that was introduced theoretically earlier by Russian scientists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The technique allows the laser to be blind to all moving atoms in a gas sample and see only the ones that happen to be stationary along the direction of the red light beam, which unmasks the true structure of the atoms.

Such heat losses have seriously limited their practical use in electronics; but the heat effect was turned into an asset in the fight on acute disease at the cellular level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><sec><p>We acknowledge financial grants that supported our work on Nanoengineered light emitting silicon, including the University of Illinois, US National Science Foundation, US Army, US Office of Naval Research, State of Illinois, Grainger Foundation, Beckman Foundation, King Fahd University, King Saud University and King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Sharp of America, and SunGen of Canada, and Saudi ARAMCO.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Occasion</title><p id="Par89">2015 has been declared as the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies.
