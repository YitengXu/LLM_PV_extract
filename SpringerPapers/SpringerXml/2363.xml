However, inherent limitations such as short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), high charge recombination rate and slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> inhibit the PEC performances of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photoanodes. As such, given the narrow band gap enabling excellent optical absorption, increased charge carrier density and accelerated surface oxidation reaction kinetics become the key points for improved photoelectrochemical performances for α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photoanodes.</p><p>Metal ion doping, as an effective way to promote charge transfer by increasing donor density and improving the electronic conductivity of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, has attracted enormous efforts with a number of metal ions (Ti, Zr, Sn, Pt, <italic>etc.</italic>) as dopants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For instance, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> reported that Ti-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> prepared by a facile deposition-annealing process showed greatly enhanced PEC performance due to the increased donor density and reduced electron-hole recombination at the time scale beyond a few picoseconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Zr doping was also found to enhance the PEC performance of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod arrays by reducing the rate of electron–hole recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Slow water oxidation reaction kinetics, another main factor limiting the PEC water splitting effciency of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as photoanodes, was previously found to be effectively improved by surface treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A thin overlayer of metal oxides such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and ZnO, has been demonstrated to effectively accelerate solar water oxidation by passivating surface states of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The kinetics can be also improved by modifying the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surface with specific cocatalysts (<italic>e.g.</italic>, IrO<sub>2</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Co-Pi, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>) in order to facilitate the four-electron process of water oxidation. This modification generally catalyzes hole transfer and results in suppressed surface charge recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Recently, a Pt-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod photoanode was reported to show a record-breaking performance of 4.32 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> PEC water oxidation current at 1.23 V vs. RHE under simulated 1-sun irradiation when an oxygen-evolving Co-Pi cocatalyst was added on the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Surface doping of metal ions has proven to be an alternative way to achieve enhanced PEC performances of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photoanodes by promoting charge migration and/or creating a doped overlayer to catalyze the surface water oxidation reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Xi <italic>et al.</italic> reported photocurrent improvement in α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod arrays treated by surface Sn doping, which was mainly attributed to a reduced electron–hole recombination at the hematite–electrolyte interface through the formation of an Fe<sub>x</sub>Sn<sub>1−x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. An α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanotube photoanode with a thin Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer on the surface showed a ~280% enhancement of the photoconversion efficiency relative to the pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanotube photoanode. This enhancement was indudced by the Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer and was attributed to the promoted charge migration, accelerated surface oxygen evolution and inhibited low-energy photoexcited hole recombination at the semiconductor−liquid junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>As discussed above, increased charge carrier density and accelerated surface oxidation reaction kinetics can be achieved by metal ion doping and surface treatment (cocatalyst decoration or surface doping), respectively. Then, is it possible to reduce the bulk and surface charge carrier recombination by synergistically increasing the charge carrier density and accelerating the surface oxidative reaction kinetics, for efficient solar water splitting over α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photoanodes? In this study, an Ag-doped overlayer was proposed and created on the surface of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods for improved PEC performances. It was revealed that Ag doping greatly increased the charge carrier density in the near-surface region of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods, meanwhile the Ag-doped overlayer effectively catalyzed surface oxidation reaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod arrays with an Ag-doped overlayer</title><p>α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod arrays with an Ag-doped overlayer (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films) were developed as photoanodes by a simple and inexpensive method for efficient solar water splitting. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the procedure for the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films. First, β-FeOOH nanorod arrays were grown on FTO subsrates <italic>via</italic> a solution-based purpose-built method (Step I)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and then treated by ultrasonication in an Ag<sup>+</sup> (silver acetate, AgAc) aqueous solution (Step II). The Ag<sup>+</sup>-absorbed β-FeOOH nanorod arrays were further annealed at 750°C for 5 min to form Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films with α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the internal region and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) on the surface. Since the films were ultrasonically treated in Ag<sup>+</sup> aqueous solutions with different concentrations (0.005, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 M), the obtained Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films were designated as Ag/Fe-<italic>n</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> = 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, respectively. The crystal structure of these Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1 in Supplementary Information</xref>, both pristine and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films displayed typical Raman bands of hematite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, with no other impurity phase observed. The top view SEM images revealed that after ultrasonication treatment in an Ag<sup>+</sup> solution, the Ag-doped nanorod array films retained their original morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>), with nanorod diameters of 50–100 nm. The absence of additional peaks in the Raman spectra and the unaltered morphology (<italic>e.g.</italic>, nanorod diameter) for the Ag-doped nanorod array films compared to the pristine hematite indicates that the Ag-doped overlayer is very thin.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A schematic showing the preparation of Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06627_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>To further investigate the morphology and architecture of the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod array films, TEM images were obtained as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Pristine hematite shows the morphology of nanorods as grown in aqueous solution (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although shortened nanorods appear in the pictures, they may have originated during the processing of hematite nanorods for TEM scanning. The high-resolution TEM image of pristine hematite (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) reveals the surface of the nanorods to be very clean and smooth. Although nanorod morphology remained almost unchanged upon doping (see SEM images in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>), something of interest is observed near the surface for the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods (Ag/Fe-0.005, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The atomic arrangement is uniform and well-ordered in the internal regions but gradually fades while approaching the surface of the nanorods. This should be due to the incorporation of Ag into the hematite surface structure and the formation of a thin overlayer of amorphous Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the surface as detected by TEM (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Such a disordered overlayer, identified by the absence of a uniform crystal lattice, was also observed when Ni<sup>2+</sup> or Sn<sup>4+</sup> solutions were used to treat hematite nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. By varying the concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> precursor solution from 0.005 M to 0.1 M, the obtained Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods possessed a similar Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer, with thickness estimated to be ~2–3 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C–F</xref>). However, in the case for higher Ag<sup>+</sup> concentrations, observable nanoparticles of Ag<sub>2</sub>O present on the surface of the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods (Ag/Fe-0.05 and Ag/Fe-0.1, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and 2F</xref>). These nanoparticles should be formed from superfluous Ag<sup>+</sup> ions absorbed on the surface of the nanorods after annealing.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images of Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films.</p><p>(A,B) pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, (C) Ag/Fe-0.005, (D) Ag/Fe-0.01, (E) Ag/Fe-0.05, (F) Ag/Fe-0.1.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06627_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The chemical compositions of Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films were studied by XPS, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>. For both pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films, the binding energies of Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p<sub>1/2</sub> levels are located <italic>ca.</italic> 711.1 and 724.4 eV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3A</xref>), respectively, with an energy difference of 13.3 eV, indicating that iron ions mainly exist as Fe<sup>3+</sup>. After being treated in Ag<sup>+</sup> aqueous solutions, all films display obvious Ag XPS signals with binding energies of the Ag 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Ag 3d<sub>3/2</sub> levels located at ca. 367.9 and 374.0 eV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3B</xref>), respectively. Comparison with XPS data from Schön<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> shows very good agreement and indicates that these Ag 3d signals are from Ag<sup>+</sup> ions. When the concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> aqueous solution is increased from 0 to 0.1 M, the surface Ag:Fe molar ratio first increases quickly and then very slowly, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. This change in the Ag:Fe molar ratio may be explained to some extent by the observations in the TEM images. After being treated in the Ag<sup>+</sup> aqueous solutions, an Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer with very similar thickness of 2 ~ 3 nm was formed on all of the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films. In short, both surface concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> and thickness of Ag-doped overlayer are very similar, which may be related to the depth-limited diffusion of surface absorbed Ag<sup>+</sup> ions into the lattice of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods. Additional nanoparticles, which is likely assigned to Ag<sub>2</sub>O due to the absence of metallic Ag XPS signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3B</xref>), existed on the surface of the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods made from the Ag<sup>+</sup> solutions with higher concentration, resulting in the slightly increased Ag:Fe molar ratio for the surfaces of these nanorods. The Sn XPS signal originates from Sn<sup>4+</sup> ions that diffused from FTO to α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> during high temperature annealing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

In the present study, both pristine and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films underwent the same annealing process (annealed at 750°C for 5 min), providing the very similar condition for Sn<sup>4+</sup> diffusion in α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods. Thus, the resulted similar and very low Sn<sup>4+</sup> concentrations (Sn:Fe molar ratio: 0.034 ~ 0.045) in these pristine and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films should be not the main reason for their varied PEC performances. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3D</xref>, the binding energies of the O 1s levels for both pristine and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films are very similar to those for hematite in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(A) Molar ratio of Ag:Fe at the surface of Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films, (B) XPS etching profile of the Ag/Fe-0.05 film.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06627_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The depth distribution of Ag in the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films was examined by an XPS Ar<sup>+</sup> etching measurement.

This result corresponds to the graded distribution of Sn diffused from the FTO substrate, as shown by the Sn:Fe molar ratio curve in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>. One can easily observe that after slightly decreasing at the initial etching stage, the molar ratio of Ag:Fe levels out at ~0.02 (Ag:Fe molar ratio curve in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which can be also evidenced by the change of peak area of Ag 3d in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4D</xref>. The slightly higher molar ratio of Ag:Fe at the film surface (0 s etching) is reasonable, given that the surface of the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods was covered by the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer. Finally, the constant molar ratio of Ag:Fe during Ar<sup>+</sup> etching indicates a homogenous distribution of Ag<sup>+</sup> dopants along the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods. Thus, a uniform and thin overlayer of Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) formed on the entire surface of the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods, as previously confirmed in the TEM images.

By further checking the repeated anodic I-V scans, a strong peak appeared between 0 V and 0.4 V during the first anodic scan for all the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films. In the repeated I-V scans, this peak became weaker and weaker and then diminshed after two I-V scans for Ag/Fe-<italic>n</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 0.005, 0.01) and four I-V scans for Ag/Fe-<italic>n</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 0.05, 0.1). Considering the anodic oxidation reaction happens at the photoanodes, the peak could be associated with the partial oxidation of Ag<sup>+</sup> in the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films.

Such a decrease in <italic>3d</italic> electron binding energy is unique for Ag in the metal-oxygen systems, where the oxidation number of the metal increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, one may also note that the relative ratio of IPCE increase in the visible light region is higher than that of the ultraviolet (UV) region; a ratio of ~4.0 IPCE increase is observed at 400–450 nm (inset of <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) while a ratio of only ~2.3 IPCE increase is observed at 360 nm.

The electron densities of pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ag/Fe-0.05) nanorod films are calculated to be 2.6 × 10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> and 1.2 × 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>, respectively. This 5-fold increase in the carrier density confirms the conjecture of increased carrier density of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> upon Ag doping. It is well known that doping ions with higher valence states, such as Sn<sup>4+</sup>, Ti<sup>4+</sup> and Si<sup>4+</sup>, <italic>etc.</italic>, can increase the electron concentration of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, by acting as donor dopants.

The enhanced charge carrier density, which is linearly proportional to conductance according to the formula σ = <italic>ne</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>μ<sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, leads to lower impedance for the Ag-doped samples. The enhanced electrical conductivity can extend the lifetime of charge carriers, giving rise to a reduction in the recombination of the electron−hole pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, the increased charge carrier density and reduced electron–hole recombination in the near-surface region by Ag surface doping is believed to be the major contributing factor for the pronounced photocurrent improvement of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods in the present study.

This flat-band potential shift is probably due to the efficient hole transport from the bulk α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to the Ag-doped overlayer, accelerating the surface water oxidation reaction.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mott−Schottky plots of the pristine and Ag-doped Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod film (Ag/Fe-0.05), inset shows the donor density (N<sub>d</sub>) and the flatband potential (V<sub>fb</sub>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06627_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>As generally accepted, α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> suffers from short hole diffusion length in the bulk and swift charge recombination on the surface, which greatly restricts the PEC efficiency of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a photoanode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Doping foreign metal ions such as Ti, Zr and Sn into the bulk of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has proven to be an effective method of improving the conductivity and hence carrier migration ability of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, contributing to increased PEC activity in the UV light region specifically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. To improve the utilization of low energy charge carriers and enhance the PEC energy conversion efficiency in the visible light region, it is important to avoid hole accumulation at the surface and inhibit surface charge recombination. Some metal oxides (IrO<sub>2</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) or metal oxide mixtures (Fe-Ni oxide, Ni-Bi oxide) have been observed to significantly lower the overpotential for the water oxidation reaction by avoiding hole accumulation on the photoanode surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In our study, a thin Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer of ~2–3 nm was formed by Ag doping and evenly covered the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod surface. Ag dopants effectively increase the charge carrier density in the near-surface region and lower the impendence for charge transfer, allowing more photoinduced holes in the near-surface region to transfer to the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod surface. Additionally, as revealed by XANES analysis, higher extent of O(<italic>2p</italic>)−Fe(<italic>3d</italic>) hybridization induced by surface doping of Ag is believed to lead to increased oxygen electrocatalysis, which possibly renders the Ag-doped overlayer to act as water oxidation catalyst. Once arriving at the surface, as evidenced by XPS analysis (partial oxidation of Ag<sup>I</sup> to Ag<sup>III</sup> during initial period of PEC reaction), holes are captured by Ag<sup>+</sup> doping sites, which inhibits both surface hole accumulation and recombination of holes with either surface trapping sites or surface electrons, effectively promoting the water oxidiation process. Due to the increased carrier density by Ag doping and accelerated water oxidation reaction kinetics by the Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer, excited holes could quickly tranfer to the surface and participate in surface reactions with reduced bulk and surface recombination. As a result, the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films show greatly enhanced PEC performances relative to the pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod film, which is more significant in the visible light region due to the more obvious acceleration effect of the Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer on the water oxidation reaction for low energy holes.</p><p>Without knowing the fundamental electronic structures of the material and how they operate upon its working condition, it is difficult to better understand and to better engineer the material for more practical use.

The Fe <italic>K</italic>-, Fe <italic>L</italic><sub>2,3</sub>- and O <italic>K</italic>-edge XANES spectra were recorded in the dark and illuminated condition by an 1.5 AM solar simulator.</p><p>Firstly, the <italic>in-situ</italic> Fe <italic>K</italic>-edge XANES spectra which probe the electron transition from 1<italic>s</italic> to 4<italic>p</italic> states are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S7</xref>.

It is clear that no substantial spectral differences can be found in the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod film with and without solar illumination, whereas a significant change in the Fe <italic>3d</italic> t<sub>2g</sub> states is revealed for the pristine one. As the pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is exposed to the solar illumination, the intensity of Fe <italic>3d</italic> t<sub>2g</sub> state is reduced compared with that without illumination. This indicates the Fe <italic>3d</italic> states are more critical in pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film than in Ag-doped one. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref> displays the <italic>in-situ</italic> O <italic>K</italic>-edge XANES spectra of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod films with and without solar illumination. In contrast to the <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, no subtle spectral change can be found in pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film but a remarkable spectral difference is revealed in the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film under the illuminated condition. Notably, the absorption edge is shifted to lower energy in illuminated condition than that without illumination. Besides, in the Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film, the ratio of the intensity of the peak at around 529.6 eV to that around 531.0 eV declines in the illuminated condition. The observation of the spectral differences from <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A,B</xref> suggests that the mechanisms and the active orbitals in pristine and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film are different. The oxygen related hole is critical in Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film and iron related hole dominates in the pristine one. These two different types of holes are consistent with a recent study that revealed two kinds of helpful holes (oxygen-related and iron-related holes) for water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>In-situ</italic> XANES spectra of (A) Fe <italic>L</italic>-edge and (B) O <italic>K</italic>-edge for the pristine and Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ag/Fe-0.05) films recorded with and without illuminated condition.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06627_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The spectral change of the pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film upon the light irradiation may suggest that the electronic structure is only varied at the Fe <italic>3d</italic> orbital, implying the charge is probably accumulated at surface of nanorod and does not involve in the hybridized O(<italic>2p</italic>)−Fe(<italic>3d</italic>) orbitals. This implies that separation of electron-hole pair is not efficient in pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and it recombines easily at the surface. However, the remarkable spectral change of O <italic>K</italic>-edge of Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film with and without solar illumination suggests the light-induced modification of conduction band. The conduction band is shifted to lower energy and may be beneficial for electron flow. The slight intensity decrease (increase) of the peak at around 529.6 eV (531.0 eV) in Ag-doped α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film in the illuminated condition indicates the hybridized O(<italic>2p</italic>)−Fe(<italic>3d</italic><sub>t2g</sub>) orbital gains some charges. The gain of the charges is believed to be related to the charge transfer between Ag <italic>5d</italic> and O(<italic>2p</italic>)−Fe(<italic>3d</italic>) orbitals, contributing to the increased charge carrier density with Ag dopants possibly acting as electron donors. The Ag may lose some charge in the initial stage, turning Ag<sup>I</sup> to Ag<sup>III</sup>, which has been illustrated by XPS analysis. Therefore, the possible mechanism of the Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer catalyzing the water oxidation reaction could be proposed in <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. Upon solar light irradiation, the electrons are excited from oxygen to iron (S<sub>1</sub>), the oxygen-related holes then render Ag<sup>I</sup> to be oxidized to Ag<sup>III</sup> (S<sub>2</sub>). The oxidized Ag<sup>III</sup> species could promote water oxidation to produce oxygen and meanwhile be reduced back to Ag<sup>I</sup> (S<sub>3</sub>). Such a multistep charge transfer process is supposed to prevent the recombination of oxygen-related holes with surface trapping sites or surface electrons and hence catalyzes the water oxidation reaction.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Core/shell structured α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods and schematic of water oxidation reaction accelerated by Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06627_Fig9_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated a facile solution-based surface treatment method, through which a thin, Ag-doped overlayer of ~2–3 nm was evenly formed along the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods. As a photoanode for light-induced water splitting, the obtained α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> core/shell nanorod films demonstrated enhanced photoelectrochemical performance relative to the pristine α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod film, especially in the visible light region. IPCE at 400 nm was increased from 2.2% to 8.4% at 1.23 V vs. RHE. It is proposed that the carrier density was increased by Ag doping and the water oxidation reaction kinetics were accelerated by the Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> overlayer. Synergistically, these enhancements led to an increase in the photoelectrochemical performance of the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ag<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2−x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> core/shell nanorod film by reducing bulk and surface charge carrier recombination. This design of core/shell structured photoanodes from low cost hematite “rust” reveals potential applications for developing highly efficient water-splitting materials for solar hydrogen generation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fabrication of α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorod arrays with Ag-doped overlayer</title><p>Step I: β-FeOOH nanorod arrays were grown on FTO glass in an aqueous solution as reported by Vayssieres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, with minor modification.
