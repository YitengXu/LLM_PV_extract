The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of low energy narrow-range UV-LED on osteosarcopenia in animal models of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 6 (SAMP6). Preliminary experiments specified the minimum irradiance intensity and dose efficacy for vitamin D production (316 nm, 0.16 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1,000 J/m<sup>2</sup>). we set a total of 4 groups (n = 8 per group); vitamin D-repletion without UV irradiation (Vit.D+UV−), vitamin D-repletion with UV irradiation (Vit.D+UV +), vitamin D-deficiency without UV irradiation, (Vit.D−UV−), and vitamin D-deficiency with UV irradiation (Vit.D−UV +). Serum levels of 25(OH)D at 28 and 36 weeks of age were increased in Vit.D−UV+ group as compared with Vit.D−UV− group. Trabecular bone mineral density on micro-CT was higher in Vit.D−UV+ group than in Vit.D−UV− group at 36 weeks of age. In the histological assay, fewer osteoclasts were observed in Vit.D−UV+ group than in Vit.D−UV− group. Grip strength and muscle mass were higher in Vit.D−UV+ group than in Vit.D−UV− group at 36 weeks of age. Signs of severe damage induced by UV irradiation was not found in skin histology. Low energy narrow-range UV irradiation may improve osteosarcopenia associated with vitamin D deficiency in SAMP6.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">17K19903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishida</surname><given-names>Yoshihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_68641.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Osteosarcopenia is a novel concept denoting the co-existence of decreased density of both bone and muscle, namely osteoporosis and sarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This condition promotes falls and insufficiency fractures that impede the activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This impairment of ADL is becoming an increasingly serious social problem, associated particularly with the aging of society seen in developed countries. Vitamin D is one of the most important molecules associated with osteosarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, it has been reported that the elderly are consistently deficient in vitamin D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Adequate supplementation of vitamin D for elderly persons with low cost and high safety is an urgent issue for all rapidly aging societies.

This makes it crucial to devise effective and safe UV irradiation for vitamin D supplementation.

In that study, irradiation with UV-LED was 0.54 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the wavelength of LED was 305 nm, which was estimated to be equivalent to 6.75 points in the UV index specified by WHO, an amount of irradiation considered to constitute a high risk of harm to the human body.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, several studies have clarified that vitamin D deficiency is associated with reduced muscle strength and volume, namely sarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the relationship between muscle and vitamin D supply by UV irradiation has not been investigated.</p><p id="Par5">We hypothesized that if the dose of UV irradiation by LED (UV-LED) could be reduced, but still increase bone mass and muscle mass, a treatment device characterized by low cost and high safety could be developed. The purpose of this study is to determine the minimal irradiance intensity and dose of short-range UV-LED that would be effective in supplying sufficient levels of serum vitamin D, and to examine the effects of UV-LED with a determined irradiance and dose on osteosarcopenia in animal models of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 6 (SAMP6).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preliminary experiments</title><p id="Par6">First, we conducted an experiment to determine the minimum irradiance of UV irradiation that adequately supplies vitamin D.

We documented that low energy and narrow-range UV irradiation improved bone mineral density, muscle volume and strength in the vitamin D deficient group. Furthermore, low energy and narrow range (316 nm) UV irradiation did not induce severe skin damages, suggesting that the equipment used may be safe for osteosarcopenia therapy.</p><p id="Par18">Our previous study showed that UV irradiation by 305 nm LED, which is UV-B region, improved the morphological characteristics and mechanical strength of bone as well as histological features in a vitamin D deficient senile osteoporotic mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Because of the irradiation with lower energy intentionally used in the present study as compared with the 305 nm UV irradiation in our previous study, the increase of serum levels of 25(OH)D was less marked than in our previous study. This would explain why there was no difference in the mechanical strength of femur between the irradiation + and irradiation − groups in the present study. But bones in the vitamin D-deficiency + UV irradiation group showed partly better bone morphology and micro CT and histological features than those without UV irradiation. The most important aim in this study was to increase levels of 25(OH)D by administering low energy UV irradiation with minor side effects. Improvement of mechanical strength would be obtained by irradiation with the current low-energy LED for a longer period.</p><p id="Par19">Several previous reports documented the efficacy of UV-irradiation and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D uptake for osteoporotic condition. Guo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reported that long-term UV irradiation (12 weeks) improved bone mineral content and bone mineral density in young rats, although they used wavelengths of 280–340 nm with the wave peak at 315 nm. In the present study, we used a narrow range wavelength of 305–325 nm with the wave peak at 316 nm, which reduces the risk of side effects by LED irradiation, particularly with a longer duration of irradiation.</p><p id="Par20">Geldenhuys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> reported that body weight and percentage of fat mass were decreased by UV irradiation in a murine study. Similarly, mice in the vitamin D-deficiency + UV irradiation group showed a decrease in body weight greater than that of the vitamin D-deficiency − UV irradiation group in the present study. Despite the lower body weight induced by UV irradiation, the bone mineral density in the vitamin D-deficiency + UV irradiation group was improved and bone strength was maintained, which is a noteworthy result for this LED experiment. Duque et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> reported that short-term infusion (6 weeks) of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D was effective for preventing osteoporosis, particularly for periosteal ossification and BMD in SAMP6 mice, which is the same mouse model used in the present study. In SAMP6, ovariectomy does not increase osteoclast activity or reduce bone mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This mouse strain is characterized by reduced osteoblast formation and increased adipogenesis in the bone marrow, causing bone loss and fracture and mimicking the human form of senile osteoporosis. This model might be adequate for analyzing the efficacy of LED equipment in the treatment of osteoporosis in the super-aging society of developed countries. However, the experiments conducted in Duque’s study cannot be repeated in the clinical setting because of the infusion of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D.</p><p id="Par21">Some in vivo studies reported that the active form of vitamin D decreases the pool of osteoclast precursor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and blocks osteoclastic bone resorption by mobilizing precursor monocytes from the bone to the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Our histological assay showed inhibitory effects of increased active form of vitamin D by LED irradiation on TRAP positive osteoclast expression in vivo, which was consistent with the results of these previous reports. Interestingly, although levels of serum Ca and IP did not decrease in the vitamin D-deficiency mouse group, levels of serum PTH tended to increase (not significant). Experiments with accumulating number of mice will more clarify that secondary hyperparathyroidism possibly caused by vitamin D-deficiency could influence the bone turnover in vitamin D-deficient mice. Thus, the active form of vitamin D induced by UV-LED might prevent osteoclastic bone loss.</p><p id="Par22">Together with osteoporosis treatment, sarcopenia treatment or prevention is also important in the elderly. Several studies demonstrated impaired muscle contraction and decrease of grip strength in vitamin D-deficient rats and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our study, vitamin D-deficiency reduced grip strength, while UV irradiation improved it significantly. Muscles from vitamin D-deficient mice were significantly lighter and UV irradiation increased muscle mass. These results might have been influenced by the body weight decrease seen in the vitamin D-deficiency group, with in particular this decrease being greater with than without UV irradiation. Body weight and body fat percentage in vitamin D-deficiency + UV irradiation were decreased as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Together, UV irradiation increased muscle volume, while decreasing body weight and percentage of body fat, which might be positive changes for sarcopenia therapy. Girgis et al. showed that muscle mass from vitamin D-deficient mice tends to be light, but there was no significant difference in their study using C57BL/6 mice. The reason for the larger difference in the present study may be attributable to the fact that the periods of both the vitamin D-deficient diet and UV irradiation were longer in it than in Girgis’s study. Another reason might be that we used senescence-accelerated mice in the present studies, which would be a more suitable mouse model of the human form of senile sarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The most important aim of the present study is to provide therapeutic UV at wavelengths with few side effects. In our previous study, UV irradiation by 305 nm thickened epidermis and dermis, and also generated few Melan-A positive cells. In contrast, in the present study, low energy UV irradiation by 316 nm irradiation did not induce such signs of skin damage. Considering the UV-index, the previous irradiance with 305 nm of UV was equivalent to 6.75 points of the UV index based on WHO criteria, which was defined as high risk. In the present study, the irradiance with 316 nm UV was equivalent to 2.00 points, which was defined as safe. Because osteosarcopenia can be efficiently and safely improved under the conditions set in the present study, it can be applied to human clinical practice.</p><p id="Par24">There were several limitations in this study. First, we measured serum vitamin D levels not by liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) but by radioimmunoassay. LC–MS/MS would be better to measure the exact amount of vitamin D in individual patients, while radioimmunoassay would be adequate to compare the serum vitamin D levels of mice in the same environment. Second, we measured mRNA of vitamin-D metabolic enzymes, bone strength, histology and serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D at the end of the irradiation period. Collecting data during the irradiation period would be preferable for explanation of the interim progression, but would need the further sacrifice of numerous mice. In addition, frequent tests for serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels require large amounts of blood, which can cause unexpected death in mice. To prove the effects of UV irradiation on improvement of osteosarcopenia, we set minimum required evaluation points in the present study. Third, in preliminary experiments, results of serum 25(OH)D level were different between irradiance-determination and dose-determination experiments. Possible explanation was that the time when the experiment was conducted was different, and the numbers of mice were small in preliminary experiments. Fourth, we set preliminary and main experiments in the present study, in each of which the mice were different. Results of serum 25(OH)D levels were slightly different between the mice (preliminary and main experiments). However, the effective irradiance and dose determined by the preliminary experiments could also improve osteosarcopenia in the main experiments. Fifth, the scale of serum 25(OH)D level used in the present experiments were not applicable directly to human. In addition, we should examine the effects of UV irradiation also on the male mice because of the proportion of osteoporotic fractures in men cannot be ignored and is a crucial problem in an aging society.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, our results indicated that conditions of low energy UV irradiation by 316 nm LED device determined by preliminary experiments improved osteosarcopenia in a vitamin D deficiency senile mice model. UV irradiation with this UV-LED device could be clinically useful for patients with osteosarcopenia with few side effects, particularly, patients with low mobility, and/or cannot sunbathe. Since this device could be developed as a small and portable one, it could be easy to use in a variety of situations in the clinical setting from a general hospital to home-care. Considering that many developed countries face an increasingly aged population that is more susceptible to the burdens of osteosarcopenia associated with vitamin D deficiency, treatment by low energy UV irradiation with a narrow range UV-LED device may be a promising novel therapeutic approach to this disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study design: preliminary and main experiments</title><p id="Par26">All experimental procedures on animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Utilization Study Committee of Nagoya University (Permit Number; 28106), and were implemented in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

We adjusted the LED module to a wavelength of 316 nm, because 316 nm was already confirmed to effectively provide vitamin D, and considered to be less harmful owing to its being at the short end of UVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The wave spectrum of the LED module was measured with a UV radiometer USR-45 DA-10 (Ushio Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and the spectrum was proved to be within a very narrow range (Suppl.

As previously described, a 2 × 4 cm dorsal patch of skin was clean-shaven as the area to be irradiated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We irradiated the mice in a clear acrylic box with a base area of 4 × 6 cm. The lamp was positioned 10 cm above the dorsal patch of the mice. The radiation irradiance on the area of the dorsal patch in the box for the LED module was measured using a UV radiometer USR-45 DA-10 (Ushio Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The reflection coefficient of the box was 1.77. The UV irradiation dose was controlled to 1,000 J/m<sup>2</sup>. At 20 weeks of age, forty mice were divided into 7 groups (5 mice each); a control group and six UV irradiation groups (0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, 0.27, 0.54 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>, 316 nm, irradiated twice a week) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>).
