For this technology to be economically competitive, it is critical to develop water splitting systems with high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies. Here we report a photovoltaic-electrolysis system with the highest STH efficiency for any water splitting technology to date, to the best of our knowledge. Our system consists of two polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysers in series with one InGaP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb triple-junction solar cell, which produces a large-enough voltage to drive both electrolysers with no additional energy input. The solar concentration is adjusted such that the maximum power point of the photovoltaic is well matched to the operating capacity of the electrolysers to optimize the system efficiency. The system achieves a 48-h average STH efficiency of 30%. These results demonstrate the potential of photovoltaic-electrolysis systems for cost-effective solar energy storage.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">In order to be practical for large-scale deployment, the cost of solar hydrogen generation must be significantly reduced.

However, the cost of H<sub>2</sub> produced by electrolysis is still significantly higher than that produced by fossil fuels.

These values indicate that there is significant room for further improvement in the performance of PV-electrolysis system prototypes.</p><p id="Par5">The discrepancy between reported STH efficiencies for PV-electrolysis devices and stand-alone solar-to-electricity PV efficiencies mainly arises from poor matching of the current–voltage (<italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic>) characteristics of multi-junction PVs with those of water electrolysers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The maximum power-point voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>MPP</sub>) of a typical commercial triple-junction solar cell is in the range of 2.0–3.5 V under 1–1,000 suns of illumination. However, the thermodynamic minimum voltage required to electrolyse water is only 1.23 V at 300 K (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>), with practical operating voltages in the range of 1.5–1.9 V (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Electrolysing water using a voltage in excess of the thermodynamic minimum voltage results in energy wasted as heat rather than stored in H<sub>2</sub> chemical bonds. Previously, this limitation was overcome by coupling multiple PV and/or electrolyser units in series, to optimize the match between the voltage characteristics of these device components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, although the efficiencies achieved were still far from optimal.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we employ a high-efficiency triple-junction solar cell with two series-connected polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers to achieve very high STH efficiency.

The solar cell is a commercially available triple-junction solar cell manufactured by Solar Junction, with an active area of 0.316 cm<sup>2</sup>. From top to bottom, the three subcells of the PV are made of InGaP (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>=1.895 eV), GaAs (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>=1.414 eV) and GaInNAs(Sb) (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>=0.965 eV) respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The cell was installed on a water-cooled stage, which maintained a cell temperature of ∼25 °C and was illuminated with white light from a xenon arc lamp to simulate concentrated AM 1.5D solar illumination. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM840">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> for comparative xenon arc lamp and AM 1.5D spectra.) The two PEM electrolysers consist of Nafion membranes coated with 0.5 mg cm<sup>−2</sup> Pt black catalyst at the cathode and 2 mg cm<sup>−2</sup> Ir black catalyst at the anode. The two electrolysers were connected in series with the PV cell and a potentiostat, which was used to measure the current through the circuit. Water was pumped into the anode compartment of the first electrolyser, whereas the cathode of the first electrolyser had no input flow. The water and O<sub>2</sub> effluent from the first electrolyser’s anode compartment flowed into the anode compartment of the second electrolyser. Likewise, the H<sub>2</sub> from the cathode side of the first electrolyser flowed into the cathode side of the second electrolyser. The H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> products flowing out of the second electrolyser were collected and quantified, whereas the unreacted water was fed back into a water reservoir and recycled through the system. The temperature of the electrolysers was held at ∼80 °C, consistent with standard operating conditions for industrial water electrolysers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

A <italic>P</italic><sub>in</sub> value of 1,328 mW was obtained by multiplying the operational concentration (42 suns) by the 1 sun illumination intensity (100 cm<sup>−2</sup>) and the solar cell area (0.316 cm<sup>2</sup>). The Faradaic efficiency of the electrolyser was measured at 20 min intervals several times throughout the 48 h experiment (photographs of the measurement apparatus are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM840">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).

The STH efficiency slowly decreased over 48+ h of testing and averaged ∼28% for the last 20 min of operation. The average STH efficiency achieved over the entire 48+ h of operation was 30%. The decrease in STH over 48 h of operation is mainly due to an increase of <italic>V</italic><sub>OP</sub> over the maximum power point primarily caused by a decrease in performance of the electrolysers over time, an issue that is readily addressable through electrolyser development, as commercial electrolysers have demonstrated tens of thousands of hours of stable operation. Although electrolyser performance accounts for most of the decrease in PV-electrolysis efficiency over time, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> also shows that the current of the solar cell was slightly lower at the end of operation compared with the beginning of operation, which is due to a slight decrease of the incident light intensity. This contributed approximately one percentage point to the total STH loss, as the STH calculation was performed using the initial incident light intensity; thus, the overall STH efficiencies reported are conservative values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par12">The efficiency analysis assumes that the light incident on the PV cell is the only energy input into the system. In reality, there can be additional energy inputs, including the energy required to cool the PV, heat the PEM electrolysers and pump water into the electrolysers. In a concentrated PV device illuminated by natural sunlight, there may also be optical losses in the lenses or mirrors used to concentrate the incident sunlight onto the PV cell, which could reduce the system efficiency. We have chosen to neglect these factors in this study for several reasons, among them to allow for direct comparisons with results from previous studies. We note in general that laboratory-scale systems are designed differently than commercial-scale systems and the losses are not identical. For instance, in this study, lenses or mirrors were not needed to achieve the simulated concentrated solar light; thus, there are no optical losses to measure. In addition, commercial-scale PV systems and PEM electrolysers have been designed to minimize energy losses involving cooling, heating, pumping and so on; thus, the losses in a laboratory-scale demonstration system are less relevant, in addition to being more difficult to accurately quantify. Ultimately, the methods used to supply the aforementioned additional energy inputs in a laboratory-scale system are not optimized; thus, they are not an accurate representation of what could be achieved in large-scale PV-electrolysis systems. As a result, the STH efficiency numbers we have reported for this device represent a limiting upper bound in regard to any additional auxiliary energy inputs that would be required for any commercially scaled water-splitting system.</p><p id="Par13">We note that the laboratory-scale device described in this study is constructed from components that could be scaled up to larger PV-electrolysis installations. Optimizing the PV-electrolysis system design will be crucial for enabling the deployment of economical large-scale installations. Appropriate designs will minimize the heating, cooling and pumping energy inputs. Most commercial concentrated PV modules use passive cooling methods to regulate the PV cell temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and PEM electrolysers will naturally run at temperatures well above ambient conditions, as the excess energy from overpotentials at the anode and cathode is dispersed as heat. If needed, additional heat could be supplied by the sunlight that is not converted to electricity. It might also be desirable to operate the PV at a temperature &gt;25 °C. Although this would decrease the PV’s open circuit voltage, it would increase the current output and decrease the energy input needed to cool the PV (if active cooling methods were employed). This could result in an increased STH efficiency if the PV still produced enough voltage to drive the dual-electrolyser. The PV operating temperature and other operation parameters pose tradeoffs to be optimized. Overall, the system design and operating conditions must be chosen to minimize the levelized cost of hydrogen produced over the operating lifetime of the system. Although the components used in this device are expensive, including the III–V PV fabrication and the precious metal catalysts, the very high STH efficiency achieved shows that this strategy may have the potential to produce hydrogen at low cost, in particular if lower-cost materials and fabrication methods can be developed. Technoeconomic models of large scale, centralized solar H<sub>2</sub> production facilities suggest that achieving high STH efficiency is one of the most important factors in reducing the cost of H<sub>2</sub>, potentially even more important than reducing the cost of the absorber or catalyst materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Continued development of lower cost, higher efficiency PV cells and electrolysers, optimized PV-electrolysis system designs and technoeconomic models to predict hydrogen costs are all important subjects for continuing research.</p><p id="Par14">In summary, we report a PV-electrolysis system that demonstrated an average STH efficiency of 30% over a 48 h period of continuous operation. This is the highest STH efficiency reported to date and the first solar water splitting system that demonstrates a STH efficiency reaching 30% or higher. Coupling a high-efficiency multi-junction solar cell with two electrolysers in series is an effective way to minimize the excessive voltage generated by a multi-junction solar cell, allowing for greater utilization of the high-efficiency PV for water splitting. This system also primarily uses commercially available components, suggesting that similar techniques could be implemented on a large scale. The demonstration of this high-efficiency system is an important step closer to the US Department of Energy technology and cost goals, and shows great opportunities for solar energy storage and H<sub>2</sub> production with solar water splitting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Solar simulator calibration and Solar Cell characterization</title><p id="Par15">For the 1 sun measurement, we used a solar simulator (ABET Technologies, Model Sun2000) equipped with a 550 W xenon lamp as a light source. The GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb multi-junction solar cell (0.316 cm<sup>2</sup> area) was manufactured by Solar Junction.</p><p id="Par16">As the cells were operated under concentrated sunlight, the calibration of the solar simulator for 1 sun conditions (100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>) was carried out using the AM 1.5 Direct spectrum (ASTM G173). Although reference solar cells can be used to adjust a simulator for appropriate total power output, spectral control is crucial for accurate multi-junction cell measurements. For this reason, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of each sub-junction of the multi-junction stack was measured using a grating monochromator (Newport CS260) calibrated with silicon and germanium photodetectors (Newport 918D-UV, 918D-IR). All light sources and photodetectors were calibrated by the manufacturers before the experiment. These EQE measurements were integrated with the AM 1.5D spectrum to determine short-circuit current densities and to understand the current-limiting junction of the cells. The EQE of each sub-junction and the AM 1.5D spectrum are shown overlaid in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM840">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>.

The cell package was mounted onto a water-cooling stage such that a surface temperature of 25 °C was maintained. The distance between the cell and the lamp was adjusted to achieve the desired short circuit current (<italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>).

No concentrator optics were placed between the simulator and the cell and therefore the possible effects of concentrator optics were not considered in efficiency calculation. As the cell was cut and installed in a standard CPV cell package, the whole cell area is active under illumination; therefore, no aperture or mask was used. Numerical modelling based on the junction ideality factor was later conducted to determine whether open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) inflation due to the mismatch between the solar simulator spectrum and the AM 1.5D spectrum resulted in STH inflation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

Separately, an Ir black catalyst (Premetek) and Nafion 117 ionomer solution (Aldrich) were also mixed in a 3:1 weight ratio. The Pt and Ir catalyst/ionomer mixtures were both dispersed in 4:1 volume ratio mixtures of isopropanol and water.
