Three decades later, this realisation is once again hitting us hard. The good news is that this time around there is a high degree of scientific confidence that a commercially viable, renewable transportation energy resource, competitive with fossil fuel in terms of cost, may be realised within the next 10 to 20 years. Much of this is the result of the recent scientific breakthroughs in genomics and bioengineering. In recent years, a significant number of start-up biofuel companies have emerged and are offering novel biofuel technologies that promise to move these emerging technologies past the research and development stage and into commercialisation. These companies are well advised to develop a viable intellectual property (IP) strategy and a strong patent portfolio to attract investment.

He even travelled to the Amazonian forests to identify plants that produce essentially ‘ready to use’ hydrocarbon fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p><p>Despite his efforts, the biofuel development envisioned by Professor Calvin did not gain traction at the time. With the easing of restrictions in foreign oil supplies, interest in biofuel development gradually diminished. However, three decades later, with the present energy crisis looming ominously, there is renewed interest in biofuel development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Government mandates and industry activism have ignited the current biofuel revolution. The US government has mandated that 20 per cent of our fuel needs by 2017 should be met with domestically produced renewable and alternate fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> The European Union's Biofuels Directive states that, by the end of 2010, 5.75 per cent of all petrol and diesel transport fuels must be biomass-based.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> A subsequent energy strategy adopted in early 2007 increased the target to 10 per cent for 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> A number of oil companies have also come forward with generous research grants to support biofuel research.</p><p>British Petroleum (BP) has established the Energy Bioscience Institute, comprising the University of California (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and has endowed it with funding of US$50 million per year for 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> BP has also signed a deal with Synthetic Genomics, a start-up company having as its focus developing biological conversion processes for subsurface hydrocarbons that could lead to cleaner energy production and improved recovery rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Shell Oil company, a world leader in the distribution of the biofuel component of transportation fuels, has invested in companies developing cellulosic ethanol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Chevron has been working with National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to produce liquid transportation fuel using algae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Chevron is also partnering with Solazyme, a start-up biofuel company to develop biofuels from algae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> ConocoPhillips has entered into an agreement with Archer Daniel Midland company to develop renewable transportation fuels from biomass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> ConocoPhillips has also provided an 8-year $22.5 million research grant to Iowa State University for producing fuel from non-edible biomass such as stalks and leaves from corn plants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><p>Besides oil companies, plant biotechnology companies have also made efforts to develop energy crops to meet the feedstock demand by the emerging biofuel industry. For example, Monsanto is working with Mendel Biotechnology to breed perennial grass varieties for the biofuel industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup></p><p>At present, the biofuel industry is mainly research-driven. Essentially all of the now ongoing research activities are being carried out either at academic institutions or in small start-up companies. A number of novel technical ideas for producing entirely new types of biofuels are being tested. In addition, efforts are also ongoing to improve the efficiency of already existing biofuel production technologies. Anyone interested in commercialising these emerging biofuel technologies is advised to make an effort to understand the general trends of biofuel research and to use that knowledge to build a strong intellectual property (IP) strategy. In the first section, this paper introduces the reader to the current biofuel market. The next section provides an overview of emerging biofuel technologies under four sub-categories, namely, first, second, third and fourth-generation biofuels. The objective of the last section is to introduce the reader to the patenting opportunities in the emerging biofuel technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>CURRENT BIOFUEL MARKET</title><p>The present state of the commercial art is the capability to produce two different types of liquid biofuels: bioethanol and biodiesel. Bioethanol and biodiesel account for 85 and 15 per cent of biofuel production, respectively. Biodiesel production is mainly restricted to Europe. Bioethanol is widely used in Brazil and the United States and is produced through microbial fermentation technology. Biodiesel is derived from plant oils/fats and is manufactured by means of a chemical coupling reaction between a fat and an alcohol.</p><p>Brazil is the world leader in bioethanol production and produces 4.2 billion gallons of bioethanol per year requiring around 3 million hectares of land. Commercial bioethanol from sugarcane has been in existence in Brazil for about 30 years and it is a global energy commodity that is fully competitive with gasoline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup></p><p>In the United States there has been tremendous push to develop bioethanol. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates renewable fuel standard (RFS) requiring fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Corn-derived ethanol has been the main source of renewable biofuel in the United States. In 2007, the United States grew a record 13.1 billion bushels of corn on 85 million acres. During 2007, 139 biorefineries in 21 states produced 7.8 billion gallons of ethanol making use of 22 per cent of the total corn produced in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> The remaining corn production was enough to meet domestic consumption needs, export demand and stockpiling requirements. It has been calculated that expansion of the US biofuel industry over the next 15 years would reduce dependence on foreign oil by 11.2 billion barrels of crude oil over the next 15 years accounting for $1.1 trillion and add $1.7 trillion (2008 dollars) to the US economy between 2008 and 2022.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup></p><p>It is estimated that corn-based ethanol production will reach 15 billion gallons per year in 2015 without interfering with the demand for human food and animal feed in the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> However, to reach a target of 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels by 2017, there will be a need to exploit other feedstocks for biofuel production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> In addition, improvements in existing technologies as well as invention of new bioprocess technologies for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol or any other types of transportation fuel are urgently needed to meet the RFS in 2022. The greatest challenge for the biofuel industry today is to produce biofuel at a price that is competitive with gasoline, but without government subsidies, and to realise enough capacity to meet the long-term demand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>EMERGING BIOFUEL TECHNOLOGIES</title><p>In contrast to the situation in the 1970s, the current interest in biofuel development is accompanied by a recent explosion of knowledge in the areas of plant and microbial biotechnology. In the last three decades, vast amounts of genomic sequence data have been accumulated along with the technical skills needed to precisely manipulate the genetic make-up of microbial organisms and crop plants. We now have the technical ability to introduce desirable new traits either into a microbial organism or into a crop plant. With these developments, confidence in our ability to make biofuel development a reality has grown. Within a relatively short period of time, biofuel development has advanced from first-generation biofuels to fourth-generation biofuels. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows an idea of the various pathways currently being followed in biofuel research and development.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Pathways for biofuel development.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41488_2010_Article_BFjcb20091_Fig1_HTML.gif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>FIRST-GENERATION BIOFUEL</title><p>Ethanol produced from corn grain is commonly referred to as a first-generation biofuel. Ethanol production from corn grain is achieved either by a wet milling or dry milling process. In the wet milling process, the corn grain is soaked in water or diluted acid to separate the grain into its component parts such as starch, protein and kernel fibres. The separated starch is then subjected to enzyme digestion to break down the starch into glucose, a process referred to as saccharification. The product of saccharification is subjected to microbial fermentation to produce ethanol.</p><p>In the dry milling process, the corn grain is first ground into fine powder called ‘meal’. The meal is subsequently liquefied to produce a mash and the resulting mash is subjected to high temperature. This step is followed by the addition of enzymes to breakdown the starch into glucose. Microbial fermentation is used to produce ethanol, which is concentrated through distillation and dehydration procedures. The fuel alcohol thus produced is similar to the alcohol in liquor. Therefore, before shipping the ethanol to gasoline distribution hubs for blending, a small amount of gasoline (∼5 per cent) is added to denature the ethanol, making it undrinkable.</p><p>The simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process for ethanol production has been in existence for quite some time. Current research efforts in first-generation biofuel have focused on improving the efficiency of the overall process with an eye to reducing costs. Such research has been directed towards designing better enzymes for breaking down starch into glucose and developing genetically engineered microorganisms for improving ethanol tolerance and production efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>SECOND-GENERATION BIOFUEL</title><p>With first-generation biofuel technology using corn, it is possible to produce 15 billion gallons of ethanol by 2015. However, in order to meet the target of 35 billion gallons of biofuel production by 2022, it is necessary to explore new sources of feedstocks. In a recently published report, the US Department of Energy has emphasised the importance of exploring other sources of biomass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Second-generation biofuel is derived from lignocellulosic materials such as straw, grass and wood. Second-generation biofuel is also referred to as cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol production is in a relatively early stage of development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Although the cost of the feedstock for second-generation biofuel is much lesser as compared to corn grains, the process for converting the feedstock into ethanol is much more expensive. There is a great opportunity for developing proprietary processes for breaking down cellulose into simple sugars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Although, at present, the initial processing of feedstock for cellulosic ethanol is technically challenging, production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass is expected to be commercially available in the next 10 to 15 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup></p><p>The structural complexity of cellulosic biomass makes it a challenge to produce the simple sugars that can be converted to ethanol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In its chemical composition, cellulosic biomass derived from plants is made up of 35–50 per cent cellulose, 20–35 per cent hemicellulose and 10–25 per cent lignin. Cellulose is a linear polymer made up of glucose. Hemicelllulose is a branched polymer composed of a simple 5-carbon sugar called xylose. However, lignin is an aromatic polymer and is not a substrate for microbial fermentation leading to alcohol production.</p><p>This path towards commercially viable cellulosic ethanol production will require leveraging knowledge in a variety of fields such as genetics, biochemistry, chemistry and bioengineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> As is well known, in manufacturing ethanol, the cellulosic feedstock is first shred into small particles. Next, the shredded material is subjected to pre-treatment in which heat, pressure or acid is applied to release the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The pre-treatment process yields a liquefied syrup of hemicellulose and crystalline cellulose.</p><p>Similar to the manner in which the enzyme amylase is used in the breakdown starch to glucose (for first-generation biofuels), for second-generation biofuels, the enzyme, cellulase, is required to breakdown cellulose into glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> The resulting glucose is subjected to microbial fermentation leading to the production of ethanol. Proprietary and unique microorganisms as well as proprietary enzymes are being developed to improve the production of cellulosic ethanol production.</p><p>There has been an interest in understanding microbial cellulose utilisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> A number of research laboratories are working to engineer superior cellulases for use in the hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose. There are two major classes of cellulose enzymes: non-complexed cellulose enzymes present in aerobic bacteria; and complexed cellulose enzymes found in anaerobic cellulose degrading bacteria. Cellulase enzymes are commercially available and the efficacy of the cellulase enzyme has recently become much improved.</p><p>Efforts are under way to identify cellulose-degrading enzymes from sources that were totally unthinkable only a few years ago. One interesting approach is the search for cellulosic enzymes found in microbes living symbiotically in the guts of termites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Termites ingest wood and convert it to fermentable sugars by exploiting the metabolic capabilities of microbes living symbiotically in their hind guts. The process is fast and efficient – typically achieving 95 per cent conversion in 24 hours or less.</p><p>By mining the termite digestive system, Verenium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> a company involved in cellulosic ethanol production, expects to identify new, highly efficient enzymes that can potentially be adapted to process cellulosic biomass into sugars to make cellulosic ethanol on a large scale. This project is being carried out in partnership with the US Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> InBio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and the California Institute of Technology.</p><p>Another important avenue for improving the yield of cellulosic biofuel is to create microorganisms efficient in metabolising the 5-carbon xylose sugar derived from hemicellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup></p><p>Parallel to the development of bioethanol, there is also an interest in developing biobutanol, which is a 4-carbon alcohol. Butanol has certain physical features that make it more attractive than ethanol as a transportation fuel. It can be blended into gasoline at higher concentrations, reducing global reliance on petroleum, and can be distributed by pipeline. It also compliments ethanol blends, improving ethanol vapour pressure and water absorption, which has prohibited the wider adoption of ethanol.</p><p>BP and DuPont were the first industry players in the area of advanced biofuels. These two multinational corporations are partnering together to develop technologies to bring biobutanol to market economically. DuPont and BP have also been developing catalysts to produce 1-butanol (a 4-carbon chain with the alcohol group at one end), 2-butanol (a 4-carbon chain with the alcohol group bonded to a carbon atom in the middle of the chain) and isobutanol (a branched chain with the alcohol group on one end). Isobutanol and 2-butanol have higher octane ratings, making them better fuels, and the companies have found that gasoline blends containing 16 per cent high-octane butanols deliver fuel performance similar to blends with 10 per cent ethanol (E10). BP and DuPont also claim that the 16 per cent biobutanol blend has other characteristics that make it preferable to E10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup></p><p>There is a growing interest in funding projects aimed at cellulosic ethanol production. Within the US Department of Energy, a separate office, the ‘Office of Biomass Program’, has been set up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> In March 2007, the US Department of Energy awarded total grants of $385 million to develop second-generation biofuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> The recipients of these grants include Abengoa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> Alico,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> Bluefire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Broin (Poet),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Iogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and Range Fuel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>THIRD-GENERATION BIOFUEL</title><p>Third-generation biofuels represent an improvement over second-generation biofuels in terms of the feedstock used in the biofuel production. The feedstock for third-generation biofuel is rich in cellulose and the resulting end product is cellulosic ethanol. The uniqueness of third-generation biofuels lies in the fact that the feedstock used is derived from transgenic plants expressing cell wall degrading enzymes post harvest so that the time and effort spent in processing cellulosic feedstock is significantly reduced.</p><p>Plant biotechnology has now evolved into a relatively precise and predictable science. Scientists have learned to selectively add desirable traits into crop plants. During the first wave of transgenic crop plant production, plants were created that were resistant to pests and herbicides. As a result of the second wave of transgenic plant revolution, we now have plants with improved nutritional values. With the biofuel revolution, the future focus in transgenic plant production will likely shift to producing energy crops.</p><p>In creating transgenic energy crops, there are two important considerations. First, the transgenic energy crops should have an improved productivity in terms of total biomass produced for each acre of the land planted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Genomes of a number of plant species have been completed and the genes involved in the growth regulation of plants have been identified. For example, with the completion of genomic sequence of poplar in 2006, plant biologists have identified 40 genes involved in the control of plant growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> There is growing confidence that before too long transgenic energy crops with even higher productivity will exist. The US Department of Energy has established three research centres and each centre will receive $135 million over a period of five years to apply knowledge of plant genomics to biofuel development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup></p><p>The second consideration in creating transgenic energy crops relates to producing feedstock, which is easier to process by the cellulosic bioethanol industry. There is great understanding about the biosynthesis of cellulose within the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> Now the challenge is to develop a process to break down the cellulose outside of the cell using either biological or chemical means. Efforts are underway to create transgenic plants that would express lignocellulose degrading enzymes post harvest so that the cellulosic feedstock is already conditioned for microbial fermentation by the time it reaches a fuel production facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup></p><p>Ultimately, it should be possible to combine both traits described above into a single energy crop. The resulting transgenic energy crop would show a faster growth rate and produce biomass that could be processed at biofuel refineries with little effort.</p><p>Scientists at a number of universities have developed transgenic plants that are easier to process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> Syngenta, a plant biotechnology company, is developing a genetically modified strain of corn that expresses high levels of a thermal-tolerant alpha amylase to increase the cost effectiveness of ethanol production from corn starch.

There are definite advantages in pursuing fourth-generation biofuels. Compared to second-generation cellulosic ethanol, the fourth-generation biofuels (derived from the application of synthetic biology) are expected to have similar properties as current fossil fuels in terms of energy content. Compared to bioethanol, gasoline has 52 per cent more energy per gallon. Fourth-generation biofuels are also expected to be closer to gasoline in their physical and chemical properties. In addition, fourth-generation biofuels can entirely replace fossil fuels used in any type of transportation vehicle without any modification. There is a question as to which of these two biofuels, competing for the same feedstock, would ultimately prevail in the marketplace. The answer to this question depends on further research and development efforts in each of these biofuel categories.</p><p>A number of companies are involved in the production of fourth-generation biofuels. For example, Shell and Virent have a joint research and development effort to convert plant sugars directly into ‘biogasoline’, avoiding the fermentation process used to produce ethanol in today's biorefineries altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup></p><p>Metabolic engineering is another approach to producing ready-to-use biofuels. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), have modified the highly active amino acid pathway in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria to produce isobutanol, a longer-chain alcohol than ethanol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> This is a non-fermentative method of producing longer-chain alcohols. Higher-chain alcohols have energy densities close to gasoline, are not as volatile or corrosive as ethanol and do not readily absorb water. Furthermore, branched-chain alcohols, such as isobutanol, have higher-octane numbers, resulting in less knocking in engines. UCLA has licensed this technology through an exclusive royalty-bearing license to Gevo Inc., a Pasadena-based company founded in 2005 and dedicated to producing biofuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup></p><p>Metabolic engineering has also been applied to producing biodiesel. There are at least three companies focused on the production of biodiesel. Amyris Biotech<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> is reengineering <italic>E. coli</italic> to produce gasoline substitutes that contain more energy than ethanol. Amyris is also developing a diesel substitute that can achieve lower costs and much greater scale than vegetable oil-based biodiesels. LS9 Inc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> is reengineering <italic>E. coli</italic> and other organisms to make a fossil fuel substitute. LS9 researchers are modifying the pathways that convert sugars to fatty acids, which can then be converted to biodiesel. Solazyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> is working with natural and engineered algal strains to produce renewable biodiesel. In its effort to produce biofuel using algae, Solazyme grows the algae in dark fermenters in which the algae converts sugar to oil.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>IP STRATEGIES FOR BIOFUEL INDUSTRY</title><p>As detailed above, much of the biofuel industry is still in the research and development stage. Under such circumstances, a viable patent strategy leading to a strong portfolio is usually required to secure the funding needed to move the industry from the research and development stage to marketplace commercialisation. In building an IP portfolio, companies should not only be mindful of the value of their own patent portfolio and the need to protect its core technology but also the need to identify the IP of others in which it may be necessary to acquire a license (or otherwise avoid). Once a strong patent portfolio is built, the company should have a strategy to generate a revenue stream from its IP by licensing and/or enforcing its IP through litigation.</p><p>In the case of the first- and second-generation biofuels in which the IP landscape is already crowded, end products may no longer be patentable. As a result, for first- and second-generation biofuels, a company's patent focus should be directed to upstream products and processes. These upstream products and processes include biomass feedstock, reagents and methods used to convert the primary biomass into simple sugars, as well as the microorganisms and the processes used to convert the simple sugars into useful bioethanol.</p><p>The transgenic energy crops generated as third-generation biofuels may well be patentable. Similarly, fourth-generation biofuels may give rise to additional patenting opportunities. The production of fourth-generation biofuel is based on non-fermentative methods that may be novel. In addition, the end products of fourth-generation biofuels may include novel chemical compositions that would be patentable. Thus, in view of the many diversified available approaches for producing biofuels, there exists a potentially vast IP landscape for biofuels.</p><p>There has been some effort to map the IP landscape of the biofuel industry. A recent analysis of published US patents has shown that during 2001–2007, a total of 2796 biofuel patents were published in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> There has been a steady increase in the number of biofuel applications during the course of last 7 years. In 2000, there were only 147 patents related to biofuels. This number increased to 391 in 2005 and jumped to 646 in 2006. During 2007, a total of 1045 patens were granted in the area of biofuels. A specific subset of the biofuel industry, the biodiesel IP landscape alone, has recently been reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> Singh <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> have reviewed published patents that relate to processes optimisation for biodiesel production.</p><p>Public Intellectual Property Resource for Agriculture (PIPRA), an organisation comprising 45 institutional members in 14 countries, is presently mapping the IP landscape of biofuel technologies related to cellulosic ethanol from the farm to the ethanol plant including seeds and germplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup></p><p>As evidenced by these efforts to map the emerging IP landscape for biofuels, it is clear that the increase in biofuel research and development activities in the last few years has been accompanied by a significant increase in patenting activity. As a result, the IP landscape for biofuels is already well developed.</p><p>Recognising the competition for IP rights, it has become important, both for investigators and investors in the biofuel field, to have a viable IP strategy in place before they venture into elaborate (and expensive) research and development in a particular biofuel area that may already be circumscribed by a competitor's patent(s). This is important for two reasons: (1) a well-planned IP strategy should insure that patenting opportunities are captured timely so that a strong patent portfolio can be built to secure the core business; and (2) a proper IP strategy, accompanied by periodical IP review at each stage of the product or process development, should insure freedom to operate within the company's core business and avoid situations in which a product or a process would infringe third-party patents.</p><p>It seems unlikely that a single biofuel company will be involved in all stages of biofuel development, starting from production of biomass feedstock to end biofuel product. Rather, it is more likely that a company may be involved in feedstock manufacturing or in primary processing of biomass to liquefied feedstock or in optimising the final stages of biofuel production in the refineries where the end biofuel product is produced. Therefore, depending on a company's core business, even within a single biofuel category, the IP strategy and its patenting opportunities may vary considerably from one company to another.</p><p>A company involved in the manufacturing of biomass feedstock should be fully aware of patenting opportunities available for protecting inventions related to plants. Plants may be protected by obtaining a utility patent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> or by a Plant Variety Protection Act certificate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> or by plant patents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> In a legal dispute between Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. and J.E.M. Ag. Supply, Inc., the US Supreme Court held that a new plant variety could be protected by a patent and a P.V.P Act certificate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup></p><p>When developing a transgenic energy crop as a feedstock, one should also have a well-planned licensing strategy to procure all patented reagents and methods necessary for the creation of transgenic plants from third parties, that is, patent owner or its licensees, if necessary. For example, the transgenic ‘Golden Rice’ with vitamin A-enriched grain is intended to benefit people in poor countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> To produce such rice, one would require a license to 16 patents, including patents related to the use of transgenes, methods of isolating and cloning DNA and methods of regenerating transgenic plants from transformed cells. As a result, the development of ‘Golden Rice’ slowed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup></p><p>A start-up company may be involved in improving the process of ethanol production either from corn starch or cellulosic material. Saccharification and fermentation processes are well known in the art. However, a modification to either the saccharification or fermentation processes leading to an improvement in efficiency may be a patentable invention, provided that the process steps are novel and non-obvious.</p><p>Alternatively, an improved process can also be kept as a trade secret. The decision whether to patent an invention related to a process or to keep it as a trade secret depends on business objectives and an ability to maintain trade secrets. In some situations (especially in cross-border situations) a process patent is difficult to enforce if the subject matter of the patent relates to a method of manufacturing and reverse engineering of the end product cannot be used to establish infringement of the protected process. Under such circumstances, it may be advisable to maintain the inventive process as a trade secret. Again, the decision whether to patent an invention or to maintain it as a trade secret should be made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In the case of fourth-generation biofuel development, non-fermentative processes (as opposed to the fermentative process used in first- and second-generation biofuels) may well be patentable. Moreover, in contrast to simple ethanol (the end product of first- and second-generation biofuels), the end products from fourth-generation biofuels are expected to have specific fingerprints. Based on reverse engineering the products in the fourth-generation biofuel, it may be possible to determine whether a competitor is infringing the inventive process. Thus, there is an enhanced opportunity to patent both the processes involved in the manufacture of fourth-generation biofuel as well as the resulting chemical compositions.</p><p>Some of the reagents used in the saccharification and fermentation processes are commercially available. When a reagent is not commercially available, it may be necessary to license it from a third party. Such licensing can be a major issue in connection with the development of first- and second-generation biofuels. Most of the improvement in processes efficacy in terms of the commercial manufacturing of the first- and second-generation biofuels is expected to come from the use of unique proprietary enzymes to depolymerise feedstock at the saccharification stage and use of unique proprietary microorganisms to achieve increased fermentation efficacy.</p><p>In the case of fourth-generation biofuel development, where microorganisms are genetically manipulated to introduce new metabolic pathways, many patenting opportunities are expected to present themselves. The newly created micro-organism, as well as the processes for biofuel production involving these genetically modified microorganisms, may be patentable inventions. At the same time, fourth-generation biofuel development may require equally large numbers of licensing agreements for patents covering the gene sequences that may be required to alter metabolic pathways in the microorganisms.</p><p>As alluded to above, building a strong IP portfolio involves both a defensive strategy to protect the core technology and appropriate offensive strategies to exploit the technology. It bears repeating that the defensive strategy should include periodic IP due diligence reviews of competitors patenting activity to assure freedom to operate. When another party has patented a technology, it is necessary to seek a license at an early stage of development, before committing heavy investment and before the patent owner gives an exclusive license to another party. Once a strong portfolio is built around a product or process, it can be used to realise increased valuation and higher license fees. This is the ‘reward’ part of the offensive strategy. Sometimes, in order to command initial respect for its IP, an emerging company may have to resort to litigation to prevent competitors from using its patented invention. Recent litigations to assert the patent rights related to improved enzymes used in bioethanol production illustrate this point.</p><p>In one case involving patent litigation in the biofuel industry, Novazyme, a major enzyme manufacturer, accused Genencor, another major enzyme manufacturer, of infringing one of its US Patent 6,867,031 having claims directed to a genetically engineered alpha-amylase from <italic>Bacillus stearothermophillus</italic>. Genecor's product, Spezyme Ethyl<sup>®</sup>, allegedly used such an enzyme. Novazyme filed a suit against Genecor on the day the patent was issued. After a court decision in favour of Novazyme, Genencor withdrew its commercial enzyme and agreed to pay $15.3 million to settle charges that it had infringed the patent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup></p><p>In a second patent litigation in the biofuel field, two US patent applications filed by Novazyme having claims related to enzyme-producing technology were involved. In an interference proceeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> between Novazyme and Genencor, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office's (PTO) Board of Appeals and Patent Interference decided in favour of Genecor. Novazyme appealed the decision to the US District court for the District of Delaware. The district court reversed the decision of the PTO and held that the patent applications filed by Novazyme had priority over the application filed by Genencor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup></p><p>An ongoing patent invalidity lawsuit in the field of biofuels was filed in the US District Court for the District of Idaho on 8 October 2007. In this lawsuit, Idaho Energy, which does business as Energy Products of Idaho, filed a lawsuit against Harris Contracting Co., Alliant Energy Corporation Services Inc. and Von Roll Inc., asking a judge to declare that a patent relating to the generation of energy from agricultural biofuel is invalid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup> This law suit was in response to the original assertion of the patent owner that Idaho Energy requires a patent license to avoid infringement.</p><p>In view of the endemic examination backlogs at the PTO, in a fast-growing field like biofuels, once a decision to file a patent on a new invention is made, it may be necessary to expedite the patent application process. Because such applications are energy-related, a procedure is available to petition to make the application ‘special’, so that it is taken up for examination out of turn. Of course, efforts should be made to draft a complete, accurate and comprehensive application to avoid delays in prosecution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In a fast-growing, highly invested area such as biofuels, it is very important for investors to make sure that their ability to commercialise products and technology is not impaired by third-party patents. It is also equally important for investors to make sure that their products and technologies are appropriately protected in relevant countries. Review and due diligence of patent material are somewhat different from reviewing scientific and technical literature for the purpose of drafting a publication in a peer-reviewed trade journal. There is need to work closely with patent professionals right from the beginning so that IP issues and opportunities are addressed at every stage in product development.</p><p>Patent professionals who are well qualified in technology areas such biotechnology (particularly plant and micro-bial biotechnology), molecular biology, biochemistry (particularly enzymology), chemistry, chemical engineering, bio-process development, systems biology and bioinformatics can be of great help to their clients in conducting IP due diligence, formulating IP strategy and in assisting their clients in making business decisions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Strobel</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The production of myco-diesel hydrocarbons and their derivatives by the endophytic fungus <italic>Gliocladium roseum</italic> (NRRL 50072)</article-title><source>Microbiology</source><year>2008</year><volume>154</volume><fpage>3319</fpage><lpage>3328</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1099/mic.0.2008/022186-0</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Calvin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Solar energy by photosynthesis</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1974</year><volume>184</volume><fpage>375</fpage><lpage>381</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1126/science.184.4134.375</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Calvin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Hydrocarbon from plants: Analytical methods and observations</article-title><source>Naturwissenschaften</source><year>1980</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>525</fpage><lpage>533</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/BF00450661</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Somerville</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The billion-ton biofuels vision</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2006</year><volume>312</volume><fpage>1277</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1126/science.1130034</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Twenty in ten: Strengthening America's energy security.
