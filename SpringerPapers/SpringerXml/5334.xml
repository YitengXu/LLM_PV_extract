However, most mesocosm studies regarding the pelagic environment do not consider the effects of physical factors like water-column stratification, turbulence and mixing. Neglecting such factors might bias the results compared to the natural system. Using a unique indoor mesocosm facility, we present results on how different water-column stratifications can be made and how they act as barriers for exchange between water layers. Turbulent mixing, simulated by vertically rotating incubation vessels, is shown to be of high importance for primary production, generating up to nine times higher production in humus-rich water than incubation vessels at fixed depths. Convective stirring is shown to be an attractive method for generating different turbulence conditions, and different temperature settings can be used to get turnover times from 84 h or more down to 17 min for a 5-m water parcel. We also demonstrate how an anoxic bottom layer can be achieved by stimulating heterotrophic bacteria through addition of bioavailable organic carbon.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mesocosm-based research has become an increasingly important part of aquatic ecology by closing the gap between laboratory studies at the species, individual or lower organisation level and field studies at the population or ecosystem level (Stewart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). Field studies in the marine environment often require large research ships with daily costs of 10,000€ or more and studies on natural systems, especially pelagic ones, also include much short-term variability. Thus, high cost of marine field studies combined with the inherent natural spatial and temporal variability heavily constrains the possibility of achieving statistically well-founded results solely based on field studies. Alternately, laboratory studies at the individual level can, for example, precisely define physiological responses to both abiotic (light, temperature, salinity, etc.) and biotic variables (food concentration and quality, crowding, gender, age, etc.). However, the complexity in the natural environment is not fully reflected in the relatively small volume of water used in laboratory experiments, and the time scales used are usually short. For example, Miko et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>) compared results from ecotoxity tests on tadpoles in the lab and in outdoor mesocos which showed strikingly different results. However, due to the reduction in complexity also present in a mesocosm, extrapolation of results from mesocosms to the natural environment should be done with caution. Spivak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>) concluded that results from mesocosm-scale experiments on micro-algae probably are relevant to large-scale processes, such as eutrophication. On the other hand, Williams et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>) found that freshwater pond mesocosms showed lower biodiversity than corresponding natural ponds. Mesocosms in a mesotrophic and a eutrophic lake showed the same water chemistry as the surrounding water, but most biological variables diverged from the surrounding water (Dzialowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). The tendency of diverging succession in mesocos and natural habitats has been repeatedly shown by Schindler and colleagues (see, e.g., Schindler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref> for a review). Another problem is variability between replicate mesocosms. Caquet et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>) showed that water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and suspended solids exhibited a very low variability between replicate mesocosms whereas nutrients displayed elevated variability. They also found that biological parameters at the individual level were less variable than those at the community level.</p><p id="Par3">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> represents an attempt to categorize and compare different types of mesocosms and also compare with open field studies, thus giving a rough overview of which type of basic tool should be the best choice for a given research question. Costs, working conditions, range of environmental manipulation and measurement possibilities and replication possibilities have been considered. To cover as much as possible of the volume and depth ranges, the natural environment is of course number one, and going from sea/lake-based to land-based and indoor mesocosms gradually reduces the possible range in volume and depth. Field studies are also best if natural light conditions and irradiance profiles are of primary importance, although sea/lake-based mesocosms can provide the same light conditions as in nature; they have a practical limit in depth and thereby also a more restricted range in the vertical irradiance profile.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Relative suitability of the basic research tool for doing ecological studies in pelagic environments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Function</p></th><th align="left"><p>A</p></th><th align="left"><p>B</p></th><th align="left"><p>C</p></th><th align="left"><p>D</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Choice of volume</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Choice of depth range</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Sensitivity to weather conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Access and working conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Statistically based investigations</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Sensor-based online monitoring</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Cost of a comparable research study</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Use of natural light conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Adjustment of light conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Range in vertical irradiance profile</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Adjustment of nutrient conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Adjustment of temperature conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Adjustment of salinity conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Adjustment of pH conditions</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Control of turbulent mixing</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Density stratification of water parcel</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>**</p></td><td align="left"><p>***</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Manipulation of food-web structure</p></td><td align="left"><p>*</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td><td align="left"><p>*****</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>A = Ship-based studies in the field; B = Sea-based mesocosms; C = Land-based mesocosms; D = Indoor mesocosms.

Sea/lake-based mesocosms are often inexpensive, at least compared to the indoor variant, and provide better opportunities for a natural light environment. The negative characteristics of sea/lake-based mesocosms compared to land and indoor facilities are their sensitivity to weather conditions and very restricted potential to control light, temperature and turbulent mixing, whereas the ability to adjust nutrients, pH and food-web structure is approximately the same as for the land-based and indoor counterparts.</p><p id="Par5">Land-based and indoor mesocosms have a number of advantages, such as easy access, good working conditions, very low sensitivity to weather conditions, best possibilities for sensor-based online monitoring and especially that indoor mesocosms provide the best opportunity for manipulation of the physical environment. The number of land or indoor mesocosm units is usually restricted due to restricted space, and the number of replicate treatments and treatment levels will, therefore, also be restricted. Cost is an important factor in the choice of research tool, and land-based and indoor mesocosms often have a high initial construction cost but require limited operation budgets thereafter. A ship-based field study has full costs every time, and sea/lake-based mesocosm facilities often require frequent repair and renewal of parts.</p><p id="Par6">A range of physical, chemical and biological shortcomings are obvious when trying to extrapolate mesocosm results to natural ecosystems (Schindler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>). An enclosure of a water mass will inevitably differ in some conditions from the natural ones, and one factor that has received attention is the importance of dimensional relationships of the actual enclosure. Mesocosms with the same volume but different dimensional properties will often generate different results (e.g., Petersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999</xref>; Petersen and Englund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>). This might be explained by, for example, a changed surface/volume ratio or changes in the light environment and in air–water exchange processes. An obvious effect of an increased surface to volume ratio is a potential for build-up of periphyton biomass on the inside walls, which will act as an increasingly important factor for the flow of energy and material in the mesocosm during the time span of a study.</p><p id="Par7">Most ecological studies using mesocosms lack information on physical characteristics of the experimental environment. Factors like mixing, turbulence, light spectrum and exchange rate through discontinuity layers are very important for biological processes and, if different from the natural environment, may cause biased results as compared to the natural environment. The natural environment in the sea and lakes is usually also stratified during most of the year, although thermoclines or pycnoclines are seldom part of a mesocosm-based ecological study. In this paper, we describe a unique mesocosm facility where the physical characteristics can be controlled and manipulated and give some examples of biological consequences of different physical conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par8">For our functional tests and experimental evaluations, we used the indoor mesocosm facility at Umeå Marine Sciences Centre, University of Umeå, Sweden, situated at the northern Bothnian Sea (N63°34′; E19°50′) in the Baltic Sea.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The experimental facility</title><p id="Par9">The facility is located in a 6-m-high temperature-regulated hall with a second floor about 120 cm below the top of the mesocosms, with a laboratory in direct connection to this upper floor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). It consists of 12 insulated black cylindrical polyethylene tanks, 5 m high with an inner diameter of 0.73 m. There are three 1.4-m-high vertical sections in each mesocosm where the temperature is monitored and regulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), separated by two 0.4-m-high sections. The wall of each 1.4-m unit is divided into six interconnected concentric sections with holes in the dividing lamellae on opposite sides of two neighbouring sections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), and with an inlet for the temperature control medium at the bottom and an outlet at the top section. The temperature control medium (40% propylene glycol, Dowcal 20) is, thus, forced to circulate around the wall (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The outer part of the wall comprises an air-filled section that insulates the entire mesocosm tank (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The actual temperature-control system consists of two units for circulation of the glycol solution, one with cold (− 6 °C) and one with warm (30 °C) solution. Both are connected to each of the three vertical sections on each tank (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) through computer-controlled valves that direct either cold or warm glycol solution according to the desired temperature (Honeywell AB, Johanneshov, Sweden and Gate AB, Umeå, Sweden). In general, the maximum deviation from the desired temperature is within ± 0.5 °C. The two intermediate sections of 0.4 m in height can either be switched off or connected in parallel with an adjacent 1.4-m temperature control section.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simplified view of a mesocosm tank. <bold>a</bold> Dimensions of the entire tank showing the positions of the three sections with temperature control and the two smaller sections between them. <bold>b</bold> Cross-view of the tank wall in one temperature-controlled section</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40071_2017_185_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">The technical design described above makes it possible to set up stratified water columns with a thermocline at 1.5–2 m in depth, at 3.2–3.7 m in depth, or at both depths. The temperature control system can also be used to create convective stirring at different rates. A slight increase in the temperature settings in one or both of the two lower sections promotes convective stirring in the water column. It is also possible to maintain convective stirring above a cooler bottom layer by a similar slight offset in the temperature settings between the middle and upper sections. Faster convective stirring can also be maintained by maximum heating at the low section and maximum cooling at the top section, thus allowing the middle section to control the overall temperature in the water column. Further increase in pycnocline strength can be achieved by dissolving sea salt in the water. Each mesocosm tank is irradiated by an HID metal halogen lamp (Philips MH/CDM-T 150 W/930) with an emission spectrum resembling that of natural sunlight but with lower irradiance than sunlight below 400 nm. The position of the lamp in our experiments was adjusted to give 400 µmol quanta m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> immediately below the water surface in all mesocosm tanks.</p><p id="Par11">The mesocosm facility also includes an automatic system for water exchange, where a given percentage of water renewal per time unit can be set. The tanks can be filled either from the ordinary water-supply system, with intake approximately 800 m offshore, from 2 to 8 m in depth, or through a second pipe system, where water directly from the dock outside the lab or from a transport truck can be used. Water from the ordinary water-supply system is normally passed through a 300-µm filter; it can also be pre-flushed with air, or it can be used without any pre-treatments. A valve system ensures that all tanks are filled in parallel. There is a movable filtering system with 10 µm pre-filters (FSI Filter Spec. Int., Michigan City, Illinois, USA.) and patron filters down to 1 µm (Roki Techno Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) which can be connected to the system. It takes around 3 h to fill all tanks without filtering and around 16 h to fill them with 1-µm-filtered sea water, including one necessary change of filters. A system is also available for collecting undisturbed bottom sediment from the field in shallow cylinders, fitted in size to the bottom of the mesocosm tanks.

The mesocosm tanks were filled with tap water, the absolute irradiance was measured at 0.3, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4.4 m in depth, the water-column irradiance was calculated by trapezoid depth integration, and the results shown are relative to those for Alu.

We recorded the temperature profiles in the water column with a temperature setting of 15 °C in all three sections of the mesocosms and with different mixing methods. Temperature profiles were measured in undisturbed conditions, in water bubbled with compressed air from 60 cm in depth, in water with an undulating fan blowing air on the surface, and in water with a 200-W electrical heater placed at the bottom. A further study of the exchange rate of water between the heated surface and deeper layers was also performed with the undisturbed conditions and with the 200-W electrical heater placed at the bottom of the mesocosm. This was done by injecting a solution containing 4 g of humic acid (Aldrich pnr: 536080) at 2.4 m in depth and profiling the content of humic acid in the upper part of the water columns over time using a Turner Designs Cyclops-7 CDOM sensor (Turner Designs, San Jose, California, USA).</p><p id="Par15">Air bubbling and fan blowing were also compared in a study of the mixing efficiency through a thermocline with a 5 °C temperature gradient. Air bubbling was done by lowering a PVC tubing with an outlet diameter of 18 mm to pre-defined depths and regulating the air pressure to give a bubbling frequency of one bubble per second. This bubbling strategy creates stirring but it does not aerate like an air diffuser since the area of the bubbles at any given time is negligible compared to the area of the water surface.</p><p id="Par16">When testing air blowing on the surface, we arranged the fan to blow at 45° towards the surface and undulate 45° left and right. To promote convective stirring, we used either a submersible 250-W heater or the three internal temperature control mantles that form parts of each mesocosm tank (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In these experiments, we used 160 mg of rhodamine in 50 ml of water, injected at 2.4 m in depth as described above.</p><p id="Par17">Two different types of mixing rate experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, the rate of transport through thermoclines was studied. In another set of experiments, water-column mixing with different settings to promote convective stirring was studied. In both cases, we used a rhodamine solution that was slowly added through a small funnel with PVC tubing attached to the neck and with an air diffuser attached to the other end of the tubing. To ensure that all of the rhodamine was injected, the tubing was flushed with 100 ml of water after the injection. The rhodamine solution and flush water was kept at the same temperature as the surrounding water. In the thermocline experiment, the temperature in the bottom layer was set to, respectively, 5, 10 and 15 °C, and to 20 °C above this bottom layer in all three tanks. A rhodamine solution (160 mg in 50 ml of water) was injected at 4.5 m in depth, and a 250-W submersible heater was placed at 3.2 m in depth to ensure mixing in the upper water column. After adding the rhodamine, we lowered a small aquarium pump with horizontal in- and outlets down to the bottom and ran it for 1 min to get the bottom water well mixed with rhodamine. Vertical profiles of the rhodamine distribution were thereafter made over time, using a Turner Designs Databank handheld data logger with a pre-calibrated Turner Cyclops 7 model 2100-000 fluorimeter sensor (Turner Designs, San Jose, California, USA). After the profiling ended, the water column was mixed thoroughly, and the rhodamine concentration was recorded to get the equilibrium concentration. In the study of the transport rate through thermoclines, we divided the water column into four vertical sections, 0.2–1.8, 1.8–3.3, 3.3–3.6 m (main part of the thermocline), and 3.6–4.7 m (stagnant bottom layer where the rhodamine was added). The transport rate into the water above the bottom layer (above 3.6 m) was calculated by normalizing the final equilibrium concentration of rhodamine to 100% and then plotting the % values of equilibrium rhodamine concentration over time and fitting a linear regression equation to the data. This is a simplification of the actual process since, in theory, a given proportion of water is mixed per time unit, which would generate a logarithmic succession. The exchange rate of rhodamine from the bottom layer through the thermocline was calculated by setting the start value minus the equilibrium value as 100%, thereby normalizing the equilibrium rhodamine concentration to 0%, and then plotting the % values over time. To define the effect of thermocline strength, i.e., the density difference between the bottom and overlaying water, we plotted the transport rate versus thermocline strength (density difference), both for transport into the upper two layers and out from the bottom layer, and adapted the best fit regression equation to the data.</p><p id="Par18">In the studies of water-column mixing, we defined homogenous mixing as the time it takes for the concentration of rhodamine to stabilize to within 95–105% of the final equilibrium concentration. This was tested with three temperature conditions: (1) temperature settings of 14, 15 and 16 °C in the low, middle and upper temperature-control sections, respectively, ensuring a continuous temperature increase from the bottom to the surface; (2) no temperature control, yielding a uniform temperature in the water column. (3) maximum heating in the low temperature-control section, a 15 °C setting in the middle section, and maximum cooling in the upper section, allowing for maximum convective stirring but with a constant temperature from the bottom to the surface. For these three experiments, we used 20 mg of rhodamine in 10 ml of water and injected it at 2.4 m in depth, followed by rinsing with 100 ml of water and rhodamine profiling over time, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary production under different mixing conditions</title><p id="Par19">Primary production was measured in two experiments.

The primary production based on traditional fixed-depth incubation was successively reduced with added humus. A decrease of more than 80 and 60% for the 8 mg l<sup>−1</sup> additions could be observed for the 0- to 1.5- and 0- to 4.5-m sections, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a).

Irradiance as PAR (400–700 nm in wavelength), salinity and temperature are commonly included variables, whereas spectral distribution and level of turbulent mixing are seldom measured. The ultra-violet radiation from sunlight is known to affect microorganisms and especially bacteria negatively, but Ogbebo and Ochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>) showed that this effect was significant only with added inorganic nutrients, and then with a stronger effect on phytoplankton production (45% reduction) compared to bacterioplankton production (21% reduction). In addition, sunlight also causes photolysis of DOC (dissolved organic carbon), which will transform carbon compounds and make them more bioavailable for bacterioplankton (Bertilsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>; Tranvik and Bertilsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>). Such effects of sunlight will, therefore, have a strong impact on the overall production, as well as the trophic balance of the system. By mesocosm enclosures with different types of inside material and different light sources, both quantity (PAR irradiance) and quality (spectral distribution) of the light climate in the water column can be manipulated, as shown in our Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.</p><p id="Par31">One feature of solid mesocosm tanks is that the tank walls do not let light in from the sides into the water column. This is in contrast to in situ mesocosms, which are usually made of a thin plastic material, although of variable opacity. The light penetrating the water column is absorbed by the water itself, as well as by dissolved and particulate material. Light hitting the wall of a solid tank is partly absorbed and partly reflected, with the relative proportion dependent on the surface material and also how clean the surface is. One important factor for indoor mesocosms is the light source, where the beam angle is a key factor. In nature, the light beam from the sun is essentially parallel, while an electric light source over a mesocosm tank delivers a diverging light beam. The wider the beam angle from the light source, the higher the attenuation through absorption on the wall. In our mesocosm experiments, we recorded light attenuation coefficients ranging from 0.521 (pure tap water) up to 2.612 [natural water with a high allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) content], which can be compared to coefficients measured in the northern Bothnian Sea between June and December, where the average coefficient was 0.595, ranging from 0.300 up to 1.425 (own unpublished data). The negative consequence of a higher-than-natural light attenuation coefficient is that the same light-depth relationship as in nature cannot be reproduced. However, at the same time, it might be an advantage, since the irradiance profile in a natural water column can be reproduced on a compressed depth scale. For example, in the experiment by Båmstedt and Wikner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>), the average compensation depth was 3.2 m without added ADOC and 2.6 m with added ADOC, whereas field measurements gave a range from 3.2 to 15.4 m, with an average of 7.7 m.</p><p id="Par32">Pycnocline strength and turbulent mixing are physical properties that are of the utmost importance in, for example, supplying nutrients from deeper water to the euphotic zone or supplying oxygen from above to benthic organisms. The effect of variable pycnocline strength and turbulent mixing on ecosystem components can easily be studied in mesocosm experiments, but mesocosms of the type we describe here are also suitable tools for direct physical studies of how different combinations of pycnocline strength and turbulent mixing govern transport rates, as exemplified in our Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.</p><p id="Par33">When using mesocosms to simulate a natural ecosystem, one major challenge is to create mixing, since the natural mechanisms of mixing will be altered in a closed water parcel. In our study, we found that mixing in the uppermost few cm of the water parcel is necessary to eliminate a gradually increasing surface aggregation of organic material. Mixing from 60 cm in depth was also necessary with our illumination system to eliminate the thermal-lid effect caused by heat from the lamps. The exchange of material between the surface and deeper layers is clearly hampered by the existence of a surface section that is warmer than the water below (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, f). The combination of a low mixing rate in the water column and temperature stratification at the surface may influence the exchange of gases between the water column and the atmosphere and the transport of nutrients from deeper water to the surface layer. In the worst case, this can lead to mesocosm environments that differ significantly from the prevailing natural conditions. Because different lamps produce different amounts of heat, it is necessary to investigate the actual condition for each mesocosm facility. Both bubbling with air from 60 cm in depth and blowing air on the surface with a fan eliminated thermal stratification at the surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c). The use of a fan, however, caused a significantly higher loss of water due to evaporation and a lower surface temperature as compared to bubbling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). The explanation for this effect is as follows: the enthalpy of water evaporation is 2260 kJ per kg (see textbooks on thermodynamics), and this energy is taken from the water, thereby causing a cooling of the surface layer and a different temperature profile as compared to air bubbling. The logic of the difference in temperature profile is a difference in transport rate, clearly illustrated in our Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d. The results are a strong reminder that the same methods should always be used if the results from different experiments are to be compared.</p><p id="Par34">Striebel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>) compared the effect of three methods of mesocosm mixing, following a plankton community over 19 days and using a disc that moves up and down, an air-lift system and air bubbling. Mechanical mixing with the disc generated the highest zooplankton biomass, and an air-lift system generated a lower proportion of small flagellates, but otherwise, all methods gave the same community composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton. From mesocosm studies in Lake Thaihu, Zhou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016a</xref>) showed that the turbulence level had a strong impact on the structure of the zooplankton community, with a shift from the dominance of large-sized crustaceans to small-sized rotifers with increased turbulence. High turbulence also suppressed the zooplankton growth and biomass. Zou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016b</xref>) also reported a strong positive influence of turbulent mixing on the production of autochthonous chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). We have mainly used convective stirring as a standard method of mixing, since it corresponds better to field conditions than mixing by pumps, propellers or air bubbles (e.g., Paul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Sjöqvist et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). This is done either by slightly different temperature settings for the temperature-control mantles, or by submerging an electrical heater, or by both. The maximum convective stirring settings correspond to only 17 min for complete mixing of the mesocosm water (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f) with still a rather uniform temperature profile (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). These results show that high stirring rates can be achieved and that the overall temperature is precisely controlled by the setting of the middle section under these circumstances. The range in mixing rate, exemplified in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, with relatively small differences in temperature profiles, shows that mixing by convective stirring is a versatile and effective method of creating different turbulent environments. However, to achieve a given mixing rate for a certain type of mesocosm, calibration measurements are necessary. We have used rhodamine injections for this purpose, with the criterion that mixing is achieved when the concentration of rhodamine has stabilized to within 95–105% of the equilibrium value.</p><p id="Par35">Our results of primary production from rotating incubations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) also indicate a dramatic importance of turbulent mixing in water with a high content of humus, which causes brownification of the water, with an increased production ratio between rotation/fixed-point incubations with increased humus. Because primary production with a radioactive tracer technique is measured either by in situ incubations at fixed depths or in an incubator with a series of fixed light levels, such an effect from turbulent mixing will not be accounted for. Almost 40 years ago, Marra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1978</xref>) noted that variation in incubation depth yielded higher primary production than incubations at fixed depths. In addition, Gieskes et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1979</xref>) noted from their studies in the tropical open ocean that the primary production in the upper part of the euphotic zone was underestimated, probably caused by more rapid bleaching of chlorophyll in algal cells incubated at fixed depths compared to cells freely circulating in the vertically mixed surface layer. This important topic obviously needs more attention. If further studies show this issue to be of general significance, future measurements of the primary production in situ and in incubators should be made in better accordance with the prevailing turbulent mixing conditions.</p><p id="Par36">Turbulent mixing is also of profound importance for the diffusive boundary layer above the bottom sediment and for the transportation of material and properties through a pycnocline, such as supplying the photic zone with nutrients from the deeper layers and for oxygen-rich surface water to reach the deeper layers. Lucas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>) used an oscillating grid mesocosm in which the turbulence could be varied and found that the thickness of the oxygen-diffusive boundary layer was inversely related and that the oxygen penetration depth in different sediments was positively related to the turbulence intensity. Our study on oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) showed the effect of enrichment of bioavailable DOC for the oxygen concentration in the bottom layer. However, the estimated theoretical consumption of oxygen through bacterial respiration indicated that 23 days would be required for the observed reduction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>c). The density difference between the upper and lower water layer was 1.737 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, and if we use Eq. 4 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, we see that the transport rate from the bottom layer would be 0.053% per hour. This means that 1.27% per day of the bottom water is replaced by more oxygenated water from above, which would then somewhat reduce the effect of bacterial respiration. Bacterial abundance in the mesocosm with glycol addition was 35–66% higher than mesocosms without glycol addition, and bacterial production was between 150 and 168% higher (data not shown), clearly showing the stimulating effect of glycol on the bacterial community. We can only speculate about the difference between the theoretical and observed oxygen succession, and one aspect may be a lower theoretical growth efficiency than the 19% we used (see “<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>”). The fact that the bacterial production increased by 150–168% with glycol but the bacterial abundance only increased by 35–66% might indicate that glycol was mainly used for respiration. Higher-resolution measurements, both in time and depth, would probably also provide a better basis for explanation. Here, our primary goal was to show that an anoxic environment can be achieved in a mesocosm enclosure via natural biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Final remark</title><p id="Par37">We have described a unique aquatic mesocosm facility that is highly versatile regarding physical conditions in the water column.
