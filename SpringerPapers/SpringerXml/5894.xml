As such, it must rely on smart harvesting equipment and techniques for a reliable and effective application. The introduction of sensors and digital information technologies in forest inventories, operation planning, and work execution enables the achievement of the desired results and provides a range of additional opportunities and data. The latter may help to better understand the results of management options on forest health, timber quality, and many other applications. The introduction of intelligent forest machines may multiply the beneficial effect of digital data gathered for forest monitoring and management, resulting in forest harvesting operations being more sustainable in terms of costs and environment. The interaction can be pushed even further by including the timber processing industry, which assesses physical and chemical characteristics of wood with sensors to optimize the transformation process. With the support of an item-level traceability system, the same data could provide a formidable contribution to CSF. The “memory” of wood could support scientists to understand the response of trees to climate-induced stresses and to design accordingly an adaptive silviculture, contributing to forest resilience in the face of future changes due to human-induced climate alteration.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en" specific-use="web-only"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Digital information technology</kwd><kwd>Forest machines</kwd><kwd>Forest operations</kwd><kwd>Harvesting equipment</kwd><kwd>Sensors</kwd><kwd>Timber processing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-80767-2_Chapter_9.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Climate-Smart Forestry and Forest Operations<index-term id="ITerm4"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term></title><p id="Par32">Climate change<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Climate changes</term></index-term> is altering the ecological equilibrium<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Forest management</term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Timber processing</term></index-term> of our planet. Forests<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> are among the most affected ecosystems due to the increasing damages caused directly or indirectly by rising temperatures, such as droughts, wildfires, and pest attacks. On the other hand, in the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)</term></index-term>), forests are considered a key tool in tackling greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration in the atmosphere. In this regard, there is an open debate concerning the most appropriate use and management of forests. Some researchers consider a priority the carbon sequestration<index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Carbon sequestration</term></index-term> capacity of forest ecosystems<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Forest ecosystems</term></index-term>, suggesting a focus on the accumulation of carbon in forest biomass and soils. This would be achieved with a specific management approach and reduction of timber harvests (Holtsmark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). The concern over timber extraction is not only related to illegal logging but also regarding the production of forest biomass for energy (Searchinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2018</xref>). Nevertheless, while illegal logging and deforestation are unanimously regarded as a threat, several authors consider that under appropriate management and regulations, timber and biomass extraction may contribute positively to an overall net carbon control (Kauppi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>; Favero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>), e.g., through substitution of fossil fuel-based products.</p><p id="Par33">In this frame, the productive functions of forests are essential to guarantee an effective contribution to GHG mitigation<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Mitigation</term></index-term>. In fact, they provide renewable materials and fuels (substituting fossil-derived alternatives), food, as well as other non-wood forest products, whose importance may sometimes offset the role of woody materials (Sheppard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2020</xref>). The production of goods with direct economic value is essential to support local communities and rural development. This in turn ensures forest management<index-term id="ITerm13"><term>Forest management</term></index-term> and preservation is economically and technically feasible. For instance, by allowing the presence of local inhabitants, which represent both the workforce and the main users/monitors of forests.</p><p id="Par34">A possible answer to this complex scenario is provided by climate-smart forestry (CSF) (Yousefpour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2018</xref>). This is a comprehensive approach, addressing the goals of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM)<index-term id="ITerm14"><term>Sustainable forest management (SFM)</term></index-term> and the threat of climate change<index-term id="ITerm15"><term>Climate changes</term></index-term> by enabling both forests and society to transform, adapt to, and mitigate climate-induced changes (Bowditch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">The previous and following chapters of this book describe in detail the concept of CSF as well as the solutions envisaged for its application and the tools used for forest monitoring<index-term id="ITerm16"><term>Forest monitoring</term></index-term>. The present chapter focuses on the contribution that forest operations<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> and, in a broader vision, the whole timber supply chain can provide to CSF application. This contribution can be summarized by two main roles:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par36">Active forest management<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Forest management</term></index-term></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">Production of data at plot and tree level</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par38">Even if they stem from the same activities, these two roles can be easily differentiated when considered as part of CSF. In fact, the former is the application in practice of the management strategies, acting “passively” while implementing the guidelines and instructions elaborated by CSF models<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Models</term></index-term>. The latter, instead, is an active contribution to the development of such models<index-term id="ITerm20"><term>Models</term></index-term>. In fact, the data produced and stored all along the timber supply chain can be used to better understand forest dynamics and improve the very models<index-term id="ITerm21"><term>Models</term></index-term> previously mentioned, closing the loop.</p><p id="Par39"><italic>Active</italic><italic>forest management</italic><index-term id="ITerm22"><term>Forest management</term></index-term> is based on the use of specific technologies and techniques. These can be combined to achieve both processes efficiency, social benefits, and minimal environmental impact, implementing the concept of sustainable forest operations<index-term id="ITerm23"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> (SFO) as introduced by Marchi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>). SFO deployed in the frame of an adaptive silviculture is a crucial tool to enhance the resilience<index-term id="ITerm24"><term>Resilience</term></index-term> of forests and to achieve the following goals:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par40">Increase the sustainability of timber and forest biomass production</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Directly or indirectly enhance or maintain the production of non-wood forest products and indirect services, such as water supply and carbon sequestration<index-term id="ITerm25"><term>Carbon sequestration</term></index-term></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">Implementation of sustainable and smart silviculture practices, such as tree species change, age mixing, density reduction, or salvaging operations</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par43">In order to secure a fast and effective implementation of SFO guidelines, sensing and digital technologies are necessary to plan, manage, and execute forest works, creating a link between SFO and precision forestry (PF). The latter can be defined as the application in forestry of geospatial information and remotely sensed data for planning silvicultural operations at the level of stand, sub-stand, or even individual trees (Holopainen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>). For instance, planning may identify broad restricted areas, as may be the case of riparian vegetation surrounding water bodies enclosed in the forest (e.g., ponds or creeks), but with individual-tree detail level, it can address the protection of individual trees (e.g., trees hosting nests of protected birds’ species) as well as meet the precise requirement of nature conservation instances.</p><p id="Par44"><italic>Production of data at plot and tree level</italic> is one of the distinctive requirements of CSF, which relies on the availability and elaboration of data (including the territorial scale). As described in the chapters of this book, this is essential for understanding the dynamics of forest growth<index-term id="ITerm26"><term>Forest growth</term></index-term> and health and its responses to climate change<index-term id="ITerm27"><term>Climate changes</term></index-term> and to draw models<index-term id="ITerm28"><term>Models</term></index-term> that support management hypotheses. Data is provided by a number of sources, ranging from satellite images to sessile sensors<index-term id="ITerm29"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> fixed on trees, varying greatly in territorial and time scale. Forest equipment is already an additional source of data, but the potential of machines as carriers of sensors<index-term id="ITerm30"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> for forest monitoring<index-term id="ITerm31"><term>Forest monitoring</term></index-term> is still largely unexpressed. Furthermore, the whole timber supply chain, including the highly detailed sensors<index-term id="ITerm32"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> deployed by the timber transformation industry (e.g., sawmills), provides extremely valuable and accurate data regarding wood development and characteristics. This data could narrate the “memory of wood,” relating the stresses<index-term id="ITerm33"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> and growing conditions experienced in the last decades (or centuries) by an enormous dataset of trees. For this purpose, an effective tracing system from stump to mill is necessary as well as the capacity to store and manage properly a high volume of data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Timber Supply Chains and CSF: The Stat of the Art</title><p id="Par45">This section details the practical application of PF in planning and management of forest harvesting. It describes the present sources of data and their commercial application for fleet control and for estimate of timber and biomass yield. Additionally, it discusses the developments expected in the near future and the main research lines currently known. All the information or data infrastructure is also considered from the point of view of CSF, and the potential synergies between commercial operations and forest monitoring<index-term id="ITerm34"><term>Forest monitoring</term></index-term> activities are highlighted.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>From Forest Inventories to the Virtual Forest</title><p id="Par46">At present, forest inventories (FI) are the most common application of precision forestry. For this purpose, visible (red/green/blue, RGB) or hyperspectral images are the main data source, collected from airborne sensors<index-term id="ITerm35"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> installed on different carriers, such as satellites (long distance), airplanes (medium distance), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for short distances (White et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>). Forest inventories are generally integrated with thematic maps, such as soil layers, forest treatments, tree species composition, and any relevant information reported. A detailed forest inventory plays a key role in the management of the forest as well as in its economic valorization (which may aim at producing an income for the owner or simply to cover the costs of the necessary management operations, depending on the function assigned to the forest stand). For this purpose, it includes not only quantitative values, such as timber volume, age distribution, and structure of the forest stand, but also qualitative figures, such as health and fertility of the stands composing the forest.</p><p id="Par47">A further technology with great potential and consolidated application in forest sector is the laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR), which has proven particularly effective in large-scale inventories, integrating data elaborated from RGB sensors<index-term id="ITerm36"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> (Matasci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>) and multispectral sensors<index-term id="ITerm37"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> (Puliti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). Compared to the latter source of data, LiDAR provides a more reliable 3D information (Noordermeer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>) and allows a better estimate of the growing stock<index-term id="ITerm38"><term>Growing stocks</term></index-term> and the relative value of the harvestable roundwood (Peuhkurinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>). The assessment of the quantity and market value<index-term id="ITerm39"><term>Market value</term></index-term> of growing stock<index-term id="ITerm40"><term>Growing stocks</term></index-term> can be further enhanced thanks to the application of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). This can integrate both traditional inventories and aerial surveys, returning a detailed inventory including number of trees, shape and taper of stems, crow insertion, and other parameters not detectable with aerial, above-crown sensing (Mengesha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>). For instance, by integrating RGB images taken from UAVs with TLS scanning, Pichler et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>) increased the effective volume estimation of the trees in the stand from below 80% for the aerial data to over 94% of the combined dataset. This proves the potential of merging data originated from different sensors<index-term id="ITerm41"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> and integrated with other digital information sources such as topographic or thematic maps (e.g., pedological layers) and traditional forest inventories. Such multisensor data fusion leads to the generation of a digital model<index-term id="ITerm42"><term>Models</term></index-term> of the studied object (Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001">2012</xref>), in this case the forest. This can be defined as the “virtual forest” (Rossmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2009</xref>), which gathers accurate, consistent, and readily available information regarding the real forest. This information is used to better plan and manage commercial forest operations<index-term id="ITerm43"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term>. Some examples may be given by forest road and skid trail planning and georeferencing (Đuka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). The virtual forest and the related database are both generated for and paid by forest management<index-term id="ITerm44"><term>Forest management</term></index-term> and harvest operations. Yet, from the point of view of CSF, they can be regarded as an excellent and massive data collection infrastructure. In fact, the availability of such an integrated network of sensors<index-term id="ITerm45"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> can provide stand-specific information extremely useful to monitor the forest physiology and health parameters (see also Chap. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-80767-2_10" ext-link-type="doi">10</ext-link> of this book: Tognetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR04">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Multipurpose Forest Operation<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> Planning</title><p id="Par48">Cost optimization remains the foremost aim (and driver) of forest operation<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> planning.

The development of a multi-target forest operation<index-term id="ITerm51"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> plan is a complex task, which requires more data regarding the forest and a higher capacity to elaborate and interconnect this information. For this purpose, the digital database of the virtual forest (VF) is the perfect source of data, which is not only related to standing trees but also to other descriptors of the forest. For instance, LiDAR data is also used to detail the terrain features through the digital surface model (DSM) and the digital terrain model (DTM). These are used to derive the canopy high model (CHM) but provide also relevant information regarding terrain and soil characteristics such as roughness, slope and, with the integration of sampling plots, bearing capacity (Pirotti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The high-resolution 3D data of the VF combined with multi-spectrum satellite data collected in frequent time series is a key element to optimize planning of forest operations<index-term id="ITerm52"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term>. It allows to minimize the transit for forest machines<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> and to set predefined skidding trails (Sterenczak and Moskalik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2015</xref>) and cable layout (Bont and Heinimann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>) that increase efficiency of the operations, reducing costs per cubic meter of timber extracted. As an example, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">9.1</xref> shows a GIS analysis to evaluate alternative forwarder paths in an Alpine environment by considering variables I) slope and roughness of the terrain and II) the density of the forest stand. The variables were determined from LiDAR data: in particular, the digital terrain model (DTM) (a), the canopy height model (CHM) (b), the terrain roughness (c), and the cost surface normalizing and summarizing the previous data (d).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 9.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Example of timber hauling operation planning based on digital data.

In both cases, the maximum lateral inclination was supposed to be 4%. The generated paths were then compared with the real paths of the machine driven by an expert operator.</p><p id="Par52">Thanks to the high detail of the data, plans can get to a tree-level resolution and evaluate the interaction among trees at stand level and the trees’ group dynamics (Pirotti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2012</xref>; Lindberg and Holmgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>). This creates a link with the climate-smart silvicultural prescriptions<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>Silvicultural prescriptions</term></index-term> described in Chap. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-80767-2_8" ext-link-type="doi">8</ext-link> of this book (Pach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR03">2021</xref>) and strengthens the connection that may (and should) exist between the timber supply chains and CSF aims. Examples of this interaction can be provided by forest operation<index-term id="ITerm55"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> plans tailored to include the priority of habitats conservation, to tackle the spread of forest pests, and to consider the hydrological effect of logging extraction (Blagojević et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>; Görgens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). The reduction of soil damage due to forest operation<index-term id="ITerm56"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> can take advantage from the use of high-resolution data as reported by (Niemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>; Salmivaara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>). Minimizing soil damage is one of the most important targets for the sustainability of forest operation<index-term id="ITerm57"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> to preserve soil fertility and forest regeneration and to reduce the rate of soil erosion (Cambi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>; Venanzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2019</xref>), for instance, by developing detailed wet-index and terrain mobility maps (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>; Mattila and Tokola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2019</xref>). Additionally, in the last two decades, water quality preservation has been introduced as a relevant factor in the planning of forest operations<index-term id="ITerm58"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> (Keleş and Baskent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>). This is particularly relevant in mountain<index-term id="ITerm59"><term>Mountains</term></index-term> areas where the need to maintain wood production while preserving water quality coexists, maximizing the ecosystem services<index-term id="ITerm60"><term>Ecosystem services</term></index-term> provided by the forest (Ovando and Speich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">The higher complexity of multi-target planning calls for more powerful systems of data interpretation and modeling of forest dynamics. In fact, the more factors and goals are included, the higher will be the effort to develop decision tools. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) techniques, as well as machine learning fuzzy algorithms, are increasingly deployed for such elaborations. The evaluation of the effects of forest operations<index-term id="ITerm61"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> in the forest environment can be even more complex when climate change<index-term id="ITerm62"><term>Climate changes</term></index-term> effect is considered (Keenan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>) with the related nonlinear alterations. On a world scale, climate change<index-term id="ITerm63"><term>Climate changes</term></index-term> is influencing in different ways the operating methods connected to forest harvesting and wood transportation, as well as in the choice of silvicultural addresses and landscape conservation. Consequently, the forest management<index-term id="ITerm64"><term>Forest management</term></index-term> planning, which includes also the planning of forest operations<index-term id="ITerm65"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term>, needs to be supported by more complex approaches with the introduction of nonlinear approaches and heuristic techniques (Bettinger and Boston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). The challenge is to accomplish complex planning, addressing all the risks faced by the forest and all the benefits provided by the same forests such as soil protection, carbon storage, biodiversity<index-term id="ITerm66"><term>Biodiversity</term></index-term>, water supply, and non-wood forest products (Matthies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sensors<index-term id="ITerm67"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> on Forest Machines<index-term id="ITerm68"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term></title><p id="Par54">The appropriate<index-term id="ITerm69"><term>Sensors</term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm70"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> implementation of the forest operation<index-term id="ITerm71"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> plans based on the FI (or the VF) requires logging machinery or forest teams equipped with geopositioning sensors<index-term id="ITerm72"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> (at least) and an appropriate interface with the FI (Holopainen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>). This is even more important when there is an upgrade to the virtual forest and its larger content of digital information. Most modern machines, such as harvesters and forwarders, can already benefit from a digital FI, for instance, with a better organization of harvesting of marked trees or forwarding piled logs along predefined paths. This is possible<index-term id="ITerm73"><term>Sensors</term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm74"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> thanks to the presence onboard of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, which provide sufficient accuracy on flat terrain, particularly on areas with limited vegetation cover, such as clear-cuts (Valbuena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2012</xref>). Digital FIs at present are generally deployed to guide machines through optimal paths to follow. These are elaborated according to predefined criteria, such as minimum cost, minimum impact on soil or standing trees, or a compromise among these (Piragnolo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2019</xref>). In optimal cases, where geopositioning is highly reliable and accurate, this application can be stretched to the level of a single tree to cut, implementing a virtual tree marking performed directly on the digital inventory.</p><p id="Par55">This information can be further refined with the information of the exact position of the processing head or the logs grapple (boom’s tip) with respect to the machine, leading in optimal conditions to a sub-metric precision in recording the position of the standing tree or the pile of logs (Lindroos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>). These machines can also feed the virtual forest with additional data collected by the onboard sensors<index-term id="ITerm75"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>. At present, the parameters measured are the diameters and length of the logs produced by the harvester: values needed to calculate the felled and processed volume (Eriksson and Lindroos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). These are generally used for invoicing timber produced and delivered but can also provide a detailed insight of the quantity of roundwood produced in the harvested plot (Rossit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2019</xref>) and draw a balance between net annual increment and harvesting of a given forested area. Furthermore, by segregating the assortments, at least in main classes (e.g., pulp-wood vs. industrial timber), it is possible to estimate several characteristics of the harvested trees (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2018</xref>) and, possibly in the near future, even to develop forest yield maps (Olivera and Visser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">An additional sensor<index-term id="ITerm76"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>, which is increasingly installed on forest machines<index-term id="ITerm77"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term>, is the timber crane weighing load cell.

These factors, together with the presence of mud, dust, or resins and with the very variable conditions of natural illumination, may challenge readability of ID codes in the case of visual systems. Additionally, the tracking service should be based on unique codes (physical ID number) linked with an ID code stored in a database, allowing it to retrieve the attributes associated with each timber item.

This technology requires visual connection for code acquisition with smartphones or portable devices, and effective reading can be hindered by inappropriate light conditions or presence of mud and dirt on the barcode. Furthermore, tags can be removed or damaged during handling and transport operations. This last inconvenience can be overcome printing the barcode directly on the wood surface. Spraying ID codes on wood boards is a common tracking system in industrial sawmills and has been successfully tested in forest operations<index-term id="ITerm106"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> by installing spray nozzles on the chain saw bar of a processor head (Möller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>). This solution allows to mark the crosscut section of each log with a special barcode while processing and without productivity losses (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">9.5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">9.6</xref>). Clearly, the system has several challenges, among which is the readability of a code printed on the relatively rough surface of a log crosscut with chain saw. Readability can be improved with the addition of microtaggants. These are microscopic particles to be mixed with the paint used for spraying. Being composed by different layers artificially designed, microtaggants provide a unique numeric code (visible with microscopic analysis), which prevents falsification and that may include materials that enhance readability when exposed to UV or laser light sources.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 9.5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>On the left, logs recently hauled marked with plastic tags (orange).

The system, called Woodpecker, is constituted by 12 hammer brands, which are punched into the wood by the harvester head. The hammers can independently rotate, and each position represents an alphanumeric value, generating a unique 12-digit code that identifies the timber item, assigning it an ID that allows retrieving its attributes in the associated database. The marks are impressed in the butt end of the log and can be read with optical technology and software elaboration at the sawmilling facility (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">9.7</xref>). Also, this technology has been tested successfully on processor heads, leading to a fast and effective tagging of logs.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 9.7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The coded brands punched in the solid wood on the left carry an information carried as a unique ID for the log as simplified on the center and right.

This technology is based on the identification of the unique characteristics of each log end section (or crosscut section), identified through the analysis of digital images. The system is better suited for industrial, indoor applications due to the more controlled reading conditions (stable light, fixed angle, and distance of reading), but the implementation on processor heads has been conceived in order to secure a tracking service of single logs from the stump to the mill (Schraml et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2015</xref>). Biometric fingerprinting requires high-quality images of the log ends to discriminate logs. Common cameras providing images in the visible spectra can be deployed, but sensors<index-term id="ITerm108"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> operating in the hyperspectral and NIRs proved more effective (Schraml et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2020</xref>). Clearly, the file size of images would be too large to transfer it from the forest to a server and store it in a large database (e.g., storing data for all the logs produced annually by a company). The first elaboration can identify the key identity characteristics of the log end and store the information in much lighter vector files, which can be effectively transferred in a reference database (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">9.8</xref>). Deployment of biometrics from stump to mill would provide useful data for the industry, for instance, sorting early in the supply chain the timber assortments, but with slight adjustments of the image analysis software, it would also provide relevant CSF information regarding health and development of the felled trees. Biometric fingerprinting technology is not yet at a commercial stage, but its fast development is expected to soon open a wide range of applications and services to the timber supply chain, forest management<index-term id="ITerm109"><term>Forest management</term></index-term>, and CSF.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 9.8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Biometrics fingerprinting is based on the elaboration of visible and measurable characteristics of the log end, compressed in vector-format information.

A typical RFID system is based on a reader connected to one or more antennas emitting an interrogating signal. The signal is received by tags attached to the item. Tags consist of a transponder and a chip and can be active (with an inner power source) or passive. The latter requires the energy provided by the interrogating wave to return a signal. By EPC standard, the signal returns the identity of the tag, stored in the 12-byte memory of the chip. Disposable, passive RFID tags are preferred in timber supply chains due to their low unitary cost, even if they can store less memory and feature a lower reading distance compared to active tags (Björk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>). RFID can operate at different frequencies, ranging from low (LF), high (HF), to ultrahigh (UHF). The latter allows effective reading ranges of several meters in operative conditions with passive tags (Tzoulis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2014</xref>; Kaakkurivaara and Kaakkurivaara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>). RFID tags had been successfully used to transfer throughout the sequence of forest operations<index-term id="ITerm110"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> the valuable information provided by inventory data elaboration, such as bucking instructions for maximum value recovery (Picchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par86">Among the main advantages of RFID tags in forestry applications, there is the possibility to perform fast and effective bulk reading (e.g., a whole truckload passing through a mill’s gate). Furthermore, they can be used both to mark standing trees (Picchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>) and processed logs. Therefore, RFID technology can provide a complete service of timber traceability, which may be a powerful tool in the frame of a chain of custody service, guaranteeing the sustainable production of timber products from the forest to the sawmill and up to the end user (Appelhanz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par87">Regarding the drawbacks, currently (year 2020) the unitary cost of disposable UHF-RFID tags is relatively high.

Furthermore, mills could be unenthusiastic to deal with tags made of plastic and metal, even if their overall mass is about 1 g. A possible solution could be the use of pulp-neutral material for the shell and radio-reflecting ink for the transponder, even if this would surely increase the cost of tags and probably reduce their performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9.9</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">9.2</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par88">Pros<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par89">Automatic reading at high distances (3–5 m) of single tags or groups</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par90">Reading not limited by presence of mud, dirt, or obscurity (Picchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par91">Possibility to manually or automatically tag standing trees and logs</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par92">Cons<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par93">Unitary cost of tags may not be justified in case of low-value assortments.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par94">Disposable tags may be not accepted by end users of timber.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9.9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>On the left, an UHF RFID tag used to mark a standing tree, on the right an UHF RFID applied by the processor head after crosscutting</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/486887_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.jpg" id="MO9"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 9.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Suitability of tracking technologies to applications in forestry and timber supply chains</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Technology</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>Item marked</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>Application method</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>Automatic info retrieval</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Reading range</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Readable with mud/dirt</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Resistant to hauling</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Quantity of stored data</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>Standing trees</p></th><th><p>logs</p></th><th><p>Manual</p></th><th><p>Auto</p></th><th><p>Forest</p></th><th><p>Yard/mill</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Log brands (hammer)</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Colors</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Barcodes-QR tags</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Auto-barcoding</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++++</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Punching</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++++</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Biometrics</p></td><td><p>−</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>RFID</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Timber Industry as a Source of Data for CSF</title><p id="Par95">As mentioned in the previous section, the availability of a reliable tracking service discloses several new opportunities in timber supply chains. Among the most promising applications can be found the synergy between tracking technology and timber grading systems based on fast and nondestructive sensors<index-term id="ITerm111"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>. At present, these sensors<index-term id="ITerm112"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> find little application in forest operations<index-term id="ITerm113"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term>: timber assortments can be sorted with machine support (e.g., using the StanForD data and dedicated software in the harvest machine), but quality grading of the logs is performed only visually. Nevertheless, this is a costly and time-demanding operation, which is potentially biased by the subjective judgment of the expert evaluator.</p><p id="Par96">Once in the industry, a large set of sensors<index-term id="ITerm114"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> is used to precisely quantify the volume of the logs delivered and its quality. Additionally, an increasing number of sensors<index-term id="ITerm115"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> or analytical techniques are used to optimize the following steps of product transformation in the sawmill or pulp mill. According to Gergel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>), the sawmilling optimization made possible by a detailed knowledge of the properties and defects of single logs leads to an increased value recovery of 15% and 23%, respectively, for conifer and broadleaf timber. The same authors also highlighted how the status and quality of the standing trees prior to harvest plays a role of the utmost importance in the efficiency and economic balance of the timber supply chain. Nevertheless, in real practice, just empirical sorting models<index-term id="ITerm116"><term>Models</term></index-term> are used for inventorying trees according to their economic value. These return the share of predefined timber assortments with an intrinsic inaccuracy due to the impossibility of detecting internal wood defects from external features. A wide range of sensors<index-term id="ITerm117"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> could contribute to provide this service early in the supply chain. Their potential is maximum when different sensors<index-term id="ITerm118"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> work in synergy, contributing to generate a wide and comprehensive picture of the timber quality, for instance, integrating stem shape characteristics as returned by a TLS system (e.g., taper, straightness, crown insertion, etc.) with internal properties as detected by optical sensors<index-term id="ITerm119"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> on the felled trees (e.g., rot, decay, eccentricity, etc.). In the short term, the fusion of such data provides a more detailed definition of quality of single logs. In the long term, optically sensed characteristics may be used to tune the models<index-term id="ITerm120"><term>Models</term></index-term> interpreting 3D data provided by laser technology, gradually but constantly decreasing the gap between estimated properties and actual characteristics of the assortments. The very same data and approach can also disclose the “memory” of timber, being this the result of the growing conditions that the tree endured along its life. Widening the scope of the data analysis and the inputs of the models<index-term id="ITerm121"><term>Models</term></index-term>, it will be possible to support CSF studies and forecasts by relating the captured wood characteristics with the physiology of the trees and their response to the past stresses<index-term id="ITerm122"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>.</p><p id="Par97">A recent trend in timber characterization is to deploy sensors<index-term id="ITerm123"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> as early as possible in the timber supply chain. Although application of timber quality gauges in forest machinery is mostly at the experimental stage, it arises great interest from the industry, since quality determination early in the supply chain would allow a great reduction of procurement costs by delivering just the desired quality to each end user, optimizing the logistics and further increasing the profitability of the industrial transformation. At the same time, the application of sensors<index-term id="ITerm124"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> for timber quality along the timber production process would bring additional benefits also to CSF applications, providing more data and with higher level of detail.</p><p id="Par98">In addition to UAVs, forest technologies for monitoring tree processes include sensor<index-term id="ITerm125"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> networks deployed on the tree stems or embedded in the soil layers. The proliferation of these technologies generates a flow of data, which needs to be appropriately investigated through machine learning for automating or responding to disturbance events. The digitalization of forest stands allows forests to operate as technological platforms so that trees function as technical instruments informed by data that are meant to enable precision forestry and practices oriented toward high timber quality.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Wood Properties Relevant for CSF</title><p id="Par99">The industrial conversion of timber highly relies on the intrinsic characteristics and technical properties of this resource, which may be advantageous (or not) depending on the downstream process applied.

Perfect wood corresponds to the cylinder with a pith positioned in its geometrical center and containing regular concentric structures corresponding to yearly rings. In practice, perfect wood does not exist and always includes some defects. Here, the “defect” is considered as an undesired imperfection of the regular wood tissues that is a result of diverse stresses<index-term id="ITerm127"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> and factors affecting tree growth<index-term id="ITerm128"><term>Tree growth</term></index-term> and the morphological constitution of the plant. Such natural features may be highly undesirable, downgrading the industrial value of timber. An example could be a knot that is an imprint of the branch positioned in the trunk. Branches cause the presence of knots that deviate the fiber direction, having a tremendous effect on the mechanical properties of timber, as well as tree stability.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Tree-Ring Structure</title><p id="Par101">In temperate forests, the life of trees covers a sequence of several seasons that are recorded in the tree rings. These are structural wood tissues of different properties in spring/summer (early wood) or autumn/winter (late wood). The ring width, its chemical composition, microfibril structure, as well as the ratio of late to early woods may vary, depending on the age of tree, meteorological history, or presence of diverse factors stimulating or inhibiting the tree growth<index-term id="ITerm129"><term>Tree growth</term></index-term>. The natural yearly sequence of air temperature, solar light photoperiod, as well as water stress<index-term id="ITerm130"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> levels are expressed as the dynamical changes of the phenological events determining specific xylogenetic sequences. Therefore, the tree-ring structure may be considered as a “fingerprint” unique for each plant. This can be used for dating of wood (dendrochronology), determination of the wood origin (dendro-provenance), analysis of the local climate changes<index-term id="ITerm131"><term>Climate changes</term></index-term> (dendro-climatology), or identification of catastrophic events, occurring during the life span of the tree, among others.

For that reason, the amount of available information was relatively limited. However, several modern technologies, especially based on the tomography approach (Van den Bulcke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2014</xref>), allow mapping of the tree-ring structure without necessity for its cutting or extracting samples. Mobile X-ray computed tomography technology was applied in wood density measurements and moisture content monitoring on standing trees (Raschi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1995</xref>; Tognetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">1996</xref>). Computer 3D tomography allows locating internal log features that include pith, sapwood, heartwood, knots, and other defects. With the appropriate techniques, it can also return a detailed analysis and densitometry of annual growth rings (Van den Bulcke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2014</xref>). Additionally, spectroscopic methods as well as its evolution by means of hyperspectral imaging (Sandak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2020</xref>; Schraml et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2020</xref>) provide a possibility for extraction of till-now not accessible information regarding chemical and physical properties of wood resolved spatially to the tree-ring level.</p><p id="Par103">Nevertheless, from a technical perspective, it is crucial that both the quality of the acquired images and the capacity of the interpretation software provide sufficient information regarding tree rings of the logs (Subah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2017</xref>; Cruz-García et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>). The sensors<index-term id="ITerm134"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> installed on the processor head and operating in the forest on unprepared surfaces (the chain saw cutting surface is relatively rough for this use) may be incapable of returning the required quality for a deep and reliable analysis. On the other hand, they would potentially provide a large dataset, based on all the logs produced in the forest, including those with defects. This contraposes to the higher potential of industrial timber analysis, where more powerful sensors<index-term id="ITerm135"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>, deployed in a controlled environment, can provide extremely detailed data. Once set up, an automated tree-ring analysis, linked with an effective traceability system, would provide a very large volume of data. Such information may prove extremely valuable for understanding the past dynamics of relatively large areas of forests or to refine and better elaborate the information provided by dendrometers<index-term id="ITerm136"><term>Dendrometers</term></index-term> installed in monitoring plots (Cruz-García et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>). For instance, the availability of a large dataset reporting growth pattern of trees of the same species growing in different areas allows to better understand the seasonal and site-specific growth response to drought (Mina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2016</xref>) or human-driven factors, such as pollution (Innes and Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1989</xref>) or wildfires (Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2017</xref>). This information can be further elaborated, helping to understand the response to stress<index-term id="ITerm137"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> of forests with different characteristics, such as density (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>) and elaborate guidelines for CSF implementation. Although measurements of stem growth characteristics in temporal detail (e.g., radial increment, slow vs. fast growing trees) are important to understand wood properties, these properties change during wood formation in response to changing environmental conditions. Indeed, vessel conduit dimensions, cell wall thickness, and the relative proportions of different xylem cell types vary during the growing season. Changes in stem size detected through dendrometers<index-term id="ITerm138"><term>Dendrometers</term></index-term> can be associated with tree water status (Zweifel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2007</xref>), with daily fluctuations being related to physiological parameters (e.g., leaf water potential, whole plant transpiration) and environmental conditions (e.g., evaporative demand and air temperature) (Giovannelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Tognetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2009</xref>). These stem radius changes provide a sensitive indicator of the combined effects of actual radial growth and stem water storage and release (Drew and Downes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). Stem size variation provides indications of water stress<index-term id="ITerm139"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> thresholds in tree species and is potentially useful in threshold analysis for binary classification and determining the influence of thermal or moisture cycles on elastic shrinkage (Cocozza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). Coding of the dendrometer<index-term id="ITerm140"><term>Dendrometers</term></index-term> signal helps quantify stem (or log) sensitivity to environmental fluctuations (moisture, temperature), as well as synchronize time series related to wood properties and climatic events, and to identify time lags of environmental effects on wood traits (Cocozza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par104">Ideally, the study of tree reactions to stresses<index-term id="ITerm141"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> should be based on the analysis of tree-ring development of trunk sections located at different heights. In fact, while the common dendrochronology focuses on basal sections, where all the rings are represented (since the early development of the tree), in physiology studies, the rings grown higher in the tree’s crown may better describe the stresses<index-term id="ITerm142"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> suffered by the plant. For instance, in the case of <italic>Picea abies</italic> growing in the Alps, the phloem’s growth at the base of the trunk is completed already in July, while at higher levels of the tree, it keeps growing for the whole summer. Thus, the rings developed higher on the stem provide more effective evidence of the growing conditions of the mid-late growing season. If the tracking system records the order of production of each log, their original position in the trunk can be located and the sawmill’s data (e.g., tomography) can be related to sections corresponding to different heights of the tree.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Timber Density</title><p id="Par105">Density of wood (or specific gravity) is a metaparameter determining several technical characteristics of natural resources, considered as the most relevant wood quality descriptor (Zobel and Jett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1995</xref>). It expresses the amount of wood substance contained in a given volume. Even if density is not directly affecting wood properties (it is a property quantifier), it is highly correlated to the majority of wood assets (chemical, physical and mechanical), the yield of production, and the overall “wood quality” in general. The density distribution differs within a single plant, both along the tree height and the trunk diameter. Despite being a property of remarkably high native variance and heritability, it can be related at stand level to growth conditions or silvicultural interventions (Briggs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>), thus providing valuable information if appropriate reference values can be defined. Density is often measured in sawmill, but the interest to discriminate the timber products with the desired properties as early as possible within the supply chain stimulated the development of portable instruments. These can be deployed both for assessing the characteristics of standing trees (Paradis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013</xref>) and for automatically measuring each log with gauges installed directly in the processor head (Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2014a</xref>).</p><p id="Par106">The effect of tree-ring width on tree-ring wood density depends on the species (conifers vs. broadleaves, fast- vs. slow-growing species), the timing of climatic events influencing growth throughout the growing season and the general fertility of the site. In particular, intra- and interspecific interactions may affect the radial growth and wood density of individual species growing in mixture when compared to its monoculture (Zeller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2017</xref>). The acoustic sensing technology, such as the modulus of elasticity of wood (MOE) and the dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd), allows the estimation of intrinsic wood properties for standing trees, stems, and logs. These parameters depend on wood density and are fundamental for the evaluation of wood quality, providing information related to wood anatomy and tree physiology (Russo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Chemical Composition of Wood</title><p id="Par107">From the chemical viewpoint, wood is a natural composite of three biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. These are major constitutive chemical components, with their specific ratio varying between wood species, forest types, and within individual trees. In temperate areas, the chemical composition differs substantially along the tree height and its radius following the natural lifetime sequence of the periods when the tree grows fast (spring) or forms more mechanically resistant morphological structures (autumn). The variation of chemical composition can also be noticed at the level of the yearly ring that reflects the combined effects of the season and plant development stage as well as any other stresses<index-term id="ITerm143"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> for the tree due to biotic or abiotic factors. In addition to cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose, small amounts of minerals and extractive components are present in natural wood. The latter are particularly relevant despite their low concentrations. In fact, extractives may significantly affect the suitability of wood resources for a given conversion process or affect the durability of wood-derived products.</p><p id="Par108">All the chemical components form larger macromolecules, such as microfibrils, that are combined at different scales as fibrils, cells, and yearly rings constituting a hierarchical structure. The specific physical properties of wood are, therefore, highly dependent on the scale of observation (nano, micro, macro). It implies the necessity for adjusting measurement procedures and instrumentation for determination of desired chemical/physical characteristics and material properties. Such information has not yet been used for CSF applications. This is probably due to the cost and time delay of wet chemistry analysis. The availability of fast and nondestructive sensors<index-term id="ITerm144"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>, such as hyperspectral cameras, may disclose a new source of information to understand the health and growing conditions of trees.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Wood Defects</title><p id="Par109">In contrast to the perfect wood, the real trunk contains diverse imperfections recording all the lifelong-related growth conditions, perturbations, or stresses<index-term id="ITerm145"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>. In the timber industry, these are defined as wood defects and may include numerous features differentiating defected from the perfect wood (Kimbar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>). The European standard EN 1927-1:2008 provides a systematic methodology for identification and quantification of the log/wood defects that are later used for determination of the quality class. The following sections report the most relevant defects from the perspective of CSF.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Resin Pockets</title><p id="Par110">Resin pockets are small gaps within the structure of the xylem filled with resin. Wood development due to tree growth<index-term id="ITerm146"><term>Tree growth</term></index-term> usually occludes them within a few years after their formation. Resin pockets are a significant technological defect for the timber industry, particularly for joinery and furniture applications, due to the release of resin over time from the finished products. Resin pockets are common in conifers with resin canals (such as <italic>Picea</italic>, <italic>Pinus</italic>, <italic>Larix</italic>, and <italic>Pseudotsuga</italic> genera) but may also be the consequence of stress<index-term id="ITerm147"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>. In the latter case, they are commonly related to animal or insect attacks, sites exposed to strong winds and storm damages. Research demonstrated that water stress<index-term id="ITerm148"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> is to be regarded as the most relevant factor leading to the development of this wood defect (Seifert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2010</xref>; Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>), although other factors, such as excessive growth rate or share of defect core over total diameters at breast height (DBH), may contribute to pocket formation (Woollons et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2008</xref>). Availability of data on resin pockets may be a useful tool for identifying historical occurrence of water stress<index-term id="ITerm149"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>, areas with frequent wind gusts, and, possibly, the impact of forest management<index-term id="ITerm150"><term>Forest management</term></index-term> on certain growing conditions. Clearly, the interpretation of resin pocket presence is much more significant if associated with other parameters detected by the sensors<index-term id="ITerm151"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> on processed and sawn timber, namely, tree-ring development. Furthermore, tree rings are present throughout the whole trunk, but their size increases from the base upward and from the core outward (Gjerdrum and Bernabei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>). Thus, for a correct interpretation of their occurrence, it is important to know the position in the stem of the timber sample considered. This is possible only with an accurate traceability system capable of relating each log sourced from a tree with each other according to their sequential order.</p><p id="Par111">Like resin pockets, resinous wood is a zone within trunk volume with exceptionally high content of extractive components and resins. It is present only in conifer species with resin channels. The usual causes for resinous wood formation are responses to the microorganism activity (especially parasite fungus) or to the damage of wood induced by mechanical actions. The analogy for self-protection by the resin release in some broadleaves is a gum production that can be triggered by the frost, wound, or microorganism attack.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Cracks</title><p id="Par112">Checks, splits, and shakes (commonly defined as cracks) are separations or ruptures of the wood tissue in the longitudinal plane that normally occur along fibers in the radial or tangential sections of the trunk. These may appear on the cross section of the tree or on the log side circumference. Checks are separations of the fibers that do not extend through the timber from one face to another. Splits, however, extend the material discontinuity from the one log face to another. Shakes are separations or weaknesses of fiber bond, between or through the annual rings. There are diverse sources of stresses<index-term id="ITerm152"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> occurring to wood during life cycle. The most relevant are growth and drying stresses<index-term id="ITerm153"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>, beside thermal, frost, wind-, solar-, or lightning-induced tensions. Shakes may originate from causes other than drying stresses<index-term id="ITerm154"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>, e.g., from careless felling, where internal stresses<index-term id="ITerm155"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> existing in the living tree are released when the tree is felled. Checks, shakes, and splits are present although they may not be visible (closed checks and closed splits). Cracks may close up if the dry timber is subsequently exposed to damp conditions, but once the fibers have separated, they cannot join together again. A great threat for the tree after a crack occurring is elevated risk of decay fungi spore access to the unprotected wood tissue. The presence of cracks is an important limitation for the downstream conversion, especially if combined with other defects, such as spiral grain. Due to specific properties, cracks are relatively easily detectable even if not visible on the surface of log. This is due to the discontinuity of the material and related change of the material stiffness (natural frequency) or elasticity (stress<index-term id="ITerm156"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> wave propagation velocity).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Reaction Wood</title><p id="Par113">Reaction wood is a type of defect that tends to form in trees growing in a leaning posture. This may be caused by exposure to strong winds or because the tree grows on a slope. Reaction wood in coniferous trees is formed on the lower side of the lean and is called “compression wood.” It is often characterized by a dense hard brittle grain that contains very high content of lignin that increases wood resistance for compression. On the contrary, the broadleaves create reaction wood referred to as “tension wood” that is positioned on the upper side of the lean. It contains higher content of cellulose that increases wood resistance to tension stresses<index-term id="ITerm157"><term>Stresses</term></index-term>. Properties of compression wood are considerably different from those of normal mature wood. Compression wood tracheids, for example, are about 30% shorter than normal. In addition, compression wood contains about 10% less cellulose and 8–9% more lignin and hemicelluloses than in normal wood. These factors reduce the desirability of compression wood for pulp and paper manufacture. It is also less suitable as sawn timber since it shows a lower strength, stiffness, and dimensional stability, resulting in a decrease in yield of high-quality end products.</p><p id="Par114">Data related to reaction wood can be a particularly useful tool in the frame of CSF in mountain<index-term id="ITerm158"><term>Mountains</term></index-term> areas, as it records specific reaction of trees to environmental conditions. According to Łszczyńska et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>), data regarding the frequency and characteristics of reaction wood in forested plots may be used to assess the landslide hazard risk. In fact, in case of slight land movements, trees are tilted causing leaning and thus the formation of reaction wood. The same phenomena also lead to the formation of eccentric piths, which can be detected by tree-ring analysis. The vertical stability of a tree can be assessed using an automatic accelerometer (gyroscopic sensor<index-term id="ITerm159"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>), which measures the position and oscillation in three axes (Matasov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>), therefore, providing useful information on the effect of wind exposure on the tree aerial architecture and species-specific biomechanics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Rot</title><p id="Par115">Fungi decay is considered as the most problematic biological threat degrading wood at all stages of its life cycle, including postharvesting. Due to its chemical composition, wood is an optimal source of nutrition for fungi and, therefore, it will be a subject of extensive degradation whenever favorable conditions for growth of fungi occur. These include temperature ranges from 20 to 30 °C with a wood moisture content ranging from 20 to 50%. Diverse species of decaying fungi are specialized in degradation of specific wood polymers resulting in different degradation results. This led to the classification of fungi into three major groups: white rot, brown rot, and grey rot. The fungi spores may access wood by several ways, including root, broken branch, damaged leader, or scar on the stem. Cracks, wounds, or any other exposed surfaces of the wood. The presence of birds nesting in hollows in the tree is a certain sign of the progressing decay deterioration. Rot is the wood defect for which the quality grade reduction is obligatory. Logs cut out from older trees are more likely to contain developed rot. The final stage of rot is a complete or extensive material loss forming internal cavities. Plants have developed several mechanisms to defend themselves against decaying fungi. For instance, diverse chemical substances synthetized by trees are natural biocides, such as tannins, resins, or gum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Knots</title><p id="Par116">A knot in the tree is the portion of a branch or limb that has been surrounded by subsequent xylem growth during the tree life. Knots form morphological structures starting from the pith and by following the radial direction reaching the log surface. There are more than 50 types of knots that are classified according to the size, decay presence, and location and distribution within the stem.</p><p id="Par117">The size, type, and distribution of knots have the most important impact on log quality and are the main consideration when applying grading rules. The severity of the grain deflection caused by the knot is correlated with its size. In any case, the presence of knots changes the anatomical structure of surrounding wood (reaction wood presence and grain deviation), as well as its chemical composition (extremely high content of extractive components). The distribution of knots in logs depends on the species and characteristics of the growing site. It is also determined by the growth characteristics of the tree and the tree age. The detailed knowledge regarding knots in trees is highly relevant for CSF. Fortunately, there are several scanning techniques for automatic detection and classification of knots that are implemented during forest operations<index-term id="ITerm160"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term>, log sorting/grading, as well as downstream conversion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Shape Imperfections</title><p id="Par118">Any deviation of the tree form from the perfect cylinder is considered as a shape imperfection, reducing the yield of product that can be obtained in the sawmill. Sweep, excessive taper, bulges, swell, flanges, and out-of-roundness are some of the most important shape imperfections. All these defects can be measured both on the standing tree and on the processed log by means of laser triangulation scanners, photogrammetry, and TLS. In some cases, imperfections can be reported also by the standard measurement equipment installed on most modern timber processors.</p><p id="Par119"><italic>Sweep</italic> is a bow-like bend in the trunk of a tree diverging the trunk from the straight and vertical theoretical axis of the tree. The presence of sweep is a result of diverse factors, including slope of the terrain, temporary loading due to snow or wind, mechanical damages, or insect activity.</p><p id="Par120"><italic>Tree taper</italic> is defined as the gradual reduction of the log diameter along its length. It is a natural feature of each living tree, even if logs with a high degree of taper are considered as having a poor form. Although taper cannot be eliminated, it is possible to minimize it by means of appropriate silvicultural activities. In fact, the extent of taper depends not only on the tree species, local climate, age of the tree, soil fertility, and terrain irregularity but also on the density of trees within the surrounding forest stand.</p><p id="Par121"><italic>Bulge</italic> is an enlargement of the tree diameter forming a barreling shape. It is a natural feature when occurring at the bottom of the tree, assuming reasonable progress of the diameter changes. On the contrary, when occurring in the higher part of the trunk it is frequently associated with fungi or bacteria attack.</p><p id="Par122"><italic>Canker</italic> is a defected wood in a form of gnarls or volume losses, both attributed to the phytopathological changes triggered by an activity of microorganisms (fungi or bacteria). In contrast to swollen wood, the tissue of the canker is abnormal and sick.</p><p id="Par123"><italic>Out-of-roundness</italic> is a shape imperfection appearing as an elliptical cross section of the log. It is frequently associated with the eccentric or double pith. The usual consequence of the pith shift is the presence of reaction (tension or compression) wood. Another reason for the out-of-roundness is the partial damage of the cambium due to mechanical or phytopathological injury.</p><p id="Par124">Such stem defects can be related to the influence of various environmental factors, supporting CSF studies to better understand tree growth<index-term id="ITerm161"><term>Tree growth</term></index-term> dynamics. According to Schneider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2018</xref>), the hydraulic and biomechanic theories are the most widely used. Both theories underline the importance of crown dimensions in determining tree form, as confirmed by Kidombo and Dean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>). Yet, climatic variables such as total summer precipitation and mean winter temperature may have a higher influence on tree taper than the average wind speed (Schneider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2018</xref>). This underlines that the complex tree growth<index-term id="ITerm162"><term>Tree growth</term></index-term> dynamics require a holistic analysis of all climatic factors and physiological processes to understand stem formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sensors<index-term id="ITerm163"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> for Timber Quality Assessment</title><p id="Par125">Once the timber reaches the mill, a large array of possible sensors<index-term id="ITerm164"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> can be deployed to analyze the quality and volume of the logs to be processed. There are several technical solutions available for wood defects detection or quality grading of logs. Some of the most compatible with CSF requirements are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10</xref>.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 9.10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Selected sensing techniques used for assessment of log characterization during forest operations<index-term id="ITerm165"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> and log sorting in sawmill: (<bold>a</bold>) measurement of lengths with rotary encoder, (<bold>b</bold>) measurement of the log diameters profile by two encoders integrated with debranching knives, (<bold>c</bold>) measurement of the log diameter with light curtain, (<bold>d</bold>) 3D log surface scanning with laser triangulation system, (<bold>e</bold>) determination of the X-ray attenuation for internal defects detection of density profiling, (<bold>f</bold>) measurement of mechanical properties by assessment of cutting forces when cross cutting logs with chain saw, (<bold>g</bold>) modulus of elasticity assessment by stress<index-term id="ITerm166"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> wave velocity, (<bold>h</bold>) free vibrations for determination of modulus of elasticity, (<bold>i</bold>) camera vision system for cross section scanning, analysis of tree rings and fingerprinting of logs for traceability, (<bold>j</bold>) camera vision system for identification of wood defects present on the log side surface, (<bold>k</bold>) computed X-ray tomography for 3D visualization and detection of internal defects</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/486887_1_En_9_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par126">The length of log combined with its diameter is a basic merchantable property. As mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">9.4.2</xref>, all the processors used for trees harvesting and delimbing are equipped with a measurement <italic>wheel and optical encoder</italic> (Mederski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10a</xref>). Sensors<index-term id="ITerm167"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> used for log diameter measurements are usually <italic>absolute encoders</italic> configured as protractors, which are integrated with both delimbing knives and feed rollers and measure these rotation angles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10b</xref>). An advantage of such a measurement system is a possibility for a continuous determination of the diameter change trends along the three when passing the processor head. Combined length and diameter measurements provide not only highly precise information regarding a single log volume but can also quantify taper. Such a measurement approach is capable of fast data acquisition and straightforward integration with a database when converted to StanForD file format.</p><p id="Par127">The <italic>light curtain</italic> is a simple optical measurement system, where the dimensional information regarding the object is determined by illumination (or shadowing) of electronic photodetectors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10c</xref>). It was a very popular solution for the size sorting of logs supplied to the sawmill. However, nowadays it is replaced by the <italic>3D laser triangulation systems</italic> relying on the image analysis of the structured light profiles (usually laser) that appear as deformed when observed from an angle (Siekański et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2019</xref>). The advanced analysis of the surface texture allows identification of some wood defects appearing as particular textures of the bark.</p><p id="Par128">Implementation of <italic>X-ray scanners</italic> for monitoring of logs is the industrial solution for detection of the majority of wood defects not visible on the log surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10d</xref>). It allows for identification of deviations of the wood properties along the log, without the possibility to localize the depth position of each feature. For that reason, this setup is frequently duplicated to provide a possibility for better recognition of the defect location within the log section. The ultimate solution for the X-ray imaging of logs is <italic>X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10k</xref>). This technology allows straightforward detection and mapping of internal defects, such as butt decay, voids, cracks, or inclusions. The resolution of images allows dendrometric analysis of tree rings and other refined measurements (Van den Bulcke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2014</xref>; Stängle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2015</xref>; Rais et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017</xref>; Gergel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>). Appropriate data analysis may allow for the information collected on the logs to be related back and integrated with the information on the original tree. An example of this application is provided by Stängle et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2014</xref>), which compared data from TLS stem and branch scar analysis with X-ray computed tomography (CT), and Uner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2009</xref>) using X-ray CT to highlight the effect of thinning on timber density. Thanks to the presence of several X-ray CT operatives in sawmills around the globe, and to their high-speed analysis (up to 180 m/min), this technology is a highly promising data source for CSF applications.</p><p id="Par129">As in the case of drilling resistance, it is possible to indirectly assess mechanical strength of wood by measuring cutting forces occurring when crosscutting logs with a chain saw (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10f</xref>). This can be implemented by integrating <italic>load cells</italic> with the cutting unit or by measuring other effects, such as electrical power consumption or <italic>oil pressure changes in the hydraulic circuit</italic> of the saw motor (Sandak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2019</xref>). Another possibility for adopting cutting resistance analysis for log characterization is to measure the forces required for delimbing. It is clear that a healthy and big branch results in much higher cutting resistance than delimbing of the small and dry branch. In any case, value obtained for a chain saw or delimbing knife can be considered only as an estimate and indirect quantification of the wood suitability; however, it is useful to identify some critical wood defects, such as decay or butt rot.</p><p id="Par130"><italic>Stress</italic><index-term id="ITerm168"><term>Stresses</term></index-term><italic>wave propagation velocity</italic> is a highly useful tool for identification of the stiffness and modulus of elasticity (Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2014b</xref>) of logs derived from harvested trees (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10g</xref>). In that case, the sensor<index-term id="ITerm169"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> can be installed directly on the processor head and perform analysis before a crosscutting operation. A similar approach is used for determination of the mechanical properties of logs by measuring these <italic>natural frequencies</italic>. In that case, the log is induced to vibrate by an impact, and the vibrational or acoustic response is measured with specific detectors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9.10h</xref>).

However, there are several promising techniques with great potential for migration from the laboratory testing into practical applications both in forest and in timber transformation industries. Some examples of the most suited for the CSF are briefly described below.</p><p id="Par133"><italic>Spectroscopy</italic>, including visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared ranges is an analytical technique quantifying interaction of the electromagnetic radiation (light) with the matter. The light can be scattered, absorbed, transmitted, reflected, or trans-flected from the measured surface. The specific pattern of that interaction is recorded as a spectrum. Light absorbance, especially in the infrared range, is highly related to the chemical composition (functional groups with dipole momentum) of the sample. Therefore, by assessing light spectra reflected from the wood sample, it is possible to determine its chemical composition and some physical properties. An extensive reference dataset and advanced multivariate data analysis are indispensable to assure the high reliability of prediction models<index-term id="ITerm170"><term>Models</term></index-term> (Sandak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016b</xref>). However, if properly calibrated, spectroscopic evaluation of wood can provide a rapid and very low-cost assessment of a broad range of the properties, including species, provenance, chemical composition, physical properties, or suitability for diverse conversion paths (Sandak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>). Portable NIR spectrometers even allow scanning of standing trees or fallen logs directly in forest (Sandak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2016a</xref>).</p><p id="Par134">An evolution of the spectroscopy toward a space resolved map of spectra is implemented as <italic>multispectral</italic> or <italic>hyperspectral imaging</italic>. The difference between both is in the number of spectral bands constituting the spectrum, that is, &lt;10 in the case of multispectral imaging. This technology allows rapid mapping of the chemical properties of the material over the object surface (Thumm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2010</xref>). There are several properties of wood that can be assessed with the help of this technique, such as moisture content, chemical anisotropy of the constitutive polymers at diverse heights of trees (Meder and Meglen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012</xref>), and fiber angle direction (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>), among others. The limitation of hyperspectral imaging is relatively high investment cost, fragility of the optical instruments when integrating with forest operations<index-term id="ITerm171"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term>, and very high amount of generated data that requires refined IT systems and algorithms.</p><p id="Par135">Only a few wood scanning techniques allow scanning of the bulk interior. In contrast to harmful ionizing radiation of X- and gamma rays, microwaves are considered as safe and easy to apply in the scanning systems. A great advantage is that, assuming sufficient power of emitter, microwaves penetrate wood bulk, and these interactions with the matter can be interpreted as attenuation, phase shift, or polarity change. These wave properties are directly correlated to the wood density, wood moisture content, and grain angle direction (Schajer and Orhan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2005</xref>). For that reason, it is possible to simultaneously measure all the above wood properties. <italic>Microwave scanners</italic> can be implemented as an array that, in consequence, allows spatially resolved maps of wood assets (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">9.3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 9.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of sensor<index-term id="ITerm172"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> technologies to determine tree/timber characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th rowspan="2"><p>Tree dimensions</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Tree-ring structure</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Timber density</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Chemical composition</p></th><th colspan="7"><p>Wood defects</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>Resin pockets</p></th><th><p>Cracks</p></th><th><p>Reaction wood</p></th><th><p>Rot</p></th><th><p>Knots</p></th><th><p>Shape imperfections</p></th><th><p>Mechanical damages</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Dimension measurement</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>+++</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Satellite and drone imaging</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Terrestrial LiDAR</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Vision systems and photogrammetry</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Light curtain</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>3D laser triangulation systems</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>X-ray scanner</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CT scanner</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td/><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stress<index-term id="ITerm173"><term>Stresses</term></index-term> wave propagation velocity</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Natural vibrational frequencies</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Acoustic tomography</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Electrical resistivity tomography</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Stiffness of the standing tree</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Cutting forces</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Drilling resistance</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Spectroscopy</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hyperspectral imaging</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td><p>+++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Microwaves</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Intelligent Forest Machines<index-term id="ITerm174"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term>, the Way Ahead</title><p id="Par136">As described in the previous sections of this chapter, the availability of digital forest data makes it possible to optimize forest works from the operational cost and environmental impact point of view. Traceability tools further increase the precision of the operations and guarantee a full control of the woody products, whose value is effectively assessed and maximized by an array of sensors<index-term id="ITerm175"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> deployed in the mills. From the management (and CSF) point of view, the most effective solution is to link the databases of the forest inventories and the derived tracking systems with the log scanners operating at the sawmill. Nevertheless, a further significant improvement could be achieved with the determination of timber characteristics early in the supply chain, enhancing the sorting of logs and increasing the overall value of the derived timber products (Taube et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2020</xref>). The fast development of sensors<index-term id="ITerm176"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> makes this challenge possible, as it had been demonstrated by the EU<index-term id="ITerm177"><term>European Union (EU)</term></index-term> project SLOPE (<ext-link xlink:href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/604129" ext-link-type="uri">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/604129</ext-link>), funded under the seventh Framework Program. Within the project, the potential of the Virtual Forest, the tracking systems, and the timber sensors<index-term id="ITerm178"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> had been combined in a technological showcase, proving the feasibility of this concept.</p><p id="Par137">The virtual forest was generated integrating information from satellite, UAVs, and TLS surveying systems, combining macro and local analysis in the characterization of the forest resources in mountain<index-term id="ITerm179"><term>Mountains</term></index-term> areas. Data was stored in a dedicated database provided with a 3D interface, which allowed users to navigate into the virtual forest, estimate the volume, and value of timber in a selected area as well as to plan accordingly the harvest operations by cable yarding (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">9.11</xref>).<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 9.11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>3D visualization of forest (image combined with aerial picture).

A dedicated software matched the shape characteristics of the trees with the timber assortments and locally accepted their value, returning the maximum value recovery conditions. Those were appended in the database as bucking instructions to be transferred from the forest to the processor head. For this purpose, standing trees were georeferenced and marked with RFID UHF tags whose ID was linked to the data and bucking instructions of each tree (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">9.12</xref>).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 9.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Trees felled with motor-manual chain saws are marked with RFID for tracking along the supply chain and for transfer of cutting instructions to the processor head at landing</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/486887_1_En_9_Fig12_HTML.jpg" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par139">All forest operations<index-term id="ITerm180"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> were performed by prototypes of intelligent machines, namely, a cable yarder and a processor head operating at landing.

The optical sensors<index-term id="ITerm185"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> (not installed in the prototype) could identify decay spots and would warn the operator to recalculate the cutting instructions, which were based on the shape of the standing tree. From the point of view of a CSF application of this data, the system provides a further source of information which, when fully integrated with other sensor<index-term id="ITerm186"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> data, adds to the tool kit available for CSF planning and operations. Currently, only the logs with sufficient market value<index-term id="ITerm187"><term>Market value</term></index-term> reach the sawmill and can be further analyzed with industrial sensors<index-term id="ITerm188"><term>Sensors</term></index-term>. However, the presence of sensors<index-term id="ITerm189"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> on the processor head would provide data of lower quality (due to the work conditions), but as this is data from all the trees and logs<index-term id="ITerm190"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> produced in the stand, it is thus more representative of the general health of the trees. Once a track and trace system are fully integrated within the timber supply chain, it is possible to relate the information regarding each standing tree (and the logs produced from it) with the analysis performed in the sawmill.

Martín-Fernández and García-Abril Martín (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2005</xref>) proved that if extensive and high-quality data is available, such planning can be performed at the level of individual trees by means of appropriate algorithms (iterative conditional mode), which otherwise could be applied only on small, intensively managed forest properties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data Management in Timber Production and CSF</title><p id="Par149">As a final consideration, it is important to highlight how an essential aspect of the synergy between forest operations<index-term id="ITerm203"><term>Forest operations</term></index-term> and CSF is the transfer, storage, elaboration, and harmonization of data collected by different sensors<index-term id="ITerm204"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> for different purposes (planning, production, invoicing, monitoring, forecast of health and growth dynamic, etc.). A further level of complexity is given by the perspective and capability of the different players of the supply chain, which produce and use data with different timing, purposes, technical tools, and frequency. This complexity is further increased by the additional target posed by CSF in the hypothesis of creating a unique system of data generation, elaboration, and exchange with a multipurpose vision.</p><p id="Par150">Mortality and weakening control is accomplished by gathering and analyzing data with long-term field plots, where fixed low-cost networks of sensors<index-term id="ITerm205"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> are installed (see Chap. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-80767-2_10" ext-link-type="doi">10</ext-link>; Tognetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR04">2021</xref>). Data can be effectively integrated with nondestructive sensors<index-term id="ITerm206"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> for timber quality, which identify timber quality parameters, such as defects, that can provide useful information regarding the health state of forests. In this sense, sensors<index-term id="ITerm207"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> installed on forest machines<index-term id="ITerm208"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> may bring a more valuable contribution than sawmill equipment in spite of the unavoidable lower precision. In fact, only quality timber is delivered to industrial users and analyzers. On the contrary, machine-based sensors<index-term id="ITerm209"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> are used to discriminate the logs among the supply chains of industrial timber, pulp, and biomass. Even if more detailed control will be dedicated to high-quality material, data must be generated for the selection of different classes, thus providing also valuable information regarding health parameters (rot, rings development, resistance wood, wood density, etc.).</p><p id="Par151">A prerequisite for allowing applications and systems to communicate with each other in an agile and flexible way is the interoperability between systems and interfaces used. For this purpose, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and ISO created a web service interface standard for publishing, accessing, and visualizing spatiotemporal information (de la Beaujardiere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>). In particular, the Sensor<index-term id="ITerm210"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> Web Enablement Initiative (SWE) promoted by the OGC proposed standards designed to collect data collected by sensors<index-term id="ITerm211"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> in a standardized way and augment the sensor<index-term id="ITerm212"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> data with the spatiotemporal dimension (Bröring et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). Thus, any machine control data or timber log data, mostly in the format of the Standard for Forest machine<index-term id="ITerm213"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> Data and Communication (StanForD), can be coupled with a spatial and temporal reference (Purfürst and Lindroos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2011</xref>). StandForD constitutes a de facto standard that covers all types of data communication present in forest machines<index-term id="ITerm214"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term> and would probably require an upgrade, enabling it to exchange data provided by the new sensors<index-term id="ITerm215"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> that will soon be deployed on forest machines<index-term id="ITerm216"><term>Forest machines</term></index-term>. By adopting the standards of SWE, it would also guarantee a standardized transmission, storage, and dissemination of the sensor<index-term id="ITerm217"><term>Sensors</term></index-term> data. This would be a fundamental step toward a wider use of the information produced, paving the way for a real integration of timber production and CSF.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Appelhanz S, Osburg V-S, Toporowski W, Schumann M (2015) Traceability system for capturing, processing and providing consumer-relevant information about wood products: system solution and its economic feasibility.
