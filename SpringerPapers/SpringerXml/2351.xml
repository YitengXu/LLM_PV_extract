id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the deep transformation of the national energy structure, the ability of resource allocation of the traditional energy network is gradually unable to meet the development needs of future energy systems. The technology and market environment for implementing demand response have significantly changed, and the optimal coordination of the supply and demand in the Energy Internet cannot be effectively realized only by considering the demand response in power system. Instead, an integrated demand response (IDR) is required whose technical requirements cannot be met only by considering power system scheduling and control. Furthermore, the existing market framework and incentive mechanism cannot be adapted to a more complex market structure for the multi-energy systems (MES). At present, the end customers on energy demand side have gradually become an aggregation of various forms of energy consumption such as energy storage, combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) and load, which have self-coordination abilities. When the energy supply cannot meet the demands of the end customers in MES, the end customers need to respond in various forms to ensure the balance of energy supply and demand. It is necessary to explore the implementation mechanism and incentive mode of IDR, perform simulations to verify the effectiveness of the strategies, and solve the problems such as lack of supporting tools for the operation of IDR. In such cases, the efficiency of energy use on the customer side can be improved and the integrated energy service strategy can be effectively supported.</p><p id="Par3">Traditional demand response is a mechanism in which customers dynamically change their electricity consumption behavior in response to time-of-use electricity price signals or real-time dispatching instructions to reduce critical-peak demand and transfer power consumption between different time periods. However, in the demand response oriented to multi-energy coordination, energy consumers response not only by reducing energy consumption or opting for off-peak energy consumption but also by changing the type of the consumed energy. With the rapid development of MES, all types of energy loads can participate in demand response.</p><p id="Par4">IDR can break the boundaries between different types of energy sectors to realize a deep response to resources on the demand side. The values of IDR mainly include: 1) Improving the economic efficiency of the energy system. IDR enables multiple types of energy to participate in the optimization of demand response, which leads to a larger optimization space and further improves the benefit for customers. The IDR considers the conversion between various types of energy and thus raises the consumption of renewable energy resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At the same time, a deeper demand response can reduce the required investment of power grid. 2) Improving the safety of the energy system. Through the conversion between various types of energy, the IDR can reduce critical-peak load, maintain the transient balance of the system, improve the consumption of renewable energy, and further improve the safety of the system. 3) Mining the potential of demand response resources. With IDR, customers can conduct demand response more flexibly, and thus, the potential of demand response can be fully explored and the capacity of demand response resources can be improved.</p><p id="Par5">At present, the research on demand response mainly focuses on the traditional demand response in power system, while the research on the analytical technique, evaluation method and implementation mechanism of IDR is not thorough and comprehensive enough. Different types of demand response resources have different dynamic time constants and control time scales, whereas establishing mathematical models for energy equipment under different time scales is a serious problem due to large-scale and high-complexity. The steady-state characteristics in a long time scale and the transient characteristics in a short time scale of various types of resources are also different. Therefore, it is necessary to study the optimal operation and control methods under different time scales and conditions of state dependence. Demand response is not a problem of one single time snapshot but a continuous optimization problem with temporal coupling. In addition, with a large scale of various demand response resources connected and reacted to the grid, the separated operation and management modes of traditional energy systems will be significantly changed, and the original supply-demand balancing mechanism, market mechanism and price mechanism are no longer applicable. Therefore, researchers worldwide are currently working to establish a scientific analysis framework and implementation mechanism for IDR.</p><p id="Par6">Taking the traditional demand response in power system as a starting point, this paper first reviews the research on the fundamental theory, framework design and potential estimation of demand response in power system. The practical cases and software development of demand response are then introduced. Finally, the current theoretical research and application of IDR are assessed. The overall structure of the paper is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Overall structure of the paper</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2019_126_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Fundamental theory and framework design of demand response</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fundamental theory</title><p id="Par7">Demand response is an important means for the new-generation energy systems to deal with power generation uncertainty and load demand fluctuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Demand response is a mechanism in which power customers dynamically change their electricity consumption behavior in response to time-of-use electricity price signals or real-time dispatching instructions to reduce critical-peak demand and transfer power consumption between different time periods. The benefits of demand response can be significant. On the one hand, it can effectively reduce the peak load of the power system and delay the investments required for new generation units and transmission lines. On the other hand, it can improve the consumption of renewable energy and reduce the adjustment and start-up/shut-down costs of thermal power units during the off-peak periods, which also improves the safety of power system operation.</p><p id="Par8">According to the different types of signals given to the demand side, demand response can be divided into price-based and incentive-based demand response. Price-based demand response can be further sub-divided into time-of-use price, real-time price, critical-peak price, multi-step price, etc. Incentive-based demand response can be sub-divided into direct load control, interruptible load, demand-side bidding, emergency demand response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], etc. Due to the lack of price signal and market mechanism to promote demand response in China, demand response has been mainly realized by other means such as technology, administration and subsidies, including peak shifting, improvement of production process, cooling/heat storage, adjustment of production time and promotion of electricity-saving equipment, without fully considering and mobilizing the initiatives of customers. However, developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which have fully developed their electricity markets, have implemented various demand response projects that effectively control the peak load of the systems. For example, in Europe, which has eight major regional electricity markets, demand response projects in each country can reduce the peak load by 2.9% on average. Existing research on demand response mainly focuses on two aspects: the optimal operation of power system considering demand response, and the optimal strategy for customers to participate in demand response according to external signals. From the viewpoint of system, through the optimal allocation of demand response resources, the objectives including minimum total operating cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], minimum network loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], maximum consumption of renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], maximum social welfare can be achieved under certain constraints. The modeling methods of demand response include those based on the elasticity coefficient of electricity price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and considering the rebound effect of direct load control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The considered demand response resources include residential electric water heaters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], air conditioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], distributed energy storage devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and electric vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. From the view point of customers, they will receive the electricity price signals from the electricity market or the suppliers. Considering the comfort of electricity consumption, the load aggregation and energy management optimization are realized for various types of electrical equipment including roof photovoltaics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and energy storage devices in different ranges, e.g., households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and residential areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Framework design</title><p id="Par9">Demand response has developed from manual to semi-automatic and finally to full-automatic, and its effectiveness, reliability and flexibility have been greatly improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the aspect of system framework design of demand response, reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] proposes a predictive control scheme of automatic demand response mechanism, which mainly considers the distributed energy connected to power grid, supports large-scale implementation of demand response projects, and can reflect the planning stage, real-time operation, financial settlement and verification of energy and services in the process. An integrated framework of communication and control of demand response is introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and a meter gateway architecture is proposed to realize centralized load management and control by means of energy aggregators, equipment switches and intelligent electric equipment. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] proposes a demand response framework which can be applied to a home local area network (LAN) as a hardware architecture connecting the energy management system and the equipment interface unit to realize home demand response. In the process of acquiring data of power consumption and executing local load control, the communication between the equipment interface unit and the demand response system can be realized. The research team of the University of California, Berkeley subsequently proposes a framework named “Information-centric energy infrastructure”, and its main purpose is to packet dispatch and control various types of distributed energy, load or energy storage systems to form energy subnets with different functions. Each energy subnet interacts with others through interfaces named Intelligent Power Switches in order to combine intelligent communication protocol with energy transmission in a common framework and realize the basic framework of cooperative control of various distributed energy sources, thus laying a solid foundation for the development of Energy Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Potential estimation of demand response</title><p id="Par10">Potential estimation of demand response is to quantitatively estimate the load capacity that are able to participate in demand response. It is a prerequisite for quantitative analysis of demand response, and is the theoretical basis for practical application and software development of demand response.</p><p id="Par11">Data mining of the real-time power consumption of customers is currently a hot research topic in the field of demand response potential estimation. Its core technique is clustering algorithm, including direct clustering and indirect clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The direct clustering is performed on the data of power consumption itself, and various types of clustering techniques have been studied, including K-means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], fuzzy K-means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], agglomerative hierarchical clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], self-organizing map (SOM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], support vector clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and subspace clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Various types of indexes have been used to quantitatively evaluate the effect of clustering, including Clustering Dispersion Indicator (CDI), Scatter Index (SI), Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) and Mean Index Adequacy (MIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In order to deal with the challenges brought by the large quantity of electricity consumption data with high dimensionality, research on data dimensionality reduction has been carried out. The indirect clustering is performed on the data after dimensionality reduction instead of the original data itself. Dimensionality reduction approaches can be classified into feature extraction based methods and time series based methods. Feature extraction refers to mapping a high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space, which includes linear dimensionality reduction method such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as Sommon Mapping, Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and deep learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Since the data of electricity consumption is essentially a time series, there are also some studies applying the idea of time series analysis to the data mining of electricity consumption, such as Discrete Fourier Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], Discrete Wavelet Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], Symbolic Aggregate Approximation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and Hidden Markov Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Clustering analysis of the data of electricity consumption mainly aims at obtaining typical electricity consumption patterns of customers and then estimating the potential of demand response. Furthermore, the classification of customers with similar electricity consumption patterns can reduce the high cost of identifying the massive data of electricity consumption one by one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and also lay a foundation for customer classification modeling and implementation of demand response. Apart from the research on unsupervised clustering techniques, there are also some studies of supervised classification techniques. Based on the load profiles labeled by the customer pattern or electric equipment, the physical meaning indicated by the data of power consumption is analyzed through decision tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], logistics regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and other techniques. Besides, the potential estimation of customer demand response also provides a basis for the settlement of demand response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Practical cases and software development of demand response</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Practical projects worldwide</title><p id="Par13">Many power grids worldwide have introduced demand response. In 2012, Beijing was chosen as one of the first pilot cities for demand side management (DSM) in China and made a preliminary attempt on DSM. In 2015, Beijing took the lead in establishing the demand response mechanism named “Initiative Response, Load Aggregation” in China. It also issued the <italic>Notice of Beijing Development and Reform Commission on the Recruit of Demand Response Load Aggregators and Power Consumers for Beijing’s Comprehensive Pilot DSM Program</italic>, and first 26 organizations were chosen as the “Demand Response Load Aggregators for Beijing’s Comprehensive Pilot DSM Program in 2015”. Execution process of the demand response program in Beijing is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. On July 26, 2016, Jiangsu Province successfully implemented province-wide demand response for the first time. This activity consisted of two modes of demand response: agreed response and real-time response, with a total of 3154 participating customers. The agreed response was wholly performed by business customers, including 248 ordinary consumers and 24 load aggregators. The real-time response was mainly performed by air conditioning loads from 1871 participants, including 1550 non-domestic customers and 321 domestic customers. According to the preliminary statistics, the actual agreed response load was 3.31 million kilowatts and the real-time response load was 0.214 million kilowatts, i.e., 3.52 million kilowatts in total. The PJM power grid in the United States has achieved remarkable benefits from demand response, the capacity of which accounts for about 6% of the peak load of the whole network. In September 2013, PJM deployed nearly 6 million kilowatts of demand response sources, which saved about 11 billion US dollars on electricity bills for the customers in that year. In terms of dynamic demand response, real-time automatic demand response system has been established at Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone and Yangtze Metallurgical Industrial Park in Jiangsu Province. A total of 868 pieces of electric equipment owned by 276 enterprises in the park can automatically make response decisions according to real-time power consumption under the control instructions from the demand response platform. Without affecting the normal production of the enterprises, the total demand of the park can be reduced by 558,000 kW in just one second by suspending production, load reduction or other means, thereby realizing a second-level dynamic demand response.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Execution process of the demand response program in Beijing</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2019_126_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">Promoting demand response is also an important move for demand side revolution in China. The issue of <italic>Several Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Further Deepening the Reform of the Electric Power System</italic> (ZF [2015] No. 9) in March 2015, officially kicked off a new round reform of power system in China. The opening of the retail electricity market is an important part of the new round of reform, which will result in many new market members such as electricity suppliers and load aggregators. Demand response, as a low-cost, flexible-deployment, and high-quality resource, can incorporate into the electricity market through flexible business models, such as reducing the electricity bill by responding to the time-of-use price, and providing auxiliary services such as peak shaving and reserve. It can be predicted that in the near future, the resources and potential of demand response will be widely motivated and demand response will become a brand-new and non-negligible factor in the operation of power system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Software development and application</title><p id="Par15">As for the software development and application of demand response system, Pacific Gas and Electric Company implements a demand-side bidding project based on an automated platform. Through the application of automation technology and communication technology, it coordinates the control of consumers and distributed energy resources to reduce the peak load. The “ITM” project of the Kema Laboratory in the Netherlands uses time-of-use distribution technology and incentive mechanism to mitigate the impact of electric vehicles on the power grid.

The IDR strategy of the regional CHP system often takes into account the peak shifting rather than load shedding (e.g., reducing the heat load using the thermal inertia of the buildings), and also considers more types of optimization objectives (e.g., emissions). Some studies also model the demand response as a virtual power generation unit. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] investigates a model-predictive control (MPC) strategy based on demand response for the intelligent control of a micro-CHP system. A distributed energy management method for the coordinated operation of CHP systems based on demand response is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

Most of the studies model the integrated energy systems as an EH. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] develops a multi-objective (cost and environment) operation optimization model of EH in the presence of demand response. The weighted sum method is adopted to solve the multi-objective model and the fuzzy technique is used to select the optimal compromise solution. Demand response using load shifting flattens load curve and reduces total cost and emission of EH. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] combines the supply-side characteristics of the EH with the demand-side flexibility brought by the demand response schemes, and models the energy supply system of the building as an EH with its heat demand modeled according to the laws of thermodynamics. The effects of different demand response schemes (load shedding and shifting) with and without wind power and energy storage in the integrated energy systems are compared in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The EH model is used to simulate the wind power, energy storage and demand response in electricity and natural gas infrastructures. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] proposes a 2 m + 1 point estimation probabilistic scheduling scheme for multi-input multi-output EH, and studies the impact of the response heat and electricity loads on reduction of the total cost and the impact of the participation of different equipment on supplying multi-energy loads. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] proposes a residential EH model, which consumes electricity, natural gas and solar radiation at the input ports to meet the electricity, heat and cooling demands at the output ports. In order to improve the operational flexibility of the EH, an inclusive demand response strategy including load shifting, load shedding and flexible heat load modeling is adopted. A mathematical model framework for the optimal planning of EH considering the operation constraints is provided in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Both deterministic and stochastic objective functions are given considering the wind power, electricity price and electricity demand. Wind turbines, energy storage and demand response are considered in the EH. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] introduces a way to integrate demand response and energy storage into the existing multi-energy network analysis and modeling method. The study concludes that demand response has a similar effect to energy storage and thus demand response can be modeled as an equivalent energy storage unit. The optimal operation of integrated energy systems considering wind farms, electric heat storage systems, demand response, electricity market and thermal energy market is studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>].

A value evaluation method of EH with energy converters, storage and DSM is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Considering the flexibility of EH in changing output powers, the Monte Carlo simulation method is adopted to evaluate its economic value. A robust optimization model based on EH model for integrated energy systems is established in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].
