This paper proposes a frequency-based control strategy, ensuring the frequency among the strict limits imposed by the Standard EN 50160. The frequency of the microgrid common AC bus is determined by the energy storage converter, implementing a proposed droop curve among the state of charge (SoC) of the battery and the frequency. Therefore, the information of the SoC becomes known to every distributed energy resource (DER) of the microgrid and determines the active power injection of the converter-interfaced DERs. The active power injection of the rotating generators remains unaffected, while any mismatch among the power generation and consumption is absorbed by the energy storage system. Finally, in case of a solid short-circuit within the microgrid, the energy storage system detects the severe voltage decrease and injects a large current in order to clear the fault by activating the protection device closer to the fault. The proposed control methodology is applied in a microgrid with PVs, wind generators and a battery, while its effectiveness is evaluated by detailed simulation tests.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microgrid</kwd><kwd>Frequency control</kwd><kwd>Renewable energy sources</kwd><kwd>Energy storage system</kwd><kwd>SoC control</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40565_2015_Article_178.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>SC17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>CrossCheck date: 15 October 2015</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">As renewable energy sources (RESs) integration has considerably increased, the microgrid concept has been developed. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a microgrid is defined as a cluster of DERs and local loads connected to the utility grid, which can operate in parallel to the grid or isolated as an island. The microgrid concept also includes the integration and control of storage assets in order to ensure a high power quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In the literature, the critical role of the energy storage system is focused on the regulation of the voltage and frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and on preserving the power balance due to the intermittent operation of the RESs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, other ancillary functions of the energy storage may include the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability, load leveling, peak shaving and operating reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. When the microgrid is comprised of RESs and energy storage systems in island operation mode, the energy storage usually acts as grid-forming source and regulates the common AC bus appropriately, while the RESs are controlled to inject the available power to the microgrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, this approach may lead the SoC to unsafe operation, provoking a damage in the energy storage. Furthermore, an active power imbalance among the generation and the consumption may deteriorate the microgrid frequency regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the control strategy should take into account the SoC control, ensuring a prolonged lifetime for the battery.</p><p id="Par7">Since in island operation mode, the frequency is no longer imposed by the utility grid, several control strategies propose the implementation of a secondary control for frequency regulation in order to ensure a frequency within a stipulated band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This supervisory control level can be implemented either in a centralized or decentralized way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In case of implementing a centralized control method, a microgrid central controller (MCC) modifies the control of the DERs appropriately, by gathering measurements from local controllers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this control approach, the communication is considered necessary. However, the system reliability is reduced, since it is dependent on the operation of a physical communication system. On the other hand, the decentralized approach aims at providing the highest possible autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, in many cases the communication is still considered a basic principle of the control.</p><p id="Par8">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], frequency is used as a communication agent for the energy control in an islanded microgrid, with no need of further communication. The goal focuses on the adjustment of the conventional droop method, considering the frequency variation and the SoC of the energy storage. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], a decentralized energy management integrated in a microgrid with PVs and batteries is examined. The SoC of the battery determines the microgrid frequency, nevertheless additional control schemes are needed to achieve coordination with other kind of DERs. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the frequency is also used as a communication parameter of the SoC of the energy storage system in a microgrid with converter-interfaced DERs. However, all the connected sources are considered as converter-interfaced DERs, while, due to the presence of secondary control and the associated communication network, only a limited frequency deviation is used in the control strategy implementation. Moreover, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], no fault-clearance methods are examined, and no voltage regulation is investigated. A power control strategy focusing on the control of the SoC of the energy storage is also proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The frequency is used again as a communication signal for sending the information of charging/discharging to all DERs. However, only converter-interfaced generation units are considered.</p><p id="Par9">This paper investigates the case of a microgrid in a small Greek island, which is currently supplied by conventional power sources. The conventional power sources are synchronous generators, driven by diesel engines; three generators, each one rated at 220 kVA, 400 V, 50 Hz and one generator rated at 90 kVA, 400 V, 50 Hz. The loads are concentrated, representing the small town consumption. According to measurements, the peak load is 350 kW (15-min average power) during summer period, while it is reduced to 70 kW during the winter. The annual energy consumption corresponds to 1020 MWh.</p><p id="Par10">Since the most abundant RESs in Greece are wind and solar power, this case study proposes the replacement of the conventional diesel-driven generators with a microgrid consisting of a 230 kWp PV installation and two asynchronous wind generators (WGs) of 275 kW each one. The energy production of the RESs cover in average 90 % of the total load energy consumption. Taking into account a projected 50 % increase of the load demand, the total annual energy consumption yields 1530 MWh. The WGs cover approximately 80 % of the projected annual energy consumption (1224 MWh), while the rest 20 % (306 MWh) is covered by the PVs.</p><p id="Par11">In order to maintain the power balance in the microgrid, a battery of 7.3 MWh is also added. The battery bank is selected to provide one day autonomy in the month with the peak demand, which equals to 4 MWh, representing a typical day in August. The permissible depth of discharge (DOD) is assumed 60 %, while the converter efficiency is considered equal to 95 %. In order to protect the microgrid from faults, the battery converter is sized to inject 1.5 p.u. of its nominal current for 2 s (at 400 V level), i.e. 1500 A in the microgrid under study. Thus, the apparent power of the battery converter is 850 kVA at 400 V rated voltage. The microgrid under study is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Single-line microgrid scheme</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40565_2015_178_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">In order to ensure power balance among the power production and consumption without implementing any physical communication between the DERs in this small Greek island, this paper proposes a decentralized control strategy based only on local measurements for the effective frequency control in a microgrid with an energy storage system. The energy storage is considered as the converter-interfaced battery. According to the proposed methodology, the battery converter adjusts the microgrid frequency by considering its SoC and implementing a proposed droop curve. Thus, the information of the SoC is transferred indirectly through the frequency to all DERs, which determine their power output appropriately. In this way, the frequency always remains within the preassigned limits, while the SoC control ensures a prolonged battery lifetime. Finally, the case of a short-circuit is examined. The battery converter identifies the fault due to the deep voltage decrease and modifies its control in order to inject a large current. The fault is cleared within a few seconds.</p><p id="Par13">The paper is organized as follows: Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> describes the microgrid modelling.

The internal battery resistance depends on the SoC and temperature, while its value differs between charging and discharging periods.

At <italic>t</italic> = 1 s, the WGs contribute with 300 kW and the battery SoC equals to 49.4 %. As a result, the frequency of the common AC bus is set to 49.31 Hz and the PV injects the active power from the MPPT, which is equal to 100 kW. Each load L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> absorbs 200 kW, <italic>pf</italic> = 0.8, therefore the battery does not inject any active power. At <italic>t</italic> = 1.5 s, a short-circuit takes place at the terminals of the load L<sub>2</sub>, as it is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. When the voltage <italic>rms</italic> value drops below 300 V (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), the battery converter senses the fault and adjusts the control to current-control mode in order to inject a current equal to 1500 A and clear the fault. As long as the voltage remains at very low values, the over/under voltage relays R<sub>14</sub> of the WGs and R<sub>12</sub> the PV respectively are activated disconnecting these DERs. As a result, only the battery feeds the fault with this large current, causing the respective activation of the protection device at <italic>t</italic> = 3.5 s, i.e. 2 s after the short-circuit appearance.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simulation results</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40565_2015_178_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO21"/></fig></p><p id="Par35">Subsequently, the battery converter returns to voltage-source control mode and the RESs reconnect to the microgrid. The microgrid returns to steady-state operation after a small transient effect. Since L<sub>2</sub> is disconnected from the microgrid, the aggregated load current becomes lower than in the pre-fault operation. As a result, the total active power balance has changed and the surplus of active power is absorbed by the battery. The simulation results are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, proving the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. As is figured, the battery discharges during the fault and its corresponding SoC is decreasing. After the fault clearance, the battery switches to charge mode and its SoC is increasing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">A new frequency-based control strategy for a microgrid with an energy storage is proposed. The frequency of the main AC bus is determined by the battery SoC in terms of implementing a proposed droop curve. The microgrid could consist of both converter-interfaced and rotating generators. In the examined microgrid, only RES have been considered, showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology even under intermittency of the primary source. The aim of the proposed control strategy is to ensure a frequency deviation among the strict limits of the Standard EN 50160 for providing a high quality power to the connected loads. At the same time, the battery SoC is controlled in order to avoid overcharging or deep discharging. Finally, in case of a solid short-circuit within the microgrid, the battery undertakes to feed the fault with a high current and clear it. The proposed methodology is confirmed by detailed simulation results representing a microgrid in a Greek island. The microgrid contains a battery as an energy storage and is mainly fed by PVs and WGs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ravindra</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kannan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramappa</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Microgrids: a value-based paradigm: The need for the redefinition of microgrids</article-title><source>IEEE Electrif Mag</source><year>2014</year><volume>2</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>20</fpage><lpage>29</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1109/MELE.2013.2297738</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>[2]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nikkhajoei</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Lasseter</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Distributed generation interface to the CERTS microgrid</article-title><source>IEEE Trans Power Deliv</source><year>2009</year><volume>24</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>1598</fpage><lpage>1608</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2021040</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>[3]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Koohi-Kamali</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tyagi</surname><given-names>VV</given-names></name><name><surname>Rahim</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Emergence of energy storage technologies as the solution for reliable operation of smart power systems: a review</article-title><source>Renew Sustain Energy Rev</source><year>2013</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>135</fpage><lpage>165</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.056</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>[4]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Cooperative control strategy of energy storage system and microsources for stabilizing the microgrid during islanded operation</article-title><source>IEEE Trans Power Electron</source><year>2010</year><volume>25</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>3037</fpage><lpage>3048</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1109/TPEL.2010.2073488</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>[5]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>XG</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>QM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Advances and trends of energy storage technology in microgrid</article-title><source>Int J Electr Power Energy Syst</source><year>2013</year><volume>44</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>179</fpage><lpage>191</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ijepes.2012.07.015</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>[6]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ricalde LJ, Ordonez E, Gamez M et al (2011) Design of a smart grid management system with renewable energy generation.
