zinc-nickel battery and the lithium battery, for solving energy shortages and environmental contamination. Meanwhile, the drastic change in the external outside environment has brought a huge challenge to manage the battery industry chain. Therefore, in the uncertain external environment, the study of supply chain competition between lithium battery and new nickel battery manufacturers is the focus of this paper. We build a cooperative game model under the demand disturbance and a non-cooperative game under the background of product promotion. The results show that (i) the price set by the manufacturer increases with technical improvement when consumers are more sensitive to the technical level. (ii) The optimal price of all manufacturers will drop as the CETRC (carbon emission technology renewal coefficient) increases. (iii) The price of zinc-nickel batteries will be higher than that of lithium battery as the market promotion rate is in the middle range. In the model, the supply chain determines different optimal prices according to the different ranges of the demand disturbance.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Zinc-nickel battery</kwd><kwd>Cooperative promotion</kwd><kwd>Carbon trading</kwd><kwd>Demand disturbance</kwd><kwd>Complexity</kwd><kwd>Bifurcation chaos</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The authors declare no con ict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">At present, energy shortage and environmental pollution are greatly challenging the survival of human beings. Fossil energy, as the main body of energy consumption, has limited reserves and is not renewable. According to BP Energy Statistical Year (2018), it is reported that the world’s crude oil reserves can be exploited by human beings for less than 50.2 years; meanwhile, the other kinds of traditional energy, such as gas and coal, are also facing a negative outlook. Worse still, the consumption and waste of energy are constantly increasing, and the problem of energy supply is extremely serious. Based on this background, the emergence of chemical power supply, especially batteries, has become the focus of attention, and it has great advantages in energy and power density, efficiency, and cost. In recent years, the demand for batteries has constantly been increasing. Batteries have greatly influenced the lifestyle, communication, transportation, and some other fields of modern people, applying widely wearable electronic devices, RFID devices, smart cards, and electric vehicles.</p><p id="Par3">Among the existing batteries, lithium-ion batteries and zinc-nickel batteries are the power sources with strong competitiveness and development prospects. Rechargeable lithium battery derives from the concept of solid solution electrode and rocking chair battery proposed in the 1970s. Nowadays, the lithium-ion battery has become one of the most widely used power sources for many energy storage devices (such as wearable electronic devices, electric and hybrid vehicles, and fixed purpose devices). However, the shortage of lithium and cobalt has brought huge challenges to the mass production of lithium batteries. Also, the development of lithium-ion batteries has reached the upper limit of the technical level. Under such limitations, people turn their attention to a new type of high-energy power supply with high energy density, green, safe, and sustainable development to replace lithium-ion batteries for energy conversion and energy storage. As a kind of alkaline cell, zinc-nickel batteries have been widely applied in electronic components, fixed power supplies, and other fields. It has the advantages of low cost, high discharge voltage and energy density, large discharge current, green environmental protection, and so on.</p><p id="Par4">Although zinc-nickel batteries have a promising future, lithium batteries still occupy a dominant position in the industrial pattern. There is a long way to go for zinc-nickel batteries to give full play to their advantages, expand their market share, and occupy a place in which the remodeling and management and the game strategies of different manufacturers are of crucial importance, especially under the background of the drastic change of exterior environments, such as 5G, sharing economy, low-carbon policy, trade protectionism, and Covid-19. How to make good use of the external environment, give full play to its advantages, avoid risks, and obtain advantages in the competition will become an important factor for the development of zinc-nickel batteries.</p><p id="Par5">In addition, with the vigorous development of the mobile Internet, the task of product promotion has gradually shifted from retailers to third-party platforms or institutions. For example, the e-commerce platform not only provides consumers with product information but also provides businesses with advertising promotion and other services, just as domestic communication giants can provide advertising and promotion services for cooperative businesses through SMS push (short message service push). Through an accurate website and SMS push, we can dig deep into the target users, further explore the potential market demand, and enhance the competitiveness of this product. How to make good use of this promotion service in the competition will also become the top priority in the development of zinc-nickel batteries as a latecomer.</p><p id="Par6">In this paper, we will establish the basic model of the non-cooperative game of three oligarchs under the background of product promotion and the cooperative game model under the fluctuations of demand. This paper focuses on the following questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par7">the equilibrium strategy of the three oligarchs game in the basic model,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">the effect of the cooperative promotion model on the equilibrium strategies of battery manufacturers, and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">the effect of demand fluctuations on the equilibrium strategies of the three oligarchs.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par10">The marginal contributions of this paper are as follows: First, this paper innovatively explores the game relationship between lithium battery manufacturers and new nickel battery manufacturers in the case of uncertain consumer demand and clarifies the changes in consumer game relationships in the uncertain environment. Second, this paper finds that for zinc-nickel battery manufacturers, an appropriate market promotion rate should be selected, while too high or too low market promotion rate may cause damage to profits, which provides a reference for new nickel battery manufacturers to set reasonable prices in practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Literature review</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Zinc-nickel battery</title><p id="Par11">The zinc-nickel battery studied in this paper has the advantages of being low-cost, high power density, and environmental-friendly and is considered to be one of the most potential electric vehicle batteries. In recent years, research on zinc-nickel battery have never halted, and breakthrough achievements have also been made. For instance, Meng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>) have succeeded in growing Zn Al LDHs/HC on hollow carbon spheres, showing large specific surface area and good mechanical stability, facilitating the deposition and growth of zinc, and the core–shell structure is beneficial to electrolyte diffusion. Meanwhile, the material takes hollow carbon spheres as the conductive substrate, organizes and forms a developed conductive network structure, and establishes an efficient and stable path for electron transport successfully. Chen and others designed 3D ZnO-Cu-C hybrid microspheres. There is copper decorating on the surface and internal in-situ carbon, forming a 3D penetrating conductive frame as the path for electron transport, and the external copper can also restrain the dissolution of active ingredients effectively. Such structure provides with large effective surface area, promoting the quick move of ions. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>) prepared gel precursors and then prepared carbon-coated nano ZnO by heat treatment. The nano ZnO is combined with carbon physical cover, maintaining the efficient utilization of nano ZnO and also preventing the dendritic growth and densification of an anode, showing high electrochemical activity, low resistance, and high discharge capacity of 622 mAhg<sup>−1</sup>. Cui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>) prepared graphene/ZnO by physical method. In the process of charging and discharging, graphene cut Zn in situ and anchored zinc atoms, which effectively inhibited the dissolution of zinc oxide in an alkaline solution. In addition, carbon nanotube-coated zinc oxide was also synthesized (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). In this way, the reaction of zinc oxide with alkali liquor was prevented effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cooperative promotion</title><p id="Par12">Some scholars have considered cooperative promotion in the research on the supply chain. Huang and Li (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>) studied the optimal advertising strategy of cooperative advertising between manufacturers and agents in the supply chain by applying the method of game theory; Zhou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>) studied the optimal cooperative advertising and ordering strategy of a two-level supply chain based on risk aversion preference. Chutani and Sethi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>) analyzed the optimal advertising decision-making problem in a closed-loop supply chain when only one member of the supply chain invested in advertising. Lin and Shao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>) studied the investment strategy of online advertising in the Internet environment. Karray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>) studied two cooperative promotion strategies in the supply chain based on game theory. Karray et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) studied the cooperation effect of two competitive manufacturers and one retailer. Xie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>) studied the coordination contract considering cooperative advertising in a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain.</p><p id="Par13">In terms of carbon quota and carbon trading, Ji et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>) studied the O<sub>2</sub>O retailing supply chain in a low-carbon environment and set up three models including unlimited carbon trading, grandfather carbon trading, and benchmarking carbon trading. Research shows that benchmarking can effectively promote manufacturers to produce low-carbon products. Under the policy of quota and carbon trading, Xu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>) considered consumers’ preferences and manufacturer’s carbon emission reduction, set up the centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making models, and coordinated the supply chain with a wholesale price contract, a cost-sharing contract, and two-part pricing contract. Yang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>) built two competitive supply chains in the context of carbon cap trading and explored the impact of its horizontal cooperation and vertical cooperation on carbon emission reduction. Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>) considered the game model of carbon emission benchmark for government decision-making, analyzing how the manufacturers’ production decisions change with the change of government carbon trading policy under consumers’ carbon preference and technology upgrading. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>) proposed a mechanism that considers carbon trading of fresh food supply chain and cold chain logistics services. Different from previous research, this one studied the carbon trading behaviors within the supply chain, revealing the relationship between carbon trading and logistic service and its influence on the cooperation between suppliers and retailers. Qian et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>) considered retailers’ equity concerns in the context of carbon trading and set up the wholesale price contract and two pricing contracts, and the supply chain coordination is realized through the bargaining model. Results show that the intensification of equity issues will reduce the carbon emission reduction level of manufacturers. Ji et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>) studied the impact of the inverse relationship between carbon trading price and carbon quota on supply chain production decisions, deduced the optimal carbon quota under a wholesale price contract and an income-sharing contract, and found that the social welfare performance of the two contracts is different under different environmental concern parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Supply chain risk</title><p id="Par14">The problem of supply chain risk has been widely concerned by academia for a long time. Kleindorfer and Saad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>) believe that the risks affecting the operation and management of the supply chain are mainly divided into two types, namely, the risk caused by the uncoordinated supply and demand and the risk caused by the disruption of normal operation by emergencies. While as for emergence risk in the supply chain, Chopra and Sodhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>) pointed out that because of the characteristics of low occurrence probability and low predictability, emergencies are often ignored in practice and research. Emergency management in response to supply chain emergencies includes a variety of research directions, and disturbance management, which is closely related to the research focus of this paper, was first proposed by Clausen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). In the research of supply chain emergency disturbance management, the existing literature has studied different supply chain modes, disturbance factors, emergency coordination mechanisms, and so on. Xiao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>) studied the decision-making of the supply chain composed of one manufacturer and two retailers after the sudden change of demand caused by emergencies and pointed out that the supply chain coordination after the production deviation cost can be realized by adjusting the quantity discount contract. Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>) analyzed the coordination problem of multi-retailer competition in the supply chain under demand disturbance and proposed that emergency coordination can be carried out through revenue sharing contract. Ma and Xie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>) took the duopoly air conditioning market under demand disturbance as the research object and analyzed the impact of disturbance on the dynamic game system. Xie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>) studied a two-echelon supply chain composed of buyers and sellers and buyers. Considering the buyer’s uncertain demand and income, the repurchase contract in the supply chain is studied, and the effects of income uncertainty and relative bargaining power on the performance of the repurchase contract are studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The evolutionary game of supply chain</title><p id="Par15">In the end, related researches of this paper are on the evolutionary game of supply chain in a complex system. In actual economic activities, due to the complex environment, it is difficult for supply chain members to make completely rational decisions, while the nonlinear system dynamics model can be used to study the process of the dynamic game. Chen and Hu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>) constructed a dynamic evolutionary game model of government and manufacturer time based on carbon tax and subsidy and analyzed the game behavior between manufacturer and government under dynamic and static carbon emission reduction policies. Tong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>) considered the carbon trading policy and consumers’ low-carbon preference, constructed the retailer-led Stackelberg game, and studied the equilibrium solution and stability of the evolutionary game. Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2019</xref>) constructed an evolutionary game model between the government and manufacturers under the background of carbon quota and carbon trading and studied the impact of government policies on the carbon trading market under the conditions of static carbon trading price and dynamic carbon trading price. The results show that when the government implements the static carbon trading price, the evolutionary game cannot achieve stability. Under the dynamic carbon trading price, there is a stable strategy. In the multi-channel recycling supply chain of duopoly manufacturers, Zhan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) explored the impact of the carbon tax on manufacturers’ recycling and carbon emission reduction strategies, further constructed a multi-cycle dynamic game model, and analyzed the complex characteristics of bifurcation, chaos, and sensitivity. Bao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>) considered the government subsidy behavior and consumers’ low-carbon preference factors, studied the short-term and long-term game behavior of duopoly carmakers, and compared the optimal strategies under three game models (cooperation, noncooperation, and cost-sharing). Ma and Wu (2014) constructed a supply chain including strategic consumers, the government, and two manufacturers producing electric vehicles and fuel vehicles, respectively, and analyzed how subsidies and carbon emission constraints affect the operation of the supply chain based on an evolutionary game. Gao and Ma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>) studied the complex dynamic behavior of a financial system. Through numerical simulation, the path of a singular non-chaotic attractor is found, the time-delay feedback system is considered, and the stability and Hopf bifurcation of the controlled system are studied. Xu and Ma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>) established a solar photovoltaic supply chain including the government, utility grid, exclusive solar panel retailers, and households. The long-term equilibrium strategy of a nonlinear dynamic system is studied, and how the stability of equilibrium, conservative, and aggressive strategies affect the system is studied. Ma and Xu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2022</xref>) proposed a Stackelberg game model to investigate the competition between solar energy and traditional fossil energy under the regulation of renewable portfolio standards. The result shows that the government should enact a strict requirement instead of announcing a low requirement rate if a high punishment rate has already been implemented. Ma et al.

Boosting sales of lithium battery and zinc-nickel battery is very important to reduce carbon emissions, so this article constructed the uncertain demand situation, the lithium battery manufacturers, and zinc-nickel battery manufacturers of the game model; combining with the evolutionary game theory to explore the long-term stability of the both under the condition of uncertainty, lithium battery manufacturer for practice and zinc-nickel battery maker gives reference to the decision-making.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Basic model</title><p id="Par17">Here, we consider a market structure in which there are competitions between two zinc-nickel battery manufacturers and one lithium battery manufacturer. We assume that all of them are able to adopt a price competition strategy. In addition, the manufacturers of zinc-nickel battery cooperate with China Mobile and other communication companies to expand their market influence. In this paper, we set subscript 1 to represent the lithium battery enterprise, referred to as lithium battery for short; subscripts 2 and 3 indicate zinc-nickel battery enterprises cooperating with China Mobile (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The meaning of parameters</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Parameter</p></th><th align="left"><p>Meaning</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p><inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

It can be seen that for every battery manufacturer, when technology has a great influence on sales, or when consumers are sensitive to the technical level, the price set by the manufacturer will increase with the improvement of its technical level. However, when technology has little influence on sales, or consumers are less sensitive to the technical level, the price set by manufacturers decreases with the improvement of their technical level. Therefore, in order to realize the positive incentive of technology level to price, we should actively publicize and cultivate consumers' sensitivity to technology level.</p><p id="Par34">Lemma 2: <inline-formula id="IEq70"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq70_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>∂</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>∂</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq70_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

It can be seen that the profit of zinc-nickel battery manufacturers increases with the promotion of the market-promoting rate, while that of the lithium battery manufacturers is the opposite. Meanwhile, under different promotion degrees, the influence of marketing rate on profit is different. That is to say, the higher the promotion degree of zinc-nickel battery manufacturers is, the greater the impact will be. The above conclusion shows that zinc-nickel battery manufacturers are supposed to strengthen the cooperation with China Mobile and improve the marketing rate to increase profits. Moreover, they should also improve promotion extent in order to gain more advantages in the competition of zinc-nickel battery.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Influence of market promotion rate on battery manufacturer’s profit under different promotion degrees</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20679_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par47">The impact of the marketing rate on the profits of battery manufacturers under different promotion rates is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

Demand fluctuation refers to the sudden increase or decrease of product demand caused by sudden time. If demand fluctuates obviously in the short term, a serious supply chain bullwhip effect might be triggered under the further promotion of poor information transmission in the supply chain, and in turn, there will be a loss of customers or unsalable products in the enterprises in the supply chain. In recent years, the 3C electronic products and new energy automobile industry are booming, so the demand for batteries is increasing, but there are uncertain factors behind the stable increase of the market. For instance, in terms of policy, the extension or cessation of national subsidies for new energy vehicles will promote or inhibit the total market demand for new energy vehicles. In terms of technology, a series of security problems with certain new energy vehicles will lead consumers to take a wait-and-see attitude toward new energy vehicles again, further decreasing the total demand for batteries. On the aspect of trade, the rise of international trade protectionism and populism has hindered cross-border trade and further caused demand fluctuations. As a consequence, we set total market demand as <inline-formula id="IEq114"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq114_Math"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq114_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the three coordinates respectively represent the adjustment speed of the sales price level of the three battery manufacturers, and the region surrounded by the yellow curved surface is the stability region of the system. When the adjustment speed is in the stable region, there is a stable solution to the manufacturers’ multi-cycle game. However, when the adjustment speed is beyond the stability region, the system would lose stability and enter a period of doubling bifurcation state or chaotic state. This phenomenon shows that in order to make the market enter an orderly and balanced state, battery manufacturers should control the adjustment speed of decision variables within a certain range.</p><p id="Par89">The 3D Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> directly shows the adjustment speed stability region of the long-term game of the three battery manufacturers. In order to analyze the specific effect of adjustment speed on the long-term game in detail, this paper makes a detailed analysis in the form of a bifurcation diagram by using MATLAB software. The specific methods are as follows: The system is iterated continuously under different adjustment speed values, and then the strategy changes after a certain number of iterations are drawn into a scatter diagram.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Stability range of system adjustment speed</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20679_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par90">Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the influence of the sales price adjustment speed of lithium battery manufacturers, <inline-formula id="IEq169"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq169_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq169_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The change in the price adjustment coefficient will cause the system to produce unstable phenomena such as bifurcation or chaos, which makes it difficult for all participants to accurately predict the future price trend and profit change, and affect the decision-making efficiency of all participants in the supply chain. Therefore, the chaotic state of the system is extremely harmful to each battery manufacturer. When the game parties in the system make decisions, the reference coefficients cannot be customized at will. Therefore, this paper uses the variable feedback control method to control the chaotic state of the supply chain system so as to make the evolutionary game model enter a stable state from chaos. In the process of gradual control, the game is easier to predict and analyze.

By comparing Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>, it is obvious that for the original supply chain discrete system dynamics model, the larger the price adjustment parameter is, the more likely it is to bifurcation, which makes the system to enter a chaotic state, making it difficult for all participants in the game to predict future price fluctuations. After using the variable feedback control method, we can see that if a higher price adjustment speed is adopted, that is, the zinc-nickel battery manufacturer adopts a more radical price adjustment strategy; it will not affect the zinc-nickel battery manufacturer’s systematic control, but can stabilize the overall trend of price. Therefore, in terms of system stability, the chaos control method of variable feedback control method in the model can enable zinc-nickel battery manufacturers to build a system model suitable for their own development and easy to predict and control so as to realize the sustainable development of battery supply chain.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Time series diagram of price adjustment speed of zinc-nickel battery manufacturers under chaos control</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20679_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO15"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par99">This paper studies the competition and cooperation of the battery supply chain including two zinc-nickel battery manufacturers and a lithium battery manufacturer. Two models are established in this paper: a basic model and a demand disturbance model. In the basic model, two zinc-nickel battery manufacturers and a lithium battery manufacturer adopt the price competition strategy at the same time, and the zinc-nickel battery manufacturers expand their market effect by cooperating with China Mobile and other communication companies. In the demand disturbance model, due to social emergencies, the three battery manufacturers cope with the demand disturbance in the market by cooperating.</p><p id="Par100">Through the analysis of the above two models, the main conclusions are as follows.</p><p id="Par101">In the basic model, when the consumers are sensitive to the technology level, the prices set by manufacturers rise with the improvement of the technology level. The greater the consumer preference for zinc-nickel battery, the higher the price of zinc-nickel battery. With the rise of the updating parameters of carbon emission technology, the optimal prices of the three manufacturers will decrease. When the market promotion rate is in the moderate range, the price of zinc-nickel batteries will be higher than that of lithium batteries.</p><p id="Par102">In the demand disturbance model, the supply chain makes different decisions of optimal prices according to different ranges of demand disturbance. In the numerical simulation, with the increase of out-of-stock costs and inventory costs, the region in which the planned demand is equal to the disturbed demand will expand, and the increase of inventory costs will reduce the optimal price, while the increasing out-of-stock cost will increase the optimal price.</p><p id="Par103">In the evolutionary game model, the price adjustment speed of battery manufacturers should be controlled within a certain range so as to maintain the stability of the system and the orderly market competition.</p><p id="Par104">This paper has clear management significance: (1) This article discusses the uncertain demand, lithium battery manufacturers and zinc-nickel battery manufacturers of competition and cooperation relations, has been clear about the optimal pricing strategy, and explores the stability of the long-term evolution of game behavior in the west that could help to practice the game strategy of battery manufacturers and zinc-nickel battery manufacturers to provide the reference. (2) It can be seen from the conclusions that if we want to realize the positive incentive of technology to the price of products, we need to improve consumers’ sensitivity to technology level; that is, we need to enhance the propaganda of technology. In terms of energy-saving and emission reduction, the battery manufacturers should improve the level of carbon emission technology so that their products can gain more advantages in competition with products at the same level. In terms of zinc-nickel battery manufacturers, they are supposed to choose an appropriate market-promoting rate, while a higher or lower rate may lead to damage to profits. Facing emergencies, the supply chain can formulate the optimal price according to demand disturbance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the reviewers and associate editor for their careful reading and helpful comments on the revision of the paper.
