This forces the manufacturer to enclose battery components in heavier and peculiar packaging structures to meet the stringent safety requisites. Such heavy protective packaging reduces the overall amount of ready-to-use energy (energy density). An all-solid construction will certainly enhance the overall performance of any energy storage and conversion devices that can be thought of<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>An ideal ion conducting polymer electrolyte for ambient temperature energy storage has been the dream pursued by many researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. An enhanced safety may be achieved by complete replacement of organic carbonate-based liquid electrolytes, thus leading to facile and leak-free fabrication, flexibility, compactness, reduced weight and laminated structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Scientific community has been focusing on polymer systems containing –EO– moieties for an all-solid cell construction and other polymers (e.g., PMMA, PVdF) in mostly hybrid/gel configurations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It is well known that polyethylene oxide (PEO) crystallizes at about 55 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and ionic as well as segmental mobility are limited to its molten (amorphous) state at elevated temperatures. This impedes its widespread application into the global market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, at elevated temperatures such polymers lose their dimensional stability being in molten state, which leads to non-homogeneity inside the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This facilitates the diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> ions through localized favourable paths, increasing both concentration gradients and defects that may create temperature deflections and short-circuits. Attempts have been also made to reduce the crystallinity to retain the amorphicity by incorporating various ceramics/metal oxides (e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but the target remains unachieved so far. Another problem is the solvent-based preparation procedure, where complete and “concrete” solvent removal is a herculean task; indeed, in most cases the unavoidable traces of solvent persisting in the polymer matrix create various interfacial stability issues, even enabling thermal runaway reactions.</p><p>Four decades after the discovery of ionic conduction in polymer electrolytes by Fenton <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and Armand <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, the topic remains red hot. Moreover, the all-solid-state Li-metal battery concept is still appealing due to assured high energy density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A polymer electrolyte that is less reactive towards Li-metal and highly resistant to dendrite formation/penetration would potentially open up the possibility of Li-metal based accumulators to entry in the market. After decades of efforts, PEO matrix still struggles to meet the requirements of global market due to its low ambient temperature conductivity and inferior safety arising from non-uniform plating/stripping of Li<sup>+</sup> ions, which often results in hazardous dendrite formation.</p><p>A compromise between the characteristics of an all-solid state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and a gel-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> polymer electrolyte might represent the vital knot that researchers need to accomplish the goal. In this direction, remarkable results are reported in literature with the addition of room temperature ionic liquids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> into thermoplastic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> or thermoset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> polymer matrix. However, the problems such as restricted Li<sup>+</sup> ion diffusion, cost and rate capabilities become the hurdle towards the commercialisation of such materials. Thus, slowly and steadily the scientific community is moving towards the addition of noncarbonated high boiling, thermally stable organic solvents such as organic nitriles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, glymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, etc. Moreover, in the case of thermoplastic polymers the separator size deformation with varying temperature is a tough issue, while thermosets are limited by unsuitable ionic conductivity and brittleness of the polymer matrix.</p><p>Glymes (various lengths) are well known for complexing with metal-ions through their multiple ether-like oxygen atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. When lithium salt is dissolved in glyme-based solvents, they show promising ionic conductivity and Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Due to the excellent properties imparted by glymes in the liquid electrolyte, recently they have received plenty of attention for next-gen systems beyond Li-ion, such as lithium sulphur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and lithium air rechargeable batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>Free radical photopolymerisation is a low cost, solvent-free and energy saving technique very well established for many applications in an easily implemented and versatile fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Photopolymerisation can be suitably adapted to the preparation of polymer electrolytes due to its eco-friendliness, which is a key aspect that influences the fate of large-scale polymer electrolyte manufacturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, UV-induced reaction on multifunctional monomers permits rapid <italic>in situ</italic> generation of intimate electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which currently represent a major striking point to be fixed in the field of electrochemical devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, the whole electrolyte preparation can be carried out in the absence of solvent.</p><p>Most of the systems referring to glyme-based electrolytes are either blended with thermoplastic materials or directly used in their liquid form. Little work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> has been devoted to study their possible implementation in a self-standing, softly cross-linked thermoplastic polymer matrix. In the present work, we use a system based on PEO and tetraglyme and we directly cross-link it in one-pot along with the supporting lithium salt under UV irradiation to retain the solid-like nature and dimensional stability. By concurrent exploitation of photo-induced cross-linking and <italic>in situ</italic> functionalization procedures, kinetically driven inhibition of the PEO chains crystallization is readily achievable at ambient conditions, leading to polymer electrolytes that possess solid-like properties without hampering ionic mobility. They are prepared by mixing PEO as the polymer matrix, bis[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]ether (tetraglyme, TEGDME) as the active plasticizer, lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as the source of Li<sup>+</sup> ions and 4-methyl benzophenone (MBP) as the light-induced hydrogen abstraction mediator (photoinitiator). Under UV excitation, MBP abstracts an acidic proton from a methylene group and generates a free radical chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This free radical can combine with another free radical belonging to the same chain or other –EO– chains to interlink themselves. Tetraglyme also possesses methylene groups that can undergo hydrogen abstraction and following inter-radical reactions to form oligomers, or bond to the adjacent PEO chains. The final interlinked solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) films are mechanically robust, highly flexible, homogeneous and largely amorphous. They also exhibit excellent properties in terms of compatibility with the lithium metal electrode and suppression of hazardous dendrite growth. The sum of these characteristics enlighten the striking prospects of the newly developed ISPE as electrolyte separators in both Li-ion and Li metal batteries conceived for high energy and/or power demanding applications, including hybrid vehicles and smart grid storage systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussions</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical-chemical characterization</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the materials used in the study along with the real aspect of ISPE formed after UV exposure (right top), which is almost transparent, tack free, flexible and easy to manage.

The micrographs are well in agreement with the results obtained by Schulze <italic>et al.</italic>, who used a one-pot synthetic strategy based on polymerization-induced phase separation to generate nanostructured polymer electrolytes that exhibited an unprecedented combination of high modulus and ionic conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In the present case, phase separation is not possible as the material is made of similar –EO– based backbones. Indeed, viscosity as well as polymerization induced aggregation and-to a certain extent - rearrangement of the PEO chains could be possible. The photopolymerisation was carried out after keeping the highly viscous reactive mixture under stressful conditions (90 °C, pressed at 20 bar) between two Mylar foils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In particular, micrographs clearly evidence a bag-like polymer matrix that incorporates an extremely soft material. The surface roughness is very clearly visible in secondary electron mode. Moreover, the overall aspect and characteristics indicate the exceptional homogeneity of the sample, with no noticeable presence of pores or voids. Moreover, the images showed in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(E</xref>,F) demonstrate that the obtained ISPE is stretchable and highly elastic (once the stress is released, it can go back to the previous shape). These results all together confirm that the proposed electrolyte is soft, weakly cross-linked, flexible and shape retaining at ambient conditions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Micrographs showing the overall morphology of sample PTL-1: cross-section under secondary electron mode (<bold>A,B</bold>) and top view (<bold>C,D</bold>), at different magnifications; (<bold>E,F</bold>) shown the images of the sample PTL-1 (at 25 °C) under stretch and bend mode, demonstrating the mechanical integrity and excellent elasticity.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19892_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) values are tabulated in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and the respective profiles are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. Both the glass transition and the melting temperatures were determined for all the samples. <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> values vary between –34 and –44 °C. As expected, the amount of salt noticeably influences the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of the ISPEs prepared with 1:1 tetraglyme to PEO ratio. Generally, low <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> values account for a moderately enhanced segmental motion of the –EO– moieties in the polymer matrix which is facilitated by low crystallinity. Moreover, a noticeable change in the peak associated with the melting of the crystalline region is clearly evidenced: an increase in LiTFSI content reduces the intensity of the melting peak, which also results broadened. As noted in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, an increase in salt content reduces the [EO]/[Li] ratio from 54:1–23:1. Thus, an increased amount of Li<sup>+</sup> ions is available for the coordination with PEO chains, thus reducing the tendency of forming crystalline phases. Moreover, the cross-linking effect further reduces the mobility of the PEO main chains. Overall, a relationship is present between the phase transition temperature and the salt content: the higher is the salt content, the lower is the transition temperature. This is expected as for the typical coordination effect by lithium salt, which weakly decreases the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ISPEs in all cases exhibit crystalline melting peaks near room temperature during the heating cycle of the DSC analysis. This may be attributed to low cross-linking density (7.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> mol m<sup>–3</sup> for PTL-1, calculated at 0 °C), which allows the long enough –EO– chains to rearrange and crystallize in the matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that the melting points of these newly elaborated polymer electrolytes are well below the typical PEO-based electrolytes when tested by means of DSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. If one calculates the number of MBP molecules per –EO– moieties, the latter exceeds 46 ± 3 per each photoinitiator molecule. This ratio is sufficient to enforce the rearrangement of the –EO– moieties to form weak crystalline phases. One cannot neglect the effect of tetraglyme in diluting the number of cross-linking per area, as some of the initiator molecules are actively involved in real-time oligomerization and eventual branching processes. Thus, the effective cross-linking would be lower than the theoretical calculations from mole ratios. Overall, the average cross-linking length obtained in the present work suggests that cross-linking is not sufficient to prevent the PEO crystallization. It can be hypothesized that a higher degree of cross-linking may not be also favoured, as it may induce the low molecular weight tetraglyme and/or its oligomers to squeeze out of the system during thermal stresses. Thus, we selected an optimum cross-linking, which could assure a good mechanical integrity along with good plasticizer retention (leak free).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the ISPEs PTL-1 to PTL-3 that contains various amounts of LiTFSI salt.

According to the differential thermal analysis (shown in dotted lines), the weight loss occurs for all the samples above 190 °C, the major contributor being tetraglyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Higher amounts of LiTFSI reduces the thermal stability of the polymer matrix, which is clearly visible in the differential curves (shift of the peak from 218 to 195 °C). This could be the general trend observed for tetraglyme kind of plasticizers that show the tendency to decompose in reaction with fluorinated anions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, both DSC and TGA profiles show that no unusual phase changes or weight losses occur in the temperature range between 25 and 150 °C, which makes the material thermally stable and useful as a polymer electrolyte under standard operating conditions in real battery configuration.</p><p>Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was performed on sample PTL-1 and the resulting profiles (both modulus and loss modulus) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1(A,B)</xref>. It clearly indicates that the material has low <italic>T</italic>g, which is in agreement with the DSC analysis. In addition, the calculated cross-linking density (7.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> mol m<sup>–3</sup>, calculated at 0 °C) was found to be comparatively lower than other known systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This is an indication that the number of cross-linking points between the PEO chains is lower than expected, which allows the long enough –EO– chains to rearrange and crystallize in the matrix. Tensile tests were carried out on the PTL-1 sample according to ASTM Standard D638; the Young’s modulus was found to be 0.3 MPa and maximum force at break was found to be 1.5 MPa. The material can stretch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1C</xref>) very well under stress, as justified by the maximum strain (elongation) of around 17 mm before the membrane was broken.</p><p>The cross-linking effects and related properties were studied by an indirect method where the ISPE was subjected to dissolution in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The solubilized fraction was analysed using size exclusion chromatography/gel-permeation chromatography (SEC/GPC) to calculate the molecular weight of oligomers formed by the bonding between various tetraglyme molecules. We chose PTL-1 as the representative sample and performed the test to understand the molecular weight of the soluble fraction. It is worth noting that the results of insoluble fraction study are in agreement with the gel-content studies performed on similar samples. The soluble fraction in THF while testing showed a broad molecular weight distribution primary caused by the tetraglyme molecules. Molecules with various molecular weights ranging from 300 up to 41000 Da eluted from the column at different time intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>), which correspond to the higher homologous of tetraglyme such as dimers, trimers or oligomers. This is a direct indication that tetraglyme molecules are taking part in the polymerization reaction to form oligomers and remain active upon UV irradiation. In such a scenario, some branches that arise from the reactions between the radicals generated from –EO– of PEO and –EO– of tetraglyme might be formed. The oligomers formed by tetraglyme may not remain in the polymer matrix, which is clearly visible when the membrane was placed in the THF bath. Thus, during the insoluble fraction test, these oligomers may diffuse out of the system, which may account for the low cross-linking content of the cross-linked material. Thus, the gel content achieved for our samples is lower than the values obtained by Kim <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, who used PEO and room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). RTILs may not take part in the chemical reaction, thus a higher insoluble content was obtained when they calculated the insoluble fraction with respect to the PEO content. Here, we propose the use of tetraglyme instead of RTIL, due to the presence of accessible protons in tetraglyme that can take part in the dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation in the presence of light sensitive ketyl species.</p><p>FTIR studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref> in ESI) were performed on PTL-1 sample with and without UV curing to unravel any drastic difference induced by the irradiation. The FTIR spectra are identical and no noticeable changes are observed, which confirms that the soft cross-linking strategy does not induce any drastic modification in the polymeric components as well as with respect to the TFSI<sup>−</sup> anion. Moreover, for comparison purposes, FTIR analysis of liquid TEGDME added with 10 wt. % of LiTFSI was performed and compared to the spectra of PTL-1. Clearly, the spectra of liquid electrolyte and PTL-1 are very different. In general, in an electrolyte system three kinds of ions can be present: free ions, free ions co-existing with ion pairs and aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. PTL-1 analysed after UV-curing was almost absent with the peaks corresponding to aggregates (1236 and 1143 cm<sup>−1</sup>) if compared to the LiTFSI/TEGDME system that contains the same wt. % of lithium salt. As a result, we assume that the electrolyte gets enriched with free ions and neutral ion pairs, which can move faster in the polymer matrix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electrochemical characterization</title><p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out between 0 and 85 °C. The Arrhenius plots for all samples are shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. The plots of PTL-1 to PTL-3 demonstrate the influence of the lithium salt when PEO to tetraglyme ratio is 1:1. It is widely accepted that ionic conductivities exceeding 0.1 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> at room temperature are necessary for an electrolyte to function in real battery configuration. Nevertheless, the crystalline domains of PEO-based polymers restrict the ionic mobility. Recently, Khurana <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> reported a cross-linked –EO– based polymer electrolyte showing an ionic conductivity higher than 0.1 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> at 25 °C. In our work, we are able to achieve even improved ionic conductivities (0.40 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> for PTL-3) for interlinked PEO-based solid polymer electrolytes. The conductivity values increase with an increase in the salt concentration, then reaching the maximum for PTL-3 where the −EO− to Li ratio is 23:1. However, the difference is not huge; indeed, all membranes demonstrate conductivity values ≥0.1 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> at 25 °C. We decided not to increase the salt concentration further as for the ion pairing nature of TFSI-based salts, which strongly influences the ionic mobility, probably due to the saturation of the hopping sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It is worth mentioning that the sample retains good elastic and mechanical integrity under stress. After several days of conductivity tests, which were carried out under 10 N pressure, it was observed that the membrane retains its size and shape without any noticeable damages around the edges. Indeed, the thickness variation after the test was &lt;2%. This is an encouraging result as ISPEs are super soft, low <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and highly plasticized. Further, it confirms that no leakage of tetraglyme from the polymer matrix occurs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Arrhenius plot showing the ionic conductivity <italic>vs.</italic> temperature for ISPEs prepared with various LiTFSI content.

The same behaviour (see <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B–D) is observed above the melting point between 35 and 85 °C.

Above 0 °C, the ionic conductivity increases with a VTF-like dependence for all the samples.

Overall, the transport number in the PTL series of samples is comparatively higher than the classical literature data on polymer electrolytes, but it is close to the data obtained for systems that contain tetraglyme as co-solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The reasons for such a high number is the absence of ion pairs, or the presence of more free ions and neutral ion pairs. Moreover, the oligomerisation of tetraglyme moieties weakens the coordination between Li<sup>+</sup> ions and O atom of TEGDME. This facilitates the movement of Li<sup>+</sup> ions inside the polymer matrix leading to improved transference number values. It was previously demonstrated by Kriz <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> that tetraglyme can loosen the coordination of Li<sup>+</sup> ions with –EO– units of PEO chains, resulting in improved ion mobility and might also enable Li<sup>+</sup> ions to decouple from ion pairs.

Even though the CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-O- chemical moiety is same for both PEO and tetraglyme, the difference may arise from the –CH<sub>3</sub> end group of tetraglyme, which avoids the interaction between electrode surface and the –OH terminal groups of PEO. However, the oxidation stability is anyway superior than the pure PEO-based system and this is an intriguing aspect of this electrolyte.

Instead of using CHCl<sub>3</sub>, ACN was used due to the solubility of the components used for membrane preparation. Moreover, CHCl<sub>3</sub> is suspected for carcinogenic activity. The cross-linked (insoluble) fraction was then calculated by dividing the mass of the dry sample left over after the extraction by the mass of the original sample (relative error = ±1%).</p><p>The overall morphology was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) on a ZEISS Supra 40, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). For cross-sectional morphology characterization, the samples were cracked after dipping in liquid nitrogen to avoid any change in the morphology. Then, the samples were subjected to metallization by sputtering a very thin Cr layer (~10 nm) to minimize the effect of the electron beam irradiation.</p><p>The glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) of the samples was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with a METTLER DSC-30 (Greifensee, Switzerland) instrument. In a typical measurement, the electrolyte samples were cooled from ambient temperature to –85 °C and then heated at 5 °C min<sup>−1</sup> up to 120 °C. The <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> was calculated as the midpoint of the heat capacity change observed in the DSC trace during the transition from glassy to rubbery state. The thermal stability was tested by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) using a TGA/SDTA-851 instrument from METTLER (Switzerland) over the temperature range between 25 and 600 °C under N<sub>2</sub> flux at a heating rate of 10 °C min<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>The mechanical properties were determined by dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) on a MK III Rheometrics Scientific Instrument at 1.0 Hz frequency on tensile configuration at a heating rate of 5 °C min<sup>−1</sup>. The specimen size was 20 mm × 4 mm × 0.2 mm. The storage modulus and the loss factor were measured from −80 to 30 °C. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR, NICOLET-5700) spectroscopy (400–4000 cm<sup>−1</sup>, resolution 2 cm<sup>−1</sup>) was carried out at 25 °C, on extremely thin films sandwiched between gold plates with an orifice. Tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM Standard D638, using a Sintech 10/D instrument equipped with an electromechanical extensometer (clip gauge).</p><p>Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed to examine the effect of UV curing using an Agilent Technologies 1200 Series (USA) instrument. The instrument was equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector and two Waters Styragel columns (HT2 and HT4) conditioned at 35 °C. A sample of cross-linked polymer was weighted, transferred into a Whatman glass microfiber thimble and extracted with THF for 24 hours using a Soxhlet apparatus. After extraction, a small quantity of the soluble fraction was transferred to a vial and left open to evaporate THF. The obtained solid was then diluted with chromatography-grade THF and used for GPC measurement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Electrochemical characterization methods</title><p>The following procedures were performed in the inert atmosphere of a dry glove box (MBraun Labstar, O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O content &lt;1 ppm) filled with extra pure Ar 6.0. The ionic conductivity was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of cells assembled by sandwiching the ISPE between two stainless steel (SS-316) blocking electrodes (area 2.54 cm<sup>2</sup>). A PARSTAT-2273 potentiostat/galvanostat/F.R.A. (Frequency Response Analyzer) by Princeton Applied Research (USA) was used for measurements at various temperatures between 100 kHz and 1 Hz at the open circuit potential (OCV). The bulk resistance of the samples was calculated from the impedance curve. Then, the ionic conductivity was calculated based on the following equation:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19892_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where σ is the ionic conductivity (S cm<sup>−1</sup>), <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub> the bulk resistance, <italic>l</italic> and <italic>A</italic> are the thickness and the area of the specimen, respectively.

The cell was kept at 80 °C overnight to achieve an intimate contact and a stable interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes.

The working electrodes were prepared from a slurry that contains TiO<sub>2</sub> (Hombicat-100) or LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (Clariant-LP2), carbon black and PVdF in 70:20:10 weight ratio, respectively. The slurry was deposited over Cu (or Al) foil and later dried overnight (120 °C). The typical preparation for the electrode-electrolyte composites followed the procedure reported elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. In a typical preparation procedure, appropriate amounts of PEO, tetraglyme, LiTFSI and MBP were mixed at 70 °C and mechanically grinded to obtain a viscous paste-like mixture. This mixture was later deposited over a composite electrode film and hot pressed (20 bar, 90 °C) for 15 min to obtain a uniform coating over the electrode surface. This setup was exposed to UV light for 6 min to obtain a cross-linked polymer electrolyte system. Then, electrolyte/electrode disks (area 2.54 cm<sup>2</sup>) were cut from the sheet and dried under vacuum overnight at 40 °C prior to cell assembly. The electrode films used in this study were pressed prior to pre-polymer deposistion, which can retain the some pores/voids for the electrolyte components to accommodate while overall processing. The electrodes we used in the present case are not pressed/calendared.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Porcarelli, L. <italic>et al.</italic> Super Soft All-Ethylene Oxide Polymer Electrolyte for Safe All-Solid Lithium Batteries. <italic>Sci.
