The thermodynamic limitations of this process restrict the power output of a single µPSC. Herein, we demonstrate µPSCs in four different array configurations to enhance power output from these power cells. To this effect, six µPSCs were arrayed in series, parallel, and combinations of series and parallel configurations. Each µPSC was injected with a 2 mL liquid culture of photosynthetic microorganisms (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) in the anode and 2 mL of 25% (w/v) electron acceptor potassium ferricyanide (K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>) in the cathode. The combinations of µPSCs connected in series and parallel generated higher power than the individual series and parallel configurations. The combinations of six µPSCs connected in series and in parallel produced a high power density of 1914 mWm<sup>−2</sup> in the presence of white fluorescent light illumination at 20 µEm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, to realize the array strategy for real-time applications, a 1.7 V/2 mA rating light-emitting diode (LED) was powered by combinations of series and parallel array configurations. The results indicate the reliability of µPSCs to produce electricity from photosynthetic microorganisms for low-power applications. In addition, the results suggest that a combination of microlevel photosynthetic cells in array format represents a powerful optimal design strategy to enhance the power output from µPSCs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies (Quebec Fund for Research in Nature and Technology)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">Equipe</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Packirisamy</surname><given-names>Muthukumaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds de recherche Nature et technologies (FQRNT) Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41378_2022_Article_361.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Microphotosynthetic power cells (µPSCs), also known as biophotovoltaics, are emerging as promising renewable power sources. This technology exploits photosynthetic microorganisms to harvest energy from sunlight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, µPSCs facilitate addressing the present concern of sustainable energy generation. In µPSCs, light energy is converted to electrical power with high-energy charge-separated electron-hole pairs by exploiting living photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria and blue–green algae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The excited electrons are transferred across a series of complex intracellular electron carriers, and eventually, a fraction of these electrons is exported across the cell membrane and released into the external environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The µPSC, in turn, harnesses these electrons through the anode and cathode electrodes, thereby generating electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Although sunlight-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is relatively low at 0.1%, the primary source, solar energy, is nearly infinitely available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To this end, it is essential to understand the limiting factors that impede performance in several directions such as understanding microorganisms at the cellular level, electrochemical engineering design, and fabrication of µPSCs to harness more energy from sunlight.</p><p id="Par4">One of the significant restraints and limitations of the µPSC is its low power density. Consequently, to address these issues, quite a few approaches have been studied. Algal biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and genetically engineered cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> were utilized for electricity generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Innovative engineering design strategies have been demonstrated for the enhancement of power density by decoupling storage and power delivery for µPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Subsequently, mediator-free microfluidic µPSCs with cyanobacterial cells have been utilized to generate a power density up to 100 mW/m<sup>2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Digital printed cyanobacteria were also used to generate electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Hence, in this context, several studies exist on various dimensioned single-cell µPSCs and methods to increase their performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although microlevel µPSCs outperform macrolevel µPSCs due to their high surface area to volume ratio, higher columbic efficiency, lower internal resistance, higher mass transfer efficiency, and smaller distance or no distance between the electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, they are thermodynamically limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thermodynamically, the maximum open circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) that could be produced by µPSCs with photosynthetic microorganisms is only 1.8 V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Consequently, arraying µPSCs is one of the possible optimal solutions to obtain the desired voltage and current output from the µPSC such that it can be utilized to power low- and ultralow-power devices.</p><p id="Par5">In this context, a commercial inkjet printer was utilized to fabricate a thin-film paper-based biophotovoltaic cell consisting of a layer of cyanobacterial cells on top of a carbon nanotube conducting surface. A peak power density of 0.38 ± 0.07 mWm<sup>−2</sup> and a current density of 4 mAm<sup>−2</sup> were generated under 100 µEm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> light illumination. Subsequently, µPSC arraying strategies were realized to power real-time low-power devices. An arrayed configuration was also used to obtain an overall effective voltage of 1.4–1.5 V and current output of 1.5–2 µA to power a commercial digital clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thereafter, to obtain the desired voltage of 3 V from the µPSC, another array configuration was utilized to power light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p><p id="Par6">Although a few works have investigated array configurations for real-time applications, detailed analyses are still under investigation. Such a detailed analysis of the array configurations provides insights into the design of suitable low-power converters for real-time low- and ultralow-power devices. Herein, we demonstrate an array of µPSCs in series, parallel, and a combination of series and parallel connections. The 12 µPSCs were fabricated and connected in various array configurations. Electrical parameters such as the open circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>), short circuit current (I<sub>sc</sub>), load voltage (V<sub>L</sub>), and current (I<sub>L</sub>) at 1 kΩ and 0.5 kΩ were recorded for all configurations. Furthermore, the polarization curve (I-V) and power-current (I-P) characteristics were analyzed. To demonstrate the array strategy for real-time low-power applications, an LED with a 2 mA current rating and a 1.7 V voltage rating were powered from an array of µPSCs.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Device design and operation</title><p id="Par7">The µPSC anode and cathode chambers were fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and both chambers were separated by a Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane. Nafion 117 was specifically chosen considering its robustness and a relatively high proton diffusion capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The anode and cathode electrodes were fabricated on both sides of the Nafion membrane (Methods section). Such fabrication reduces the internal resistance between the electrodes, thereby increasing the performance by decreasing losses. After fabricating these components, all components were bonded together with PDMS. To seal the cathode compartment, microscopic cover glasses were employed. Then, 2 mL of 25% K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] was injected into the cathode chamber. Subsequently, the anode chamber was also injected with 2 mL of suspension-cultured green algal cells, and the anode chamber was purposefully not closed to allow for the diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen from the atmosphere (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

After circuit connection, the effective voltage was noted as 2.1 V, and the current was 1.2 mA. Due to losses in the array configurations and ohmic losses due to circuit components, the terminal voltage and the currents were found to be lower. The illuminance of the LED was low because of the lower current from the array of µPSCs. The LED was not powered at full capacity due to the lower supply of current (1.2 mA) from the µPSC than the rating (i.e., 2 mA). Subsequently, two LEDs of the same rating were connected in parallel. Both LEDs were powered by a µPSC array configuration. However, due to the division of the µPSC current between the two LEDs, their luminance was slightly reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13c</xref>). Following this experiment, to observe the response in the dark, the complete dark condition was set up; it was found that for a short duration of light and dark cycles, the performance of the array of µPSCs was unaffected. Moreover, two LEDs were successfully powered in the dark (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13e</xref>). In the second case, only five µPSCs were utilized. First, three µPSCs were connected in series, and second, another set of two µPSCs were connected in series. Finally, both sets were connected in parallel to obtain the desired voltage and current to power up the LED (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13f</xref>). After establishing the array configuration, the effective voltage and current were measured as 1.72 V and 1.8 mA, respectively. For this circuit connection, a lower power rating LED (1.7 V/2 mA) was used. As the power rating of the LEDs was low, an attempt was made to power the two LEDs in an array configuration. Therefore, both similar rating LEDs were connected in parallel.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Real time powering of light emitting diodes from arrayed micro-photosynthetic power cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of an LED circuit connected to an array of µPSCs. <bold>b</bold> The array combination utilized for the LED-lit, terminal voltage and current of an array of µPSCs, LED rating 2 mA and 2 V. <bold>c</bold> LED lit up in the light condition of 1000 lux; the LED illuminance was low because of the lower current input to the LED. <bold>d</bold> LED glowing from the µPSC in the dark. <bold>e</bold> The two LEDs were connected in parallel in the dark. <bold>f</bold> Photograph of an array combination of 5 µPSCs with a terminal voltage and current of 2.1 V and 1.9 µA, respectively. <bold>g</bold> The two LEDs connected in parallel under the light condition of 1000 lux lit for more than 4 h. <bold>h</bold> The two LEDs glowing from the µPSC in the dark.

Following the light condition response, to test the performance in the dark, the complete dark condition was established. In the short span of light and dark cycles, the performance of array configurations was found to be almost the same. To test the performance in the dark over a considerable period, 30 min was used. In our previous tests, it was found that after 30 min in the dark, the terminal voltage and current of the µPSC decreased slightly. Although the performance in the dark decreases over a long period, the array configuration is still able to power two LEDs with relatively good luminance. As quantifying the luminance was not a focus of the study, it was not measured. Furthermore, to test the performance with a higher loading condition, under the same dark conditions, another LED of the same rating was connected in parallel to the existing two LEDs. All three LEDs were successfully powered by the array configuration with relatively good luminance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13i</xref>). Finally, to observe the long-term performance, only two LEDs were connected. The two LEDs were successfully powered for up to 4 h continuously without variation in the terminal voltage and current. The process of connection and disconnection of the circuit was repeated several times, demonstrating reproducibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Reliability</title><p id="Par48">The µPSCs from Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (from 7 to 12 µPSCs) were disassembled and cleaned with deionized water after the removal of anolyte and catholyte.

At that time, LEDs were also successfully powered, and no significant difference in their performance was observed compared to their previous performance, indicating the reliability of the array configuration of µPSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">In summary, several array configurations such as series and parallel configurations and combinations of series and parallel configurations were reported in this work.

In addition, most IoT sensors require power for a short period with a long period of inactivity.

By designing a system for the continuous flow of anolyte and catholyte, the performance could be extended for continuous operation. Another important aspect is that the materials used in fabrication, such as proton exchange membranes (Nafion) and thin metal foils, are environmentally friendly and biodegradable. From a techno-economical perspective, a detailed cost analysis of the technology was performed in our previous work, which demonstrated the economic and environmental advantages of developing µPSC technology. Therefore, with these salient features, after designing µPSCs with a continuous flow of anolytes and catholytes, we can envision future applications of these fuel cells in charging batteries, cellular mobiles, small electronic devices including earphones, e-readers, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">In conclusion, we demonstrated a simple method of fabricating µPSCs and several array strategies for real-time low-power and ultralow-power applications. Due to low power density limitations, to increase the power density, an efficient array strategy was analyzed. The µPSCs were fabricated and connected in four different configurations, series, parallel, series combination, and parallel combination, to enhance the voltage and current of the µPSC. When connected in series, the voltages were found to be the summation of individual terminal voltages, and currents remained that of the µPSC with the lowest value. When connected in parallel, the effective currents were the summation of individual cell currents, and voltage remained that of the µPSC with the lowest value in array combination. In the CC-1 and CC-2 configurations, which are combinations of series and parallel configurations, both the terminal voltage and current were higher than those of the mere series and parallel configurations. By utilizing the [S2 (P3, P3)] configuration, we generated a power density of 1914 mWm<sup>−2</sup> with 2 mL of anolyte (C. reinhardtii) and 2 mL of [K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]. To demonstrate the configuration for a real-time low-power device, an LED with a rating of 2 V/2 mA was successfully powered for 4 to 6 hours. This novel fabrication method and array strategy will simplify the applications of µPSCs to several low- and ultralow-power applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Algal culture</title><p id="Par53">Algal strains (CC-125 wild-type mt + [137c]) were cultured in 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks in a temperature-controlled system (23 ± 2 °C).
