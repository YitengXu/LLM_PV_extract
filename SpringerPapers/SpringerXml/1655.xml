id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Microbially produced alkanes have been proposed as potential replacements for the current fossil-derived fuels and chemicals. Alkanes would be ideal substitutes for the currently used fossil fuels, because they can drop in directly in the current infrastructure and engines and have high-energy density and low hygroscopicity, preferred especially in aviation and diesel fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, realization of alkane production in an environmentally viable way requires that alkanes are produced from sustainable substrates with high efficiency. Currently, most of the microbial alkane production studies have focused on alkane production from biomass-derived sugars. In contrast, carbon dioxide could allow bypassing the biomass step and serve as sustainable carbon source for large-scale production, provided that efficient methods and microbial hosts can be developed for its utilization.</p><p id="Par5">The challenge of alkane production from carbon dioxide can be divided in two parts: (1) the reduction of carbon dioxide to organic compounds, and (2) the conversion of these compounds to long-chain alkanes. These processes impose different, and in part contrasting, requirements for the host metabolism, and are thus regarded difficult to achieve efficiently in any single organism. For example, the most efficient CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathways require anaerobic conditions and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Due to the anaerobic metabolism, the organisms employing these pathways have limited capacity for the production of highly energy-intensive molecules, such as long-chain alkanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Homoacetogenic bacteria (homoacetogens) are known for their ability to efficiently reduce carbon dioxide to acetate by the WoodâLjungdahl pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The energy for the acetogenesis can be obtained from hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, synthesis gas, organic compounds, or in the form of electrons directly from the cathode surface of a bioelectrochemical system in a process called microbial electrosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Homoacetogens have been studied for decades and are already being used in industrial scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, they present an attractive option for the fixation of carbon dioxide into organic compounds. However, due to the limitations of their anaerobic energy metabolism, they are unlikely to be able to efficiently produce molecules with higher energy content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, metabolic engineering of homoacetogens is hampered by the lack of established gene editing tools. One solution to circumvent these issues and to broaden the metabolic capability is to employ more than one organism in the production system. For example, the acetate produced from CO<sub>2</sub> by the acetogens can be upgraded to value-added, high-energy molecules by heterotrophic organisms such as <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hu et al. produced acetate with <italic>Moorella thermoacetica</italic> from CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, and utilized <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> for the conversion of the acetate into triacylglycerol. We have previously studied the conversion of acetate produced by acetogens either from CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, or by CO<sub>2</sub> and electricity (microbial electrosynthesis) into long alkyl chains. In addition, mixed cultures have been utilized for the chain elongation of acetate to higher carboxylic acids, such as caproate and caprylate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, alkane production from acetate has not been reported to date.</p><p id="Par7">Alkanes have been produced in various microbial hosts by the heterologous expression of a cyanobacterial two-step pathway. The pathway involves the reduction of fatty acyl-ACP to fatty aldehyde, which is subsequently converted to <italic>n</italic>-alkane. In cyanobacteria, the first step is catalyzed by acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and the second step by aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Besides the cyanobacterial AAR homologs, fatty aldehyde-producing reductases have been characterized from various organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Even though these reductases are not known to participate in alkane production in their native context, they can be utilized as part of synthetic alkane-producing pathways in heterologous hosts. Similarly, an alkane-producing enzyme CER1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has been used in heterologous alkane production instead of the cyanobacterial ADOs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The last enzyme of the pathway, ADO, is regarded as the bottleneck for the alkane biosynthesis, due to its low activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Cyanobacteria naturally produce only small amounts of alkanes, and thus the low activity is not an issue in the native context. However, in the (heterologous) overproduction, the low activity of ADO can cause accumulation of the pathway intermediates. Especially the fatty aldehyde, which is the substrate for ADO, is problematic due to its toxic nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, endogenous enzymes, such as aldehyde reductases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and dehydrogenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], compete for the fatty aldehyde substrate with ADO, leading to the loss of the valuable long acyl chains from the alkane-producing pathway. Thus, efficient alkane production requires careful balancing of the enzyme activities to provide ADO with sufficient amount of substrate, while avoiding these negative effects of fatty aldehyde accumulation. Furthermore, while the individual components (especially the cyanobacterial AARs and ADOs) of the pathway have been thoroughly studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], less attention has been paid to the performance of synthetic pathways comprised of enzymes from different origins.</p><p id="Par9">We have previously developed a twin-layer biosensor for the monitoring of the alkane biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The sensor consists of two parts, and is able to monitor both the intermediate fatty aldehyde and the end product alkane. The first part of the sensor consists of constantly expressed bacterial luciferase LuxAB, which utilizes fatty aldehyde as a substrate in a reaction that produces visible light. Thus, the concentration of fatty aldehydes is reflected in the luminescence signal. The second part of the sensor consists of a <italic>gfp</italic> gene under a native alkane-inducible promoter. Both luminescence and fluorescence can be measured in real time during cell growth, making the sensor a powerful tool for the screening and optimization of the alkane biosynthesis pathways in a high-throughput manner.</p><p id="Par10"><italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> ADP1 is a promising chassis for genetic studies, metabolic engineering, and lipid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. <italic>A. baylyi</italic> does not naturally produce alkanes, but the fatty aldehyde intermediate is part of its natural storage lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], suggesting potential for long-chain alkane production. We have previously shown that alkanes can be produced by the expression of the cyanobacterial pathway (AAR and ADO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> grows well on acetate, and we have previously shown it to be a suitable chassis for the upgrading of the acetate produced by acetogens into long-chain lipid compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ADP1 has tendency for natural transformation and homologous recombination, supporting straightforward genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In this study, we establish alkane production from acetate in metabolically engineered <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ADP1. By utilizing the alkane biosensor, we compare the performance of different synthetic alkane biosynthesis pathways, and demonstrate the importance of pathway balancing for improved alkane production. Further, we demonstrate the net production of alkanes from CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> by a two-stage bacterial process combining an acetogen <italic>Acetobacterium woodii</italic> and the <italic>A. baylyi</italic> engineered for alkane production (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Outline of the study.

The engineered strain that produced most alkanes was coupled with a process in which acetate was produced from carbon dioxide by acetogenic bacteria, leading to the net production of alkanes from carbon dioxide (<bold>c</bold>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13068_2018_1229_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par12">As the first step towards the alkane production from CO<sub>2</sub>, we started by constructing nine synthetic alkane biosynthesis pathways and compared their performance in alkane production from acetate. We have previously demonstrated increased fatty aldehyde production in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> with the expression of any of the three different reductases: Acr1, AAR and a putative dehydrogenase from <italic>Nevskia ramosa</italic>, designated here as Ramo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Acr1 is an endogenous fatty acyl-CoA reductase from <italic>A. baylyi</italic> that is involved in the natural storage lipid (wax ester) production pathway. AAR from <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> is a fatty acyl-ACP/CoA reductase employed in the alkane production pathway in cyanobacteria, and earlier studies indicate that it is the most efficient among the cyanobacterial homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Ramo, on the other hand, is a putative short-chain dehydrogenase from the bacterium <italic>Nevskia ramosa</italic>. Ramo was initially identified based on its sequence homology with Acr1, and its expression was shown to increase the fatty aldehyde and wax ester production in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These three fatty aldehyde-producing enzymes were included in this study. The alkane-producing enzymes selected for the study were ADOs from <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> (SeADO) and <italic>Prochlorococcus marinus</italic> (PmADO), and CER1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, all of which have been previously utilized in heterologous alkane production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The genes encoding the pathway enzymes were cloned under T5/<italic>lac</italic> promoter as synthetic operons containing first the alkane-producing and then the aldehyde-producing gene, both preceded by ribosomal binding site (RBS) sequences (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The resulting nine constructs were transformed to the previously developed biosensor strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. <italic>A. baylyi</italic> naturally degrades alkanes, but the <italic>alkM</italic> gene essential for alkane degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] has been deleted from the sensor strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">For the comparison of alkane production, the sensor cells harboring the different pathways were cultivated in 96-well plate in minimal medium supplemented with 50Â mM acetate. The expression of the alkane biosynthesis genes was induced with either 10 or 100Â ÂµM IPTG and the luminescence and fluorescence signals measured in real time during cell growth (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The highest luminescence signal, indicating highest fatty aldehyde production, was obtained with the CER1-AAR pair.

Thus, we next set out to optimize the relative expression levels of ADO and AAR. Changes in the relative expression were achieved by modulating the RBS of AAR in the synthetic operon. Three RBS:s with predicted strengths âweakâ, âmediumâ and âstrongâ based on <italic>E. coli</italic> characterization were chosen (Biobrick parts BBa_0031, BBa_0032, and BBa_0030, respectively).

The relative expression of AAR was altered by modifying the strength of the RBS, and the effects on the aldehyde and alkane production were measured with the biosensor. The strongest RBS yielded the highest aldehyde production, as expected. In contrast, the alkane production was higher when an RBS with intermediate strength was used. This suggests that lowering the AAR expression leads to more balanced metabolism, thus avoiding the harmful effects of the fatty aldehyde accumulation, and resulting in higher alkane production.

In this study, we utilized a fed-batch cultivation strategy to support better growth and alkane production from acetate. In the cultivations, acetate concentration was maintained between 30 and 70Â mM to provide the cells with sufficient carbon and energy source while avoiding the toxic effects of higher concentrations.
