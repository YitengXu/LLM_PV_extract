Passive permeate-side-heated interfacial-heating solar membrane distillation has been shown recently as a promising system for off-grid distributed water and wastewater treatment. In this study, single-stage tubular systems were developed by giving the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane (pore size: 0.45 µm) a tubular structure with the outer surface (i.e., the permeate side) coated with carbon black NPs which absorbed solar thermal energy and evaporated the feedwater inside the membrane tube. Under natural sunlight, the vertical tubular system had a production rate of distilled water per footprint of 0.67‒2.06 kg m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> throughout the year, 71% higher than the single-stage planar system on average. The three-stage planar systems were developed by overlapping three single-stage modules. Two adjacent modules shared a common copper sheet that serves as both the top of the condensation chamber of the preceding stage and the bottom of the feedwater chamber of the following stage. The copper sheet can partially transfer the condensation heat of the preceding stage to the feedwater of the following stage, thus enhancing the system energy efficiency (<italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub>) in producing distilled water. The <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> and distillate flux of the three-stage systems were 62% and 5.01 kg m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, at the average daytime irradiance of 422 W m<sup>−2</sup>, 34% higher than the single-stage planar systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Florida Atlantic University (FAU)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/100008778</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>51</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41545_2022_Article_192.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water Quality/Water Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Water Industry/Water Technologies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Waste Water Technology / Water Pollution Control / Water Management / Aquatic Pollution</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Water is an invaluable resource for human being. However, due to the rapid growth of population and overuse of water resources, it is estimated that 1.8 billion people will live with water scarcity by 2025<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Most of them live in the rural areas of developing countries and are often forced to drink unclean water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which can lead to water-borne diseases or death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, people may also experience a temporary shortage of drinking water in disaster situations. For example, in July 2007, the flash flood in Gloucestershire, United Kingdom left 140,000 homes without drinking water for 17 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In February 2010, the tsunami caused by an earthquake in Southern Chile affected 70% of the Chilean population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and interrupted the supply of electricity and water for several days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, affordable water purification systems that require no electrical energy are crucial for water-stressed and disaster-prone areas.</p><p id="Par3">Since most of the regions facing water scarcity (e.g., Northwestern China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, Southwestern U.S.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, Northwestern Bangladesh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, West Asia, sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>) have high solar radiant exposure, solar interfacial distillation is a promising technology for off-grid water production. Following the pioneering works of Wang’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and Chen’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> groups, researchers continued inventing novel photothermal materials and let them float on water surface to enhance evaporation energy efficiency (<italic>ƞ</italic><sub>evp</sub>).

The <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>evp</sub> was calculated by dividing the total enthalpy of vaporization of evaporated water (in some cases sensible heat was also included) by the total radiant energy received on the surface of photothermal floats.</p><p id="Par4">Several groups utilized photothermal floats in the distillation systems that include both evaporation and condensation processes to produce distilled water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, few researchers quantified the system energy efficiency in producing distilled water (<italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub>), which can be calculated by dividing the total enthalpy of vaporization of the produced distilled water by the total radiant energy received by the surface of photothermal floats (often replaced by the global horizontal solar radiant exposure times the area of photothermal floats since the actual received radiant energy within the system was difficult to measure). The most recent example is a solar desalination system that used carbon black-coated aluminum plate to heat the feedwater wicked by a fiber cloth under the aluminum plate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Its <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> was reported as 24%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A previous example is a system using floating polystyrene bars wrapped by hydrophilic cellulose fabric (<italic>η</italic><sub>sys</sub> = 24%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. One limitation of photothermal floats is that one cannot tilt the system and let the surface of solar absorber receive a higher irradiance than the horizontal plane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In addition to hydrophilic photothermal floats, hydrophobic membranes coated or integrated with photothermal materials were employed for interfacial distillation. Instead of floating on the free surface of water, hydrophobic membranes were used to contain and heat the feedwater in interfacial-heating solar membrane distillation (ISMD) systems. In feed-side-heated ISMD, the feed side of the membrane was coated with photothermal materials (e.g., silver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, carbon black<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, titanium nitride nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and polydopamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>) for absorbing solar thermal energy and heating the feedwater at the air-water interface which is also the membrane-water interface. In many studies on active ISMD, the system energy efficiency in producing distilled water (<italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub>) was overestimated because the electrical energy consumed by the peristaltic pumps for circulating the feedwater, distilled water, or both was not considered. In a passive feed-side-heated ISMD system using polydimethylsiloxane/carbon nanotube/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PDMS/CNT/PVDF) membrane, the production flux of distilled water was 0.9 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> and the <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> was 60% under one sun <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Our group recently invented a passive permeate-side-heated ISMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It was also the first permeate-side-heated MD system. The permeate side of the hydrophobic membrane (i.e., 0.45 µm PVDF membrane) was coated with carbon black NPs, which absorbed solar thermal energy and transferred the heat to the feedwater that was in contact with the feed side of the membrane. Unlike the feed-side-heated ISMD in which sunlight has to pass through feedwater, sunlight only needs to pass through the air in the distillation chamber before reaching the photothermal coating in the permeate-side-heated ISMD, resulting in less attenuation and higher <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub>. Compared to the horizontal photothermal floats, the permeate-side-heated ISMD can be placed at an inclination to receive a higher irradiance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The system produced a distillate flux of 8.56 kg m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> at an average daytime irradiance of 652 W m<sup>−2</sup> which corresponds to an <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> of 67.5%, the highest single-stage <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> under natural sunlight to the best of our knowledge among all published solar distillation systems. The initial distillate flux was independent of the type of feedwater (i.e., deionized (DI) water, seawater, canal water, and municipal wastewater). It was the first interfacial distillation system that demonstrated the ability to extract potable water directly from municipal wastewater.</p><p id="Par7">One advantage of membrane distillation lies in its flexibility in increasing the area of air–water interface in a given space by containing the feedwater within a designed geometry of hydrophobic membranes. In this study, tubular permeate-side-heated ISMD systems have been developed to contain the feedwater in tubular hydrophobic membranes and increase the production rate of distilled water per unit footprint area under natural sunlight. It is the first 3D design of interfacial-heating membrane distillation. The relationship between the daily solar radiant exposure and distillate flux has been derived for tubular systems in comparison with that of planar systems. In addition, multistage (e.g., three-stage) planar permeate-side-heated ISMD systems have been built to increase the <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> of planar systems under natural sunlight through partially recovering the heat of condensation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>System energy efficiency (<italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub>) and distillate flux of single-stage planar permeate-side-heated ISMD systems at different solar radiant exposures</title><p id="Par8">The single-stage planar system (the inset in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) developed in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> was thoroughly tested under natural sunlight at different average daytime irradiances in various months to measure the <italic>ƞ</italic><sub>sys</sub> and distillate flux of the system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

In this tubular system, the upper part is the transparent distillation chamber and the lower part is the condensation chamber. A hydrophobic microporous membrane was given a tubular shape by jointing the two edges of the membrane and placed at the center of the distillation chamber. The feedwater filled the inside of the membrane tube by gravity from an elevated reservoir. Due to the hydrophobicity of the membrane, the feedwater cannot penetrate the membrane tube and the inside of the membrane tube is essentially a feedwater chamber. The outer surface of the membrane tube was coated with carbon black nanoparticles, which absorbed solar radiation and converted the radiation to heat. The heat was transferred through conduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> to the feedwater that partially entered the capillary pores of the membrane from the inside of the membrane tube. Thus, the feedwater was effectively evaporated through interfacial heating. Upon evaporation, water vapor passed through the pores of the membrane and entered the tubular transparent distillation chamber that contained the membrane tube and the steam. The outer surface of the condensation chamber was covered by a reflective heat barrier that reflected the sunlight and helped keep the inside of the chamber cool where water vapor condensed into distilled water. The tubular system was set vertically so that the distilled water was collected at the bottom of the system.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>The schematic and photograph of the tubular passive permeate-side-heated solar membrane distillation system.</title><p>The tubular system was placed vertically during operation.

The distillation chamber of the tubular system has an inner diameter of 70 mm and a height of 50 mm, which gives about the same volume (difference within 2%) as the distillation chamber of the planar system.

The system used to compare with the tubular system had a 50 mm × 50 mm membrane, a feedwater chamber of 50 mm (L) × 50 mm (W) × 14 mm (H), a transparent distillation chamber [the upper part: 60 mm (L) × 60 mm (W) × 40 mm (H); the lower part within the flange: 50 mm (L) × 50 mm (W) × 14 mm (H)], and a condensation chamber of 207 mm (L) × 60 mm (W) × 30 mm (H). The system used to compare with the three-stage planar system had a 120 mm (L) × 50 mm (W) membrane, a feedwater chamber of 120 mm (L) × 50 mm (W) × 14 mm (H), a transparent distillation chamber [the upper part: 130 mm (L) × 60 mm (W) × 40 mm (H); the lower part within the flange: 120 mm (L) × 50 mm (W) × 14 mm (H)], and a condensation chamber of 150 mm (L) × 60 mm (W) × 30 mm (H). These single-stage planar systems had no copper sheet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Distillation experiments under natural sunlight</title><p id="Par28">All the distillation experiments reported in this study were conducted under natural sunlight from sunrise to sunset. Most experiments were performed on the roof of Breezeway, FAU (26°22’19”N and 80°06’11”W), and only one experiment (the one at an average daytime irradiance of 613 W m<sup>−2</sup>) was conducted at Spanish Oaks of Condominium (26°21’28”N and 80°5’58”W). The planar (both single-stage and three-stage) systems were tilted at 30° with respect to the horizontal in most experiments, while the tubular systems and the planar systems shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref> were placed vertically (i.e., at 90° inclination). The systems were placed properly just before sunrise and the pyranometer (Hukseflux, LP02-LI19) was also set along with the systems to measure the irradiance of sunlight every 30 seconds. At the time of sunrise, all the feedwater reservoirs of the systems were filled with feedwater (i.e., DI water), and the hydrostatic pressure at the center of the membrane, exerted by the feedwater in the reservoir, was observed and recorded throughout the whole day. In order to maintain a steady hydrostatic pressure, feedwater was added every 2 h to the reservoirs to keep the water level steady. The temperature of feedwater in the reservoir was also recorded using a thermometer every 2 h during the experiments. The experiments were stopped right after sunset. Distilled water was collected from the condensation chambers after sunset, and weighed using an analytical balance (LF 224 R, Intelligent Weighing Technology) to calculate the distillate production rate per unit area of the membrane (i.e., distillate flux). Both the planar and tubular systems were also tested during the night from sunset to sunrise. However, no distilled water was produced during the night.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Footprint calculation</title><p id="Par29">For the single-stage tubular system, the outer radius of the system was 0.038 m. Thus, the circular footprint of the tubular system was 0.0045 m<sup>2</sup> when placed vertically. For the single-stage planar system with the 50 mm × 50 mm membrane, the length of this system was 0.273 m and the width was 0.067 m. Hence, the footprint of this single-stage system was 0.016 m<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 0.067 m × 0.236 m) when placed at 30° inclination to the ground. For the single-stage planar system with the 120 mm (L) × 50 mm (W) membrane, the length was 0.283 m and the width was 0.067 m. Thus, the footprint of this single-stage planar system was also 0.016 m<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 0.067 m × 0.245 m) at 30° inclination to the horizontal. For the three-stage planar system, the length of footprint was 0.51 m when placed at 30° inclination to the ground and the width was 0.067 m. So the footprint of the three-stage system was 0.034 m<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 0.51 m × 0.067 m). Flanges were not considered in the footprint calculation of planar systems as flanges may not be used in real-world applications.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by Florida Atlantic University.
