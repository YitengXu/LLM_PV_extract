However, systematic and uniform manipulation of the chemical structures of GQDs remains challenging due to the difficulty in simultaneous control of competitive reactions, i.e., growth and doping, and the complicated post-purification processes. Here, we report an efficient and scalable production of chemically tailored N-doped GQDs (NGs) with high uniformity and crystallinity via a simple one-step solvent catalytic reaction for the thermolytic self-assembly of molecular precursors. We find that the graphitization of N-containing precursors during the formation of NGs can be modulated by intermolecular interaction with solvent molecules, the mechanism of wh	ich is evidenced by theoretical calculations and various spectroscopic analyses. Given with the excellent visible-light photoresponse and photocatalytic activity of NGs, it is expected that the proposed approach will promote the practical utilization of GQDs for various applications in the near future.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Photophysical and photochemical features of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) strongly depend on their chemical nature that remains challenging to be controlled in a systematic and uniform manner.

To be appreciated as a practical alternative to the previously used materials in numerous applications, the chemical composition or configuration of GQDs should be systematically manipulated, as these features are closely related to the biocompatibility, catalytic behaviour, chemical reactivity/selectivity, and optical responses, e.g., emission dynamics, absorption/emission window, and photosensitivity, of the materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In an attempt to tailor the chemical features of GQDs, substitution of heteroatoms into the graphitic lattice and the introduction of specific chemical functional groups to the edge sites have been actively studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recently, as a simple but efficient “bottom-up” method, one-pot pyrolysis using single or multiple organic precursors has been widely utilized to prepare heteroatom-doped GQDs with lateral sizes ranging from 1 to 10 nm due to the simplicity of the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, some reports have revealed the feasibility of obtaining edge-controlled GQDs by changing the types of solvents used during the formation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Despite these early successes in the production of heteroatom-doped GQDs, there still exist many challenges in the optimization of fabrication processes, including the removal of acidic/basic intermediates and dopant residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which necessarily involve time/cost-consuming post-treatments and hinder large-scale manufacturing. Furthermore, current techniques derived from solution-based one-pot methods are insufficient to allow simultaneous control of both the structural features (crystallinity) and doping characteristics (concentrations and configurations). Essentially, this limitation is caused by either the amorphous structure of dopants or the incompatibility with thermolysis because of the high volatility of dopants and the resulting increased internal pressure of the reaction system. Moreover, the uncontrollable kinetics of subsequent competitive reactions, such as growth of graphitic domains and additive (dopant)-induced side reactions that form molecular fluorophores, may impede an intuitive prediction of the synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Additionally, further development of such synthetic strategies towards diverse applications has been hindered by the absence of detailed investigations into the correlation between optical properties and the surface status of doped GQDs, which is passivated by the incomplete carbonization of organic precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Furthermore, in the field of “traditional” organic synthesis, numerous studies have proved the crucial role of solvent parameters (hereafter referred to as “solvent effect”), including the dielectric constant, polarity, and basicity. Taking one step further, studies on the perspective of reaction kinetics and selectivity have revealed that the solvent influences on the reaction velocity, which may be described as a catalytic effect, and govern the transformation of various functional groups in organic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, despite its criticality, there have been only a few studies connecting this effect to the chemical modification of GQDs, which may reveal the mechanism of the doping profile changes in response to the solvent-assisted pyrolysis of organic precursors, e.g., glucose and citric/glutamic acids.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we report a single molecular precursor-based synthetic platform to synthesize chemically tailored N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGs) with high crystallinity and homogeneity that are self-passivated by various functional moieties with different chain lengths. Such an approach could provide a predictable synthetic tool for solvent-catalysts-aided growth of heteroatom-doped GQDs via selective and quantitative C-N bond activation. By combining experimental results with quantum chemical calculations, we determine the reaction mechanism of oxidative activation of the nitrile groups in fumaronitrile (FN) in a variety of polar solvents, as well as the relationship between the structural features and optical characteristics of NGs using both steady-state and time-dependent density functional theory (SS- and TD-DFT, respectively), which can reveal the effects of end moieties as well as π-linkers. Finally, we conclude our study by exploring one of its practical applications, namely, light-sensitized photocatalysts. Specifically, to investigate the structural effects of NGs, we first apply GQDs for photocatalytic wastewater treatment, and more importantly, their potential medical application in ultralow-level energy photodynamic therapy (UL-PDT) is also validated. Consequently, the observed differences in the photocatalytic activities of each NG prepared from different solvent systems are consistent with our pre-estimations, intuitively reconfirming the effectiveness of our fabrication approach and the significance of theoretical prediction from both chemical and optical perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and chemical characterization of NGs</title><p id="Par8">In our study, NGs were synthesized by a one-step self-assembly growth method in which the organic precursor FN was added to each of the following four different solvent media: DI water (DW), THF, butanal (Bu), and benzaldehyde (Be). As graphically summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the complete self-assembly reaction of FN proceeds via two distinctive but simultaneous processes. Most of the primary reactant in FN hydrolysis, i.e., H<sub>2</sub>O, is assumed to be supplied from moisture in the air within the reaction chamber, which is actively diffused or permeated into the reaction volume by increased pressure at high reaction temperatures. More detailed descriptions are provided in the Supplementary Information (see Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Discussion <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Illustration of the formation mechanism of chemically-tailored NGs.</title><p>Schematic diagram of the possible formation mechanisms of NGs through the thermolytic self-assembly reaction of FN, and photographs of their ethanol solution preparation under four different solvent systems.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_26122_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">First, to confirm the variations in chemical composition and bonding of each NG under different solvent effects, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) measurements were performed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref>; Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). According to the XPS results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the change in the O/C atomic ratio of NGs follows a trend opposite to that for the N/C value (top of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In addition, in terms of the chemical bonding ratios of the NGs, there is an inverse correlation between the concentration of oxidized C and that of nitrogenated C (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and bottom panel in 2c), which was also confirmed by the FT-IR data (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). The chemical structures of two representative NGs (NG_DW and NG_Be: most and least oxidized forms, respectively) are depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>. Because of the differences in functional moieties of each QD, their pH values were found to be slightly different, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>.

Complete chemical conversion of FN proceeds in two consecutive steps (Step 1: C ≡ N → CONH<sub>2</sub> and Step 2: CONH<sub>2</sub> → COOH), as depicted in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>.

Furthermore, based on the free energy calculations in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>, oxidative activation of FN would rarely be achieved in circumstances where the SSMs intervened in the net reaction and the barrier energy was accordingly increased. Therefore, those SSMs were ruled out from the potential causes of the high crystallinity in our NGs, represented with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Morphological and structural characterizations of NGs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> AFM-measured height distributions of NGs (collected at 50 dots per each sample). <bold>b</bold> Representative STEM image (top-left), corresponding IFFT image of a selected area (bottom-left, inset: FFT image), and intensity line profile (right) along the dashed line of NG_Be (atom distance of ~0.24 nm, matching with average distances in graphitic materials (1120))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. <bold>c</bold> NEXAFS spectra of four different types of NGs.

In other words, this result suggests that the solvent used is not only the medium where the chemical reactions are performed, but it also actively involves in the chemical process. Furthermore, the change in Gibbs free energy (Δ<italic>G</italic>) for this step is positive due to the negative contribution of the entropy change caused by the formation of H-bonds and increased van der Waals forces.</p><p id="Par13">More importantly, the overall profiles of the potential energy surface of FN activation depend significantly on the types of solvents. In other words, as shown in the left of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, the change in Δ<italic>G</italic> is quite different in every elementary reaction for the transformation of the –C ≡ N group to its oxidized form.

From the theoretical estimation of 60% higher activation barrier for TR1_Be than for TR1_DW, the corresponding pathway is considered relatively improbable and is simultaneously suppressed, regardless of its thermodynamic energy. The above thermodynamic and kinetic calculations signify that the SSMs can effectively control the oxidation degree of FN. Consequently, we can argue that the solvent in the reaction system does not only serve as a dispersing agent, but also it can be promoted as an active interventor which can alter the energy characteristics of the system during the intermediate and transition states of the synthesis.</p><p id="Par14">Interestingly, it was found that the values of effective Gibbs free energy (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>eff</sub>, integration of Δ<italic>G</italic> provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, f</xref>) is observed to be a monotonic increasing function of the atomic ratio of resulting NGs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and thus this trend can be fitted by a bounded exponential growth curve as plotted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>. Reminding the importance of C ≡ N bond activation in either FN or its multimeric form for the formation of NGs, this correlation seems to be reasonable because their composition modulation can be attributed to the oxidation degree of FN. Also, we investigated the reliability and predictability of the model for the chemical composition of NGs prepared under other solvent systems (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>), proving the universality and effectiveness of our approach for the production of chemically tailored GQDs.

The four resonances in the intermediate region between the π* and σ* features were observed at ~287.2 eV (CK<sub>2</sub>), ~288.3 eV (CK<sub>3</sub>), ~289.1 eV (CK<sub>4</sub>), and ~289.5 eV (CK<sub>5</sub>) and were assigned to functional groups (CK<sub>2</sub>: C–O, CK<sub>3</sub>: C=O, CK<sub>4</sub>: O–C=O and CK<sub>5</sub>: various amide groups) that decorate the basal planes and the edge sites of NGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. XPS analysis was carried out using a monochromated Al <italic>K</italic>α X-ray source (<italic>hν</italic> = 1486.6 eV). To measure the electron lifetime of NGs, TRPL spectroscopy was employed. The second harmonic generation (SHG = 370 nm) of a tunable Ti:sapphire laser (MaiTai, Spectra-Physics) with an ~100 fs pulse width and 80 MHz repetition rate was used as the excitation source. EPR measurements were performed using a CW-EPR (microwave frequency and power of 9.64 GHz and 3 mW, respectively, and modulation frequency of 100 kHz).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Preparation of TiO<sub>2</sub>@NG powders</title><p id="Par35">The powders were prepared by a mild temperature hydrothermal process to avoid further oxidation of NGs. Typically, TiO<sub>2</sub> (Aeroxide® P25, 20 mg) was added to 10 mL of NG aqueous solution (0.01 mg/mL), which was then incubated for 24 hr at 70 °C to decorate NGs on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface (agitation speed: 400 rpm); excess DI-water was removed by utilizing a vacuum evaporator. The final products (TiO<sub>2</sub>@NGs), which contain 0.5 wt% of NGs, were collected after the drying process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Photocatalytic degradation test</title><p id="Par36">Photocatalytic activities of TiO<sub>2</sub>@NG powders were evaluated by monitoring the degradation of RhB and UA under the illumination of 38.6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> of white light (&lt;400 nm cut-off). The photocatalytic experiments were carried out at room temperature. In order to investigate the photodegradation efficiency of the catalyst, the aqueous solutions before/after the photodegradation reaction were analysed by absorption and fluorescence techniques as a function of reaction time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>TD-DFT calculations</title><p id="Par37">The vertical excitations of the lowest five excited states were calculated using TD-DFT with CAM-B3LYP/6-31 + G(d) basis set. To clearly describe the diffuse excited states, we chose a double zeta basis set including polarization and diffuse functions, 6-31 + G(d). The ground state geometries of the models were optimized at B3LYP (or CAM-B3LYP)/6-31 + G(d) level of theory and confirmed by frequency calculations (Opt + Freq). Also, the relaxation of the geometries in S1 was performed at TDDFT-CAM-B3LYP/6-31 + G(d) level of theory. The solvent (solvent: ethanol) is included based on the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM). The optical bandgaps of each model were calculated to be the difference of energy between the ground and the first excited states. The atomic charges in the ground and the first excited states were obtained using the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. All calculations were carried out by Gaussian 16 software package. First, we modelled and simulated several local structures of NGs with a various number of aromatic rings (C<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>-NGs, <italic>x</italic> = 1, 2, 4, 7, 19, and 36), including different heteroatom functional groups at the edge sites. For the accurate but cost-efficient calculations, we finally selected pristine and edge-functionalized C<sub>7</sub>-GQDs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was financially supported by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Institutional Program, the Ministry of Trade, Industry &amp; Energy of Korea (20011317), and the National Research Council of Science &amp; Technology (NST) grant (CRC-20-01-NFRI).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>B.J.M. and S.B. conceived the idea and designed the experiments.
