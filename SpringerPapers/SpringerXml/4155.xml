acidification and improving soybean root growth, thereby enhancing plant nutrition and physiological responses and, in turn, crop resistance to dry spells. This study evaluated the impact of long-term (17 years) surface soil amendment on soil fertility and soybean root development, nutrition, gas exchange, carbon and antioxidant enzyme activity, and grain yield in a tropical region subject to dry spells. The treatments consisted of the following long-term soil amendments: control (no soil amendment); L alone; PG alone; and L + PG (LPG). Liming, especially when combined with PG, improved soil fertility, as evidenced by increases in pH and P, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels throughout the soil profile, but reduced Al<sup>3+</sup> and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn). The improvements in soil fertility were associated with increased root development throughout the profile. Long-term application of LPG reduced the negative impacts of dry spells on pigment concentrations, gas exchange, Rubisco and sucrose synthase activities and antioxidant metabolism, and increased soybean grain yield. Our results reveal that long-term application of LPG is an important approach for increasing the vertical movement of cationic bases and roots in no-till systems to improve soybean nutrition. Long-term amendment with LPG enhanced both carbon and antioxidant metabolism in soybean plants, resulting in higher soybean grain yield, despite the predisposition of this tropical region to dry spells.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Glycine max</italic> (L.)

Merrill) is important both as an oil–protein seed crop for livestock and aquaculture feeds and as a biofuel feedstock (Sugiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>). Soybean is unique among crops in that it can supply protein equal in quality to that of animal sources, making it an excellent protein source for the human diet (Hartman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>; Sugiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>). Demand for soybean and its derivatives has increased in the last decade, challenging the reliability of supply, stock levels, and competitive pricing (Hartman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). The anticipated growth of the global population to approximately 10 billion people by 2050 (Desa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>) and the effects of climate change (Gupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>) have heightened the need for sustainable and highly efficient agricultural practices to guarantee global food security (Rellán-Álvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Among the numerous crop system challenges faced by growers, low soil quality and reduced nutrient availability associated with water restriction (due to unpredictable weather or inappropriate management practices) are the main factors responsible for losses in agricultural production, particularly in tropical regions (Rellán-Álvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>; Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). The detrimental effects of climate change may potentially be alleviated by adopting appropriate soil management practices, particularly soil chemical correction, which is increasingly necessary to improve the acquisition of soil resources by plants (Lal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>). Soil amendments such as lime (L), a corrective agent for soil acidity with low solubility (Crusciol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>), and phosphogypsum (PG), a subsurface conditioning agent with moderate solubility (Zoca and Penn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>), can improve soil quality (Bossolani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). In no-tillage systems (NTS), L is applied superficially, which may limit its effectiveness due to its poor solubility, whereas PG has greater mobility in the soil profile but does not correct soil acidity (Zoca and Penn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>). Thus, combining L and PG can be an alternative for improving the plant growth environment in tropical soils (Bossolani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">In addition to reducing soil acidity, soil amendment with L + PG neutralizes elements toxic to plants, such as aluminum (Al<sup>3+</sup>) and manganese (Mn). Aluminum inhibits root growth, resulting in reduced water and nutrient uptake as well as plant growth (Reis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>) and thus reducing Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity promotes appropriate conditions for crop root development, particularly in deep soil layers (Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). Moreover, amendment with L + PG supplies plants with nutrients such as calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), phosphorus (P), and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-sulfur) (Crusciol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>; Bossolani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). Increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability in the subsurface promotes hormone signaling and root growth (Zoca and Penn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>), and root development into deeper soil layers is crucial for avoiding plant injury under water-deficit conditions (Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). In turn, deeper roots increase soil nutrient availability (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, P, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-sulfur), resulting in improved plant nutrition and increased photosynthetic activity. Adequate soil nutrient availability promotes photosynthetic pigment formation, energy production, activation of enzymes involved in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, photoassimilation partitioning for plant development, and the yield index (Gómez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). Well-nourished plants are more tolerant of environmental abiotic stresses and have strong antioxidant scavenging systems, which reduces cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">This study focuses on the impact of soil chemical attributes on the physiological and yield responses of soybean to long-term application of soil amendments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). According to Cusser et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>), management recommendations based on short-term studies are generally contradictory and not representative of the system’s equilibrium behavior, and therefore, long-term studies are necessary to represent the reality of management within an ecosystem. We investigated the impact of L and PG applied alone or in combination on soil fertility and root growth, especially in deeper soil layers. Simultaneously, the effects of these changes on the physiological status of soybean plants were examined under field conditions to understand how photosynthetic/carbon and antioxidant metabolism are altered by the use of soil amendments and converted into crop yield. To adequately represent the real field conditions of soybean cultivated in rainfed areas, we evaluated soybean plants cultivated under tropical field conditions (i.e., without water supplementation and in a region prone to agroclimatic risks with dry spells during the crop cycle) during the second and third growing seasons after the last soil amendment applications (referred to as the first and second growing seasons hereafter).

The soil was classified as a sandy clay–textured Typic Haplorthox (USDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2014</xref>), which corresponds to Oxisols (Jahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>). The chemical and textural properties of the soil at 0.0–0.2 m depth, determined prior to installing the experiment in 2002 (Kiehl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1979</xref>; van Raij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2001</xref>), were as follows: soil pH (CaCl<sub>2</sub>), 4.2; soil organic matter (SOM), 21 g kg<sup>−1</sup>; phosphorus (P<sub>resin</sub>), 9.2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>; potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), 1.2 mmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>; exchangeable calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), 14 mmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>; exchangeable magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), 5 mmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>; total acidity at pH 7 (H + Al), 37 mmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 57.2 mmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>; and base saturation (BS), 35%. The soil particle size distribution (inorganic matrix) in the 0.0–0.2-m layer was 545 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of clay, 108 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of silt and 347 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of sand. The clay content at 0.2–0.4 m was 360 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. The climate is Cwa, which corresponds to a mesothermic type with dry winters and hot summers according to the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system (Alvares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>). The long-term (1956–2019) maximum and minimum mean temperatures during the soybean growing season were 26.1 °C and 15.3 °C, and the average annual precipitation was 1360 mm (Unicamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The experiment was designed in randomized complete blocks (RCB) with four replications. The size of each plot was 56.7 m<sup>2</sup> (6.3 m × 9.0 m). The following treatments were applied: (i) control (no soil amendment); (ii) lime (L); (iii) phosphogypsum (PG); and (iv) lime + phosphogypsum (LPG). From 2002 to 2019, crop fertilization was performed in the same way in each treatment, and only the soil amendments specified in the treatment were applied. The anhydrous carbonate mineral (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) containing 166 g kg<sup>−1</sup> Ca and 105 g kg<sup>−1</sup> Mg, and the PG contained 200 g kg<sup>−1</sup> Ca, 150 g kg<sup>−1</sup> S, &lt; 1g kg<sup>−1</sup> P, and &lt; 1g kg<sup>−1</sup> F. At the beginning of the experiment (2002), the L rate was defined according to soil chemical analysis at 0.0–0.2 m depth, and 2.7 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> of L was applied with the aim of raising the base saturation (BS) to 70% (van Raij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1997</xref>). The PG rate of 2.1 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> was calculated according to van Raij et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1997</xref>) by multiplying the clay content (0.2–0.4 m depth) by a factor 6.</p><p id="Par8">The soil amendments were reapplied when the BS in the L treatment fell to below 50%, which was verified annually. When L reapplication was necessary, PG was also reapplied (2.1 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>). In total, the soil amendments were applied four times, including in 2002, 2004, and 2010 (2.0 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> of L and 2.1 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> of PG). For the fourth application, which occurred in October 2016, updates to the methods used in Brazil led to changes in the calculation of the L and PG rates. Specifically, the L rate calculation method was revised to consider the 0.0–0.4-m layer. The 0.0–0.4-m layer was chosen as the new criterion based on results obtained by Carmeis Filho et al.

Short dry periods during the summer cropping season are common in tropical regions (Cunningham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). When temperatures and evapotranspiration are high, even short dry periods can cause considerable crop yield losses, especially when such dry periods coincide with critical periods of crop development, such as germination, flowering, and grain filling (Basu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). The higher Al<sup>3+</sup> content in low-fertility acidic tropical soils affects root growth (Bossolani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>).

Numerous studies have demonstrated that, over the long term, L amendment efficiently increases root growth, improves soil aggregation (Carmeis Filho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>; Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>; Ferrari Neto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2021</xref>), reduces runoff and erosion (Tebebu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>), and increases soil fertility in the uppermost soil layers (Nora and Amado <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013</xref>; Grover et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>; Auler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). However, the effects of L on soil chemical properties in subsoil layers have not been comprehensively examined. Overall in the present study, the effects of PG application alone on soil attributes compared with the control were small (with the exception of soil pH, which was unchanged) and were most pronounced in the superficial layers. Although PG alone was not efficient in reducing soil acidity, combining this soil amendment with L (LPG) potentiated the effects of L (e.g., increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, BS, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-S levels and decreased Al<sup>3+</sup> levels), suggesting that PG is an important complement to L in tropical soils (Crusciol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>; Bossolani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>; Moretti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). PG is a widely available and inexpensive soil amendment (Zoca and Penn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>) that provides numerous benefits to agricultural systems, especially when combined with L (Crusciol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>; Bossolani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). Upon application to soil, PG quickly dissociates into SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-S, which reduces the harmful effects of Al<sup>3+</sup> throughout the soil profile (Reis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (fertilizing action).</p><p id="Par47">The alleviation of soil acidity by L correlated significantly with increased nutrient availability. In the uppermost layers (0.0−0.2 m), application of L (regardless of PG addition) increased P availability and SOM input despite reducing Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn levels. SOM is the main source of micronutrients for plants, especially in the arable layer (0.0−0.2 m), where SOM content is higher (Fageria and Stone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). SOM is also the main source of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-S in soils, and the increase in the S concentration in L-amended soil can be explained by the increase in SOM content in the uppermost soil layers due to the higher input of crop residues (shoot and root) over time (Kopittke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>). The decrease in micronutrient availability due to surface liming can be circumvented by regularly applying micronutrients (as done in this study) or applying conventional fertilizers (N–P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>–K<sub>2</sub>O) plus micronutrients in the same input.</p><p id="Par48">The improvements in soil chemical quality were reflected in enhanced soybean root growth and well-nourished soybean plants. The increase in soybean root development is likely attributable to increased availability of exchangeable cations, mainly Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in deeper layers and reduced Al<sup>3+</sup> content (Ritchey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1982</xref>; Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). The proportion of roots distributed in deeper layers was highest in the LPG treatment, followed by the L treatment, echoing the pattern of soil fertility parameters. Calcium is required during cell division and elongation (Ritchey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1995</xref>), which are disrupted by Al<sup>3+</sup> (Reis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>). Therefore, improving chemical attributes throughout the entire soil profile can significantly improve root development and distribution by reducing the concentration of roots in surface layers and encouraging root development in deeper layers of the soil. Longer and deeper roots can efficiently take up water and nutrients from deep layers (Rellán-Álvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>), as evidenced in this study by the significantly higher leaf concentrations of N, Ca, and Mg in soybean plants in the L and LPG treatments. Improving root growth and distribution is fundamental for reducing the negative effects of low water availability during crop development. Low water availability is common in tropical regions (Carmeis Filho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>) and was observed during both growing seasons in this study. In a region with constant rainfall and lower evapotranspiration rates (subtropical region), Caires et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>) observed an increase in the proportion of roots at depths shallower than 0.20 m only. By contrast, root development increased at depths of up to 1.0 m under tropical conditions in the present study, highlighting the importance of amendment with L and PG to guarantee food production under unpredictable weather (Rellán-Álvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>) in a scenario of climate change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Leaf pigments, gas exchange and carbon metabolism</title><p id="Par49">Leaf pigment concentrations (Chl <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, total and carotenoids) were highest in the treatments that received L (L and LPG), probably due to higher soil nutrient availability and nutrient uptake by soybean roots. In photosynthesis, chlorophylls are responsible for capturing light, which excites electrons used to produce reducing and energetic compounds (NADPH and ATP) for reactions of the Calvin cycle (Croft et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). Carotenoids act as antenna pigments for capturing light and protecting the photosynthetic apparatus against photodestruction by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during abiotic environmental stresses (Gómez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">Pearson correlation analysis indicated a positive relationship between leaf pigment concentrations and the photosynthetic potential of soybean plants. In the L and LPG treatments, the <italic>A</italic> rate increased to the detriment of soybean leaf pigment concentrations. Heat and water stress are exacerbated in tropical environments, resulting in greater declines in crop yields (Paustian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2004</xref>). However, under the conditions of the present study, <italic>gs</italic> and WUE increased proportionally with the <italic>A</italic> rate. The <italic>A</italic> rate is mainly reduced through stomatal closure or metabolic impairment (Basu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>), as observed in the control and PG treatments. In these treatments, <italic>gs</italic> was significantly lower, whereas <italic>ic</italic> (indicating low CO<sub>2</sub> fixation) and <italic>E</italic> were high, suggesting dysfunction of stomatal control. Stomatal control is the immediate plant response to drought stress (Gupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">In photosynthesis, reducing power and energy produced in the photochemical phase are used to fix CO<sub>2</sub>, and this process is highly dependent on tight coordination of enzymatic activity and production of metabolic intermediates (Choudhury and Behera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>). Metabolic impairment during low water and nutrient availability is mainly caused by changes in carbon metabolism (Basu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> fixation efficiency is highly dependent on Rubisco activity, which was higher in the L and, in particular, LPG treatments, corroborating the positive correlations of pigment concentrations with gas exchange. Our findings also indicated changes in source–sink relationships, which determine the grain yield of crops (Ceylan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Low translocation of carbohydrates from source to sink implies less filling of grains or even less capacity to promote root growth, reducing crop establishment under low water availability (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>). Thus, the sink strength (ability of an organ to import photoassimilates) (Basu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>) is much lower in plants established in low-fertility environments. Furthermore, the low Susy activity in soybean leaves in the control and PG treatments suggests that the process of cleavage of sucrose molecules by Susy (and invertases) for metabolism and conversion into energy and carbon skeletons for plant metabolism was greatly compromised by the poor soil fertility and nutrition (Stein and Granot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">The main soil factors driving soybean carbon metabolism were verified by RDA and confirmed by correlation analysis. PERMANOVA segregated the treatments into three groups: LPG; L; and control and PG. This result indicates that PG application alone was not sufficient to improve soil attributes and, in turn, alter carbon metabolism in soybean plants compared with the control treatment. By contrast, L increased carbon metabolism, and the effects of L were even greater when combined with PG (LPG). Alleviation of soil acidity was the primary factor responsible for increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> availability and reducing Al<sup>3+</sup>, which enhanced Rubisco and Susy activities. Calcium and Mg are essential nutrients for photosynthesis and are involved in many other plant development pathways, such as cell division and elongation and resistance to environmental stress (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2019</xref>). Calcium participates in stomatal movements and regulates photosynthetic enzymes during carbon assimilation and chloroplast movement in photosynthetic cells depending on light conditions. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> availability decreases photosynthetic capacity by reducing the activities of Rubisco and ATPases (Cakmak and Kirkby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>), and Mg<sup>2+</sup> is also an essential component of the chlorophyll molecule and plays a central role in partitioning of photoassimilates by plant tissues (Ceylan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Soybean plants are highly sensitive to Al<sup>3+</sup> (Reis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>), as confirmed by the negative impacts of the high concentrations of Al<sup>3+</sup> in the control and PG treatments on soybean plant parameters. At toxic concentrations, exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> decreases plant root growth and WUE (Carmeis Filho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>; Reis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>), compromising crop development and yield.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Antioxidant metabolism</title><p id="Par53">Continuous photosynthetic reactions under low water and nutrient availability result in the accumulation of ROS (Cuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>) such as singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>), hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>−</sup>), and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Farmer and Mueller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>). ROS can cause serious damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, resulting in lipid peroxidation (Loix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>). To mitigate the effects of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes are activated that catalyze reactions of ROS to reduce cell damage (Farooq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>).

This difference can be explained by the compromised transport of carbohydrates over a long distance (source–sink) (Ceylan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>), which reduces grain filling. Grain filling is dependent on the translocation of carbohydrates from source-to-sink organs, a process mediated by Mg<sup>2+</sup> nutrition (Cakmak and Kirkby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). In addition, sucrose is the main carbohydrate transported (via phloem) to grains, and the production of sucrose is strongly influenced by Mg<sup>2+</sup> nutrition (Ceylan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Our results are consistent with these characteristics of grain filling, as the plants established in soils that received liming (L and LPG) had higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> nutrition (higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> availability and uptake by increasing root growth) and less sucrose accumulation in leaves (greater translocation efficiency), culminating in higher grain yield. In addition, the improvements in soybean metabolism and photoassimilate translocation to grains resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of crude protein in soybean grains. Crude protein concentration is an important characteristic related to grain quality and plays a critical role in human and animal nutrition (Karr-Lilienthal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">This study in a tropical region clearly demonstrated that liming benefits soil properties and soybean development. In addition, the combined application of L and PG (LPG) potentiated the beneficial effects of L, providing greater support for grain production, especially in periods of low water availability during soybean development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">This study makes an important contribution to understanding the long-term changes below- and aboveground in response to lime and phosphogypsum application. Our results demonstrate that liming is an important tool for improving acidic, low-fertility soils and that the effects of liming are enhanced by phosphogypsum amendment. The combined application of liming and phosphogypsum increased soybean root growth and the ability of plants to acquire water and nutrients from deeper soil layers. These findings have important implications for corrective soil management practices, particularly for the surface application of lime and/or phosphogypsum to increase soybean metabolism. The chemical properties of soil clearly impact soybean metabolism and production, and high-fertility soils enable high photosynthetic performance coupled with increased antioxidant activity. Long-term management with lime and phosphogypsum is therefore an effective approach to increase the grain yield of soybean cultivated in tropical regions predisposed to short dry spells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>C.A.C.C., E.F.C., T.J.C.A., J.C.C., and A.R.R. would like to thank the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for an award for excellence in research.
