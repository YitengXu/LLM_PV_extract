However there remains a paucity of information about overall capability across the yeast family tree. Here, 11 diverse species of yeasts with genetic backgrounds representative of different branches of the family tree were investigated. They were compared for their abilities to grow on a range of sugar carbon sources, to produce potential platform chemicals from such substrates and to ferment hydrothermally pretreated rice straw under simultaneous saccharification and fermentation conditions. The yeasts differed considerably in their metabolic capabilities and production of ethanol. A number could produce significant amounts of ethyl acetate, arabinitol, glycerol and acetate in addition to ethanol, including from hitherto unreported carbon sources. They also demonstrated widely differing efficiencies in the fermentation of sugars derived from pre-treated rice straw biomass and differential sensitivities to fermentation inhibitors. A new catabolic property of <italic>Rhodotorula mucilaginosa</italic> (NCYC 65) was discovered in which sugar substrate is cleaved but the products are not metabolised. We propose that engineering this and some of the other properties discovered in this study and transferring such properties to conventional industrial yeast strains could greatly expand their biotechnological utility.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_14641.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Large amounts of fossil-derived energy and chemicals are consumed globally each year.

Subsequently, the lag phase (LP), doubling time (DT) and efficiency (ΔOD) were calculated by using PRECOG (see  Methodology). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> employs a red-amber-green colour coding to show the extensive variation in LP, DT and ΔOD. The way these values reflect properties of growth curves are described in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. For LP and DT, darker green reflects a shorter time taken, red indicates a longer time taken. For ΔOD, darker green indicates stronger growth and red means weaker growth. It is apparent that there is considerable diversity in the LP, DT and ΔOD between the different strains. Only NCYC 2577 and NCYC 10 could grow on all 13 sugars. NCYC 49, NCYC4 and NCYC 16 grew on fewer sugars and those strains also exhibited generally shorter doubling times or lag phases. Similarly, NCYC 2791, NCYC 65 and NCYC 2826 could not grow on either rhamnose or fucose. Maltose was not an ideal carbon source for NCYC 2791. Cellobiose, xylose and lactose were not utilised effectively by NCYC 65 and ribose, cellobiose and xylose were poorly utilised by NCYC 2826. NCYC 2433 gave a short LP and DT on maltose, galactose and mannose but the growth (ΔOD) was poor. NCYC 31 and NCYC 568 could both grow efficiently on glucose, fructose and mannose, but poorly on sucrose. NCYC 568 grew better than NCYC 31 on maltose whilst NCYC 31 grew better than NCYC 568 in cellobiose.

Less than 5% of ribose, rhamnose, arabinose and fucose were consumed by any strain. In contrast, the other sugars were generally completely consumed by at least one or more strains. Therefore, ribose, rhamnose, arabinose and fucose were not investigated further. Nearly all the glucose, fructose and mannose were consumed by most strains (along with the substantial production of ethanol) except NCYC 65, NCYC 10 and NCYC 49. A smaller number of strains quantitatively consumed and fermented galactose and sucrose to ethanol. Xylose was generally poorly consumed, although NCYC 49 utilised nearly 50%.

The other metabolites were produced in trace quantities. Ethanol was the most common product detected after fermentation of all sugars as well as acetic acid. Notwithstanding differences between the yeasts, arabinitol, glycerol, succinic acid and ethyl acetate were produced from 8 sugars but not from lactose. Although the yield of lactic acid was generally low; it was still produced from all sugars. Citric acid was produced widely but negligibly from most of sugars but significantly from galactose. Like citric acid, 2,3-butanediol was significantly produced by only maltose and galactose. Higher yields of pyruvic acid were detected from glucose, fructose, mannose and sucrose compared with the other sugars. Interestingly, malic acid was only produced by NCYC 16 and then only from fructose. Ethyl acetate was significantly produced from 8 of 9 sugars except galactose by several strains. NCYC 16 produced highest amount of ethyl acetate from those sugars. Arabinitol was also significantly produced from 8 of the 9 sugars (excluding lactose) by several strains especially by NCYC 10.</p><p id="Par11">Multiple additional products were also significantly detected by NCYC 568 and NCYC 2577 fermentation from several fermented sugars. For example, NCYC 568 could produce glycerol and ethyl acetate in addition to ethanol from several sugars. Similarly, 3 different readily quantifiable chemicals could be produced by NCYC 2577 - in addition to ethanol: acetic acid was produced from glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose and galactose; glycerol was produced from glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose.

This observation was investigated further (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Closer examination of the NMR spectra showed that the fermentation liquor from NCYC 65 after growth on sucrose showed a loss of peaks associated with sucrose (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a and b</xref>), but showed instead peaks associated with glucose (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) and fructose (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Hence, sucrose was simply cleaved into glucose and fructose, and NCYC 65 consumed neither glucose nor fructose. NCYC 65 could therefore potentially provide a direct biological route to industrial invertase function without necessarily purifying the enzyme(s).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The NMR spectrum of NCYC 65 in sucrose (<bold>a</bold>), sucrose standard (<bold>b</bold>), glucose standard (<bold>c</bold>) and fructose standard (<bold>d</bold>).

At an initial substrate loading of 5% w/w (50 mg/ml, see  Methodology), the maximum theoretical ethanol yield is 9.89 mg/ml (50 mg/ml raw rice straw containing 38.66% glucose potentially gives a glucose concentration of 19.33 mg/ml. Thus, according to the equation: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (glucose) = 2CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (ethanol) + 2CO<sub>2,</sub> maximum ethanol theoretically produced should be no more than 9.885 mg/ml).

There is considerable interest in biofuel production from lignocellulosic hemicelluloses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> since xylose is the second most abundant fermentable sugar in lignocellulosic materials. Naturally-occurring pentose-fermenting yeasts are limited, and include <italic>Pichia</italic> (<italic>Scheffersomyces stipites</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; <italic>Candida shehatae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Hence there has been significant effort to genetically modify yeasts to enhance this property whilst improving hydrolysate inhibitor tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Pentoses and lactose can be fermented by bacteria, fungi and certain yeast strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Ethyl acetate is an important platform chemical that can be used as a microbiologically-degradable and environmentally friendly solvent in the manufacture of food, glues, inks and perfumes. The world’s annual demand of ethyl acetate was 2.5 million tons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, however recent production of it was only 1.7 million tons mainly produced via chemical processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study, ethyl acetate was produced in largest quantities by NCYC 16 (<italic>Wickerhamomyces anomala</italic>) from a range of sugar substrates, extending the findings of Walker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> who identified <italic>Pichia anomala</italic> (<italic>recently renamed as Wickerhamomyces anomala</italic>) as a high ethyl acetate producer and compared it with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, and Kurita<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and Rojas, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> who had carried out fermentation of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>anomala</italic> on malt agar medium and glucose respectively. The present study has further demonstrated that the yield of ethyl acetate varies significantly when fermented in different sugars (glucose, mannose, sucrose and maltose). For example, ethyl acetate was produced more from fructose than from glucose by NCYC 16. This may be due to the efficiency of conversion via different metabolic pathways of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>anomala</italic>. Glucose is firstly metabolised via multiple pathways - to glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) and then portioned for growing biomass (cells) or converted to fructose-6-P (fructose-6-phosphate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In contrast, fructose is directly metabolised to fructose-6-P and then further irreversibly phosphorylated to fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Yields may also be affected by levels of oxygen which can inhibit or enhance ethyl acetate production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Further research will be required to optimise the conditions for enhancing ethyl acetate production by NCYC 16 and to compare its phenotype to additional closely related NCYC strains. Preliminary results have strongly-indicated that ethyl acetate production may be significantly enhanced by intermediate levels of air or oxygen (results not shown).</p><p id="Par17">Arabinitol is currently synthesised via a chemical reaction requiring catalysis at high temperature, and it is an interesting platform chemical that has the potential to be used as a non-nutritive sweetener and as a feedstock in producing ethylene glycol, propylene, enantiopure compounds, arabinoic and xylonic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This study also observed, we believe for the first time, that high arabinitol yields could be produced by NCYC 568 (<italic>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii</italic>) and NCYC 2577 (<italic>Kazachstania servazzii</italic>) from a range of sugars (both hexoses and pentoses), and in NCYC49 (<italic>Galactomyces candidus</italic>) from mannose. NCYC 10 (<italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic>) was also found to produce considerable quantities of arabinitol at levels higher even than ethanol. This confirms and extends previous studies that reported accumulation of arabinitol from a range of carbon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">NCYC 31 was the only strain in the set which could convert cellobiose largely into ethanol due to its ability to produce β-glucosidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and may provide useful genetic information for bioethanol production. Similarly, NCYC 65 may be a potential enzyme producer which can simply cleave sucrose to glucose and fructose monomers, presumably by invertase activity. However, how NCYC 65 obtains energy is not clear – a careful mass balance will need to be carried out to clarify whether any of the glucose or fructose are metabolised. It is interesting that NCYC 65 grows more rapidly in sucrose than in glucose, although we did not assess growth of the yeast in both fructose and glucose mixtures. An understanding of the genetics and biochemistry in comparison with other strains might be used as a first step to improve conversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose. NCYC 65 was unable to ferment any of the 13 sugars significantly. However, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a strain of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>mucilaginosa</italic> could produce acetylxylan esterase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Such an esterase could remove certain substituents of hemicelluloses such as acetyl groups, which could potentially enhance the activity of xylanases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, a high fatty acids accumulation strain of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>mucilaginosa</italic> was reported in the research of Li, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. They mentioned those fatty acids could be used for biodiesel.</p><p id="Par19">The fermentation conditions created using pre-treated raw materials will be much more complex than environments created by purified sugars. In this study, each strain’s ability to produce ethanol was assessed and compared between enzymatic hydrolysates of rice straw and fermentation on purified sugars. Results were very consistent between the two substrates for all strains except NCYC 2577. NCYC 2577 could ferment purified glucose but was not very effective at fermenting the glucose from rice straw. It is possible that NCYC 2577 is particularly sensitive to inhibitors at very low levels (that might remain even after washing). Inhibitors of yeast fermentation are produced during unavoidable pre-treatments and yeasts can demonstrate considerable variation in their response to such chemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. There are some ways to reduce the effects of inhibitors and enhance the yield of products. For example, detoxification of hydrolysates and the use of fully or partially inhibitor resistant yeast strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. It may be possible to improve the resistance of yeasts to inhibitors by genetic improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Additional fine-tuning of the pre-treatment process may also be helpful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">In conclusion, this study presented information on yeast behaviours when grown on a range of pure carbon sources, identifying the key metabolites produced by some of strains across the different sugar substrates. It has demonstrated that the chosen phylogenetic diversity of the strain set was matched by phenotype diversity, highlighting the importance of screening widely across the vast yeast taxonomy for key bio-industrial traits. Furthermore, by evaluating the ability of yeast strains to ferment rice straw hydrolysates and comparing those data with fermentation of purified sugars, this study has highlighted the challenges that need to be addressed when attempting to exploit yeasts industrially. Nevertheless, we have identified significant gaps in knowledge that would be worthy of further research, including the possibility of creating ethyl acetate or D-arabinitol from raw materials, and the exploitation of NCYC 65 for sucrose hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Yeast strains and carbohydrates</title><p id="Par21">The genomes of a set of 94 diverse yeast strains selected from the National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC) were paired-end sequenced at the Earlham Institute, Norwich (formerly the Genome Analysis Centre) using an Illumina HiSeq. 2000 sequencer and TruSeq libraries, with 2 × 100 bp reads derived from inserts of size 500 bp.
