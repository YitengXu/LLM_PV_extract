In fact, the way nurses and doctors train is through extensive and intensive practice [1]. In other words, practice-based research has been used to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice [2]. Practice based research networks have also been gaining on importance in healthcare as ways of addressing research questions informed by practicing clinicians. They aim to gather data and improve existing practices of primary care [3], practice-based research is not only about gaining new knowledge via practice and improving existing practices.</p><p id="Par3"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4">In this presentation/paper I explain and highlight the role of practice-based research as an instrument for educational innovation in healthcare sciences.</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par6">I used interview excerpts and examples of projects related to healthcare at different universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands and Germany (also known as polytechnics in Portugal) to advance the role of practice-based research in educational innovation. This type of research is an integral part of teaching and curricular assignments in the healthcare settings in the Netherlands and Germany, and particularly at universities of applied sciences. I emphasized how practice-based research can improve and enrich the curricula, while at the same time, building necessary skills of future healthcare professionals and improving practices in already existing healthcare institutions.</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par8">I show that practice-based research is in fact short term problem-oriented research which serves educational purposes by upgrading students’ and teachers’ skills and knowledge of the profession and dynamics in the work environment; which also has the potential to improve company products or design solutions and at the same time contribute to local and regional innovation in professions and profession related institutions [4-5]. Its role is multidimensional and dialectic insofar it serves multitude goals and is accomplished in dialogue among relevant stakeholders [6]. Practical suggestions for healthcare educators and practitioners in designing their curricula to incorporate the basic elements of this practice-based research are also offered in this presentation/paper.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par10">Practice-based research is more than knowledge acquisition via practice. Its role and goals expand to enriching educational curricula with a more comprehensive engagement of external and professional stakeholders, at the same time contributing to student soft and professional skill development and solving stakeholder problems or optimizing services and products at local or regional levels.</p><p id="Par11"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par12">1.

Sexual revolution in the old age</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Francisco J Hernández-Martínez (francisco.hernandezmartinez@ulpgc.es)</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 35001 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, España</title><p id="Par20"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par21"><italic>“Do not you think your grandmother has sex? What happens with old gays? Why does a kiss between two elders tenderizes us and we do not think it is erotic”</italic> (interview, Ricardo Iacub, 2018). It still impacts us, and what do we do with it? Do we let it pass? Do we encourage them?</p><p id="Par22">Throughout the centuries, sex has been postulated as the impulse that gives life to people. This word, of Latin origin, has always aroused much interest in society and in all stages of life; but it must be differentiated from “sexuality”, because it contemplates various aspects among which it is found; sex, identities and gender roles, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, reproduction and sexual orientation [1-6]. Sexuality is a vital dimension that is present in all stages of life, at least since adolescence. It contributes significantly to health and quality of life and is, moreover, a right recognized by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) [4, 7-9]. Despite this, old age has traditionally been considered as a stage in which sexual needs would be absent, in which people are no longer interested or have the capacity to lead an active sexual life [3-8, 11]. Master and Johnson, two famous American sexologists, argued that older people should fight against a false belief, which considers that “<italic>sexual incompetence is a natural component of the aging process</italic>”. This belief limits access to sexuality due to fear of failure, to consider that it is no longer correct, that it can be sick or perverse. The same authors pointed out that many of their patients had gone to priests, rabbis, doctors or psychologists and that they had received the answer “<italic>it is logical at their age</italic>” [3, 7, 10]</p><p id="Par23">The studies carried out, in our country and internationally, show that the majority of the elderly, and especially those who have a partner, are still sexually active until very old ages [6-9]. The keys to continue carrying and enjoying a quality sexual life in old age should be recognized and admitted at a social level, and among others, we should start; to be free of prejudices and stereotypes that condemn the elderly to lack of desire, or that associate sexuality in old age to something dirty or morally condemnable. Stop associating youth and sexuality. Do not assume the possible problems or difficulties that may appear as irreversible barriers. Age influences the decrease in sexual activity and interest, but not in satisfaction. It is demonstrated that sex and sexuality play an important role in healthy and full aging [1-3, 6-9, 11]. Taking into account these premises, throughout the presentation will present the results of a study conducted in the Canary Islands among people over 65 years, users of senior centers whose main objective was; obtain data on sexual activity, sexuality and whether age-related pathologies have affected their sexual relations. Against these prejudices, older adults need, want and seek some kind of loving exchange; “<italic>Old people want and need to talk about sex</italic>”, and also young people need to think that we have a lifetime to continue enjoying and experimenting with our sexuality.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par25">1.

Physical and cognitive decline, associated with frailty, potentiate the development of geriatric syndromes and lead to a decrease in self-care, depressive vulnerability and a decrease in quality of life [2]. Adapted physical exercise and cognitive stimulation allow the maintenance of physical and cognitive capacities, which is reflected in an improvement on the functional status of the elderly and in a reduction of associated comorbidities [3].</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par41">To promote independent living in frail older adults by improving cognition and gait ability and using assistive products.</p><p id="Par42"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par43">It is planned to develop a combined intervention that will be composed by a digital cognitive stimulation program and an adapted physical exercise program. It is also being developed an auto-blocking kit mechanism for rolling walkers as an assistive product that could be used during the physical exercise program. A randomized-controlled trial will be developed to test the efficacy of the combined intervention in frail older adults. At the same time, a web platform will be developed and it will be used as a repository, providing digital intervention’ materials and results.</p><p id="Par44"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par45">Through the implementation of a multidisciplinary strategy, significant benefits are expected in the prevention and maintenance of physical and cognitive decline of the frail older adults. It is hoped that for frail older adults the combined intervention and its digital components would be synonymous of autonomy and improvement of their quality of life, contributing to active aging. The project, being based and tested in clinical practice, will guide health professionals, caregivers and general public to promote the independence of this population.</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par47">Cognitive interventions and physical exercise have impact on cognitive decline, a condition that assumes more importance once it is related with frailty in older adults. This multidisciplinary strategy gives the opportunity to older adults to act actively in their health through the spontaneous performance of cognitive and physical exercises available on the web platform. The components of the combined intervention will allow better reintegration of this population into society of today’s world. By promoting research policies among educational institutions and health service delivery institutions, the MIND &amp; GAIT project will make health care available to the frail elderly population more accessible to professionals, caregivers and general public.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par49">NCT03390478</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par51">The current abstract is being presented on behalf of a research group.

The Southern European countries, namely Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, although the reforms of the 1970s and 1980s introduced universal national health services, social inequalities in health only became a critical issue in the late 1990s. However, the issue of health inequalities became a priority from 2010-2011, when (although with different degrees of severity) the four countries began to feel the first effects of the financial crisis. Various studies have identified the impact of the economic crisis on the most vulnerable population groups, with increasing rates of mental health disorders and a rise in suicides.</p><p id="Par66"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par67">After a brief contextualization of the welfare state in southern European countries and a characterization of health systems in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, the main health inequalities are described, identifying the potential inequity induced by the reform processes undertaken and the current austerity policies implemented.</p><p id="Par68"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par69">The study resulted from a non-systematic literature review, based on the Scoping review proposal. A total of 74 publications were analysed.</p><p id="Par70"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par71">The analysis has highlighted common characteristics and trends in the Southern European health systems, as well as some significant differences between them. In the four countries, the social gradient (particularly in education, income, and work status) is the principal determinant factor in health inequalities. Another key aspect is the steady increase in out-of-pocket spending in health as a percentage of total health spending in all four countries, markedly in Greece and Portugal. The analysis has identified potential inequalities induced by the reform processes, as result of new relations between the public and private sectors in services provision. Another example of how health systems produce inequalities is the rising proportion of users’ health expenses covered by co-payments and user fees. Geographic inequality in health is another critical issue, observed in all four Southern European countries. Finally, the recent debate in the international literature on the relationship between different welfare state regimes and health inequalities will be discussed.</p><p id="Par72"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par73">The crisis and austerity policies have greatly increased the level of dissatisfaction with healthcare provision in these countries.</p><p id="Par74"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par75">Health Inequalities, Health Systems, Economic Recession, Southern European Countries.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>S6 CBmeter- a new medical device for early screening of metabolic diseases</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Maria P Guarino<sup>1,2,3</sup>, Gabriel Brito<sup>1,4</sup>, Marlene Lages<sup>1</sup>, Rui Fonseca-Pinto<sup>1,4</sup>, Nuno Lopes<sup>1,4</sup></title><sec id="Sec19"><title><sup>1</sup>Center for Innovative Care and Health Technology, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>School of Health Sciences, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal; <sup>3</sup>Chronic Diseases Research Center, NOVA Medical School, 1150-082 Lisbon, Portugal; <sup>4</sup>School of Technology and Management, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria; 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec20"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Maria P Guarino (maria.guarino@ipleiria.pt)</title><p id="Par76"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par77">Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent disease worldwide which is asymptomatic in about 44% of patients being critical to search for new ways of early diagnosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the etiology of this disease may be associated with alterations in the function of the carotid body (CB), a chemosensor organ located within the bifurcation of the carotid artery. In animal models of metabolic syndrome, it was observed that the CBs are overactivated, underlying diseases such as obesity, hypertension and T2DM. This discovery provided a new paradigm in the neuroendocrinology field, suggesting that diagnostic function of the CBs has predictive value for the development of metabolic diseases. Despite this fact, it is not common in clinical practice to look at the CBs as organs associated with endocrine dysfunction and we believe this is probably due to the nonexistence of a user-friendly, portable medical device that diagnosis the function of the CBs.</p><p id="Par78"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par79">The general aim of this work is to develop a novel device that evaluates the function of the carotid bodies - a CBmeter. We are also developing a standard test meal to be used as a physiological dynamic test during CBmeter utilization.</p><p id="Par80"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par81">This medical device will synchronously assess several physiological variables: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure variation, arterial pulse oximetry and circulating glucose, as well as the physiological responses to hyperoxia and meal ingestion. The results obtained will be analyzed using MatLab, in order to develop an algorithm with predictive value for early diagnosis of metabolic diseases. We are also developing a standard test mixed- meal to assess post-prandial glucose excursions with the CBmeter. The work is currently in the prototype development phase.</p><p id="Par82"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par83">A preliminary pilot-test performed with the prototype revealed that all the proposed variables are assessable with the CBmeter. The standardized test meal used in the pilot-test caused a glucose excursion curve that stabilized 30 minutes after ingestion, being suitable for metabolic evaluation with the CBmeter. Interstitial glucose variation was 16.6mg/dl glucose with a latency time of 21min. Heart rate did not vary significantly after the meal ingestion.</p><p id="Par84"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par85">The CBmeter prototype is currently optimized to be used in a medical device clinical-trial with healthy volunteers. The mixed meal developed has proven to be suited in healthy volunteers to determine variations in CB-related cardiorespiratory parameters.</p><p id="Par86"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par87">Project funded by FCT/SAICT-POL/23278/2016</p><p id="Par88"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par89">Carotid body, Diabetes, Early diagnosis, Medical device.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>S7 Help to care for users and caregivers: Help2care</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Maria dos Anjos Coelho Rodrigues Dixe<sup>1,2</sup> (maria.dixe@ipleiria.pt)</title><sec id="Sec23"><title><sup>1</sup>Center for Innovative Care and Health Technology, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>School of Health Sciences, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal</title><p id="Par90">There are several studies showing that the family members providing care to their relatives need to acquire abilities that enable them to be competent in their performance, having the health care professionals an indispensable role in their training [1].

The Social Representations conduct “<italic>the behaviors and the practices and, in this way, justify the positions taken and the behaviors</italic>” [3].

However, even multimodal training tends to focus on exercises separately in single physical, cognitive or environmental hazards variables. An ecological approach to explain phenomena’s such as fall occurrence, underlines not only the accumulative effect of isolated variables but also interactions between different variables.</p><p id="Par174"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par175">To reduce a set of correlated variables to a smaller number that may explain fall occurrence.</p><p id="Par176"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par177">187 older adults aged 65 to 96 years were assessed for falling risk factors. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed including data from the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) [2], Gait Scale [3], Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB) [4], body composition - fat body mass percentage (FBM %), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [5], Environmental Hazards Scale (EH) [6], health conditions (HC), time up and go test (TUG) [2] and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [7]. Factors with eigenvalues of at least 1.0 were retained and a varimax rotation was used to produce interpretable factors. A binary regression analysis was performed using the forward stepwise (conditional) technique to identify the most significant components explaining fall occurrence.

In component 1, the dominant variables concerned physical and cognitive fit (6MWT, Gait Scale, FAB, MMSE, TUG), in component 2 dominant variables concerned health and environmental conditions (FBM %, EH, HC), whereas in component 3, the dominant variable concerned alertness (ESS). These components explained cumulatively 37%, 56% and 70% of the variance in fall occurrence. Logistic regression selected components 1 (OR: 0.527; 95% CI: 0.328–0.845) and 2 (OR: 1.614; 95% CI: 1.050–2.482) as predictive of falls. The cut-off level yielding the maximal sensitivity and specificity for predicting fall occurrence was set as 0.206 (specificity = 72.7%, sensitivity = 47.7%, and the area of the ROC curve was computed as 0.660 (95% CI: 0.564-0.756).</p><p id="Par180"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par181">This pilot study showed that multiple correlated variables for fall risk assessment can be reduced to three uncorrelated components characterized by: physical and cognitive fit; health and environmental conditions; and alertness.

FF was assessed by the Senior Fitness Test Battery [2]. A composite Z-score was created based on the individual scores for each fitness item. CP was assessed by the Mini-mental State Examination adapted for the Portuguese population [3]. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all outcome measurements and comparisons were performed using independent sample t-Tests. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test associations between FF and CP.</p><p id="Par212"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par213">T-test comparisons showed that females were more flexible than males (p &lt; 0.05). Males were taller and heavier than females (p &lt; 0.05). No differences were observed between these independent fallers and non-fallers sample. Multiple regression analyses were performed to understand the association of FF with CP in fallers and non-fallers. Agility was negatively associated with the MMSE score in fallers and non-fallers; however, after adjusting for gender, age and education, this association was not significant for non-fallers (p &lt; 0.05). Lower body strength showed positive associations (p &lt; 0.05) with the MMSE score exclusively in non-fallers, regardless the adjustments. Likewise, the upper body strength was positively associated with the MMSE score (p &lt; 0.05) in non-fallers after adjusting for age, gender and education (p &lt; 0.05).

Body strength, particularly improved lower body strength, is associated with higher CP in non-faller older adults, independently of age, gender and education. This exploratory study increases the spectrum of research in multimodal programs by suggesting that agility and strength training should be included in exercise prescription for fall prevention, in order to foment CP.</p><p id="Par216"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par217">Study was funded by Horizon 2020, Portugal 2020 (ALT20-030145-FEDER-000007).</p><p id="Par218"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par219">1.

Balance is considered a key factor for higher falling risk in this population [1, 2]; thus, assessment and preventive/rehabilitation programs targeting the balance control system are currently a clinical guideline [1]. Programs commonly include strength/power training of the lower limbs and trunk muscles and postural control exercises [1, 3]. Recently it has been shown that the elderly reach premature muscle fatigue during upright stance tasks [2], and that fatigue leads to poor balance control [4]. Muscular endurance hence appears to play an important role in the efficiency of the balance control system, particularly during performance of long lasting functional tasks. However, the association between muscle endurance and balance control measures has been overlooked, especially in the trunk muscles, despite its potential to assist clinicians and researchers to comprehensively screen falling risk factors and tailoring interventions accordingly.</p><p id="Par226"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par227">The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the association between endurance of the trunk extensor muscles and the risk of falls in the elderly, considering possible co-factors such as age and BMI.</p><p id="Par228"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par229">Community-dwelling adults ≥ 65 years were recruited from senior universities in the Centre region of Portugal. Exclusion criteria included severe physical/cognitive limitations that would prevent subjects from performing the testing protocol. Falling risk/balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS, score 0–56). Muscle performance was measured through the trunk extensor endurance test (in seconds). Simple and multiple linear regression analyses, using SPSS (v20), were conducted to predict the effects of muscle endurance, BMI and age on balance control. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p><p id="Par230"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par231">Fifty-nine volunteers (44 females, age = 71 ± 5 years, height = 1.60 ± 0.09 m, mass = 71.67 ± 14.35 kg, BMI = 28.02 ± 4.62 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were included in the study. The largest correlation was found between the BBS score, and muscle endurance (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.379), and BMI (<italic>ρ</italic> = -0.335). Muscle endurance predicted 7% of the BBS score (<italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 0.070, p = 0.024). When combined with BMI, muscle endurance accounted for ~16% (<italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>=0.162, p = 0.003) of the total variance of the BBS score. Unsurprisingly, when age was added to the previous model the predictive capacity increased, reaching ~21% (<italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 0.214, p = 0.01).</p><p id="Par232"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par233">Endurance of the trunk extensor muscles and BMI predicted approximately 16% of the BBS score. Since these are modifiable factors, it is recommended that they should be routinely included in the screening of falling risk factors in the elderly and addressed accordingly in preventive programs.</p><p id="Par234"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par235">1.

Stroke code was activated 431 times, covering 37.2% (n = 282) of ischemic stroke, and have received thrombolytic therapy 18.4% (n = 52) of these patients. Door-to-needle time was, in average, 69.5 minutes. Mean (± SD) NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) score was 14.8 (± 5.2) before treatment, decreasing to 11.8 (± 6.0) at two hours post- fibrinolysis (p &lt; 0.05).

Upon entering school, learning to read and write is developed in two large areas of knowledge. The first implies capacities of recognition and decoding of written symbols of the word and vocabulary development and the second allows the understanding of what is read through inferential capacities and non-literal interpretation. Often, students with reading comprehension difficulties go unnoticed. It is easier to detect a child who reads slowly, syllable by syllable, or with mistakes than those who read fluently but without understanding the content. These difficulties only become evident when questions are asked about the text and when it is necessary to understand the questions of subjects such as mathematics or science. Thus, success to reach the National Curricular Plan can be compromised.</p><p id="Par310"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par311">Material was developed to evaluate semantic and pragmatic skills in school-aged children. In semantics, aspects of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations (lexical field, synonymy and antonyms) and paronymy are evaluated. In pragmatics, competences are evaluated such as inferences, comprehension of idioms and proverbs. This material will be placed on a platform that can be consulted and used by different professionals working with children. The items that constitute this material took into account the stages of language development and school level. The lexicon used is in the domain of European Portuguese.</p><p id="Par312"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par313">The 756 children who were assessed attended public and private schools in Portugal. The results show an increasing evolution of the lexical competences of the children, with significant differences between the different age groups in all tests. There were no significant differences between female and male except in the paronym test. Regarding the socio-professional level of the child's origin, it is verified that it is a differentiating factor of lexical competence because significant differences in all tests were observed regardless of the age of the child.</p><p id="Par314"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par315">The authors concluded that it is of great importance to analyse lexical competence regarding the aspects of its organization, as it enables students to deal with academic tasks successfully, improving literacy as well as to be able to act in a systematic and productive way in the intervention with children with language disorders. The complexity and innovation of the pragmatic skills assessment (in European Portuguese) leads to this work to continue in development.</p><p id="Par316"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par317">Semantic, Pragmatics, Assessment, School age.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec84"><title>O14 Quality of Life in Portugal – what factors can determine the QoL in people with Intellectual Disabilities and a great need of supports?</title><sec id="Sec85"><title>António Rodrigo, Sofia Santos, Fernando Gomes</title><sec id="Sec86"><title>Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon, 1495-687 Cruz Quebrada, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec87"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> António Rodrigo (antoniorodrigo92@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par318"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par319">In Portugal, the Quality of Life (QoL) concept has become increasingly relevant, leaving aside a vision that only focus on the person’s limitations to one that emphasizes the quality of interactions between personal characteristics and environmental demands, within a socioecological model.

Nevertheless, this is challenging as AECOPD diagnosis/monitoring relies exclusively on patients’ reports of symptoms worsening [2]. AECOPD are characterised by an increased airway inflammation and obstruction, abnormal bronchial mucus and air trapping, which results in changes in lung acoustics [2,3]. Thus, changes in respiratory mechanics related with AECOPD may be successfully monitored by respiratory sounds, namely adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS, crackles and wheezes) [3]. Nevertheless, little is known on ARS changes during the time course of AECOPD.</p><p id="Par463"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par464">To evaluate ARS changes during the time course of AECOPD.</p><p id="Par465"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par466">25 non-hospitalised patients with AECOPD (16 males, 70.0 ± 9.8yrs, FEV1 54.2 ± 20.6% predicted) were enrolled. Patients were treated with pharmacological therapy. ARS at anterior and posterior right/left chest were simultaneously recorded at hospital presentation (T1) and at weeks 3 (T3) and 8 (T8). ARS (no. of crackles and wheeze occupation rate–%Wh) were processed, per respiratory phase, using validated algorithms [4,5]. Differences were examined with Friedman and Cochran tests and both tests were corrected with Bonferroni corrections.</p><p id="Par467"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par468">Significant differences were found in no. of inspiratory crackles (0.6 [0.1-2.2] vs. 0.5 [0.1-2.5] vs. 0.3 [0.0-0.9]; p = 0.008) in T1, T3 and T8 at posterior chest, namely participants presented more inspiratory crackles (p = 0.013) at T1 than at T8. Similar results were found for inspiratory %Wh (0.0 [0.0-12.3] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.0] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.0]; p = 0.019), namely, participants presented significantly more inspiratory %Wh at T1 than at T3 (p = 0.006). A significant higher number of participants presenting inspiratory wheezes was found at T1 than at T3 at the anterior chest (%Wh: 10 vs. 2 vs. 5; p=0.017) and a trend to significance was found at posterior chest (%Wh: 10 vs. 3 vs. 4; p = 0.052). No differences were found for the remaining variables.</p><p id="Par469"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par470">Crackles and wheezes seem to be sensitive to monitor the course of AECOPD. Inspiratory crackles seem to persist until 15 days after the exacerbations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, approximate time needed to resolve AECOPD [6]) whilst inspiratory %Wh significantly decreased after this period. This information may allow further advances in the monitoring of patients with COPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings, as respiratory sounds are simple, non-invasive population-specific and available by nearly universally means. Further studies with larger samples and including data collected before the AECOPD are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p id="Par471"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par472">1.

Screening instruments are usually performed by different health professionals (e.g. pediatricians, nurses). The Child Health Program for primary care in Portugal determined that all 5-year-old children should be screened by nurses and general practitioners to conclude if they present a typical development suitable to school requirements. This screening is usually implemented through the Mary Sheridan test and there is no speech-language screening test used in primary care. Recently a Speech and Language Screening was validated for Portuguese children in kindergartens with excellent levels of specificity, sensitivity and reliability. RALF aims to quickly identify (5 minutes) children who may be at risk of speech-language impairment and need to be referred to a in depth assessment by a Speech-Language Therapist.</p><p id="Par494"><bold>Objectives</bold></p><p id="Par495">This study aims to implement a new screening procedure in primary health care contributing to best practices. Specifically, the study aims to identify children with speech-language disorder that are undiagnosed due to the absence of a known condition such as neurological, hearing or cognitive impairment.</p><p id="Par496"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par497">Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee (UICISA) (ref.14/2016). A sociocultural questionnaire characterizing child and family background was fulfilled by caregivers to collect information about the child’s background (e.g., mother language; neurological, hearing, cognitive disorder) and child’s family background. Subject selection criteria included: Portuguese as native language and absence of a language disorder secondary to a known condition. The sample comprised 37 children whose parents returned informed consents.

These are easily available for all those who are interested in tracking physical activity and progresses to improve physical fitness and health-related parameters [1]. However, little is known about the people’s knowledge about this equipment and specially in some specific activities that have some restrictions, for instance those performed in-water.</p><p id="Par508"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par509">The purpose of this study was to characterize Portuguese practices on the use of wearable technology during aquatic activities.</p><p id="Par510"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par511">Swimming pools from the interior region of Portugal were selected randomly and their users completed a questionnaire consisting of 33 questions. The first part focused on the characterization of their motivations and usual in-water activities, and the second focused on their views on the value of the wearable technology, its use and suggestions for future development of those devices according to aquatic activities.</p><p id="Par512"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par513">Ten swimming pools were accessed, and 418 questionnaires were filled by people ranging from 18 to 79 years-old. About 79% of these subjects have heard about wearables for sport, but 65% never used them during exercise. At the time of the inquiries, 24% still used and 11% gave up using it mainly because of lack of interest or because the devices did not work well underwater. Among the non-users, most reported that they did not have the opportunity (53%), considering that they are not useful (17%), or complaining about the financial cost (15%). However, most of them (74%) would be interested in trying this type of equipment during aquatic activities. Interestingly, 71% did not consider doing more exercise after they have the equipment. From those subjects using wearables, only a few (n = 24) used during in-water exercise.</p><p id="Par514"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par515">For future, the devices should be more comfortable, be more reliable, be water resistant, with longer battery life. Besides the usual feedbacks provided, they also would like to see some technical corrections evidenced by that technology. People seemed to know about the existence of wearables to monitor physical activity but are still reluctant because of their underwater reliability, cost, and opportunity to try them. These results evidenced a need for improving these technological devices according to subjects needs and the activities performed. Some suggestions were made according to the future development of these devices to use during in-water exercitation.</p><p id="Par516"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par517">NanoSTIMA: Macro-to-Nano Human Sensing Towards Integrated Multimodal Health Monitoring and Analytics, NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016, co-financed by FEDER-NORTE2020.</p><p id="Par518"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par519">1.

These findings suggested that caregiver restrictive/critical eating messages exacerbated the impact of shame on these psychopathological outcomes, with the tested model accounting for 17% and 29% of the variance of inflexible eating rules and body weight and shape concerns, respectively. In addition, pressure to eat caregiver messages was not correlated with all variables examined. A graphical representation of the moderation analyses allowed to understand that, for the same levels of external shame, women who recall more caregiver restrictive/critical eating messages tend to adopt more inflexible eating rules and present greater concerns and maladaptive attitudes regarding body weight and shape.</p><p id="Par530"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par531">These findings appear to offer important clinical and investigational implications, highlighting the importance of the development of efficient parental intervention approaches as a refuge against maladaptive eating regulation strategies.</p><p id="Par532"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par533">1.

During this process, the reference lists of all included articles were screened, which resulted in the inclusion of 3 new articles. Ten studies were excluded due to absence of microbiological data inclusion and 6 were excluded due to lack of full-text access and author's reply. Overall, a total of 1,337 tourniquets belonging to nurses, nursing assistants, doctors, phlebotomists and lab workers were analysed for microorganism contamination. A small number of studies verified that the same tourniquets were used continuously by professionals between 3 days to 104 weeks. Preliminary results evidenced contamination rates varying between 9% and 100%, composed by diverse microorganisms such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Acinteobacter baumannii</italic>. Several of the included studies described conflicting practices during tourniquet manipulation by health professionals, especially when focused on domains such as hand hygiene before and after tourniquet use, glove usage during venipuncture, tourniquet cleaning and disinfecting, sharing tourniquets with other professionals and storage conditions. The most cited reason for tourniquet replacement in clinical settings was due to their loss by health professionals.</p><p id="Par573"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par574">As a contribution to clinical practice, it is expected that the mapping of the available scientific evidence regarding the potential contamination of these devices will appear as an informative contribution that supports the analysis of current practices in this field, promoting the implementation of quality assurance systems in health institutions.</p><p id="Par575"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par576">This protocol is part of the project “Transfer of technological innovations to nursing practice: a contribution to the prevention of infections”, funded from the European Regional Development Fund, by the Operational Program Competitiveness and Internationalization of PORTUGAL 2020.</p><p id="Par577"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par578">1.

These results corroborate with evidence: Swiss study [2], with 89 WB <italic>vs</italic> 279 out-of-water births, 57% had physiological defect in the water and the 3rd-Stage was significant (p &lt; 0.01) in PA; English study [3] with 5,192 WB, with third physiological stage, 86.1% of which 55.8% were in water. For 3rd-Stage’s management [4]: 1. Active: administration of uterotonic (oxytocin [1], 1st choice) after birth, timely clamping of the umbilical cord and controlled cord traction. 2. Physiological: Spontaneous relief assisted by gravity and/or maternal effort. In order to evaluate PPH in WB, in addition to the clinical state of the puerperium, the coloration of the comparison to wine is analysed: 50-100 ml blood loss to the pink-Chablis; from 150-250 ml to bleed and 500-750 ml to Merlot-wine [5] or, study-site midwife’s puts-hand below the surface of the water horizontally.

Reaching the age of 100, though an important landmark, does not necessarily indicates successful aging as it is often accompanied by severe health and functional constraints. Understanding health trajectories of these long-lived individuals and studying the prevalence of diseases that are the most common causes of death is important for conveniently addressing their current caregiving needs.</p><p id="Par650"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par651">The aim of this study is to present an overview of the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of two distinct samples of Portuguese centenarians (predominantly rural <italic>vs</italic>. predominantly urban) and acknowledge potential dissimilarities.</p><p id="Par652"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par653">A sample of 241 centenarians was considered (140 from the PT100 Oporto Centenarian Study and 101 from the PT100 Beira Interior Centenarian Study). Sociodemographic information, nature and number of diseases, functionality and physical health variables were collected.</p><p id="Par654"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par655">In both samples, most centenarians were female (89.3% in Oporto, and 86.1% in Beira Interior), and widowed (76.4% in Oporto, 91.1% in Beira Interior), and lived in the community (57.9% in Oporto, 49.0% in Beira Interior). Higher levels of basic activities of daily living (BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) dependency were found in the Oporto sample, as well as a higher percentage of bedridden centenarians (61.0% in Oporto <italic>vs</italic>. 38.1% in Beira Interior). Sensorial impairments and incontinence were the most frequent conditions reported in both samples; however, lower percentages of age-related illnesses were found in the Beira Interior sample. Considering the three most lethal diseases among the elderly population (heart disease, non-skin cancer and stroke), 60.0% of centenarians in Oporto escaped these conditions, whereas in Beira Interior this percentage increases to 85.4%.</p><p id="Par656"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par657">This study provides a general overview about the health profile of Portuguese centenarians in two types of communities: one rural and with low population density, and another in an urban context. Our findings raise important differences between centenarians from the two samples, which reinforce the heterogeneity of this population, and the importance of environmental factors in how such an advanced age was achieved.

Quality nursing care is essential to prevent functional decline. A “new” theoretically based philosophy of care has been proposed: the Function Focused Care (FFC), which is geared toward optimization of function and physical activity during all personal/care related activities that occur throughout the hospital stay [2]. The FFC has demonstrated better outcomes at discharge and post-acute periods.</p><p id="Par667"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par668">To evaluate the effect of an educational program for nurses in promoting the FFC among hospitalized OA.</p><p id="Par669"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par670">This is a prospective quasi-experimental study developed in four internal medical units. These units were randomly selected in two units for case (intervention) and two for control. Participants were 117 OA and 94 registered nurses (RN). Intervention consisted in the development and implementation of an educational program about FFC to RN, lasting 10 hours, and a maintenance program, during 5 months. Further details about the program can be found in Tavares et al [3]. Implementation of FFC activities by RN was assessed through the FFC Behaviour Checklist, which was completed by the researchers through non-participant observation [4]. The measures for patients were the functional decline (DF) assessed by the Katz Index: difference between baseline and discharge (t0), discharge and follow-up of 3 months (t1) and baseline and follow-up (t2). For comparison of the case and control groups, an independent t-test was calculated.</p><p id="Par671"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par672">The patient’s sociodemographic and clinical characteristics showed no statistical differences between groups. The provision of FFC mean was 0.46 ± 0.22, indicating that RN promoted only 46% of total possible FFC activities. Significant statistical differences were found between case and control group (<italic>t</italic>(91)= -2.85; p= 0.01), with means of 0.52 ± 0.24 and 0.39 ± 0.19, respectively. No statistical difference was found between the promotion of FFC and the functional decline at t0 (U = 30.5, p = 0.15), t1 (<italic>t</italic>(38.82) = 6.293; p&lt; 0.15) or t2 (<italic>t</italic>(83) = 2.49, p = 0.44).</p><p id="Par673"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par674">Promotion of functionality is very low, which could be explained by the lack of impact in FD prevention. However, in the case group, more FFC activities were developed. These results suggest a positive impact of the educational program in OA care. The FFC can be seen as a challenge and opportunity for change, innovation, and creativity, in order to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of care of hospitalized OA.</p><p id="Par675"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par676">1.

Concerning the self-reported data, some studies described subjectivity and difficulty in extracting reliable information when using such methods.

Measures included demographic variables, functional capacity, assessed by six functional tests: Grip strength, Timed Up and Go (TUG), 30 seconds Sit-to-Stand, Step test, 4 Stage Balance “modified” and 10 meters Walking Speed and two questionnaires (Self-efficacy for exercise and Activities and Participation Profile related to Mobility - PAPM).

The number of older frail people increases rapidly, which leads to a substantial impact on the economic, social and health systems. Cardiovascular Health Study data [1] estimated that, in a population with 65 years or more, 6.3% of aged adults have the frailty phenotype. According to Fried <italic>et al.</italic>, frailty is a vulnerable condition characterized by the decline of biological reserves [2,3]. This happens due to deregulation of multiple physiological systems, which puts the individuals at risk by reducing the organism resistance to stressful factors, with a subsequent loss of functional homeostasis. One of the most significant aspects described in the literature is the fact that frailty is an important risk factor for falls. It is estimated that one in every three adults over 65 years fall each year. The frailty syndrome also compromises the social participation of aged adults.</p><p id="Par725"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par726">To understand if adults with 65 years or over with frailty phenotype have history of falls in the period of the previous 12 months prior to the study and worst social participation, when compared to the ones who don't have this phenotype.</p><p id="Par727"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par728">A sample of 122 community-dwelling adults (age ≥65 years), mean age 72.22 ± 6.44 years old (63.9% female), with history of at least one fall in the previous year participated in this cross-sectional study.

Nowadays, some progresses have been made but they still face multiple stereotypes and barriers that limit their social and sexual lives. Sexual assistance is a way of sexual expression in which trained individuals provide sexual services to clients with disabilities, improving their well-being in relation to sexuality. However, in Portugal the only way to access commercial sex is through sex workers who have no training to attend disabled clients.</p><p id="Par741"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par742">To understand if sex workers see training as a useful aspect to be taken into account for improving psychological and sexual health of clients with disabilities and themselves.</p><p id="Par743"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par744">An explorative study of qualitative approach, with 13 sex workers interviews analysed using the thematic analysis method proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006) [1].</p><p id="Par745"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par746">From the analysis of the interviews four themes have emerged.

However, intervention with men is criticized, such as: using resources that could be targeted to victims; the imposition of re-education measures rather than punitive measures; consider that men do not change their behaviour [1]. Nevertheless, it is within the framework of evaluation that we find one of the major shortcomings of batterer intervention programs, since the effects of participation of men in that, have been receiving little analysis [2].</p><p id="Par755"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par756">This research aims to analyse the results of a batterer intervention program from the perspective of man accompanied by the program.</p><p id="Par757"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par758">It is a case study conducted in a batterer intervention program with 86 men. It was used the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Follow Up Questionnaire, adapted to be used in Brazil. Data were analysed according to content analysis techniques.

Subjects were asked to agree through an informed consent.</p><p id="Par759"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par760">When asked about changes occurred after 3 months of follow-up in the program some men reported having not noticed any changes, which indicates that the program is not effective to all participants and the importance of longer follow-ups. However, most men cited changes in the way they act and perceive the division of tasks between men and women, thus participation in the program can be the starting point for rethinking and building new ways of expressing masculinity. And the changes cited go beyond the scope of the marital relationship, encompassing the relationship with the children, the abandonment of addictions and the desire to seek school education.</p><p id="Par761"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par762">According to the data, attention to perpetrators of violence has a positive influence not only in the behaviour towards the partner, but also on the relationship with children and the abandonment of addictions. Although longer follow-ups - including the couple - are needed, the batterer intervention program may be a tool to decrease violence against women.</p><p id="Par763"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par764">1.

The framing sample included 69 older adults aged ≥ 65 years. Of those, 28 (average age of 79.33 ± 7.35 years and average education of 3.29 ± 1.86 years) participated in the 7-week RBP, twice a week. Outcomes of interest were cognitive frailty indicators measured through the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); quality of life measured using the short version of World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-module for older adults (WHOQOL-OLD-8); and depressive symptomatology measured by the 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-10). In addition, the eight professionals conducting the study were asked to identify obstacles to the successful implementation of the program, and to evaluate its structure, themes, contents, and the involvement of the elderly in each session.</p><p id="Par774"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par775">RBP was shown to have positive effects on the MoCA and WHOQOL-OLD-8 score (p &lt; 0.05). Improvement in the GDS-10 score was observed; however, it was statistically non-significant. The structure of the program sessions was considered as mostly clear and perceptible (94%), and themes and contents as mostly pleasant and appropriate (94%). Positive feedback was obtained regarding the program capacity to involve the elderly in the activities proposed (87.5%). However, according to the professionals’ opinion, there is a need for ampler capacitation of the teams implementing RBP, better articulation with the institutions regarding the used space and activities schedule, and better articulation with the elderly to guarantee their commitment to the program.</p><p id="Par776"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par777">Reminiscence was shown to be effective in improving cognition and quality of life, as well as potentially effective in decreasing depressive symptomatology.

The program was conceptualized in four distinct phases: Phase I (Preliminary), the initial conceptualization of the program design and supportive materials; Phase II (Modelling), consisting in the conduction of interviews and focus groups with healthcare specialists; Phase III (Field Test), aiming at the evaluation of each program session; and Phase IV (Consensus Conference), to synthesize the contributions and analyse challenges that emerged in preceding phases.</p><p id="Par791"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par792">Based on the contributions of experts, healthcare professionals and the institutionalized elderly, a RT program divided into two strands was formed. The main strand includes 14 sessions, performed twice a week. The maintenance strand included seven weekly sessions. Each thematic session is related to the participants' life course, with a maximum duration of 60 minutes. The 4-phase conceptualization process resulted in the creation of a digital platform with audio-visual contents to aid professionals during each session; inclusion of an introductory section that contextualizes the therapeutic potential of RT; introduction of complementary activities that can be developed additionally in the institutional settings; reinforcement of multisensory stimulation throughout the program; introduction of a final moment of relaxation through abdominal breathing. The terminology used and visual presentation of the program were reformulated in order to improve user experience. The created program was considered by the elderly and healthcare professionals involved during the course of this process as pleasant and interesting, praising its structure, thematic contents and proposed activities.</p><p id="Par793"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par794">The involvement of experts and potential users enabled the program to mirror the needs of the elderly with cognitive decline in an institutional setting.

The interventions consisted in psychotherapeutic interventions for the nursing diagnosis “anxiety”, integrated in the Nursing Interventions Classification. One mental health nurse provided the individual-based intervention over a 5-week period (one 45-60 minutes weekly session). A treatment-as-usual control group received only pharmacotherapy (if applicable). The primary outcomes, anxiety level and anxiety self-control, were assessed with the outcomes “Anxiety level” and “Anxiety self-control”, integrated in the Nursing Outcomes Classification (Portuguese version) [5] respectively.

The psychotherapeutic intervention presented a very large effect size on the anxiety level and a huge effect size on the anxiety self-control. 22.8% and 40% of the outcomes related to the anxiety level and anxiety self-control, respectively, are predicted in the event of integrating the intervention group.</p><p id="Par811"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par812">This study demonstrated the psychotherapeutic intervention model in nursing was efficacious in the decrease of anxiety level and improvement of anxiety self-control in a group of Portuguese adult psychiatric outpatients with pathological anxiety, immediately after the intervention.

The approach in the home nursing visit was directed to the well-being of the new born and its mother, appearing to the family as a resource, not having the concern to explore the interaction and the reciprocity within the family. We highlight three dimensions: Postpartum home visit, that describes the experiences of the participants about the care operationalized in this visit; Family Nursing, which traces the way they understand the work of the family nurse in this transition and, lastly, the Postpartum parenting, which reports the mother perception about this stage of the life cycle.</p><p id="Par845"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par846">The home visit and work philosophy by the family nurse contributed to the positive adaptation to parenthood and to approach the family and added value for improvement of the quality of health care, yet it was not assumed as a reality in the context of caring.</p><p id="Par847"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par848">1.

People who use gyms come from diverse socio-demographic conditions, where the consumption of this type of substances is not only used for the purpose of improving physical performance, but also to obtain a more muscular physique, especially for men, and leaner, especially for women whose goal is faster weight loss [1].

The mean age of PES users was 34.96 years (Std. Dev. = 10.00). They were married, unemployed and with a low level of education (until 9 years = 41.7%). PES users showed more years of training (4 years) than no PES users. The main sports modalities of the respondents were cardio fitness (57.0%), bodybuilding (56.5%), stretching (27.8%) and localized (27.2%). PES use was suggested mostly by friends (51.9%), peers (30.8%) and by internet (30.8%). The most commonly consumed PES were diuretics (46.0%) and anabolic steroids (44.0%). Thirty percent of PES users reported side effects and the most commonly reported was acne (53.3%), agitation and tremors (40.0%). The main reason for using PES is the improvement of the physical condition (54.0%). Five-point three percent of non-PES users expressed an interest in using PES in the future.</p><p id="Par874"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par875">This exploratory survey revealed the use of PES amongst Portuguese gym/fitness users and its increasing importance to investigate the psychosocial factors that may influence PES use in this specific population.

Current research is still under discussion regarding the nature, definition, characteristics and prevalence of frailty. Identify frail older adults (OA) has recently been recognized as an important priority, especially in community-dwelling OA.</p><p id="Par883"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par884">Determine the prevalence of frail OA in a primary care (PC) settings and to assess the concurrent validation of the Portuguese version of Prisma7 (P7) with two other published and validated instruments: Frailty Phenotype (FF) and the Groningen Frailty Indicator (IFG).</p><p id="Par885"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par886">This study was conducted in one PC unit in the north region of Portugal with a convenience sample of 136 OA (≥ 65 years). The questionnaire included: 1) sociodemographic, family and health variables; and 2) the frailty instruments P7, FF and IFG. OA were considered frail: ≥ 3 positive questions out of 7 for P7; ≥3 factors out of 5 for FF; and ≥ 4 dimensions out of 8 for IFG. Further details about these scales can be found in Machado. For the concurrent validity, methods based on correlation (Spearman Rank test) and agreement (Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity and specificity values) were used. For comparison of the two groups (frailty or non-frailty), an independent t-test was calculated. Finally, binary logistic regression model was considered to identify predictors of frailty.</p><p id="Par887"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par888">According to the characterization of P7, IFG and FF, the prevalence of frail OA was 7.4%, 19.9% and 26.5%, respectively. The agreement percentage between the instruments was moderate ranging from 68% to 77%, observing that the P7 is partially concordant with the other instruments. The P7 showed high specificity values, but low sensitivity values. Frail OA were characterized (p &lt; 0.05) as being older, having worse health perception, lower physical capacity, slower walking velocity, higher IFG scores, and decreased hand grip strength. As predictors of frailty, in the multivariate model, older age (OR = 1.111) and better physical capacity (OR = 0.675) were significant (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p id="Par889"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par890">A sample of more robust people and a “synthetic” application of P7 (without explaining the questions) may have influenced the prevalence results presented. More studies are needed in order to further evaluate the psychometric properties of the various tools tested.

Ideally, the identification of children at risk of failure to learn reading and writing should occur in the last year of pre-school or early in the first year, so that intentional programs can be implemented to promote basic reading skills [2,3,4]. The most promising reading learning support programs combine explicit phonological awareness training with highly structured reading instruction [5,6].</p><p id="Par899"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par900">This study evaluated the impact of two early intervention programs on reading learning difficulties. A program exclusively in virtual environment and a hybrid program, comprising sessions in virtual environment and in real environment.</p><p id="Par901"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par902">Participants were 57 children, attending the first year of schooling, native speakers of European Portuguese, identified as at risk of having learning reading difficulties. The children were divided into three groups: (a) virtual environment intervention - training with Graphogame software, (b) hybrid intervention - training using Graphogame software and real-time sessions of pre-reading and reading skills oriented by a technician from the CiiL team (Center for Research and Intervention in Reading) and (c) absence of intervention beyond that provided for in the regular system of education. The intervention programs were developed in a school context, with the virtual component (Graphogame) developed with daily periodicity, with duration between 10 to 15 minutes. The intervention in real environment was carried out once a week, with activities of 30 to 40 minutes, using materials of a playful character, created specifically for the present study. In both types of sessions, the groups consisted of two to five children. The participants were evaluated at the level of letter-sound relations, phonemic awareness, word reading and pseudo word reading.</p><p id="Par903"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par904">Both intervention environments produced significantly more positive effects than those obtained by the control group. Still, the software Portuguese Basis Graphogame is an effective tool, however, with a more positive effect when used in parallel with a face-to-face reading promotion session.</p><p id="Par905"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par906">The early intervention in reading difficulties should promote the explicit training of phonemic awareness and letter-sound relations in order for the decoding process to be developed. Although the virtual environment – in this case the software Portuguese Basis Graphogame – is a highly effective tool, ideally, it should be combined with a real-environment intervention to ensure that the child effectively dominates letter-sound relationships and that trains intensively the decoding process.</p><p id="Par907"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par908">1.

Recently, CRF has been described as a clinical vital sign, which highlights its role in health promotion and disease prevention [2]. The 6-min-walk test (6MWT), incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), unsupported upper limb exercise test (UULEX) and the 1-min sit-to-stand test (1’STS) are worldwide tests to assess CRF. Reference values of these tests are however, lacking for the Portuguese elderly population. This hinders the interpretability and limits the confidence of clinical decision-making in the field of CRF.</p><p id="Par963"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par964">To contribute for establishing reference values for the 6MWT, ISWT, UULEX and 1’STS in the Portuguese healthy elderly population.</p><p id="Par965"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par966">A cross-sectional study was conducted with healthy elderly volunteers [3] recruited from the Centre region of Portugal. Each participant conducted two repetitions of the 6MWT, ISWT, UULEX and 1-min STS. The best repetition was considered for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to determine reference values by age decade (61-70; 71-80; 81- 90) and gender. Two-way ANOVA was used to investigate significant effects for age/gender and their interaction. Values were presented as mean ± standard deviation or median [95%, Confidence Intervals].</p><p id="Par967"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par968">262 healthy people were enrolled (61.5% female; 75.0±0.5yrs), 125 completed the 6MWT (66.4% female; 75.1±0.7yrs), 83 the ISWT (57.3% female; 76.1±1.0yrs), 210 the UULEX (63.3% female; 75.7±0.6yrs) and 50 the 1’STS (54% female; 72.1±1.0yrs). Values decreased significantly along the decades and were statistically different between male and female (p &lt; 0.05) across all tests.

Canadian researchers define frailty as a multifactor syndrome involving biological, physical, cognitive, and social factors [2], which contribute significantly to disability and hospitalization [3]. Considered a modern geriatric syndrome, it is related to physiological changes, diseases, polypharmacy, malnutrition, social isolation and unfavourable economic situation [4, 5].</p><p id="Par982"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par983">The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence and factors associated with frailty in the elderly attended in outpatient care. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 374 elderly individuals in outpatient care between October 2015 and March 2016. Data collection was applied to the Edmonton Fragility Scale [2]. Data were analysed by Stata software version 12 and described by measures of frequency, mean and standard deviation (SD). Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to investigate associations between independent variables and frailty. The adjusted prevalence ratios were obtained by multiple Poisson regression analysis. It was started with a saturated model and the variables that were not statistically relevant were removed, since their exclusion did not modify the results of the independent variables that remained in the model. The statistical significance was p &lt; 0.05. The study complied with national and international standards of research ethics involving human subjects and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee in Human Beings of the institution under registration CAAE: 34905214.0.0000.0105.</p><p id="Par984"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par985">The results showed a predominance of female (67.4%), married (54.4%), with low educational level (55.1%), who lived with relatives (46.3%). The mean age of participants was 67.9 years. Regarding the clinical variables, 97% of the elderly reported having some type of disease, 92.3% used medication, 56.9% had no urine loss, 4.5% used walking sticks, 65.8% denied falls and 69.8% hospitalization. Regarding the fragility syndrome, the mean score was 5.9 points, with 40.1% elderly classified as fragile and 59.9% non-fragile. After multiple regression analysis, the variables that remained associated with the fragility were gender (p = 0.002), low education (p = 0.01), falls (p = 0.005), urinary incontinence (p = 0.000) (p = 0.001), medications (p = 0.02) and hospitalization (p = 0.001).</p><p id="Par986"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par987">The study identified important factors associated with frailty in the elderly attending the outpatient clinic.

Family members attending FCs were offspring in 67%, spouses in 23%, other relatives in 38% and the parents in 4% of cases. All meetings occurred in the presence of one physician and one nurse from the PCST. FCs were held because of patient discharge (88%), worsening of clinical condition (24%), family needs (59%), discussion of therapeutic goals (38%) and conspiracy of silence (1%). As a consultant team, the PCST is concerned with post-discharge and evaluates the needs of patients at home with the help of an ambulatory healthcare team or primary care team. Therefore, FCs have the objective of preparing families for patient discharge. During FC the main subjects of discussion were post-discharge healthcare referral (94%), objectives of healthcare (84%), clinical information about diagnosis and prognosis (42%), symptom control (47%), management of expectations concerning the illness (73%), nutrition (12%) and family needs (psychological support in 17% and nursing instructions 10%).</p><p id="Par1030"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1031">There is an increasing number of FC and more are being requested by the referral healthcare team.

Older people with diabetes represent a challenge, in terms of effective coordination and management in multiple areas. In this sense, older population needs to adhere to a medication regimen, sometimes complex. Polypharmacy is a reality and leads to unnecessary disease progression and complications, reduces functional abilities, increases hospitalizations, reduces the quality of life, increases health costs and even deaths [2]. Management of such phenomenon is extremely hard and requires awareness.</p><p id="Par1039"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1040">To identify the clinical profile of the older people with Diabetes mellitus in two Family Health Units in Faro (FHUs Farol and Al-Gharb).</p><p id="Par1041"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1042">Observational and descriptive study was performed, with people aged 65 years or above, living in the community and registered at the Health Centre of Faro (FHUs Farol and Al-Gharb). Three hundred and ninety-five patients were interview in terms of their medication regimen. For data collection, a sociodemographic questionnaire, Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) and chemical parameters (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and capillary glycaemia) were used.</p><p id="Par1043"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1044">The sample was composed of people aged 65 years and over [75.59 (±6.75)], with a maximum of 93 years (52.9% were women and 47.1% were men). Regarding the MRCI, an average of 15.63 (± 6.84), with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 32 was found. We verified the existence of a high and statistically significant positive correlation (r = .897; p-value &lt;.001) between the MRCI and the number of drugs prescribed. The study also showed that the increase of the number of drugs prescribed is related to advanced age. For HbA1C, an average of 7.09 (± 1.14), a minimum of 5.3 and a maximum of 12.4 was obtained. It was found that 57.47% of the patients had HbA1C value lower than 7%, 22.78% had values between 7%-7.9% and 19.75% had values higher than 7.9%.

We know that the use of electronic health information to support patient care will undoubtedly be responsible for a substantial time-spent on the overall workload of nurses. Too often, we are confronted with nurses’ opinions that the use of computerized information systems (CIS) has a great impact on the overall nurses’ workload (35 to 50% of the global nurses’ workload).</p><p id="Par1054"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1055">To identify the perception of nurses on the time spent on CIS in use in a hospital and his impact on the global nurses’ workload.</p><p id="Par1056"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1057">A cross-sectional survey was applied to collect data from 148 nurses that use CIS in a hospital (medical and surgical services).

These values are overlapping to those presented in some national and international studies. However, results are higher than the real-time shown in studies of Silva (2001) and Sousa and colleagues (2015).

However, there are several national and international studies that point out in certain contexts for a lower “real-time” in the global nurses’ workload on the use of computerized information systems.</p><p id="Par1062"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par1063">Computerized Information Systems, Electronic health information, Nursing workload, Time spent.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec267"><title>O60 Pain in people 75 and older: association with activity patterns</title><sec id="Sec268"><title>Maria C Rocha, José G Sousa, Madalena G Silva</title><sec id="Sec269"><title>Physiotherapy Department, School of Health, Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal, 2910-761 Setúbal, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec270"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Madalena G Silva (madalena.gomesdasilva@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par1064"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1065">The prevalence of pain amongst the elderly population (19.5% [1] to 52.8%[2]) may not be disregarded and varies depending on the age range and context. Regardless, pain in this population group has been associated with reduced functional capacity, changes in gait and sleep patterns, depression and reduced social participation [3]. Exercise has often been recommended as an intervention to manage pain in the elderly [4], however long-term adherence to exercise programs is limited [5]. Characterization of pain and exploring its associations with light intensity physical activity may provide a base for discussing alternative clinical interventions for the management of pain in this population group.</p><p id="Par1066"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1067">To characterize the presence, location and duration of pain in very old adults and investigate its association with light intensity physical activity.</p><p id="Par1068"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1069">A cross-sectional study was implemented with 65 participants aged above 75 years, without cognitive impairment, average age of 79.48 ± 4.98.

Although common, this syndrome is often under-diagnosed and nursing staff are in the best position to recognize, prevent and monitoring delirium symptoms. The current approach to delirium care seems to be insufficient and nurses need to receive more support and guidance providing high quality care [2].

Data collection included the application of the Mini Mental State Examination [2] for cognitive screening and Edmonton Fragility Scale [3], culturally adapted to the Portuguese language in Brazil [4]. Data were analysed using Stata®12 software. The association was verified through simple linear regression (Fisher's F and Student's t tests), significance level of p = 0.05.

The fragility evaluation identified that 19.6% of the elderly were nonfragile, 24.3% apparently vulnerable, 26.2% had mild fragility, 15.9% moderate and 14.0% severe. It was found that any level of schooling used medication (p = 0.001), solitude (p = 0.001), loss of urine (p = 0.001) and hospitalization in the last 12 months (p = 0.001) and was associated with the fragility syndrome.</p><p id="Par1178"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1179">The importance of early detection of the syndrome is emphasized through the use of an instrument that is valid, reliable and easy to apply by the health team, such as the Edmonton Fragility Scale.

Portuguese guidelines [7] encourage the implementation of regular pressure ulcer risk assessments through the application of the Braden Scale and the patients’ categorisation into two levels of risk (defined by cut-off point of 16). However, the development of pressure ulcer(s) is complex and multifactorial [8] and whenever the Braden Scale score falls below 18, each patient functional deficit and/or risk factor should be individually addressed [9].</p><p id="Par1189"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1190">To analyse the Braden Scale accuracy tests in adult patients admitted to general wards in a Portuguese hospital during one year, using different cut-off points.</p><p id="Par1191"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1192">The study was designed as a retrospective cohort analysis of electronic health record database from 6,552 adult patients admitted without any pressure ulcer in medical and surgical wards in a Portuguese hospital during 2012. All data were extracted after Hospital Council Board and Ethics Committee approval (Reference Number 049688). Braden Scale Accuracy Tests (BSAT) such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the curve (AUC) were assessed [10].</p><p id="Par1193"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1194">The study included 6,552 participants with a mean age of 64 years and 6 months. The majority of participants was male (52.6%); admitted trough emergency service (69.1%); in surgical (64.5%) units. During the length of stay 153 (2.3%) participants developed (at least) one pressure ulcer. Considering the cut-off point of 15, the BSAT showed: sensitivity of 50%(95%CI:42%-58%); specificity of 82%(95%CI:81%-83%); PPV of 6%(95%CI:5%-8%); NPV 99%(95%CI:98%-99%); and AUC of 66%(95%CI:61%-71%).

Furthermore, in order to develop evidence-based practice, we should create a minimum data set for pressure ulcer prevention, assessment and documentation [12-14] based on patients’ characteristics, international guidelines [15] and conceptual frameworks [12-14].</p><p id="Par1197"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1198">1.

So, it is important to create moments where the students can tell whatever they know about a subject, in order to make an additional scientific explanation. The program of the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle of basic education aims to develop an attitude of permanent research and experimentation, and the part “<italic>The health of your body</italic>”, to produce knowledge and the application of norms of body hygiene [1]. However, the contents expressed in the textbooks for these levels of education do not justify the need for children to adopt these hygiene habits, which must be acquired as early as possible, to be a systematic routine throughout life. On the other hand, it allows to eradicate some of the alternative conceptions that some 1<sup>st</sup> cycle students present on some issues [2], as the notion about the morphological view of microorganisms away from reality, idealizing them similar to animals [3,4,5]. There is evidence that children are able to learn about microorganisms at this age [3,4,5] and it is desirable that it occurs as early as possible, avoiding late conceptual changes that are difficult to reconstruct in their entirety [4]. For some authors [6,7], children should realize that the knowledge learned in the classroom can be applied in their daily lives.</p><p id="Par1217"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1218">In this context and with the purpose of promoting scientific and critical literacy, we developed an activity about hand hygiene because handwashing should be learned and be a properly reasoned behaviour.</p><p id="Par1219"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1220">The activities were developed by all 26 students in the class A, 2<sup>nd</sup> grade of the School EB1/JI Picua. The students' age ranged from 7 to 8 years, with 54% (14) boys and 46% (12) girls. It started with the question “<italic>Handwashing: Why, When, How</italic>?”. According to the conceptions expressed by the students the appropriate theoretical contents were presented in a gradual and interactive way. This was followed by the experimental procedure with permanent monitoring and support based on the succeeding steps: role-playing stages for proper handwashing; applied activity; listing expected results; observation of cultures and microscopic observation of microorganisms, recording and reflection about the results achieved.</p><p id="Par1221"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1222">All groups showed the expected results, <italic>i.e.</italic>, higher microbial growth in the quadrants corresponding to unwashed hands.</p><p id="Par1223"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1224">Giving the results and the theoretical framework, the students learned proper concepts on the subject, which allowed them a better understanding of the world around them.</p><p id="Par1225"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1226">1.

Accidental falls are a cause of fractures, traumatic brain injury, and even death. They can also lead to restrictions in participation, eventually resulting in loss of independence in normal activities of self-care. Falls in older adults are multifactorial and can be caused by medical conditions, cognitive impairment, medications, and home hazards. Therefore, a single identifiable factor may account for only a small portion of the fall risk in the community-dwelling elderly population, stressing the need for a multifactorial evaluation in this population.</p><p id="Par1237"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1238">Identify the risk of accidental falls in an independent elderly population by using functional tests that can be routinely applied in clinical practice and evaluate the influence of medication in the risk of falling.</p><p id="Par1239"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1240">The sample consisted of 108 individuals who attended a health care facility between October 2016-January 2017. Inclusion criteria: age 65-85, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) ≥ 120 and Timed Up and Go (TUG) ≤ 12s. Individuals with serious cognitive or motor impairment were excluded. A form was filled with sociodemographic data, daily medication and history of falls. Handgrip strength was measured. Fear of falling was assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Participation was evaluated using the Activities and Participation Profile related to Mobility (APPM).

Fallers were older, had lower ABC and handgrip strength. ABC showed strong negative associations with APPM. All of the functional parameters were affected by age, with older individuals performing worse than younger participants. Polypharmacy was identified in 41.7% and increased the risk of falls (OR = 3.597; CI 95% 1.174-11.024; p = 0.025). Individuals taking antidepressants showed an increased risk of falls (OR = 9.467; CI 95% 2.337-38.495; p = 0.002). Anti-arrhythmic drugs (p = 0.002), benzodiazepines (p = 0.015) and other CNS-acting medication (p = 0.039) negatively influenced ABC scores.

The AAL concept corresponds to a new paradigm building on ubiquitous computing devices and new interaction forms to improve older adults’ health, autonomy and security [2]. In spite of promising contributions of AAL solutions for ageing in place, low adoption by end users was reported [3-5]. This is thought to result from the intersection of technology features, user characteristics and attitudes [6]. Research has suggested that among attitudinal factors preventing adoption of these solutions there is a lack of trust, substantiated, among other factors, by user’s concerns about data security and privacy [5,7-10]. Digital advisory services for AAL solutions have to foster not only user’s trust on the advisory service <italic>per se</italic>, but also on AAL products and services and the web communication within a community.</p><p id="Par1249"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1250">To analyse stakeholders’ attitudes and requirements towards AAL digital advisory services, applying the findings to develop a pan-European advisory and decision-support platform for AAL solutions (ActiveAdvice).</p><p id="Par1251"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1252">A qualitative approach was used. Thirty-eight semi-structured interviews with AAL stakeholders– older adults and informal caregivers, businesses and government representatives– were conducted in six European countries (Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal and UK). The data was analysed using the matrix method [11].</p><p id="Par1253"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1254">For the uptake of AAL digital advisory services, the level of user’s trust in the system seems to be critical. Features emerging as crucial to foment trust in digital advisory services were threefold: presence of security and privacy cues; personalization-related cues; and community features, including availability of client-to-client interactions and feedback given by reliable peers or experts. Older adults expressed their interest in becoming active in a digital community if provided an environment perceived as secure and, simultaneously, easy to use.</p><p id="Par1255"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1256">Building trust in AAL digital advisory services depends on multiple and complex user requirements. Security issues have shown to be of utmost relevance due to the nature of information exchanged, <italic>i.e.</italic> personal, health-related and sensitive data, and generational preferences, with privacy and security cues having primacy for ‘Baby Boomers’, as supported by previous research [12].

During a situation of clinical deterioration with the need for IHET intervention, the actions of nurses in inpatient services depend on many factors. To facilitate the activation and effectiveness of this team, nurses must have self-confidence to carry out the activation of IHET. Nurses believe that IHET’s intervention is important in the pursuit for safe care and that the most important ingredient for the effective use of this team is the nurse.</p><p id="Par1280"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1281">This study aims to evaluate the level of self-confidence for emergency intervention of nurses and to identify the nurses’ perceptions of the importance of the IHET.</p><p id="Par1282"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1283">This correlational study included 129 nurses from the Centro Hospitalar de Leiria who answered a questionnaire about the perception of IHET importance and the self-confidence scale for emergency situations validated for the Portuguese population by Martins et al. (2014), which consists of 12 items with Likert type responses. Pearson correlation and t-student were used for data analysis.</p><p id="Par1284"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1285">In this study, 84% were female nurses with a mean age of 39.70 ± 9.02 years, with an average professional experience of 16.97 ± 8.95 years, and the majority with training in the emergency area (94%). The mean self-confidence level of the nurses was 3.263 ± 0.571, for a maximum of 5 points. Regarding the nurses’ perception of importance of the IHET, a positive tendency was observed (results ranged from 3.426 ± 0.570 to 4.775 ± 0.419). A partial relation between the professional experience (r = 0.25; p = 0.004), the training (t = 6.143; p ≤ 0.0001) and the level of self-confidence (r = -0.205; p = 0.020) with the level of perception is highlighted.</p><p id="Par1286"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1287">In this study, regarding the self-confidence for emergency intervention, the nurses demonstrated confidence, albeit modestly. Likewise, they presented a tendency towards positive agreement regarding the importance of IHET. Of note, the higher the experience of the nurses, the greater the importance attributed to the IHET. Finally, it was verified that the higher the nurse's self-confidence index, the lower the feeling of insecurity in an emergency situation.</p><p id="Par1288"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par1289">Hospital Rapid Response Team, Nursing, Emergency situation, Perception of importance, Self-confidence in emergency</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec319"><title>O73 Relationship between cognitive impairment and nutritional assessment on functional status in institutionalized Portuguese older adults</title><sec id="Sec320"><title>Catarina Caçador<sup>1</sup>, Edite Teixeira-Lemos<sup>2,3</sup>, Jorge Oliveira<sup>2,3</sup>, Fernando Ramos<sup>1</sup>, Manuel T Veríssimo<sup>4,5</sup>, Maria C Castilho<sup>6</sup></title><sec id="Sec321"><title><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Agrarian School, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu, 3500-606 Viseu, Portugal; <sup>3</sup>Centre for the Study of Education, Technologies and Health, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu, 3504-510 Viseu, Portugal; <sup>4</sup>Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, 3000-075 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>5</sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, 3004-504 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>6</sup>Laboratory of Bromatology, Pharmacognosy and Analytical Science, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec322"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Catarina Caçador (cacasabel@hotmail.com)</title><p id="Par1290"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1291">Elderly are particularly vulnerable to nutritional change deficits. Malnutrition in elderly patients is frequently underdiagnosed [1] and it has a large number of negative consequences on health and quality of life [2]. Even in industrialized countries undernutrition is becoming an alarming phenomenon, especially involving elderly institutionalized subjects. Few studies have focused on the relationship between patient’s nutritional assessment and a severity of cognitive impairments, comorbidity and functional status in institutionalized older adults.</p><p id="Par1292"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1293">In the present study we evaluated the relationship between functional disability, cognitive impairment and nutritional status.</p><p id="Par1294"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1295">This was an observational study with data collected from residents living in institutions in the district of Viseu (centre of Portugal). Inclusion criteria were: subjects aged 65 or older, living in institutions, that voluntarily accepted to participate in the study. All of the 216 subjects studied underwent multidimensional geriatric assessment. A form was filled with sociodemographic data and the nutritional state was assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), whereas cognitive performance was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The functional state was assessed by Barthel Index (BI). Statistical evaluations (p &lt; 0.05) were based on Qui-square tests between Barthel Index (BI), Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Body Mass Index (BMI) and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores. Statistical evaluations (p &lt; 0.05) were based on Qui-square tests between BI, MMSE, BMI and MNA scores.</p><p id="Par1296"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1297">A cognitive impairment in MMSE performance was displayed in 39.4% patients. Slight disability occurred in 69.4% of the residents, 24.1% were independent in activities of daily living and only 6.5% of the seniors had moderate dependence. There was a proportional increase of the cognitive impairment of the elderly (p ≤ 0.001) with increasing dependence. According to MNA, 27.8% of the elderly were at risk of malnutrition and 71.3% showed no nutritional problems. Statistical analysis showed that dependence increased the risk of malnutrition.</p><p id="Par1298"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1299">A close relationship between malnutrition and functional dependence has been obtained. Both tests, MNA and BI, are positively associated. The scores of BI can help to determine who may be at risk of poor nutrition.</p><p id="Par1300"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1301">1.

In the specific case of the Integrated Continuing Care Teams (ICCT), inserted in the National Network of Continued Integrated Care of Portugal, it is justified the use of a panel of indicators of health gains “Sensitive to Nursing Care”, given the nature of the services provided in these units, which helps to measure the clinical results obtained.</p><p id="Par1307"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1308">1) To identify the main nursing care needs of ICCT clients; and 2) Identify health gains sensitive to nursing care related to those needs.</p><p id="Par1309"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1310">Based on the definition model of indicators “sensitive to nursing care”, we developed a quantitative study-exploratory, descriptive and correlational, using the analysis of the nursing documentation available in Information Systems in use, in a convenience sample of 217 cases, attended in four ICCT of the northern region of Portugal, from October 2012 to May 2013.</p><p id="Par1311"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1312">From the analysis of 9,258 documented nursing diagnoses, it was possible to generate eight “types” of health gains indicators. Five related to the dependent person and three referring to the family caregiver (FC). Here the great incidence of the care provided in these ICCT was revealed, where the Gains in autonomy/independence in the universal requirements of self-care and Gains in knowledge of the FC were the most representative areas of the care provided. Then, came the domains of Gains in the evolution of nursing diagnoses of the dependent person (“others”) and Gains in knowledge of the dependent person. Approximately 10% of the results computed were in areas that focused on Gains in FC performance (11.20%), Gains in performance of dependent persons (10.43%) and Gains in the prevention of Ulcers of Pressure (9.32%). With an order of magnitude in the order of 3.30% emerged the field of indicators related to Gains in the evolution of nursing diagnoses centred on the Role of Care Provider.</p><p id="Par1313"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1314">Reflecting on these results allows a more effective approach to the representation of nursing care in the evaluation of quality and, certainly, a better redefinition of the panel of indicators at the national level, with “sensitivity” to the nursing work developed by ICCT.</p><p id="Par1315"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par1316">Healthcare Quality Indicators, Quality of Health Care, Home Care Services, Nursing Care, Nursing Care Management.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec327"><title>O75 Psychosocial impact of the powered wheelchair on the social participation of its users</title><sec id="Sec328"><title>Inês Domingues<sup>1</sup>, João Pinheiro<sup>1</sup>, Anabela Martins<sup>2</sup>, Patrícia Francisco<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec329"><title><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, 3004-504 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Physiotherapy Department, Coimbra Health School, Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, 3046-854 Coimbra, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec330"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Inês Domingues (inesfsdomingues@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par1317"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1318">There is a growing prevalence of disability worldwide, which indicates an increasing number of persons who might benefit from assistive technologies.

The most satisfied users were the ones with better performance in terms of social participation. PIADS scores showed a positive impact of the powered wheelchairs in all subscales, with the following average scores: total 1.37, competence 1.39, adaptability 1.32 and self-esteem 1.38.

The population comprised mothers who had a biological child in 2012 and 2013 in the Centre region of Portugal. A non-probabilistic sample (n = 427) was collected using an online questionnaire with snowball effect from November 2015 to September 2016. Data was analysed using SPSS software.</p><p id="Par1340"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1341">Most women had difficulties in reconciling work with BF (72.5%).

Job status (employed <italic>versus</italic> unemployed) did not present a statistically significant relationship with BF duration. As to the age of the child when the mother returned to work, we verified a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.001) with BF duration. The level of difficulty the mother experienced in reconciling her job with BF also presented a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.002) with BF duration.</p><p id="Par1342"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1343">The majority of mothers reported difficulties in reconciling work with BF. Women who returned to work before their child was 6 months old had shorter BF duration. This reinforces the need to explore family’s timely expectations, and plan strategies to promote an effective management of work and BF. In this context, we believe there is a need to establish in our culture jurisdiction policies that favour BF and work. Health professionals should act as mediators in the definition of family-oriented health policies. In this case, the extension of a parental leave for mothers up to 6 months postpartum, the existence of a place at work where breastfeeding mothers can extract and conserve their breastmilk or the existence of day-care centres in the workplace, in accordance to the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding [6,7], may prolong BF duration and ease mothers difficulty in managing BF when returning to work.</p><p id="Par1344"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1345">1.

Being the Portuguese population incidence of 1 million people (13.3% of the total population), with a national annual total estimated cost of 1.7 billion euros with this condition. One in each four patients of DM develop Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime, ending some in amputations and consequently in death [1]. Furthermore, the Directorate-General of Health estimated that in 2016, the prevalence of DFU was of 11.5% in the Portuguese population [2]. Throughout the years, DFU assessment tools have been created, such as: I) scales, which depend on visual examination being highly subjective; II) invasive methods that use manual procedures for depicting the shape, area, depth and volume of wounds, that are time consuming, susceptible to human errors and can lead to wound contamination [3]; or III) non-invasive methods such as optical based techniques which provide three-dimensional information about the lesion, which are expensive, time consuming and require user training [4]. Therefore, more objective measures are required.</p><p id="Par1372"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1373">This research study aims to create an objective and simple methodology based in a mobile application which incorporates an algorithm that characterises DFU ulcers providing information about its area and tissue colour composition.</p><p id="Par1374"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1375">An Android mobile application was developed, tested and evaluated in 200 diabetic foot ulcers, after signing the informed consent and the procedure being explained to patients.

Descriptive statistics were used, as well as univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, with a significance level of 5%.</p><p id="Par1393"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1394">Elders were most from female gender (60.1%), aged between 65 and 74 years (49.6%) and lived in rural areas (73.4%). Just 36.5% of the elderly practice physical exercise and an important amount of elderly drink coffee and tea (68.8% and 73.2%, respectively). Concerning sleep characteristics, the elders go to bed between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. and about half of participants (52.8%) go between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m. Approximately one third had difficulty in falling asleep (38.1%), especially the elderly from the region of Bragança. During sleep, a large proportion of the elderly reported having sleep stops (78.2%) usually for 15-30 minutes and 26.5% reported waking up twice during the night. Taking into account that the time of delay to sleep is an important factor, in the present study, this was statistically related with the gender (p = 0.003) and with taking medication to sleep (p &lt; 0.001). The same two factors are statistically related with “<italic>wake up during the night</italic>” (p = 0.046, p = 0.003, respectively). 40.7% of the surveyed elderly have been diagnosed with sleep disorders, mainly insomnia (19.7%) following by restless legs syndrome (3.4%), excessive drowsiness (2.9%) and sleep apnoea, sleep-walking and narcolepsy (about 1%). It is important to refer that among the elderly, that assume to suffer from sleep disorders, just 40.7% have been consulted by a physician. Of those who consulted a doctor, 21.3% of the elderly were advised to change their lifestyle habits, such as, to avoid heavy meals before bedtime, to establish a sleep routine, to lie down only when he/she is sleepy and to practice physical activity. Concerning the pharmacological therapy, 41.7% take medication for sleep disorders, 9% take medication without consulting a doctor, while 32.5% elderly people take medication after consulting a doctor. From these, the most used are benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (12.5%), diazepam (8.6%), lorazepam (4.5%) and brotizolam (3.7%).</p><p id="Par1395"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1396">Sleep disorders are frequent in the elderly population.

Sample constituted by 202 elderlies from a population of 808 (three age groups: 65-74; 75-84 and ≥ 85 years old), obtained in a randomized and probabilistic trial, from the files of users of a Health Centre, after ethic commission approval. As instrument and method of data collection was used the QAFMI (Portuguese version of the Older Americans Resources and Services), to evaluate the functional status, in terms of physical and mental health. Data analysis: a) descriptive analyses on the most common pathologies, their limitation and medication consumption; b) functional evaluation using the score given by the computer software based on the model of QAFMI.</p><p id="Par1405"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1406">As main results we point out, the pathologies with major interference in physical activities, which are chronic bronchitis, skin disease, arthritis or rheumatism, effects of stroke and circulation troubles. Related to the consumption of medication, it was observed that for the most cited pathologies (hypertension and cardiac problems) there is a great percentage of consumption. Others (arthritis or rheumatism) have a lower prescription. There was no statistically significant difference for physical health, in the comparative study between genders. There are differences between the age groups, with lower scores for the oldest. Related to mental functional abilities, there is a statistically significant difference for the diverse age groups, with an increase of impaired capacity for the oldest. For the whole of the sample gender differences exist, being worst scored the women.</p><p id="Par1407"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1408">Women and the oldest, in general, appear as the ones that present lower functional physical abilities. The classification by the QAFMI model, regarding the area of mental health, reports the approach of cognitive decline and perception of memory loss.

Polymedication means the use of multiple medications, which can cause adverse reactions/drug interactions that increase depending on the number of medications administered. In elderly with high number of pathologies associated or not with age, complex therapies are instituted which may lead to non-adherence to therapy. This situation can impair the aim of treatment, worsen the disease, add errors to diagnosis and treatment itself, or even lead to therapy failure.</p><p id="Par1415"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1416">The objective of the present study is to assess the adherence to therapy in elderly institutionalized during the day and investigate the main factors that influence it.</p><p id="Par1417"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1418">The study was conducted with the collection and processing of questionnaires, consisting of 3 parts: demographic characterization (e.g., age, gender, marital status); therapeutic characterization (amount of daily medications and treatment regimen) and evaluation of adherence to therapy by adapting the scale of measurement of adherence to treatment (MAT).

Radiotherapy (RT) is currently used in the treatment of both types of cancer [1–4].</p><p id="Par1427"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1428">Assessment of the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) on cell lines of EC (OE19) and of BC (HT1376), namely viability and cell proliferation, characterisation of cellular death type and cell cycle, as well to establish survival factor and determination of the aggression model, after different radiation dose exposure to calculate half lethal dose (DL50).</p><p id="Par1429"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1430">Cell lines were cultured and exposed to single-shot doses of X-rays from 0.5 Gy to 12.0 Gy, except control cells (0.0 Gy). Cell viability and proliferation were assessed by trypan blue assay. The proliferation index determination was performed by immunocytochemistry trough Ki-67 expression. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell death type and cell cycle and the main morphological features of cell death were evaluated by May-Grünwald Giemsa stain. Clonogenic assays enabled assessment to differences in reproductive viability (capacity of cells to produce progeny) [5–11].</p><p id="Par1431"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1432">Our results showed that IR induces cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects in OE19 and HT1376 cells in a dose-dependent manner and dose and time-dependent manner, respectively. Main types of cell death observed were apoptosis or necrosis. We also observed cell cycle arrest on G2/M phase and a decrease of the Ki-67 expression in both cell lines studied. The cell survival curves were established according to the quadratic linear model for both cell lines. For OE19 cell line the DL50 was 2.47 Gy and for HT1376 cell line was 3.10 Gy, accompanied by a decrease in the survival factor for both lines.</p><p id="Par1433"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1434">The direct effects of the DNA molecule that are unrepairable, activate multiple intracellular mechanisms on radio-sensitivity, such as cell death, namely by apoptosis and necrosis and cell cycle arresting G2/M phase. The increase radiation dose induces alterations in cell death, from apoptosis to necrosis. According to our results, OE19 is more radio-sensible than HT1376 cell line. This study demonstrates that molecular mechanisms underlying RT are important in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer therapeutic approaches.</p><p id="Par1435"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par1436">The authors would like to thank to Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Life Sciences is a research Institution of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and to Radiotherapy Service of the Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra.</p><p id="Par1437"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1438">1.

In relation to mothers’ educational level, we verified a statistically significant relationship with BF duration, being that the mothers who detained a higher level of education, breastfed longer [1,5–7]. As for marital status, we did not verify a statistically significant relationship with BF duration, which is in line with a recent Portuguese study [5] but differs from other international studies [2,3] that refer that married mothers breastfeed longer. This difference can be explained by cultural differences and by the paradigmatic change of the women’s role, concept of marriage, and a diversity of forms of family life (great increase in unmarried couples). We also verified an increasing tendency in BF duration with the increase of the number of older children [6,7], but it was not lowest in primiparous women which contradicts other findings [6,7]. This may be clarified, once again, by the sociodemographic changes in the last decade in Portugal that include population ageing, an increasing tendency for families with an only child [4] and the great investment in parenthood and child well-being. Health care professionals should consider that sociodemographic characteristics are in constant change and so is its relation to health. These findings help health professionals to identify who may be most vulnerable to early weaning and allows them to explore expectations and develop a care plan accordingly.</p><p id="Par1461"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1462">1.

The preparation of food for human consumption is a centuries old craft, which results in food with high sugar and salt levels leading to a poor health for many people and not contributing to the recovery of seriously ill-hospitalized patients. One of the key challenges is to tailor food to the individual to match their dietary requirement and metabolic characteristics. We believe that direct digital manufacturing is able to address these issues. To date the use of 3D printing for food has been restricted to the production of aesthetic shapes for chocolate and pasta products. We see the potential in a different way in which we can tailor the food to the individual incorporating where required drug-based therapies whilst retaining the requirements to be visually pleasing. In addition, it will be possible to guarantee all the organoleptic characteristics to which the consumer in general is familiar (such as smell, sound and texture). The mouth is the gateway for food and its acceptance requires specific taste triggers. We consider that by exploiting Direct Digital Manufacturing it will possible to optimize such taste triggers whilst retaining the nutritional balance and potential. Every consumer (in general) has challenges in chewing and swallowing and engineered food has the capability to achieve this, especially when coupled with a model of the processes of the mouth and the oesophagus, parameterized to the individual. Once the food reaches the digestive system, all of the foregoing topics are largely irrelevant, other than to consider where the nutritional or therapeutic agents are extracted. The challenge of the oral intake of insulin is the best-known situation, but the delivery of chemotherapeutics is another area of challenges. It is necessary to shield the toxic therapeutic from the taste sensors and the digestive system so that it reaches the critical area of the digestive system intact. We are developing a comprehensive food design and manufacturing system that will allow each of these challenges to be met. We expect the first use of such system will be to expedite the recovery of seriously ill patients in hospitals. As enhanced testing procedures become more widely available through technological developments a wider use in the home is expected.</p><p id="Par1588"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par1589">Engineered Food, Nutritional, Therapeutic.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec403"><title>O94 The influence of an eight month multicomponent training program in edlerlies gait and bone mineral mass</title><sec id="Sec404"><title>António M Monteiro<sup>1,2</sup>, Filipe Rodrigues<sup>2,3</sup>, Pedro Forte<sup>2,3</sup>, Joana Carvalho<sup>4</sup></title><sec id="Sec405"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Sports Sciences, Polytechnic Institute of Bragança, 5300-253 Bragança, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health and Human Development, University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, 5001-801 Vila Real, Portugal; <sup>3</sup>Department of Sports Sciences, University of Beira Interior, 6201-001 Covilhã, Portugal; <sup>4</sup>Research Centre in Physical Activity Health and Leisure, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, 4200-450 Porto, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec406"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Filipe Rodrigues (ptfiliperodrigues@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par1590"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1591">Aging induces neuromuscular changes and mass, strength, muscular resistance and power, motor coordination, so, reaction and movement speed reduction may be compromised [1]. These changes result in slower movements and functional limitations in gait and weight transfer activities [1]. Even more, the functional fitness decreasing due to aging, increases the risk of falls and bone fractures [2], reducing the elderly’s quality of life.</p><p id="Par1592"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1593">Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of an eight months multicomponent training program in elderly’s gait and bone mineral mass (BMM).</p><p id="Par1594"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1595">Forty-nine elderlies were recruited for this research with 64.39 (± 6.33) years old, 11 males with 67.45 (± 4.93) and 38 females with 63.50 (± 7.47) years old. The subjects were community living persons of Bragança. All procedures carried out in this research were in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki. The multicomponent training program followed the Carvalho et al. [1], recommendations. Each session time volume was between 50 to 60 minutes. The sessions were divided in five parts: 1) general warm-up; 2) walking with aerobic exercises; 3) 1 to 3 sets of exercises of muscular resistance with 12 to 15 repetitions; 4) Static and dynamic balance training; 5) An active recovery period with stretching and breading exercises. The elderlies gait was evaluated with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and BMM with bioimpedance (Tanita, BC-545). The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test allowed to assess the differences between pre and post 8 months of the training program in BBS and BMM. The tests were performed with a significant level of 5%.</p><p id="Par1596"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1597">The BBS values pre and post the multicomponent training program for BBS were 47.33 and 50.33 respectively. In BMM, the pre and post values were 2.36kg and 2.39 kg. Despite the differences in BMM means, they were not significant between the two moments (F = 1.253; p = 0.706). However, the same did not occur in terms of BMS values (F = 1.967; p&lt; 0.001), where gait values increased significantly in the second moment.</p><p id="Par1598"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1599">Although the multicomponent training program did not increase the BMM in the elderly subjects, gait values increased significantly.

First, a quantitative study was carried out using the scales: EHA (eating habits scale), TAA-25 (eating attitudes test) and GSQ (general self-efficacy scale). In a second step, a qualitative study was carried out with subgroups that were selected from the results of the first phase of the study. These subgroups presented opposite patterns of habits (group A: better eating habits - EHA≥160 and group B: worst habits - EHA≤125) and we moved into a grounded theory approach with semi-structured individual interviews.</p><p id="Par1673"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1674">Gender emerges as a determinant of eating choices pattern, with girls assuming more adequate eating habits (t =3.84; p &lt;. 0001; r<sup>2</sup>adjusted= .037, p&lt; .0001). The perception of general self-efficacy assumes greater relevance for boys, functioning as a protective factor that reduces unhealthy options. Through multinomial regression models, we could see that gender and general self-efficacy have a big influence on eating habits. The ideals of beauty have influence on this effect. Resisting adversity has an important influence in the choices, being associated to self-regulation. The situations of risk to develop an eating behaviour disturbance appear mainly in the cases of adolescents presenting better habits (r<sub>SP</sub>= .203; p &lt; .001) and are more frequent in girls (t = 3.54; p &lt; .0001; OR = 4.04). Through content analysis it was possible to identify determinant factors that were perceived by adolescents in both groups. The ones that were more often mentioned (in a decreasing order) were family influence, taste preferences, knowledge of healthy eating rules and availability. This was followed by determinants such as self-control capacity, feeling well or bad, peer influence, feeling hungry or full, developing a task or not, impulsiveness, time available and humour/stress.</p><p id="Par1675"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1676">The differences found between sexes can justify differentiated interventions.

One group of students had an extracurricular physical activity beyond curricular physical activity (Federated Sports), and the other group entails students who only practice physical activities as a curricular activity (School Sport). Body composition (BMI and %BF) were also evaluated by Fitnessgram. To evaluate motor abilities the software Predictive Analytics Software – PASW was applied.</p><p id="Par1685"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1686">After analysing the results, we became aware that students with extracurricular physical activities had better results in motor skills than students with curricular physical activities. This result is perhaps the less surprising in the set of all assessments due to the longer physical commitment of these students in relation to the students that only exercise in the context of curricular activities. Regarding physical fitness, students with extracurricular physical activity can have more students in HFZ (healthy fitness zone) than students with curricular physical activity. Regarding the arms extension and flexion, 26% of the students with curricular physical activity are above HFZ, achieving better performance than the students that have extracurricular physical activity. According to the skills measured, the students with extracurricular physical activities achieve a relatively higher average than students with curricular physical activities. Regarding body composition and after determining the BMI and %BF of each group, it appears that students with extracurricular physical activities achieve better results than those achieved by the students of curricular physical activities.</p><p id="Par1687"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1688">The regular practice of sports with curricular and extracurricular physical activities, seems to contribute to an improvement of physical fitness, motor skills and body composition of students, keeping them in a healthy fitness zone, thus preventing premature cardiovascular diseases, among others.</p><p id="Par1689"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par1690">Motor Skills, Physical Fitness, Body Composition, Federated Sports, School Sports.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec431"><title>O101 Promotion of language skills in children aged 5-6 years, without language disorders</title><sec id="Sec432"><title>Tiago Rodrigues, Catarina Mangas</title><sec id="Sec433"><title>School of Education and Social Sciences, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec434"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Tiago Rodrigues (tiagoac.rodrigues@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par1691"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1692">Language is a human faculty that enables communication with various interlocutors. This appears early and develops, exponentially, in the early years of life. For such, it is important that the surrounding environment is stimulating and allows the exchange of experiences with other speakers. The pre-school age is a milestone in the development, not only for stimulation, but also to identify deviant behaviours. In order to avoid future complications, professionals who deal with these children should prevent any language disorders. The speech and language therapist, being a health professional trained to deal with the areas of communication and language, has a prominent role in this preventive action. In Portugal, there aren't many references concerning prevention in language disorders. As such, it is necessary to promote a definite change in the present scenario, namely with innovative and stimulating materials to develop language.</p><p id="Par1693"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1694">Therefore, this is an exploratory-descriptive study, with a qualitative-quantitative paradigm and the general objective of this study was “<italic>to create and implement a Language Skills Promotion Program for 5-6 year-old children without any language disorders, in order to analyse their potential influence on their language skills</italic>”.</p><p id="Par1695"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1696">To this end, a 10-session program was build, evaluated and validated by a panel of experts. Before the beginning of the program, all the sample children were evaluated with a language test for preschool age. A sample of 12 children, divided equally in two groups, was selected and the program was applied by a Speech and Language Therapist only to one of these groups. At the same time, the Childhood Educator’s opinion was collected in order to understand the influence of the respective program on the children's language skills.</p><p id="Par1697"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1698">The final results of the study show that children who participated in the program improved their language skills, which was not the case of the children who did not take part in that same study. These results prove that the investment in prevention actions, through the promotion of language skills, enhances the oral and written language skills of children, especially in terms of literacy, something that is indispensable for their educational success.</p><p id="Par1699"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1700">Finally, the study also emphasizes the importance of primary prevention actions, such as the application and development of programs to stimulate or organize information actions, with a view to promoting the health and the well-being of society in general.</p><p id="Par1701"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par1702">Child language, Child-rearing, Early intervention, Prevention, Speech therapy.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec435"><title>O102 The impact of a training program on the performance of nurses working at a chemotherapy ward</title><sec id="Sec436"><title>Joana M Silva, Isabel M Moreira, Anabela Salgueiro-Oliveira</title><sec id="Sec437"><title>Nursing School of Coimbra, 3046-851 Coimbra, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec438"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Joana M Silva (joanamota19@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par1703"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1704">Oral mucositis (OM) is the major complication reported by patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, with a strong impact on their quality of life by compromising physical and psychological functions [1]. OM affects 40-76% of patients undergoing chemotherapy and up to 90% of patients undergoing radiotherapy [3,4]. Inadequate oral hygiene is a patient-related risk factor in which health professionals can intervene [5,7], namely nurses [6]. Oral examination allows diagnosing the different stages of OM and establishing an individualized care plan.</p><p id="Par1705"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1706">To assess the impact of a training program on the performance of nurses working at a chemotherapy ward regarding OM risk assessment and prevention in cancer patients.</p><p id="Par1707"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1708">This action-research study aimed to identify nurses' interventions in patients with or at risk for OM. Data were collected from the nursing records of 110 patients between October and November 2016 in order to analyse the nursing documentation pattern based on an evidence-based grid. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The discussion with the team nurses about the results obtained in the document analysis was used to design a three-session training program. The next step was to reanalyse the nursing documentation pattern with the purpose of identifying positive changes in the aspects under study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee.</p><p id="Par1709"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1710">The analysis of the documentation pattern showed that 31.8% of the patients were not asked about oral hygiene practices, although 25.7% of the sampled patients were in the 1st cycle of chemotherapy. A total of 21.9% of patients were not observed during oral hygiene care. Only 14.5% of patients were given instructions about the treatment of side effects, and only 12.5% of them were given instructions about oral hygiene care. Only 2.7% of the patients had their oral cavity/mucous membranes examined, and all of them were diagnosed with OM. The implementation of the training program led to the introduction of standardized records for oral cavity surveillance. Nurses showed high adherence levels to this practice and considered it very relevant in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par1711"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1712">The research results show that nurses do not perform a systematic diagnostic evaluation of patients’ oral cavity and that few patients receive instruction on oral hygiene care, which does not contribute to patient empowerment in this area. The implementation of the training program showed that nurses recognize the need for and are committed to changing practices in this area.</p><p id="Par1713"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1714">1.

Teachers’ psychological well-being is essential not only for themselves abut also for students. Experiential avoidance of private events (e.g., thoughts, feelings, body sensations) has been pointed as a key construct linked to psychopathological symptoms. The Teachers Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (TAAQ) is a teacher-specific measure developed to target experiential avoidance related to the teaching activity.</p><p id="Par1774"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1775">The current study sought out to develop the Portuguese version of Teachers Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (TAAQ-PT), explore its factor structure and psychometric properties in a sample of Portuguese teachers teaching in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd basic cycles and secondary education.</p><p id="Par1776"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1777">A sample of 304 teachers, 256 women (84.2%) and 48 men (15.8%) was recruited through teachers’ professional associations.

They were filled by 651 subjects aged 10 to 18 years, attending four Portuguese community schools. Univariate analyses were used to verify significant differences between groups. Logistic, linear and multinomial regression analyses were used to determine significant biosocial predictors of injury, injury rate, injury type and body area injury location.</p><p id="Par1790"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1791">Injury rate was higher in boys with lower scores in the school environment dimension of KIDSCREEN-52 (p = .022) and in girls was higher in those with lower scores in the moods and emotions dimension (p .001) and higher scores in the self-perception dimension (p &lt; .001). Also in girls, upper limbs injuries were associated with higher scores in the moods and emotions dimension, and the spine and torso with lower scores (p = .037).

Injuries in the Portuguese youth were linked to three dimensions of KIDSCREEN-52 (moods and emotions, self-perception and school environment) and parents education level. Sports injuries usually result from the combination of several risk factors interacting at a given time [9].

Physical activity plays therefore a key role in maintaining the health and physical fitness of the elderly [2]. The recommendations on physical activity for health suggest that the elderly should perform at least 30 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity per day [3, 4].</p><p id="Par1810"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1811">The aim of this paper is to accurately quantify physical activity time in the elderly and to verify the existence of differences regarding physical fitness levels between two groups of people: those who complied and those who did not comply with the Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health [4].</p><p id="Par1812"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1813">This cross-sectional study sample includes 36 elderly individuals (72.28 ± 6.58 years old), both male and female, divided into two groups: the group which has fulfilled the recommendations (N = 16; 53.76 ± 24.39 minutes) and the group that has not fulfilled the recommendations (N = 20; 15.95 ± 7.79 minutes). Physical activity was assessed for 3 consecutive days and 600 minutes of daily recording, at least. The ActiGraph® GT1M Accelerometer was hence used. The “Functional Fitness Test” battery (Rikli and Jones) was used to assess the physical and functional autonomy of the elderly [5]. In order to analyse data, descriptive and inferential statistics were used. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess normality, whereas the Mann-Whitney test and the t-Test were used for independent samples.</p><p id="Par1814"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1815">On average, participants spent more time in sedentary activities than in physical activity. The group which has fulfilled the recommendations on physical activity has achieved better results on almost all physical fitness tests: 30 s chair stand (repetitions), arm curl (repetitions), 6-minute walk test (m), 8-foot up-and-go (s). However, no significant difference was found between the groups.</p><p id="Par1816"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1817">The results therefore suggest that only 44.4% of the evaluated participants complied with the Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health. Evidence also suggests that the adherence to these guidelines might have a positive influence on the physical fitness of the elderly, particularly muscular strength, endurance and agility, but not flexibility.</p><p id="Par1818"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par1819">This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT; Grant Pest – OE/CED/UI4016/2016).</p><p id="Par1820"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1821">1.

In fact, this lack of physical fitness may reduce older individuals’ quality of life, leading to dependence on personal daily assistance or even to becoming significantly more prone to fatal falls [1]. Prevention through physical activity programs, are used to slow down and delay these aging effects, by improving individuals’ agility, flexibility and body improved functionality. Most of these programs take place in in-water environment due to age limiting factors such as high-risk osteoporosis, reduced mobility, higher risk of fracture from falls, arthrosis and spinal disorders among other.</p><p id="Par1830"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1831">To assess the effects of two strength and conditioning programs in strength and dynamic balance in older adults.</p><p id="Par1832"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1833">One hundred elderlies (36 males and 64 females) aged 67.3 ± 5.2 years old enrolled the 5-year long intervention program and were assessed for lower body strength (LBS) and dynamic balance (DB). Two intervention programs were set up and subjects were included in each group according to their own will. Program A (n = 52; 24 males and 28 females; age 67.2 ± 5.2 y-o) consisted of 1 in-water session and 2 in dry-land sessions per week. Program B (n = 48; 12 males and 36 females; age 67 ± 5.2 y-o) consisted of 2 in-water sessions and 1 in dry-land session per week. Wilcoxon test was used on inferential analysis for repeated measures (pre-post). Significance level was kept at 5%. The effect size for this test was calculated by dividing the z value by the square root of N [2].</p><p id="Par1834"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1835">Combined data from both programs showed that LBS and DB improved significantly at the end of the intervention programs: LBS from 18.3±3.2 reps to 18.8±3.1 reps (p=0.003; r=-0.295), DB 4.2±0.7 secs to 4.0±0.7 secs (p=0.017; r=-0.245). Program A significantly improved LBS from 19.1±2.8 reps to 19.9±2.7 reps (p=0.001; r=-0.465) but not DB 4.1±0.7 secs to 4.0±0.7 secs (p=0.083; r=-0.240). No differences were found neither in Program B LBS – 17.5±3.4 reps to 17.6±3.1 reps (p=0.462; r=-0.106) – nor DB - 4.2±0.6 secs to 4.1±0.6 secs (p=0.083; r=-0.250).</p><p id="Par1836"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1837">Strength and conditioning programs over a 5-year time span seem to substantially delay the negative effects of aging on LBS/DB in the elderly. No visible decline in the assessed parameters was observed. Our results may suggest different effects of in-water and dry-land programs. However, participants generally responded positively to both intervention programs.</p><p id="Par1838"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1839">1. World Health Organization. Falls Fact Sheet.

The inclusion of a PC Curricular Unit (CU) in the Nursing Undergraduate Program (NUP) translates into the acquisition of competencies that allow caring for people and families in need of those carefulness. Although considering professional, institutional and family barriers, there is evidence that students apply, in clinical practice, the principles inherent of PC [1]. During clinical education, students are confronted with persons in need of PC, however without benefiting from such care. These experiences can form the basis, from which, it is possible to build the teaching-learning process of future nurses, regarding this theme.</p><p id="Par1881">Objective</p><p id="Par1882">To identify the conceptions and motivations for the frequency of the CU option of PC, by nursing undergraduate students'.</p><p id="Par1883"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1884">In the first class, nurses’ students were asked to anonymously write what they understood as PC and the motivation for attending this CU. The 210 responses collected over 5 years were subjected to content analysis [2].</p><p id="Par1885"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1886">The PC conceptions reported were grouped into the categories: “Care for people in the final stages of life”, “Care to alleviate suffering” and “Comfort care”. The reasons for choosing the PC option were grouped in “Difficult and not tackled area”, “Area that arouses more interest” and “Previous Experiences”. It is verified that the concept of PC remains as care for people in terminal phase of life and in suffering. Some students report experiencing situations that would lead to PC, conditions of therapeutic obstinacy and end of life in circumstances of intense suffering. Students also mention the nurses ‘attempts to provide those carefulness, which is not well favoured for, in the hospital wards. Students indicate interventions that are intrinsic to palliative care, such as, communication, psychological support, coping with death and mourning, without any reference to the need for knowledge in other areas, namely pathology, pharmacology, or maintenance and healthcare technologies. The orientation of care for quality of life, family integration and management of symptoms is not considered.</p><p id="Par1887"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1888">There is a need to include in each NUP a PC CU, preferably after a period of clinical education in hospital wards.

It allows exercise professionals to define the most appropriate actions to implement more suitable strategies and remove possible barriers to exercise. The decrease in body fat mass may be indirectly related to the motivation that the individual has for the practice of the physical exercise. Higher levels of motivation to lose weight may be related with higher adherence to, for example, the training plan and, consequently, be related to higher levels of body mass fat reduction.</p><p id="Par1906"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1907">This study aimed to analyse the association between body fat and motives to practice physical exercise.</p><p id="Par1908"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1909">The sample comprised 85 adults (38 males and 47 females) attending the gym, who completed a sociodemographic form and the Exercise Motivations Inventory - 2 (EMI-2). A multiple regression analysis was used to predict the value of a %body fat (%BF) based on the value of survey categories. The significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

This leads to the presence of multiple and complex medications in the life of many older adults (OA). As the self-management and adherence behaviours of these medications require the development of competences, it is important to develop a quick and easy instrument to provide systematized data for the health professional that will allow a better decision-making process and a higher probability of developing interventions with impact in the medication-taking ability of the OA. With this purpose, AGITE was developed following a process of systematic literature review, content analysis and psychometric testing, resulting in a total of nineteen questions with a Likert scale approach. Previous studies demonstrated the need for further testing of its psychometric properties.</p><p id="Par1948"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1949">After application of the AGITE to 146 elders in day centres in Central Portugal, exploratory factorial analysis (EFA) using the eigenvalue criteria, and internal consistency (IC) through Cronbach’s Alpha were performed.</p><p id="Par1950"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1951">From the EFA, using varimax rotation and screen plot analysis, an acceptable KMO of 0.653 was obtained, with no items being eliminated through analysis of anti-image matrix. A total of five dimensions emerged explaining 53.6% of the variance: “Engagement”, “Neglect and External Influences”, “Perceived Benefits”, “Healthcare Professionals Support”, and “Value assigned to Written Information”. Through analysis of the items of each dimension, higher scores of “Engagement” indicate a responsible attitude towards self-management and adherence, while higher scores of “Neglect and External Influences” demonstrate a tendency to cease medication, according to individual and non-professional external beliefs. Regarding the dimension “Perceived Benefits”, higher scores evidence how the elder positively perceives the effects of the medication, while higher scores of “Healthcare Professionals Support” are related with perceived importance of the healthcare professionals in the medication-taking ability. Higher scores of “Value assigned to Written Information” demonstrate a tendency to attribute significance to written data regarding medication. Overall the questionnaire dimensions demonstrate questionable to acceptable IC (0.6 &lt; α &lt; 0.8).</p><p id="Par1952"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1953">New analysis of the psychometric properties evidences the emergence of new dimensions, allowing for a wider understanding of the profile of the medication-taking ability of the elder population in Portugal.

Emotional Intelligence (EI) has generated a broad interest in the scientific community in Spain [1]. Prestigious social scientists from different lines of research contribute to assess important theoretical and empirical topics on this construct [2]. Aging is a process during which important changes occur in different areas of development and emotional intelligence plays an essential role. Throughout the years, the subject of death has been conceived in different ways. People abstain from talking about it, and a conduct of avoidance can be observed manifesting itself in fear and anxiety [3].</p><p id="Par1958"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1959">The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence and fear of death in an older population.</p><p id="Par1960"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1961">A Spanish sample of 384 older people aged 65 years and older (51.82% women; 71.23 ± 8.34 years of age), without cognitive impairment, were included in this descriptive and correlational study.

Evidence has suggested multiple effects of VitD beyond bone homeostasis. Low VitD levels are associated with numerous disorders including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, among others. Consumers have the general misperception that “vitamin” denotes something harmless and vital, disregarding its potentially harmful effects. Although vitD toxicity is uncommon, case reports attributed to vitD supplementation have raised. Being a fat-soluble vitamin, excessive supplementation may result in body accumulation and toxicity. It increases intestinal calcium absorption and plays a central role in its homeostasis. Thus, most symptoms of toxicity result from hypercalcemia. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal disorders (anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), muscle and joint pain, cardiac complaints, hypertension, central nervous system effects and renal disorders (polyuria, polydipsia).</p><p id="Par1974"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par1975">The aim of this study was to evaluate whether VitD3 (cholecalciferol) daily dose indicated on food supplements (FS) labels coincided with the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for this vitamin defined by the European Union Directive.</p><p id="Par1976"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1977">Labels of 110 FS sold in Portuguese pharmacies, supermarkets or health shops were examined.

As such, in recent years there has been a large number of studies examining the benefits imposed by different types of exercise (e.g. resistance training [2], and aquatic fitness [3]). However, in addition to the benefits imposed, it is crucial that the exercise is motivating and challenging.</p><p id="Par2014"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2015">It was aimed to examine the possible effects on conditioning induced by 8-weeks of aquatic fitness, in female older adults.</p><p id="Par2016"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2017">Fourteen women (64.3 ± 7.3 years old) enrolled in bi-weekly aquatic fitness of 45’ sessions for 8 weeks.

Participating socially helps to develop the feeling of belonging to a community and allows everyone to see each individual contribution in upholding the community [2-4].</p><p id="Par2033"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2034">Characterize the profile of community-dwelling adults aged 55 or older, regarding social participation, functional capacity (walking speed, grip strength, lower limb strength, static and dynamic balance) and personal factors (age, gender, BMI, confidence/fear of falling and perception of general health); verify the relationship between social participation and functional capacity as well as participation and personal factors; and find, among all the variables, which can be the best predictors of social participation.</p><p id="Par2035"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2036">Descriptive, exploratory and cross-sectional study. The sample is composed of 150 Portuguese community-dwelling older adults. The statistical design included descriptive analyses (measures of central tendency and dispersion); inferential analyses (bivariate: t-test for independent samples, One-Way ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation coefficient; multivariate: linear multiple regression, moderated linear multiple regression and hierarchical linear multiple regression). The level of significance was α =0.05, with a 95% confidence interval.</p><p id="Par2037"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2038">The results have shown that this sample was composed mostly by women, mean age approximately 69 years old. Statistically significant associations between social participation and all study variables: Age (r = 0.301, p = 0.00), BMI (r = 0.169, p = 0.039), Grip strength (r = -0.318, p = 0.00), Pressure platform Hercules® (r = -0.337, p = 0.00), perception of general health (r = 0.468, p = 0.00), Timed Up &amp; Go (r = 0.668, p = 0.00), T10M (r = -0.576, p = 0.00), Test Step (r = -0.456, p=0.00) and Fall Efficacy Scale (r = 0.768, p = 0.00). Regression analysis shows that the confidence in performing activities of the daily living without fear of falling, health perception and dynamic balance, measured by Timed Up &amp; Go test, as a whole, are responsible for 65.5% of the variance of social participation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.655; p &lt; 0.001). Using a second model we have seen that a sizeable part of the variance percentage related to the participants’ social participation, 55%, is due once again to dynamic balance and health perception, followed by age (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.549; p &lt; 0.001).</p><p id="Par2039"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2040">The Timed Up &amp; Go test and the unique question on health perception: “<italic>In general, would you say that your health is excellent, very good, good, satisfactory or poor?</italic>” account for a significant percentage of the variance in social participation in elderly individuals.

These processes occur mostly during the first years of the child’s life, having each child different developmental rhythms [1]. Motor skills are fundamental to our day-to-day life, representing the key to the child's development [2]. As such, it is important to know the different factors that influence the development of motor skills during childhood. According to bibliography, the presence of siblings may be an important factor, because this relationship provides a basis for learning and socialization opportunities in various contexts [3].</p><p id="Par2050"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2051">The main goal of this study was to verify if there were differences in the development of motor skills (global and fine) through the scales of the PDMS-2, comparing children that have or do not have siblings.</p><p id="Par2052"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2053">In this study 91 children of both sexes participated (30.20 ± 10.56 months). Two groups were created: the sibling group, consisting of 48 children (31.06 ± 10.76 months) and the non-sibling group, consisting of 43 children (29.23 ± 10.37 months). Motor skills were assessed using the PDMS-2 test battery scales4. The evaluation was performed during 4 months, 3 times a week and individually (approximately 30 minutes for each child).

It is known that childhood obesity is particularly high in urban settings. Thus, a deeper understanding of the impact of such areas in children weight is needed.

However, even within the same urban area, perceptions of neighbourhood safety change. The aspects that influence children weight status differ according to the parishes they live in - urban centre or peripheric parishes. For example, parents from a significant proportion of overweight or obese children living in the urban centre parishes perceives their neighbourhood environment as unsafe to walk during the day, however, no differences were found between normal and overweight or obese children from the peripheric parishes.

The average of total points did not vary at the beginning or at the end (74 pts). Effective beliefs increased from 61.3 to 68.7 (p &lt; 0.05) and self-efficacy from 1617 to 1851 (p &lt; 0.05). Observation and video analysis showed that Nutritionists went from delivering information to open and strategic inquiring during the course. Accompaniment showed that skills were deepened and the level of satisfaction improved with practice.</p><p id="Par2127"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2128">This is an innovative program that incorporates CBMI and defines a methodology centred on reflection, practice and accompaniment in real and simulated situations. It is necessary to evaluate the effects in indicators that measure user behaviour and the effect and impact on adult obesity. This training program represents a tool to promote behavioural change and adherence in PHC to prevent obesity.</p><p id="Par2129"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par2130">The project was financed by CONICYT: FONIS SA16I0122.</p><p id="Par2131"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par2132">Behavior Change, Motivational Interview, Professional Education, Obesity, Nutritionists Skills.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec547"><title>O130 Childhood body fat and motor competence in elementary school (5 to 9 years old)</title><sec id="Sec548"><title>Francisco Campos<sup>1</sup>, Ricardo Santos<sup>1</sup>, Mariana Temudo<sup>1</sup>, Kátia Semedo<sup>1</sup>, Diogo Costa<sup>1</sup>, Ricardo Melo<sup>1</sup>, Fernando Martins<sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec549"><title><sup>1</sup>Coimbra Education School, Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, 3030-329 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Instituto de Telecomunicações, University of Beira Interior, 6201-001 Covilhã, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec550"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Francisco Campos (francicampos@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par2133"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2134">Obesity rates have increased globally in the last decades, justifying the denomination “public health epidemic”. According some studies [1], in Portugal, childhood overweight and obesity affects about 31.5% of elementary school children, with higher values for girls, except between 7.5 and 9.0 years old. Overweight and obesity are strictly related with childhood motor competence [2]. To access overweight and obesity, among others, is recommended the body fat percentage (BFP), classified by age and gender by McCarthy centiles of BFP [3].</p><p id="Par2135"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2136">The main objectives of this investigation are: 1) to characterize childhood elementary school overweight/obesity and compare it by gender and age; 2) to correlate childhood elementary school overweight/obesity with motor competence.</p><p id="Par2137"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2138">Data was collected from 604 children’s between 5 to 9 years old (7.40 ± 1.16 years old; 295 female) of the 10 elementary schools from the “Agrupamento de Escolas de Montemor-o-Velho” (Coimbra-Portugal), using: a) the electrical bio-impedance (model BC-533®) method, to access BFP; and b) a battery of physical tests [shifting platforms and lateral jumps (stability); shuttle run and standing long jump (locomotion); throwing velocity and kicking velocity (manipulation); and handgrip strength] to access motor competence [3].

There were no significant statistical differences (p = 0.519) between genders (Mann-Whitney). By age (Kruskal-Wallis), there were significant statistical differences (p = 0.001), specially between the 5 years old (Md=2) [p=0.016 (7 years old; Md=1); p=0.003 (8 years old; Md=1); p=0.021 (9 years old; Md=1)] and the 6 years old (Md=2) [p=0.005 (7 years old; Md=1); p=0.001 (8 years old; Md=1); p=0.013 (9 years old; Md=1)]. For Md interpretation, normal weight is classified by 1, overweight by 2 and obesity by 3. The Spearman test (r) allowed to verify significant statistical correlations, two positive [shuttle run (p=0.001; r=0.136); handgrip (p=0.002; r=0.123)] and three negative [lateral jump (p=0.001; r=-0.174); standing long jump (p=0.001; r=-0.249); throwing velocity (p=0.072; r=-0.073)].</p><p id="Par2141"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2142">It is important to take into account the current recommendations and concerns of the WHO [4] (healthy eating habits, physical activity regular practice), improving body composition and motor competence in childhood from an early age, resulting probably in healthier adults and minimizing possible social problems concerning public health.</p><p id="Par2143"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par2144">This work is funded by FCT/MEC through national funds and when applicable cofounded by FEDER - PT2020 partnership agreement under the project UID/EEA/50008/2013 and by QREN, Mais Centro - Programa Operacional Regional do Centro, FEDER (CENTRO-07-CT62-FEDER-005012; ID: 64765).</p><p id="Par2145"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2146">1.

The person with COPD has to cope with a complex therapeutic regimen and with the progressive worsening of the clinical condition [3], which may compromise their capacity for self-care. Therefore, people with COPD need support to manage the disease and the therapeutic regimen [4-6].</p><p id="Par2166"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2167">The study aims were to study people with COPD perception about their social support, as well as their level of adherence to medications and to analyse the association between perceived social support and adherence to medication.</p><p id="Par2168"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2169">This is a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study, with a sample of 45 adults diagnosed with COPD, admitted to medical service at a hospital in the northern part of Portugal, between February and May 2017. Participants mean age was 71 years (SD = 11.9), they were mostly male (86.7%), married (72.7%) and had a low level of education.

That is, while the individual works, creates bonds, commits himself and goes investing in the organization. The three-dimensional model [3] identifies the three dimensions of OC: the affective commitment, which consists in the feeling or desire to participate in the organization; the continuance commitment, which consists in the obligation to remain in the organization; and finally, the normative commitment, which consists in the worker's need to remain in the organization.</p><p id="Par2185"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2186">The objective of this study is to measure the OC levels, in its several dimensions, on the health professionals (physicians, nurses and auxiliaries) in two public hospitals in Cape Verde, considering the importance of sociodemographic variables (age, gender, marital status and academic qualifications) and Working context (work income, seniority in the company, type of contract and Hierarchical position) for the CO levels revealed.</p><p id="Par2187"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2188">The study used a quantitative methodology to evaluate the impact of sociodemographic and professional context variables on OC levels.

The inverse relation between OC levels and levels of academic qualifications, as identified by other authors [2-3, 5,8-9], is also a subject of interest. As well as the fact that the lower levels of OC appear in the most qualified professions: doctors and nurses, a not treated aspect in the literature and that characterizes the health professionals of Cape Verde.</p><p id="Par2193"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2194">1.

People with lack of sleep show a positive correlation between free time and food intake and also experience hormonal and brain changes that drive the intake of food with high calorific value [1-3]. In addition, scientific research has shown a healthy and balanced diet to positively influence the quality of sleep [1].</p><p id="Par2207"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2208">The present study was set out to assess the sleep quality of high school students in Bragança county, and its association with food intake.</p><p id="Par2209"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2210">The study used non-experimental, analytical and transversal methodology, of epidemiological character and with a quantitative approach. It was intended to carry out the study in a population of 862 high school students. However, due to consent being required from both legal guardians and students, a smaller sample of 345 students was obtained. The data was collected in May 2017 through a questionnaire that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), validated for the Portuguese population.</p><p id="Par2211"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2212">Throughout the study and following PSQI analysis, it was concluded that 39.71% (n = 137) of participants showed poor quality of sleep (PSQI &gt; 5 points).

The risk of suffering from poor sleep quality is higher in young populations who frequently eat snacks ([OR]: 2.811; 99%), sugary products ([OR]: 1.901; 95%), fast-food ([OR]: 4.000; 99%) and ready meals ([OR]: 5.621; 95%) in comparison with young populations who rarely eat this sort of food. The sleep quality is also significantly related with the number of meals young people have in a day (X<sup>2</sup> = 7.580; p = 0.023). The risk of having poor quality sleep is 2.240 times higher in young people who rarely eat 4-6 meals a day.</p><p id="Par2213"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2214">A correlation between sleep quality and food intake in the sampled students was seen. The risk of having poor quality of sleep is higher in students who frequently eat a high calorie diet and also in students who rarely have 4-6 meals a day.

The most common musculoskeletal pain conditions are nonspecific or idiopathic and include regional pain in the spine, with a high prevalence [1]. Multifactorial causes are indicated, like social, psychological, physiological and environmental factors [2, 3]. Within the environmental factors, the carriage of schoolbags is pointed out as a factor that contributes to the high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain [3-5]. However, some studies report that the weight of schoolbags has little influence on the perception of pain, mainly in the spine [6, 7]. Nevertheless, musculoskeletal pain in childhood can persist throughout adolescence and increases the risk of experiencing chronic pain in adulthood [8-10]. At this phase, adolescents undergo a period of accelerated muscle-skeletal growth and development, with spinal structures being sensitive to external aggressions [11].</p><p id="Par2273"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2274">The aim of this study was to evaluate musculoskeletal pain due to schoolbag carriage in terms of prevalence, intensity and predisposing risks factors in students of 5th grade in schools of the range of community health centres of Aveiro region, during the school year of 2016-2017.</p><p id="Par2275"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2276">A cross-sectional study was design.

Only 29.3% carried schoolbags that were ≤ 10 %BW. The majority (79.9%) carried schoolbags to school for ≤ 15 min. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was reasonable (37.8%), and in the region of spine was low (16.0%).

A booklet was used during five consecutive days to register food consumption. The study was previously approved by an Ethics Committee, and by the National Data Protection Commission (NDPC no.1704/2015). The informed consent of the child’s legal representative was signed.

In Long-Term Healthcare (LTH) this is reinforced by population ageing and corresponding prevalence of chronic diseases. Thus, it is fundamental to accurately measure costs and outcomes in healthcare, improving value created for patients, <italic>i.e.</italic>, patient-centred health outcomes per monetary unit of cost [1, 2]. TDABC methodology applied to healthcare allows identifying the cost for each clinical condition in the full cycle of care, mapping processes, activities, resources and allocated time [3–5]. It has been mostly applied in acute-care settings, partly due to complexity of defining chronic condition [6].</p><p id="Par2323"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2324">This paper focuses on the cost component of a larger on-going research project (CARE4VALUE), aiming to enhance value creation in LTH providers and applied to a partner LTH unit. Specifically, the main objective is to define clinical conditions in the context of LTH, as a first step in the implementation of TDBAC.</p><p id="Par2325"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2326">Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods were applied, including: 1) three focus groups conducted with the health team of the LTH unit (physician, nurses, physiotherapist, psychologist, social assistant) to select, discuss and validate the criteria to define clinical conditions; 2) construction of a composite indicator and testing it over a sample of anonymized clinical data from 21 patients; 3) structured observation of processes taken throughout the full cycle of care of patients in different conditions. Qualitative data was submitted to content analysis and validated among participants. Quantitative data used in the composite indicator, based on validated scales, was subject to normalization, aggregation and sensitivity analysis.</p><p id="Par2327"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2328">One consensual outcome of the focus groups was that, in LTH, the disease or cause of entrance is less relevant to costs than the overall complexity of the patient, entailing psychical, social, spiritual and psychic-mental dimensions. Accordingly, a multidimensional classification model of patients in four complexity levels was delivered, after being validated and receiving consensus from the LTH team. Additionally, it will include a logging tool and dashboard to integrate separate patient-centred information and aid patient classification in complexity conditions.</p><p id="Par2329"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2330">The completion of this step allowed progressing in the design and implementation of the cost model, which, in turn, will support value measurement, and enhancing of the focus LTH unit. Besides, all involved professionals stated that their engagement in this phase of the project generated exceptional opportunities for interdisciplinary meetings and debate, contributing to closer ties between different areas of LTH.</p><p id="Par2331"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2332">1.

Data was collected from a non-probabilistic sample of nursing students from a health school of the centre region of Portugal, using a questionnaire with sociodemographic questions, the Wong and Low Emotional Intelligence Scale (1-5) [2] and the Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally Ill Scale (40-200) [3]. Ethical procedures were taken into account during research according the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p id="Par2363"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2364">Most of the nursing students inquired (N=335) were female (N=263). The sample had an average age of 21.69 years (SD=4.64), distributed by all levels of nursing graduation. Some (n=25) had already suffered from mental illness, mainly (N=17) humour disorders, and 41.2% referred to have regular contact with mental health patients in their lives. These nursing students showed a good emotional intelligence (Mean=3.62; SD=0.41), being higher in self-emotional appraisal (Mean=3.73; SD=0.58) and others’ emotional appraisal (Mean=3.85; SD=0.49). Stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness are medium-low (Mean=122.15; SD=5.02), being more intense in authoritarianism (Mean=23.92; SD=4.44) and social restrictiveness (Mean=20.87; SD=4.94). Emotional intelligence is positively correlated with attitudes in community mental health ideology (R=0.133; p=0.015). Other’s emotional appraisal ability of emotional intelligence is correlated with attitudes regarding benevolence (R=0.276; p=0.000), community mental health ideology (R=0.221; p=0.000), authoritarianism (R=-0.156; p=0.005) and social restrictiveness (R=-0.254; p=0.000). Other’s emotional appraisal ability can explain some of the attitudes regarding authoritarianism (R<sup>2</sup>=0.024; F=8.138; p=0.005), benevolence (R<sup>2</sup>=0.076; F=27.136; p=0.000), social restrictiveness (R<sup>2</sup>=0.065; F=22.560; p=0.000) and community mental health ideology (R<sup>2</sup>=0.049; F=16.862; p=0.000). Regulation of emotions also influences benevolence attitudes (R<sup>2</sup>=0.016; F=16.578; p=0.000).</p><p id="Par2365"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2366">Postgraduate nursing students have good emotional intelligence and low stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness. A significant correlation was found between emotional intelligence and stigmatizing attitudes, mostly positive, and an influence of this type of intelligence in the four areas of this kind of attitudes.

Negative feelings related to body weight and shape seem to play a role in eating problems, with some studies suggesting that binge eating may occur as a means of momentarily avoiding/reducing negative affects related to body weight and shape [2, 3]. Recent evidence suggests that positive emotions may also relate to overeating in healthy and obese adults [4-6]. Nonetheless, research on emotions and eating focuses primarily on negative emotions and there is a lack of measuring relating positive emotions to eating.</p><p id="Par2387"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2388">The current study aimed to test the factorial structure and psychometric properties of the Weight Focused Feelings Scale (WFFS), an 11-item measure that assesses negative and positive feelings linked to body weight and shape.</p><p id="Par2389"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2390">2,236 women attending a community-based weight management programme participated in this study.

Research confirms positive outcomes when implementing EBP: patient safety; improved clinical outcomes; reduced healthcare costs and decreased variation in patient outcomes [3]. Considered as a standard of care, EBP has benefits for nurses, patients, general population, health care systems, as well as for research and education. Authors describe several types of obstacles to the use of research in practice: characteristics of the adopter, organization, innovation and communication [1]. Individual barriers include lack of knowledge and how to critique research studies; lack of awareness; colleagues not supportive of practice change and nurses feeling a lack of authority to change practice. Organizational barriers include insufficient time to implement new ideas; lack of access to research; and lack of awareness of available educational tools related to research [3]. The most important factor related to nurses’ EBP is support from their employing organizations to use and conduct research. Programme implementation is most likely to be successful when it matches the values, needs and concerns of practitioners. Concerning the development and implementation of competence for EBP, firstly, is important to identify the barriers.</p><p id="Par2406"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2407">Our objective is to explore and describe nurse’s perceptions of these barriers in our context.</p><p id="Par2408"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2409">This study is part of a larger one, namely: “Clinical Supervision for Safety and Care Quality” (C-S2AFECARE-Q). To answer our research question a convenience sampling strategy was employed to distribute 500 questionnaires to nurses working in a central hospital in the north of Portugal. Data was collected between April and July 2017. They returned 260 questionnaires, 98 of these with the answer to the following question: “<italic>In your opinion, which are the barriers for the implementation of EBP in your context?</italic>”. Data analyses were based on content analysis proposed by Bardin (1977).</p><p id="Par2410"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2411">Barriers were allocated into categories: Organization; Leaders and Management; Professionals and evidence [4]. Nurses reported perceived barriers in all these levels. In the organization’ barrier, they identified lack of organizational culture; lack of support from management and outdated and unquestioned routines. They also reported insufficient support from the leaders. In individual terms, they identified negative attitudes, such as lack of motivation, resistance to change, lack of time and inadequate knowledge and skills.</p><p id="Par2412"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2413">Our results are consistent with other authors’ findings [5].

Therefore, results show the importance to implement multidisciplinary programs, tailored, with older people profiles, allowing the development of an integrated social and health response to the elderly population of this region.</p><p id="Par2445"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par2446">Aging, Eldely people, Quality of Life, Social Support, Functionality, Social and health structures.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec623"><title>O149 Healthy lifestyles &amp; literacy for health in work context- what trend?</title><sec id="Sec624"><title>Otilia Freitas<sup>1,2</sup>, Gregório Freitas<sup>1,2</sup>, Clementina Morna<sup>1,2</sup>, Isabel Silva<sup>1,2</sup>, Gilberta Sousa<sup>1,2</sup>, Rita Vasconcelos<sup>3</sup>, Luís Saboga-Nunes<sup>4,5</sup>, Estudantes Enfermagem<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec625"><title><sup>1</sup>Center for Health Technology and Services Research, University of Madeira, 9020-105 Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Higher School of Health, 9020-105 Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; <sup>3</sup>Faculty of Exact Sciences and Technology, University of Madeira, 9020-105 Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; <sup>4</sup>institute of Environmental Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal; <sup>5</sup>Institute of Sociology, University of Freiburg, 79098 Freiburg, Germany</title><sec id="Sec626"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Otilia Freitas (omsfreitas@uma.pt)</title><p id="Par2447"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2448">In the National Plan for Occupational Health (PNSO) - 2nd Cycle 2013/2017, goals are established to increase health gains and guarantee the value of the workers’ health in groups of employers by those responsible for governance and society in general.

The National Security Patient Plan 2015-2020 [3] recommends that all health institutions should supervise this problem every six month, so “Gabinete de Saúde Comunitária” is already conducting the 3rd Pressure Ulcer Prevention Study.</p><p id="Par2465"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2466">This study aims to examine the prevalence rate of pressure ulcers in patients living at home, to characterize those patients as well as the most severe ulcers.</p><p id="Par2467"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2468">This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using a quantitative approach with a questionnaire, which took place during November’s first week, in 2017.

An adequate level of HL is fundamental for risk awareness and behaviour change, as well as for disease prevention. Electronic health literacy (eHL) can be useful in promoting health, but it demands the capacity of judgment towards the obtained information and the ability to work with new technologies. Due to the high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the general population, it’s important to evaluate and relate these health concepts.</p><p id="Par2481"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2482">To evaluate and relate levels of HL and eHL with STD knowledge of professionals of a Portuguese Hospital.</p><p id="Par2483"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2484">149 individuals from different professional categories, working at a medium size Portuguese Hospital, answered an anonymous questionnaire, composed of four parts: socio-demographic data, STDs knowledge, and the Portuguese version of both Newest Vital Sign (to assess the functional HL) and eHEALS (to assess the eHL).</p><p id="Par2485"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2486">Altogether 66.0% of the sample had the possibility of an adequate HL; 59.2% of those individuals were health professionals and 76.3% had a high knowledge on STDs. 72.4% were female and 27.5% male, showing similar possibility of an adequate HL (66.7% and 61.0%, respectively). Concerning the individuals with the possibility of an adequate level of HL, 27.5% were 31-40 years old and 90.6% held a higher education degree, while 7.3% had only completed high school. In general, “<italic>I know what health resources are available on the Internet</italic>” and “<italic>I have the skills I need to evaluate the health resources I find on the Internet</italic>” had the highest mean (3.99) and “<italic>I feel confident in using information from the Internet to make health decisions</italic>” had the lowest with 3.08.</p><p id="Par2487"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2488">Individuals with higher education, especially in health sciences, have higher probability of an adequate HL. Age may also be an interfering factor, since the youth nowadays, has more access to information early in life. Our results also show that 50% of the studied population had the possibility of an adequate level of HL and a high knowledge in STDs, which is an average percentage for people who work at this hospital. This can be changed, using specific education procedures, such as lectures or seminars, to increase HL and knowledge on STDs.</p><p id="Par2489"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2490">1.

A non-probabilistic sample of health students from a school in the centre region of Portugal was considered, and data was collected with a questionnaire with sociodemographic questions, a question about perception on their knowledge about mental health (scoring 0 to 5) and the Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally Ill Scale (scoring 40 to 200) [3]. Ethical procedures were taken into account during research, according to the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p id="Par2501"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2502">The students inquired (N=636) were representative of five health degrees, namely, Dietetics, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy, mostly female (82.1%), with an average age of 21.35 (SD=4,29; Median=20). A low percentage (6.6%) had already suffered from a psychiatric disease, mainly humour disorders (4.1%) and 37.6% had regular contact with a patient with mental illness in their lives. The sample had medium-low levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness (Mean=122.72; SD=5.19), being these negative attitudes more relevant in authoritarianism (Mean=24.17; SD=4.34) and social restriction (Mean=20.53; SD=4.93) areas. Male students showed more positive attitudes towards authoritarianism (p=0.004) and social restriction (p=0.007) and females towards Benevolence (p=0.016) and Community Mental Health Ideology (0.004).

Quality of life (QoL) is a useful concept measuring the health state experienced by individuals. Perceived physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships, and environmental factors are QoL’s main dimensions (WHOQOL Group, 1995). In the field of employment, evidence-based supported employment is one of the most effective approaches. Thus, A.R.C.I.L’s Centre of Resources for Employment and Open Labour Market Inclusion started to include workers according to their preferences, mainly individuals with cognitive impairment and chronic mental health difficulties. In Portugal, few studies explored QoL in individuals with cognitive impairment and chronic mental health difficulties, particularly from the individual’s own perspective.</p><p id="Par2531"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2532">This study aims to explore differences in QoL between individuals with cognitive impairment and chronic mental illness, attending supported employment services given by the Centre of Resources for Employment and Open Labour Market Inclusion.

Younger participants (age ≤ 40 years-old) also presented better QoL (in all domains, except in social relations) when compared to older participants. All differences reflected small to moderate effect sizes. Overall QoL, as well as its physical and environmental dimensions were significantly and negatively associated with participants’ age.

Given the differences in study methodologies, it has been difficult to establish comparisons. In middle-aged women, sleep disorders are quite prevalent problems and are sometimes attributed directly to the menopausal transition. Based on the conceptual framework proposed by Meleis and Schumacher, we consider that recent changes in the sleep pattern are an indicator of the transition process, assuming that they can interfere with quality of life, and that we can try to identify the conditions/factors associated with this change.</p><p id="Par2557"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2558">To evaluate sleep disorders and related factors in perimenopausal women.</p><p id="Par2559"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2560">This was a cross-sectional study, correlational; with a non-probabilistic convenience sample, in which 600 Portuguese perimenopause women (45–55 years) were requested to complete: the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), Scale of attitudes and beliefs about menopause and the Satisfaction Scale Social Support; Self-Esteem Scale. Semi-structured interviews collected: socio-demographic and socio-economic data; lifestyle data; psychological data - global health perception; stressful life events; perception of the recent change of body image; have life projects and data on health history.

Interventions with children in preschool age should privilege spontaneity, creativity and play as a method of learning and stimulation [4, 5]. Psychomotor therapy and Creative Dance are two therapeutic approaches based on these principles [5, 6]. However, to date, no research has been done comparing the effects of Psychomotor therapy and Creative Dance.</p><p id="Par2569"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2570">The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and the impact of two intervention programs, Psychomotor therapy <italic>versus</italic> Creative Dance, on the executive and socio-emotional functioning of pre-schoolers.</p><p id="Par2571"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2572">Fifty preschool children (M = 4.04 years; SD = 0.67) were divided into two intervention groups and a control group. An experimental group participated in 24 Psychomotor therapy sessions, mainly involving sensorimotor activities and games with rules.

The family relationship was mostly a son/daughter (39.4%) or a spouse (33.3%), taking care of the patient on average at 63.9 ± .93 months. It was possible to verify that all caregivers had previous experience of caregiving to a family dependent. We also verified that the 33 caregivers presented a mean of 53.9 ± 15.8 on the emotional burden scale (maximum possible value of 110) which corresponds to little burden. We can also mention that 30.3% of the caregivers present no burden, 30.3%, present mild burden and 39.4% present intense burden. Regarding the relationship between caregiver burden, we verified that higher levels of informal caregivers burden were related to lower levels of perception of their competence to satisfy the needs related to the hygiene of the dependent-person (rs=.-0.514; p&gt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par2606"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2607">Caring of a dependent-person may lead to health risks to the caregiver.

The sample consisted of a total of 35 nurses from the emergency department of a Hospital of the Portuguese NHS.</p><p id="Par2649"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2650">Five indexes were computed in order to evaluate the different strategies to deal with conflict situations: I) commitment strategy (α = 0.745); II) avoidance strategy (α = 0.699); III) accommodation strategy (α = 0.745); IV) confrontation strategy (α = 0.618) and collaboration strategy (α= 0.698). All indices had a variation that ranged between 1, corresponding to the less frequent possible appraisal and 5, corresponding to most frequent possible appraisal. Most of the nurses reported that they were rarely involved in situations of conflict, however, 57.1% stated that they sometimes observed those situations. Results show that nurses mostly indicated the use of two strategies to deal with conflict: accommodation (M= 3.11) and confrontation (M= 3.07). Data analysis revealed that the strategy of accommodation had a statistically significant positive correlation coefficient in relation with the incompatibility of personalities (rs= 0.400, p &lt; 0.05) and a negative correlation coefficient in relation with the scarcity of material (rs= -0.358, p &lt; 0.05) as cause of conflict.</p><p id="Par2651"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2652">The results obtained allow us to conclude that the nature of the conflict determines the way it is managed by nurses. The data reveal, in particular, that the scarcity of material resources strengthens the confrontation in the nursing team, contributing to the degradation of the organizational environment. Thus, conflict management is an essential skill and tool that nurses can, and should, use as a basis of sustainability and development of nursing practice.</p><p id="Par2653"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par2654">Interpersonal conflict, Team work, Nursing, Emergency service.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec678"><title>O163 Numerical modelling of electrical stimulation on scaffolds for tissue engineering</title><sec id="Sec679"><title>Paula Pascoal-Faria<sup>1,2</sup>, Pedro C Ferreira<sup>1</sup>, Abhishek Datta<sup>3,4</sup>, Nuno Alves<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec680"><title><sup>1</sup>Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-091 Leiria, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>School of Technology and Management, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-901 Leiria, Portugal; <sup>3</sup>Soterix Medical Inc., 10001 New York, New York, United States of America; <sup>4</sup>City City College of New York, 10031 New York, New York, United States of America</title><sec id="Sec681"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Paula Pascoal-Faria (paula.faria@ipleiria.pt)</title><p id="Par2655">Preliminary experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on tissue engineering applications have shown the advantage of using different type of stimuli, namely, mechanical, electrical, magnetic or its combination to enhance cell behaviour.

Research show that body image-related shame memories are significantly associated with the severity of binge eating symptomatology in women with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) [1]. These individuals may eat as a means to temporarily avoid or reduce negative emotions related to body weight and shape [2, 3]. Evidence suggests that body image flexibility (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the ability to accept and fully experience body image-related internal experiences - thoughts, emotions, memories - when doing so is consistent with valued-living [4], may deter the engagement in emotional eating [5].</p><p id="Par2688"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2689">The current study examined the moderator effect of body image flexibility on the association between shame memories and emotional eating in a sample of women with BED.</p><p id="Par2690"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2691">109 women with the diagnosis of BED participated in this study. Mean (SD) participants age was 37.39 (10.51) years and BMI was 33.69 (7.75) kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

Correlational analysis revealed that the extent to which the recalled shame memory is central to identity is significantly associated with emotional eating. Body image flexibility was negatively associated with the centrality of the recalled shame memory and emotional eating. Results of the moderation analysis showed that body image flexibility significantly moderate the association between the centrality of the recalled shame memory and emotional eating. This suggests that patients with BED with a greater trait-like ability to accept body image-related negative internal experiences, present a lower tendency to use food as a form of experiential avoidance.</p><p id="Par2694"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2695">Findings support a conceptual integrative model of binge eating symptomatology that clarifies the role that contextual and interpersonal variables play in the development and persistence of difficulties in regulating eating behaviour in BED, and how body image flexibility may have a protective role in these associations. These results also have important clinical implications supporting the relevance of contextual-behavioural interventions that address the role of shame memories, body image difficulties and that help patients to develop body image flexibility.</p><p id="Par2696"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2697">1.

A convenience sample was performed with 252 participants. The measuring instrument was developed using the Qualtrics program. The study had favourable appreciation and consent from the College Nursing of Porto (ESEP) that provided a computer platform that allowed the participants to access to the measurement instrument. The construct in analysis in this study was developed by Ryff [2] and intended to measure Psychological Welfare on six scales: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Originally, each subscale was composed of 20 items, but the author suggested smaller versions, preferably the version of seven items per subscale. Respondents rated statements on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 6 indicating strong agreement. Participants are, on average, 31.38 years old (SD=12.88) and 81% are female.

Also, during AB children reduced systolic pressure (101.3±16.4, Md=97; NB – 104.9±17.1, Md=103; ns), heart rate frequency (79.8±11.7bpm, Md=81.8; NB – 81.7±11.8bpm, Md=83.9; ns); and, mean interval RR was greater (766.9±117.8ms Md=734.8; NB – 749.1±115.2ms, Md=715.8; ns); like rMSSD (112.9±53.3ms, Md=108.1; NB – 97.5±64.1ms, Md=79.9; ns), and HRV index (18.3±4.7ms, Md=18.9; NB – 15.6±6.1ms, Md=14.1; ns); and, ApEn became positive (greater) (.0001±.001ms, Md=.0001; NB - (-).001±.002ms, Md=(-) .0001; ns).</p><p id="Par2755"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2756">Consequently, with one short training session, these children had the capacity to implement a significantly slower BF to values near 8 bpm, cf. [11], which resulted in a reduction in HR, SP, and DP; and, in an augmentation of various parameters of HRV. All these changes point to an increase of vagal activity during AB. If vagal activity was reinforced during AB [16-17], it means that, maybe, a process of bottom-up adjustment of attention and emotional responses can be promoted, cf. [18-20].</p><p id="Par2757"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2758">1. American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5®).

However, studies about older adults seem to be scarcer [4–7], particularly studies focused on whether or not faller and non-faller older adults can accurately perceive affordances for a stepping forward task.</p><p id="Par2783"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2784">The purpose of this study was to determine if older people could accurately perceive affordances for the task of stepping forward. The relationship between real and estimated maximum distance was explored in community-dwelling older adults, comparing fallers with non-fallers.</p><p id="Par2785"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2786">A sample of 347 community-dwelling older adults (age 73.02 ± 6.40 yr; non-fallers: 57.9%, fallers: 42.1%) with the absence of cognitive impairment participated in the study. Participants were asked to predict their maximum distance for a stepping forward prior to performing the task. Absolute Percent Error (APE), Absolute Error (AE) and Error Tendency (ET) were calculated accordingly (2.8). APE measured deviation percentage from accurate perceptions, AE indicated the discrepancy (in cm) between estimation and real performance. ET indicated the direction of the error (under- or overestimation bias).</p><p id="Par2787"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2788">On average, non-faller estimated (63.7 ± 15.5 cm) and performed (70.7 ± 14.9 cm) greater distances than faller (estimation: 57.1 ± 14.5 cm; real: 61.7 ± 14.6 cm) older adults. No statistically significant differences were observed in APE (fallers: 7.2 ± 12.4 %; non-fallers: 9.6 ± 12.5 %). However, differences in AE were significant between faller (6.7 ± 5.9 cm) and non-faller (9.6 ± 12.5 cm) older adults (p = .001). Old people had a huge tendency to underestimate (77.2%) the maximum distance achieved in a stepping forward. The results show a significant association between ET and being faller (χ<sup>2</sup>(1) =6.407, p=.01). Despite general participants exhibit an underestimation tendency, this tendency is greater in non-fallers (61.6% vs 38.4%). Further, there were fewer non-fallers than fallers overestimating their ability to step forward (45.6% vs 54.4%).</p><p id="Par2789"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2790">Older adults displayed a tendency to underestimate the maximum distance they can stepping-forward. The bias of overestimation is more frequent in fallers, whereas persons who underestimated tend to do not fall, suggesting that they have a protective behaviour which avoids falls. Data evidence that older adults can perceive what the environment affords, which is in agreement with an ecological perspective to perception and action.</p><p id="Par2791"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par2792">This study was funded by ESACA Project (Grant ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-000007).</p><p id="Par2793"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2794">1.

Identify the subjects that are potential fallers is essential for a successful prevention. Researchers developed several models and tests in order to diagnose individual’s risk of falling [1, 2]. Risk factors such as environmental hazards, strength, balance or dual tasks are commonly tested. However, their discriminative power is limited, indicating a gap which these tests do not address. The assessment on the perception of affordances for individual’s ability to perceive the critical boundary action [3, 4], may fill this gap.</p><p id="Par2806"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2807">To analyse the appropriateness of a new stepping-forward test to explain fall occurrence in community-dwelling adults, that assess perception and action boundary.</p><p id="Par2808"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2809">Participants were 266 women and 81 men aged 73.0 ± 6.4 years. They were assessed for fall occurrence (yes <italic>vs</italic>. no), and for stepping-forward and perception boundaries. Participants judged their maximum stepping-forward distance prior to the performance of the estimated task. Absolute Error (AE) [|estimated – real|] (cm) and Absolute Percent Error (APE) (%) were computed, and the Error Tendency (ET) was classified (underestimation <italic>vs</italic>. overestimation) [5, 6].</p><p id="Par2810"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2811">Univariate binary regression analysis showed that all the described variables explain significantly fall occurrence (p &lt; 0.05). Data showed that, for each additional cm estimated in the stepping-forward test, the likelihood of falling decreased on 2.9%, OR: 0.971 (95%CI: 0.957-0.986), and for each additional cm performed in the test, this likelihood decreased on 4.0%, OR: 0.960 (95%CI: 0.945-0.975). Furthermore, data showed that for each additional cm computed as AE, the likelihood of falling decreased on 3.6%, OR: 0.964 (95%CI: 0.933-0.996), and for each additional 1% computed as APE this likelihood decreased on 0.9%, OR: 0.991 (95%CI: 0.969-1.013). Finally, data showed that subjects reporting an ET of underestimation were less 47.7% likely for falling, OR: 0.523 (95%CI: 0.315-0.867), than subjects showing an ET of overestimation.</p><p id="Par2812"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2813">The new stepping-forward affordance perception test evidenced to be useful to determine the risk of fall occurrence. A higher estimation of maximum distance achieved or a higher real performance on the test were associated with a lower risk of falling. Further, a higher AE and an underestimation tendency showed to be associated with a decreased risk of falling. This suggests that is the marge of security provided by the higher performance ability, in contrast with a lower perception of affordance, which is protective and avoids falls.</p><p id="Par2814"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par2815">This study was funded by ESACA Project (Grant ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-000007).</p><p id="Par2816"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2817">1.

Focusing on conceptions of disaster and trauma, the extent of the impact in different populations was also considered, along with existing knowledge regarding reactions to disaster and possible factors involved.</p><p id="Par2855"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2856">There has been significant effort in designing immediate and short-term relief and assistance in disasters, addressing the most common effects of exposure to trauma [1-3]. Developmental considerations have outlined differential psychological outcomes through the lifespan [4-7]. An important body of research has focused on resilience in relation to trauma [8-11], nevertheless, studies regarding long-term consequences and adaptive functioning are still scarce [12]. Efforts seem to focus more on preventing relatively immediate severe symptoms of psychopathology [13, 14] rather than on promoting long-term psychological adjustment.</p><p id="Par2857"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2858">Research aimed at understanding the long-term psychological effects of exposure to disasters, looking at individuals who showed and did not show psychopathology following that incident seems a sensible topic to be developed. Aiming to understand how individuals in different life stages deal with adversity and to design interventions able to support individuals in dealing with the less visible long-term effects of trauma is equally important. In addition, to focusing on the absence of psychopathology, researchers should have in mind the promotion of positive development throughout the life-span.</p><p id="Par2859">Researchers should develop measures that assess exposure to disaster/trauma, taking into consideration not only the type of event, dates and duration, but also the type of exposure and involved stressors, attempting to capture disaster exposure in its complexity. At the same time, research should acknowledge the importance of the meaning that individuals attribute to an event and its consequences, more than the event itself [2, 3], and consider perceived individual, family and community resources in relation to it.</p><p id="Par2860"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2861">1.

The aetiology of SLI is hotly debated, ranging from representational deficits in grammar to impairments in the cognitive processes that underlie language acquisition. Recent research suggests that SLI difficulties may arise from implicit learning (IL) deficits, <italic>i.e</italic>. impairments in the cognitive mechanisms that allow children to extract the structural regularities present in the input and to generalize it to new contexts [2]. IL studies have been conducted mainly with adults and unimpaired children using the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT). The few studies conducted with language impaired children produced inconsistent results [3]. Since performance of this task involves a motor component that seems to be also impaired in SLI, it is critical to conduct studies using other tasks and paradigms.</p><p id="Par2891"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2892">To analyse if IL deficits are core in SLI using an Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) task. The AGL task is particularly suited to study IL deficits in SLI because it mimics language acquisition more closely than SRTT and, in addition, avoids its motor component. In an AGL task, participants are firstly exposed to strings that conform the rules of an artificial-grammar (learning-phase). Then, they are asked to decide whether new strings conform or not these rules (test-phase). Performance is typically better to grammatical (G) than to non-grammatical (NG) strings, indicating that participants learned the grammar even without consciousness of it.</p><p id="Par2893"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2894">Fourteen Portuguese children participated in this study (M<sub>age</sub>=4.86, SD=.66), 7 with a SLI diagnosis matched in age, sex, and non-verbal IQ with other 7 children with typical development (TD). All children were asked to perform a visual AGL task presented as a computer game. Written consent was obtained from all parents.</p><p id="Par2895"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2896">Results showed that TD children outperformed SLI children in the test-phase. More hits were also observed for the G strings that revealed higher- than lower-similarity with the strings presented in the learning-phase. Furthermore, the analysis of children performance showed that while TD children revealed an increased number of correct responses and a decreased number of attempts to achieve a correct response in the learning-phase, SLI children did not.</p><p id="Par2897"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2898">Children with SLI reveal deficits in their IL abilities as indexed by a worse performance both in the learning and test phases of a visual AGL task. IL malfunctioning should be considered in the aetiology of the disorder.</p><p id="Par2899"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2900">1. Bishop DVM.

The study population consisted of 37 nurses, but 7 were excluded because they were not present in all phases of the study (n=30). The first moment of study occurred in laboratory context (in the CFS laboratories), in a realistic scenario, where a clinical situation was presented in which it was necessary to perform gastric intubation, based on the knowledge held by the student.

Nurses perform this emotional labour according to their personal resources and learning from the day-to-day experience of care [2]. Moreover, this emotional dimension of nursing care continues to be undervalued by health institutions, and by nurses themselves, so that emotional labour is not always the object of reflection and/or support in scientific evidence [3]. For this reason, conceptual models are needed to guide and strengthen nurses in their practice, especially when the context is peculiar as in paediatric care.</p><p id="Par2945">Diogo [1], presented an explanatory hypothesis of the process of therapeutic use of emotions in paediatric nursing, arguing that Emotional Labour in Paediatric Nursing translates into actions of positive transformation of emotional experience into interactions of care with the paediatric client, through five categories of intervention: 1) Promoting a safe and affectionate environment; 2) Nurturing care with affection; 3) To facilitate client emotional management; 4) to build stability in the relationship; 5) to regulate their own emotional disposition to care. This Emotional Labour Model in Paediatric Nursing was developed based on the nursing paradigm of transformation [4] whose central concept is Caring, supported by the Watson's Human Care theory [5], and theorizes about “personal knowing” [6]. This Model also integrates the principles of family-centred care and non-traumatic care in Paediatric Nursing, such as the holistic and humanized perspective on health. At the heart of the proposed Model is the Emotional Labour of Nursing conception [2].</p><p id="Par2946"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2947">1. Diogo P.

Thus, the importance of oxygen in the tissue healing process is evident, namely in ATP synthesis; production of reactive oxygen species, which stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis; and microbial growth inhibition through the promotion of macrophage chemotaxis and increase of leukocyte activity. Moreover, oxygen increases the rate of collagen deposition, an important step in healing, which supplies the matrix for angiogenesis and tissue maturation. Thus, according to the P.I.C.O. review model for clinical questions, this systematic review intends to answer the research question “<italic>In chronic wounds, how does topical oxygen therapy affects wound healing</italic>?”. It was considered chronic wounds for “patient population or disease of interest”, topical oxygen therapy for “intervention or issue of interest” and wound healing for “outcome”. However, a “comparison intervention or group” and a “time frame” were not applicable.</p><p id="Par2972"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par2973">The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the current evidence for this therapy through the analysis of primary research studies published between January 2006 and December 2016.</p><p id="Par2974"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2975">Published literature was identified using Scopus, B-On, Scielo, Pubmed, Ebsco Host and Medline databases.

Psychoeducation can improve health literacy and help to reduce the stigma of help-seeking. In recent years, the Internet has been suggested as a way to deliver mental health interventions to a broader range of persons and to reduce barriers to seek help from face-to-face services. However, little is known about the effectiveness of digital psychoeducational interventions on health literacy and psychological outcomes, such as help-seeking intentions [2].</p><p id="Par3021"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3022">To derive practical implications for health professionals, this scoping review aimed to explore the effectiveness of different digital psychoeducational interventions strengthening depression literacy or knowledge (primary outcome), stigmatizing attitudes and on help-seeking attitudes, intentions and behaviour (secondary outcomes). This review is conceptualized as an update and expansion of previous research [2] with a focus on a broad range of interventions.</p><p id="Par3023"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3024">In May 2017, a systematic search through electronic databases (e.g. PsycINFO and PSYNDEX) was performed to identify longitudinal studies on the effectiveness of digital interventions targeting depression-related mental health literacy among adults published between 2007 and 2017 in peer-reviewed English journals.</p><p id="Par3025"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3026">Overall, 19 Studies met the inclusion criteria, mostly stemming from Australia. The findings of 13 of the included 17 studies evaluating mental health literacy revealed significant increases in depression literacy. Pure dissemination of information via websites, e-mails or psychoeducational interventions yielded primarily positive findings. Both Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and online game programs were found to be knowledge-enhancing, except for one study using a simulated dialogue. Findings on digital intervention targeting stigmatization in terms of individual, as well as perceived attitudes towards mental illness were inconsistent. Concerning perceived stigma, 4 of 8 studies showed positive results in reducing stigma, whereas other results were inconsistent. Likewise, the effects of interventions on help-seeking (n= 8 studies) with respect to attitudes (n= 5 studies), intentions (n= 6 studies) and behaviour (n= 4 studies) were inconclusive.</p><p id="Par3027"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3028">The evidence base on mental health literacy interventions is promising, but still limited. Various digital interventions are overall comparably effective in strengthening depression literacy and reducing stigmatizing attitudes. Given several limitations, future research should compare subpopulations to understand what works are best for whom in clinical practice. Furthermore, the comparability of knowledge levels of healthy and depressed persons should be considered. Finally, eHealth literacy of clients and health professionals should be explored and, where required, promoted with evidence-based information.</p><p id="Par3029"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3030">1.

The correct assessment of frailty in the elderly and the design of an adequate care plan is essential for the provision of personalized care and assistance to caregivers [1-3]. Recent studies associate this concept with physical resilience, as a personal characteristic that determines the capacity to resist functional decline or restore physical health, being a central aspect in active aging [6].</p><p id="Par3048"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3049">Identify the characteristics of physical resilience that modify (positively or negatively) the fragility of the elder.</p><p id="Par3050"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3051">Integrative literature review (RIL) to answer the question “<italic>How can physical resilience influence frailty in the elder?</italic>”.</p><p id="Par3052"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3053">Fragility, although a significant syndrome linked to the natural aging process, can be modified [2]. The contextual factors of each person, if well evaluated and controlled, can improve functionality not only physically but also cognitively and socially. Interventions that reduce vulnerability and adverse outcomes reduce the risk of hospitalization. The ability of an elderly person to withstand external stress is strongly related to the physiological reserve [5-6]. Taking into account that one of the main components of the fragility phenotype is sarcopenia, many of the interventions must be operationalized in order to prevent it [6]. The phenomenon of loss of functionality and muscle mass is not an isolated phenomenon [5] and produces negative functional outcomes such as difficulty in climbing stairs, getting up from a chair or bed and lifting heavy objects. The optimization of physical resilience can happen through the design of programs of physical exercise, nutrition, therapeutic reconciliation, psychoeducational support and support by health professionals.</p><p id="Par3054"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3055">Physical resilience is also influenced by factors common to frailty. The main constraint of physical resilience that affects fragility is the physiological reserve. Resilience can be quantified in three ways by determining functional trajectories: “resilient” (without functional changes after adverse events) or “resilient” (functional decline with subsequent recovery) by Physical Resilience levels: “fragile phenotype” vs “robust phenotype” and by determining “chronological age” versus “biological age”. This possibility of quantification “opens” the door for the development of interventions to treat fragility.</p><p id="Par3056"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3057">1.

These changes, called dysphagia, can lead the patient to death by leading to malnutrition, dehydration, tracheal aspiration and recurrent pneumonia [1]. Since most of these cases are diagnosed in a hospital setting, it becomes increasingly important to create working tools that help health professionals to perform more rigorous therapeutic evaluations and interventions.</p><p id="Par3067"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3068">The present study aims to contribute to the cultural and linguistic validation and adaptation of the Protocol of Security of a Nasolaryngoscopy Evaluation of Swallowing (PSAND).</p><p id="Par3069"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3070">The study comprises two parts: a qualitative part, that corresponds to the translation and adaptation of the protocol to European Portuguese Language, and a quantitative part, where the psychometric characteristics of the protocol were studied. Further details about translation and adaptation of the protocol can be found in [2], specially the content validity procedures and its application in a pilot study. A severity assessment scale [3] was used for the functional evaluation of the swallowing safety by classifying the swallow of the subjects as normal, penetration or aspiration. For data collection, it was used the Portuguese adaptation of the PSAND and the nasolaryngoscope as evaluation tools. The content validity index (CVI) was calculated for the qualitative part, and t-student or qui-squared tests were used for comparison between severity groups.</p><p id="Par3071"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3072">The sample consisted of twenty subjects, where all of them have an acute stroke as clinical diagnosis whether or not having dysphagia. The age of the inquired ranged from 31 to 85 years old, being 16 males. The results obtained by the panel of experts allowed us to conclude that all the parameters are relevant to the evaluation of swallowing and important to determinate a safe feeding for each case (CVI&gt;0.80). Thus, by applying the PSAND, it was possible to study two groups: “Penetration” (13 patients) and “Aspiration” (5 patients). There were statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the two groups for the variables: dependent or independent feeding; poor oral control; lot of residues; reduction of laryngeal sensitivity; leaking of the bolus and difficulty in cleaning pharyngeal residues.</p><p id="Par3073"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3074">In summary, we can say that the application of this protocol is an asset to diagnose the presence of dysphagia in any clinical diagnosis, evaluate the swallowing function, verifying the risk of penetration and aspiration and classifying the Dysphagia Severity.</p><p id="Par3075"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3076">This work was supported in part by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia), through Center for Research and Development in Mathematics and Applications (CIDMA), within project UID/MAT/04106/2013.</p><p id="Par3077"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3078">1.

In addition, along with ageing, a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity among the elderly is also occurring [2,3].</p><p id="Par3085"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3086">To estimate the increase in the number of obese individuals, due exclusively to population aging in Brazil from 2014 to 2030.</p><p id="Par3087"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3088">The number of obese adult Brazilians was obtained by extrapolation of the prevalence estimated by VIGITEL (Surveillance System for Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Inquiry) [4] in Brazilian capitals, in 2014, for the entire Brazilian population. The population projection for 2030 by age groups was obtained from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) [5]. The prevalence obtained by VIGITEL in 2014 was applied to population projections by 2030, maintaining all other variables constant, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</p><p id="Par3089"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3090">The Brazilian adult population (18 +years) corresponded to 144.5 million people in 2014 of whom 15.5 million (10.7%) were 65 years of age or older. Obese adults accounted for 25.9 million (95% CI 24.9-27.0 million) of the entire adult population (17.9%), of which 3.1 million (95% CI 2.8-3.3 million) were elderly obese. The obese elderly corresponded to 11.9% of adults with obesity. In 2030, it is estimated that the Brazilian adult population will reach 175.2 million people, of whom 30.0 million (17.1%) are elderly. Obese will correspond to 31.4 million (95% CI 30.1-32.8 million) of adult Brazilians of whom 5.9 million (95% CI 5.4-6.4 million) will be obese elderly. That is, exclusively due to aging, it is expected an increase of 5.5 million obese for the entire population. An estimated 2.8 million more are obese in the age group of 65 and over. Therefore, it is expected that the percentage of 11.9% of elderly among obese adults in 2014 will rise to 18.9% in 2030.</p><p id="Par3091"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3092">Considering only the effect of aging with current levels of obesity prevalence, it is estimated that there will be an increase of almost 3 million obese people in Brazil by 2030. The impact of the increase in prevalence itself was not considered, which would make the prospect even more worrying due to the impact on chronic non-communicable diseases and in the use of health services.</p><p id="Par3093"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3094">1.

It is a cognitive alteration of sudden onset, developing in a matter of hours or days; which is interspersed with periods of lucidity and also characterized by disturbances in attention, memory and behaviour. It is also identified by the worsening of the symptoms at night and by changes in the sleep-wake cycle. The presence of this syndrome, makes impossible a holistic care, upsetting an effectively communication, between patient and nurse or family. It may even be considered common for an elderly, given the age, to appear confused, but it should not be considered normal, so investing in concrete studies to specify these mental changes and determinate what interventions are more appropriate for this vulnerable group, is emergent. It is up to nurses, who are in a privileged position, the early recognition/intervention at this neurological condition. It is assumed as an emerging need, to implement non-pharmacological strategies, so that the occurrence of delirium decreases and thus avoids great suffering.</p><p id="Par3103"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3104">This study aimed to identify the nursing interventions directed to the hospitalized elderly, for the control and prevention of delirium.</p><p id="Par3105"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3106">Using the methodology recommended by the Cochrane Centre, this systematic review of literature was guided by the following research question: “<italic>What is the scientific evidence regarding nursing interventions directed to the hospitalized adult/elderly for the control of delirium</italic>?” Using a PICO framework as reference, a review of articles published between 2012 and 2017 was carried out.

The family has its own needs, and these must be met to effectively manage the situation of instability of the family member. Since the family directly influences the evolution of a person's condition in a critical illness situation, it is important to see the family also as a target of care, in a holistic view of caring [3]. The main areas of need experienced by the family are: information on the clinical situation, assurance of patient safety, support by health professionals and willingness to be close to the patient [2].</p><p id="Par3133"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3134">Health professionals should be aware that the family is also a target in care, and that, in a multidisciplinary team, nurses are the most qualified professionals to plan and develop interventions to meet and respond to the family needs of the person hospitalized in critical illness [4]. The team must be able to respond to the identified family needs, through interventions to attenuate and help them to live the moment of hospitalization, making it the least traumatic possible, involving the relatives in the care, through the clarification of doubts and by helping to manage emotions and expectations [3].</p><p id="Par3135"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3136">1.

The properties of the aquatic environment, combined with the resistance of the water during all movements, make it beneficial for health-related parameters and physical fitness [1]. However, research is needed to understand the practices of different populations, according to the specificity of some activities. Few is known about people’s practices in these particular activities.</p><p id="Par3216"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3217">The purpose of this study is to characterize Portuguese practices and motivations to use the swimming pools and to exercise in-water physical activities.</p><p id="Par3218"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3219">Subjects from the interior region of Portugal, swimming pool users, completed a questionnaire consisting of 33 questions. Those questions were focused on the characterization of their usual in-water activities, and main motivations.</p><p id="Par3220"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3221">Until now, 418 swimming pool users answered the questions, ranging from 18 to 79 years old (44.7% females, 55.3% males). Most of them were active and only 67 subjects were retired from work. They used to practice aquatic actives for more than 2 years (60%), and the majority twice-a-week, preferring the evening time to attend the swimming pool. Among the various types of swimming pool use, it was verified that 31% perform water aerobics, 48% swimming classes and 31% free time schedules. More than half of the sample only performed aquatic activities (54%) and aimed to improve health (47%), physical fitness (31%) and 11% to relief stress. Curiously, only 1% wanted to learn how to swim. They classified the physical activities performed in-water in the last few weeks mostly of moderated/vigorous intensity. People who attend to swimming pools are persistent and committed with aquatic exercitation, practicing for more than two years. Although most of them participate in swimming or water aerobics lessons, there is still a considerable number of free-time users and swimming pools must be prepared for this fact. Interestingly, the majority attend to swimming pool to improve health and physical fitness.</p><p id="Par3222"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3223">This pilot study will be implemented in several other regions of the country and this would allow to understand the motivations and needs of users and to improve offers and support to other areas of research (<italic>i.e.</italic>, development of technological devices).</p><p id="Par3224"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3225">This project was supported by the Project NanoSTIMA: Macro-to-Nano Human Sensing, Towards Integrated Multimodal Health Monitoring and Analytics, NORTE-01-0145-FEDER000016, co-financed by European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER) - NORTE 2020.</p><p id="Par3226"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3227">1.

The closeness and the joint interest in finding together the answer to their common issues motivates them for a common path, based on trust [4]. We find that nurses' clinical exercise time and their clinical competence can influence this process [5, 6].</p><p id="Par3247"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3248">To analyse how family perceives the interaction between nurses and the family. To diagnose how to build a daily basis interaction when facing a critical illness, and which steps highlight the existing confidence.

They reported the careful construction of discourse and the effective presence with the sick person as nurses' strategy for interaction. The need to know better the situation and to discover what will happen, motivated families to start the interaction. Trust was revealed in founded solicitude and compassion. Families know that nurses are vulnerable to their suffering.

During hospitalization, 33.0-96.7% of patients need to have a PVC inserted [4-6]. These devices are not risk-free, affecting patients’ safety and well-being. In fact, up to 72.5% of the PVCs are removed due to complications [6]. Healthcare professionals should consider using specific technologies that help to select the vein to puncture and reduce the number of attempts and catheter-related mechanical complications.</p><p id="Par3267"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3268">This review aims to identify and synthesize the effectiveness of the use of vein visualization technologies (near-infrared light or ultrasonography) in patients who need peripheral intravenous catheterization when compared with the traditional technique.</p><p id="Par3269"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3270">Methodology proposed by Joanna Briggs Institute [7]. A three-step search strategy was used in this review: (I) an initial limited search was undertaken followed by an analysis of the words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article; (II) a second search using all identified keywords and index terms was undertaken across all included databases; (III) the reference list of all identified reports and articles was searched for additional studies. Studies of quantitative evidence published between 1999 and 2017 were considered for inclusion in this review. This review included patients of all ages, in any clinical setting. However, studies where patients displayed a previous vascular access device <italic>in situ</italic> were excluded. The assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and synthesis will be conducted by two independent reviewers using standardized tools recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute [7].

These professionals are required to help OA to achieve and maintain their highest level of function. The Function-Focused Care (FFC) is a philosophy of care that promotes the restoration and/or maintenance of physical function. In the institutional context it is relevant empowering NA to adopted this philosophy [2].</p><p id="Par3303"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3304">This study intends to analyse the perception of NA in relation to the FFC, through scales of self-efficacy, outcomes expectations and knowledge, as well as, the validity and reliability related properties.</p><p id="Par3305"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3306">Quantitative approach of a descriptive/correlational cross-sectional type. A self-report questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic and professional variables and the scales of self-efficacy, expectations and knowledge were applied. Further details about the scales used can be found in Costa [3]. The validation/reliability procedures for each scale consisted in the calculation of exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and in the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for test/retest purposes. Correlation between the scales themselves, with feelings related to the care of elderly, and sociodemographic and professional variables were tested using the Spearman Rank test.</p><p id="Par3307"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3308">The sample consisted of 73 NA (100% women) with a mean age of 46.4 (± 9.9) years from 5 different institutions. The scale of the self-efficacy showed a three-factor model with the total variance of 73.4%, Cronbach's alpha = 85.2% and ICC = 0.80. The scale of outcomes expectations presented one factor, Cronbach's alpha= 95.2% and ICC = 0.97. The scale of Knowledge obtained a percentage of correct answers only of 44.7%. It was not possible to develop predictive models to relate these scales in a pre-intervention situation. Also, the low correlation between the scales and feelings related to the care of OA (difficulty, gratification, physical overload and emotional overload) or sociodemographic and professional variables (age, years of experience, and self-knowledge), indicated a weak dependence between them. Finally, the institution variable showed not to be a confounding variable (that is, does not influence these results).</p><p id="Par3309"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3310">The Portuguese version of the scales analysed showed satisfactory data validity and reliability.

However, it is also known that the various existing oral antidiabetic agents may trigger a large number of adverse events, either alone or in combination. Some of these tolerability and security issues related to the oral antidiabetic are reported by patients and can influence negatively or satisfaction with treatment or glycaemic control, or the therapeutic adherence and maintenance. It is therefore very important the role of patients in monitoring of adverse events related to the use of the oral antidiabetic drugs in order to optimize treatment and improve the quality of life of patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2).</p><p id="Par3337"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3338">The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of adverse events associated with use of oral antidiabetics and assessing their impact on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of diabetic patients tracked in primary health care.</p><p id="Par3339"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3340">A total of 357 DM2 patients were enrolled in observational and cross-sectional study, recruited in six Health Care Centres/Family Health Units (FHU) of the central region of Portugal.

The most accomplished activities after school were: watching TV (100%), cleaning the Institution (96.2%), listening to Music (89.3%), studying (87.4%), playing on the computer and on Facebook (82.6%) and doing physical activity (table tennis, football, among others) (73.8%). Regarding the accomplishment of these activities, the young people reported doing them daily or at least 2 to 3 times a week. When asked if they would like to occupy their free time within the institutions otherwise, the young people were divided, even though the majority responded that they did not (53.4%). As young people are in an open regime, we asked them which activities were most frequently carried out, outside the institution, and they answered that it was a walk with their friends (87.4%), and that the frequency of this activity was daily or at least 2 to 3 times a week.

An EOT patient is exposed to a variety of painful procedures and, if the pain is not controlled, it can lead to multiple complications: physical (cardiovascular, neurological and pulmonary) and psychological (stress, anxiety and delirium), so nurses must have credible instruments for evaluation and monitoring.</p><p id="Par3377"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3378">This systematic literature review (RSL) aimed to identify the most reliable tool for pain assessment, by analysing the validity and reliability of the BPS and CPOT scales, as well as their ease of application.</p><p id="Par3379"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3380">Using the methodology recommended by the Cochrane Centre, this RSL was guided by the following research question: “<italic>Which is the most appropriate scale, BPS or CPOT, for pain assessment in patients unable to communicate verbally?</italic>” The seven included studies resulted from a research in EBSCO, using the terms “behavioural pain scale” and “critical care pain observation tool”, with Boolean operator “and”, in full text, published between 2007-2017.</p><p id="Par3381"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3382">With a number of participants between 23 and 117, the 7 selected studies, all with quantitative nature, concluded that both scales are reliable and valid for the assessment of pain in this population [1-5].

It was also verified that both instruments are sensitive to painful procedures, with an increase in several indicators [1, 2, 6]. There was also a significant statistically correlation between the values of arterial tension and the performance of a painful procedure, (the higher the pain value, the higher the arterial tension) [5,6].</p><p id="Par3383"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3384">Both scales (BPS and CPOT) are suitable for the evaluation of pain in EOT patients and according to nurses, both are easy to apply and useful for care delivery [5, 7].

A literature systematic review</title><sec id="Sec872"><title>Maria I Santos<sup>1</sup>, Rita Marques<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec873"><title><sup>1</sup>Health Sciences Institute, Catholic University of Portugal, 1649-023 Lisbon, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Escola Superior de Saúde da Cruz Vermelha Portuguesa, 1300-125 Lisbon, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec874"><title>Maria I Santos (inescamiller@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par3439"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3440">Nurses experience high levels of work-related stress due to their daily contact with critical situations, suffering, negative emotions and death. This stress overload imposes negative consequences at an individual and at an organizational level, with direct and indirect costs. On the contrary, humour seems to produce benefits to health, job satisfaction and group cohesion, when used in an adaptive way. There is scientific evidence that humour may establish an incisive coping strategy in the management of work-related stress that can be used by nurses for their own benefit.</p><p id="Par3441"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3442">The aim of the present study is to build a framework of a systematic review on the relationship between humour and nurses’ work-related stress.</p><p id="Par3443"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3444">Using the Cochrane Centre recommended methodology, this systematic review was guided by the following research question: <italic>What is the contribution of humour to nurses’ stress management?</italic> The research was performed through the EBSCO and Google Scholar search engines, in the bibliographic databases: CINAHL®Complete, MEDLINE Complete, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MedicLatina, Pubmed, Scielo and RCAAP, since 2007 to 2017, using the following conjugations of descriptors and Boolean operators: humour (OR humor) AND stress AND nurses (OR nursing) NOT children NOT patients NOT students.</p><p id="Par3445"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3446">A sum of four articles, that respond to our research question, was selected. The empirical studies were developed in four different countries (USA, Canada, UK and Portugal) with diverse designs using either qualitative and quantitative approaches. The sample varied from 15 to 61 nurses. All studies demonstrated that humour expressions are used by nurses to deal with stressful situations [1-4].</p><p id="Par3447"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3448">The use of adaptive forms of humour promote detachment and reassessment of the situation contributing to stress management [3, 4]. It also strengthens interpersonal relationships, improves communication and group cohesion, and contributes to job satisfaction [1, 2]. Therefore, evidence shows that humour can be an effective tool in stress management. Moreover, one study points out that humour can also arise in response to stress, warning to an increased stress level [4]. Nevertheless, the reduced empiric evidence found suggests that this subject within Nursing Science is not yet highly established.</p><p id="Par3449"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3450">1.

This fact is related to a set of new experiences that are significant for these actors. Supported by the literature consulted, we are led to say that they last even beyond the end of the course, unlike the relations established in the classroom.</p><p id="Par3458"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3459">Analyse the relationships established among students over two consecutive clinical studies.</p><p id="Par3460"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3461">The study was carried out with students from a group of the 2nd year of a Nursing Degree who were experiencing their first clinical experience in a hospital context, namely 10 weeks in an internal medicine service and 10 weeks in a surgery service. We chose an ethnographic study within the framework of the qualitative paradigm, in a longitudinal approach according to the logic of the case study. As a data collection technique, we used participant observation and semi-structured interviews.</p><p id="Par3462"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3463">We verified that the relation established between students differed according to whether it was a first or a second clinical teaching. The knowledge that the group acquired about themselves and about the methodologies adopted by the tutors, was different in the different contexts. In the first medical school (medicine), despite the little knowledge that the students had among themselves, the established relationship was very cooperative and cordial, based on the spirit of help. This was due to a number of factors, namely, a first clinical experience, leading to a high need to share information and knowledge related to the context and clinical practices; the lack of knowledge about tutors; and the lack of safety in the care of patients. The relationships established in this space were, therefore, strong and cohesive. In the clinical teaching of surgery, the relation established was different, highlighting more divergences/heterogeneities. According to the students' opinion, this fact was related to the work methodology/distribution of students and the request of academic work by the teachers.</p><p id="Par3464"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3465">We verified that on the 2nd clinical teaching, the relationships established between students were influenced by interpersonal competition logics. As it is known, the need to form more restricted groups can lead to unleashing alliance dynamics and oppositions among students, giving rise to behaviours of competitiveness, or of helping others, or even to the development of individualized work. Another aspect that seems to have been strongly conditioning, were the methodological strategies adopted by the tutors of the different clinical contexts.</p><p id="Par3466"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par3467">Clinical supervision, Clinical teaching, Nursing students, Socio-clinical relations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec878"><title>P42 Stress management in under graduation nursing students</title><sec id="Sec879"><title>Marco Oliveira, Andreia Santos, Rafaela Barbosa, Diana Portovedo, Isabel Oliveira</title><sec id="Sec880"><title>Escola Superior de Enfermagem da Cruz Vermelha Portuguesa, 3720-126 Oliveira de Azeméis, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec881"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Isabel Oliveira (ijoliveira@sapo.pt)</title><p id="Par3468"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3469">Admission to higher education is seen by some students as an opportunity of growth, to explore new environments and build new relationships yet, other students, perceive it as potentially anxiogenic. Some of the stressful factors are: examinations, clinical teaching, academic results, a competitive environment and the experience of transition and adaptation to a new academic environment. Therefore, it is necessary to work on the causes of stress and promote coping strategies. Being such an important subject for under graduation students, that experiencing it so intensely, it is crucial that students are also an active part in promoting the efficient management of stress.</p><p id="Par3470"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3471">Thus, in order to contribute to the adoption of coping strategies and promote the efficient management of stress, a participatory action research in health was developed in a nursing school. The strategies were: the implementation of a student support line (peer support); monthly meetings, addressed to the student population, on topics related to stress and its management; tutorials for 1st year undergraduate students by 3rd and 4th year students, through a structured program of integration to the nursing school. The follow-up of the effectiveness of the activities was carried out through a questionnaire measuring stress levels. This research foresees an initial evaluation (before implementation), intermediate evaluations and a final one, to measure the achievement of the objectives initially stated.</p><p id="Par3472"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3473">The preliminary findings show a mean of 8.52 and a standard deviation of 2.73 in the score of the domain Sleep/Stress of the Portuguese version of the Fantastic Lifestyle Assessment.</p><p id="Par3474"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3475">With the implementation of this participatory action research it is expected a reduction of stress levels, as well as enabling students to adopt coping strategies in order to manage their stress.

The early identification of these alterations resorting to non-invasive and easily administered instruments can minimize its consequences and reduce comorbidity and mortality among these patients [1,4]. The V-VST exhibits good psychometric properties, allowing the early identification of patients at risk of developing respiratory and nutritional complications.

Many of them preventable [1]. Knowing that hands of healthcare professionals are one of the main vehicles in the transmission of microorganisms, hand hygiene (HH) is recognized as the easier and most effective measure to prevent and reduce HAIs [2]. However, despite all evidence available and although 98% of healthcare professionals consider HH as the most important basic precaution in preventing HAIs, compliance is poor, remaining less than 40% [3,4].</p><p id="Par3498"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3499">To identify, in Literature, the most effective strategies to promote HH compliance.</p><p id="Par3500"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3501">An integrative review between September and October 2017 was fulfilled with the Boolean strategy: [(TI Title) hand hygiene AND (AB Abstract) nurse AND (AB Abstract) infection AND (AB Abstract) strategy OR compliance OR adherence] in CINAHL®, Science Direct and Academic Search Complete. A total of 396 articles were identified, initially. After applying the inclusion criteria: primary and secondary studies with a qualitative and quantitative approach available in full text in Portuguese, English, French and Spanish; and exclusion criteria: studies published before 2016, a sample of 12 articles was included for analysis.</p><p id="Par3502"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3503">From a total of 12 articles analysed, 10 showed the importance of a multimodal approach to the improvement of HH practices with consequent increase in compliance to this behaviour. It stands out the combination of interventions addressing knowledge (education), awareness, context of action (reminders in the workplace) as well as the involvement and support of leaders and managers in building an institutional safety culture (social influence) as the most effective to ensure greater compliance to HH.</p><p id="Par3504"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3505">In order to improve HH practices and, consequently, adherence to this behaviour, the adoption of a multimodal strategy proved to be more successful when compared to single interventions. At an early stage, it is essential to understand the reasons that lead to non-adherence to HH and after that design interventions based on identified barriers. The approach should be global, including not only healthcare professionals but also leaders and managers.</p><p id="Par3506"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3507">1. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

Family caregivers are very important elements in caring for the family member with self-care dependency, at the home context [3, 4]. This is an exhausting process with serious consequences for the general state of health perceived by the caregiver, as well as for the manifested burden [3, 5, 6]. A structured and contextualized intervention program [7] aimed at the qualification and support of family caregivers is essential for the transition and adequate performance of the functions inherent in this role.</p><p id="Par3515"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3516">To develop and implement a Nursing Intervention Program with family caregivers of dependent persons, in a home context.</p><p id="Par3517"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3518">This process began with an integrative review of the literature, in order to discover the main needs evidenced by family caregivers. Electronic databases were used, namely EBSCO and B-on, with the following descriptors: Caregiver; Family Caregivers; Needs; Dependent. The second stage corresponded to the adaptation of the Intervention Program, with the use of the Delphi technique on a group of experts. The last phase corresponded to a quasi-experimental study, with pre- and post-intervention evaluation, with the implementation of the program on 70 family caregivers, using home visits.</p><p id="Par3519"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3520">With the review of the literature were obtained 21 articles (ten quantitative studies, five qualitative studies, four systematic reviews of the literature, a review of the literature and a mixed study). The evidenced needs were organized by the Transition Theory: community and social resources; knowledge and preparation; personal meaning, beliefs and attitudes; and socioeconomic condition. The consensus technique allowed the structuring of a Nursing Intervention Program, with 93 interventions, divided in emotional and instrumental support. The implementation of the Intervention Program implied, on average, 6 home visits to the caregivers, emotional support provision and caregiver training.</p><p id="Par3521"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3522">A Nursing Intervention Program, with structured and contextualized interventions in the home context, with family caregivers of dependent persons, is a facilitator for the transition experienced by caregivers, but also an important instrument of the work developed by nurses. Thus, it provides the necessary emotional support and skills that enable caregivers to optimize care delivery.</p><p id="Par3523"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3524">1.

In pre-hospital, emergency and intensive care settings, they contribute to the valuation of technical competencies over relational aspects. The emergent need to stabilize the CIP diverts the attention away from the psychological and emotional support, increasing anxiety and diminishing the patient’s cooperation, making the care experience increasingly hostile. Vulnerability arises in these settings [1] as a condition to be appreciated in a “harmonious conciliation between the technological expertise and the art of caring” [2], because it improves expectations and experiences, and increases the positive outcomes of the resuscitation process, giving greater visibility to the nurses’ work. To understand the experiences of patients who lived emergency situations, as well as nursing interventions that reduce vulnerability, will allow for better care of the CIP [3].</p><p id="Par3576"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3577">Our goal is to review the available evidence regarding nursing interventions that reduce vulnerability at emergency and resuscitation settings.</p><p id="Par3578"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3579">We performed an integrative review of the literature available from MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and grey literature, to answer the question: <italic>“Which nursing interventions promote the reduction of the CIP’s vulnerability in emergency setting?</italic>” [4].</p><p id="Par3580"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3581">Nine qualitative and quantitative studies satisfied the search criteria and were included. These studies are from different countries and cultures and their analysis identified both the emergency setting and nursing interventions as elements that influence the CIP’s subjective experience of vulnerability. Vulnerability is a permanently present condition in the human being and the recognition of the mutual vulnerability by nurses is a way of preserving the value of caring.</p><p id="Par3582"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3583">The experience of CIP in emergency and resuscitation settings is influenced by organizational, environmental and caring factors. Being cared by competent professionals [5,6], using a therapeutic relationship and responding to the patient main needs are the most valued aspects that convey safety and a significant decrease in vulnerability. Communication and empathy [6], with explanation of clinical procedures, allows the development of trust and reduces vulnerability, facilitating patient collaboration in the care provided. Recognizing the vulnerability of CIP and its influence on collaboration, recovery and satisfaction in care, allows developing strategies and abolishing mechanized and merely technical behaviours. Vulnerability is a continually present condition in humans and the recognition of vulnerability of the professionals themselves [7] is a way to socially preserve the value of caring in an emergency context.</p><p id="Par3584"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3585">1.

Informal caregivers, namely family members, play a very important role in the provision of care to very old individuals. Informal care represents crucial support but the available knowledge on this topic is still scarce in the Portuguese context.</p><p id="Par3670"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3671">To provide an overview of caregiving characteristics in a sample of dyads of informal caregivers and oldest old people (80+) from Porto.</p><p id="Par3672"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3673">A sample of 72 caregiving dyads was considered. Sociodemographic data, information on the caregiving experience (e.g. length of care, relationship with the person cared) and the disability level of care receiver (Activities of Daily Living – ADL’s and IADL’s, and comorbidities) were obtained.</p><p id="Par3674"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3675">Informal caregivers had a mean age of 63.9 years (SD=9.95), were mostly women (76.4%), with children (70.8%), married (63.9%) and retired (50.0%). Time spent on caregiving was on average 9.73 hrs/day (SD=7.61) and the length of care was around 7 years (SD=6.15). Most of the sample had formal social support to help in the care provision: 54.2% receives support from home care services and 34.7% from day centres. Care receivers mean age was 92.0 years (SD=5.28), were mostly women (73.6%) and widowed (65.3%). Half of the care receivers (n=36; 50.0%) were completely dependent in ADL’s, 30.6% were moderately dependent, 16.7% severely dependent, and 2.8 % were independent. Most of the sample was severely dependent in IADL’s (95.8%). The mean number of comorbidities was 6.94 (SD=1.95), and the mean of medicines intake was 6.17 (SD=3.41).</p><p id="Par3676"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3677">This is an ongoing project but current data already shows that the amount of time spent on caring activities by women who are themselves in advanced age is very high, and probably exhausting due to the high level of functional dependency of the care recipients. A clear picture of tasks and probable exhaustion of the group of people taking care of very old people is crucial in order to plan which and how to deliver formal care to these dyads. Such planning is important for preventing/alleviating burden situations and raising the quality of life of care recipients and their families.</p><p id="Par3678"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3679">Project was approved by Ethical Commission of ICBAS.UP, approval number 188/2017 and by Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD), approval number 1338/2017.</p><p id="Par3680"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par3681">Informal caregiving, Oldest old people, Disability.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec934"><title>P56 Comparison of antioxidant activity for Ginkgo biloba L. and Rosmarinus officinalis L</title><sec id="Sec935"><title>Diana Silva<sup>1</sup>, Ana França<sup>2</sup>, Cláudia Pinho<sup>3</sup>, Ana I Oliveira<sup>3</sup>, Rita F Oliveira<sup>3,4</sup>, Agostinho Cruz<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec936"><title><sup>1</sup>Farmácia Holon, Baguim do Monte, Gondomar, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Farmácia Higiénica, Fão, Esposende, Portugal; <sup>3</sup>Centro de Investigação em Saúde e Ambiente, Escola Superior de Saúde, Instituto Politécnico do Porto, 4200-072 Porto, Portugal; <sup>4</sup>Secção Autónoma de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade de Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec937"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Cláudia Pinho (clp@eu.ipp.pt)</title><p id="Par3682"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3683">Natural antioxidant products have gained popularity worldwide and are increasingly being used to treat various diseases [1].

The informal (family) carer are urged to perform more activities in order to maintain the elderly health needs. Assessing the quality of the relationship between the dyad (a family carer and a patient with dementia) is necessary to assure that care plans are well adjusted. The Quality of The Carer-Patient Relationship (QCPR), [1] emerges as a specific scale for assessing the quality of the bidirectional relation of the dyad.</p><p id="Par3784"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3785">To adapt the QCPR scale to Portuguese and determine its psychometric properties.</p><p id="Par3786"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3787">Phase (I), transcultural adaptation according to the international recommendations of the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons [2], composed by four steps; Phase (II), a pilot study was conducted to assess the preliminary psychometric properties in the new cultural context, with a convenience sample composed by patients with dementia (n=30) and their caregivers (n=30).

In this sense, health education constitutes a means-activity for the promotion of health, with a transforming role of individual practices [1,2]. The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria is a public health problem, and measures to prevent their spread are essential, together with awareness actions on infectious diseases and basic measures of personal and environmental hygiene.</p><p id="Par3816"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3817">To describe the interprofessional collaboration carried out by a group of professionals, in the areas of social work, nursing and pharmacy of the hospital infection control commission (HICC), with the staff and the children and relatives housed in a house of support from a university hospital, in Brazil.</p><p id="Par3818"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3819">Experiences reported from July 2016 to December 2017. After identifying the need for a theoretical deepening in prevention and control of infections, especially in the management of children and adolescents with MDR bacteria and their relationships, in the daily routine of the home, a joint planning of actions was started between the infection control team and the support house staff, focusing on health education. Initially, monthly meetings were made among professionals for reflection and problematization of learning and participatory observation, making feasible the situational diagnosis of the house. In these meetings, subjects such as hand hygiene, bacterial transmission, management of individuals with MDR bacteria, matrix-based strategies, hospital and house of support concepts were discussed, enabling a better understanding of the difference of care inside and outside the hospital. After the development and consolidation of concepts, house staff was encouraged to produce health education actions for their public.</p><p id="Par3820"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3821">The performance of a theatrical play was carried out by both teams in June 2017, where it was identified the consolidation of contents by the professionals in the period of theoretical deepening.

Nurses' perceptions about the safety culture of the patient and the intention to report adverse events are significant in promoting patient safety [5-7]. Coaching behaviour showed a significant and positive correlation with safety culture and coaching behaviours of team leaders were associated with higher degrees of perceived safety culture and stronger intentions to report adverse events [2,8]. Openness of communication and non-punitive responses to mistakes, as well as teamwork influence the patient's safety culture [5, 7].</p><p id="Par3837"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3838">Through this LR it was possible to perceive that the safety culture is an issue still underdeveloped in health organizations, where nurses have an essential role.

Thinking about artificial nutrition and the end of life person, such as the person with advanced, incurable and progressive disease, with a survival expectancy between 3 to 6 months [2] is often reflected on a set of issues. This is a controversial discussion, about the quality of life resulting of one of these means and ethical questioning [3].

Cognitive interventions are related to the maintenance of cognitive function and are associated with independence and well-being [1, 2]. A cognitive intervention could be considered as a complex intervention once it contains several interacting components [3]. The MIND&amp;GAIT project expects the development of a structured digital cognitive stimulation program to be used with older adults with mild to moderate cognitive decline.</p><p id="Par3883"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par3884">To develop and validate an elderly-friendly multi-domain digital cognitive stimulation program.</p><p id="Par3885"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3886">To develop the program, the research team followed Guidelines for complex interventions from The Medical Research Council. The development process comprises four phases [3]. The first phase corresponds to a Preliminary Phase (I), the second to a Modelling Phase (II), the third to a Field Test Phase (III) and the last to a Consensus Conference Phase (IV).</p><p id="Par3887"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3888">The digital stimulation cognitive program has 8 individual sessions and 1 group session. The program has already passed for Phase I, which corresponds to an initial conceptualization of the program design and its support materials. At the moment, it is on Phase II, being presented to an experts’ panel to gather different opinions and evaluations from specialists in the area of cognitive interventions. Each session of the program will later be evaluated at Phase III. All the contributions and analysis resulted from the previous phases will be synthesized in phase IV. It is expected that the critical evaluation, provided by specialists in the area of cognitive interventions, will result in a well-founded and structured intervention to be applied in older adults with mild to moderate cognitive decline. The program’s construction, supported by guidelines and based in elderly-friendly digital components, intends to give a response to the challenge of an increasing aged population allying e-health. The program is to be used by health professionals and informal caregivers, in order to work as a possible way to prevent or minimize cognitive decline.</p><p id="Par3889"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3890">Cognitive interventions have impact on cognitive decline, a condition that assumes more importance once it is related with frailty in older adults.

PHC care is very important because it allows for the implementation of proximity interventions, such as nursing home care, resulting in an improvement of the health of individuals, families, and communities. The system mentioned above is the one implemented in health centres called S-Clinic and developed by the Serviços Partilhados do Ministério da Saúde (SPMS).

We had to study the essential contents of the nursing process at home and implemented in the system, in order to create a data structure with the closest resemblance to S-Clinic.

The first six months emerge as a transient, predictable and irreversible milestone. The transition to parenting is marked by the changes and repercussions that drive the child's growth and development, predating and precipitating others in the family life cycle.

The scavenging capacity of the same extracts against reactive species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>•, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NO•) was also evaluated. Finally, the biological activity of the presentation forms of garlic existing in the market was compared with the one of the garlic peel, considered food waste, taking also into account some variables that can influence the properties of the bulb, that is, boiling and freezing.</p><p id="Par3929"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3930">TPC was superior in the frozen chopped garlic sample, having the garlic tablets the lowest content. The cooked garlic presented an inferior value of TPC when comparing with the raw chopped bulb. These results indicate that cooking and freezing methods intervene directly with the total phenolic content, but in an opposite way. The extract of cooked garlic had the higher value of TFC, belonging the lowest tenor to garlic tablets. Radical DPPH• and FRAP methods allowed to verify that the cooked garlic extract evidenced a superior antioxidant activity. This result can be explained by cell wall rupture derived from heating, provoking antioxidant substance release, new and/or stronger antioxidant substance formation or oxidant enzymes inhibition [4]. The frozen chopped garlic extract presented the highest scavenging capacity of the three studied reactive species.

The high respiration rate, the lack of physical protection to avoid water loss and the changes due to microbial attack are often associated with loss of food quality, contributing to deterioration through browning, weight loss and texture changes [1]. Furthermore, bacteria, moulds, enzymatic activity (mainly polyphenol oxidase) and biochemical changes can cause spoilage during storage [2]. The use of ionizing energy for preservation has been widely studied by the food industry. However, studies evaluating the effects of ionizing radiation are mostly available in cultivated species, being scarce the reports on wild species and food waste, considered add-value foods. In this regard, food technology is making progress towards increasing food preservation and contributing to a reduction of the incidence of food-related diseases. Previous studies assessing the potential of gamma irradiation as a suitable technique to increase natural products shelf-life were focused in nutritional and chemical parameters, including bioactive compounds and their antioxidant activity [3]. Many natural compounds found in edible food wastes (seeds) or grains (beans) present antioxidant activity. Among the most important natural antioxidants are phenolic compounds (flavonoids, phenolic acids and tannins), nitrogenous compounds (alkaloids, amino acids, peptides, amines and chlorophyll byproducts), carotenoids, tocopherols and ascorbic acid.</p><p id="Par3941">In the present work, the effects of gamma radiation dose (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 5.0 kGy) on the chemical composition (total phenolics and total flavonoids) of pumpkin seeds and mung beans were evaluated. The antioxidant activity was studied using DPPH• and FRAP assays. It was observed a slight increase in the content of bioactive compounds, as well as in antioxidant activity, with irradiation doses below 1.5 kGy. Final results showed that irradiation may be a viable technique to guarantee the content of bioactive compounds, as well as their biological properties, including antioxidant activity.</p><p id="Par3942"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3943">1.

When the patient presents deterioration of his clinical condition, it requires being examined in a timely manner by a team that provides the highest level of care. That seems to be the better way to avoid the occurrence of critical events, such as mortality, cardiovascular arrest and unplanned admission in intensive care units.</p><p id="Par4011"><bold>Objectives</bold></p><p id="Par4012">This study aims to determine the characteristics of the IHET activations of Centro Hospitalar de Leiria (CHL).</p><p id="Par4013"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4014">This exploratory study analysed the registrations of the activations occurred in the last half of 2011, totalling 325 records.

The management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) includes diet, physical activity and, often, medicines; it requires daily self-care and constant lifestyle-related choices [2]. It has been estimated that glycaemic control is achieved in less than 50% of T2D patients due to low self-care behaviour [2]. Sustained hyperglycaemia causes complications and premature death, as well as significant costs [1]. Improving self-care and T2D management is therefore crucial.</p><p id="Par4023">Technology-based interventions, such as text messages, have successfully been used in T2D management; nevertheless, challenges remain, such as acceptability to users and attrition [3,4]. Relational agents, which are computational artefacts designed to establish rapport and trust by simulating face-to-face counselling in long-term interactions, may overcome such challenges. In particular, they have shown acceptability to older and low literacy patients in other contexts [5,6]. There is a paucity of research on the use of relational agents in older people with T2D.</p><p id="Par4024"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4025">To develop a viable prototype of a relational agent software to assist older T2D patients in self-care and to test its use in this patient group.</p><p id="Par4026"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4027">This is a mixed-method study, grounded in the Medical Research Council framework to develop and evaluate complex interventions [7]. The first stage - development of the optimal intervention – will comprise the definition of pre-requisites, content production (e.g. dialog creation guided by behaviour-change theories) and empowering existing virtual humans [8] with artificial intelligence. Users and health care professionals will be involved iteratively. The software is expected to run in a tablet, independently from internet connections, targeting adherence to physical activity, diet and medication-use, without assistance from health care professionals. The second stage will be a non-randomised, non-controlled feasibility trial. Eligible subjects enrolled in diabetes nursing consultations in primary care will be invited to participate. Main outcome measures include software use (timing and frequency, usability, patient satisfaction), reported self-care and reported medication adherence. Acceptability will be researched through focus groups. In both stages data will be analysed with the aid of SPSS; qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed with NVIVO software.</p><p id="Par4028"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4029">Data collection will start once ethical approval is obtained.</p><p id="Par4030"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4031">The study is expected to yield a software prototype to facilitate self-care of older T2D patients, with potential to become an effective, scalable and sustainable intervention.</p><p id="Par4032"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par4033">The study is funded by Compete 2020 and FCT (024250, 02/SAICT/2016).</p><p id="Par4034"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4035">1.

Debridement is achieved thanks to the action of proteolytic enzymes, which are secreted by these larvae, liquefying the protein material on the surface of the wound, which is subsequently used by the larvae as a nutritive material. Healthy tissues are not affected, making this method the most selective among those available. In addition, this therapy helps to fight infection and helps normalization and closure of injuries. Larval debridement has been successfully used in a large range of chronic hard-to-heal wounds with presence of non-viable tissue of many aetiologies such as pressure ulcers, venous or ischemic wounds or diabetic foot ulcers [1-5]</p><p id="Par4047"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4048">To ensure continuity in care in the aim of obtaining the best results from the use of larval debridement therapy, while allowing the administration of treatment in any healthcare context, especially at the patient's own home.</p><p id="Par4049"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4050">The procedure for the use of Maggot therapy has been elaborated and coordinated by the Nursing Unit of Ulcers and Complex Wounds of the Hospital Clínico de Valencia.

This population aging brings different health, economic and social needs, turning elderly dependent and making them living in an institutionalized way [2]. In turn, the institutionalization favours the decline of their physical and cognitive functions, which consequently, weakens the old-aged. For all this, it is very likely that this age group will have D vitamin lack, being considered a serious public health problem at a worldwide level. Therefore, its supplementation must be considered, since this age group has the tendency of staying shortly exposed to solar radiation, has little mobility and their bodies manifest a reduction of the ability of synthesis of this hormone [3-5].</p><p id="Par4123"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4124">This investigation intends to evaluate de existence of the lack of D vitamin in old-aged people who may be institutionalized and old-aged people in ambulatory from the region of Figueira da Foz.</p><p id="Par4125"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4126">Application of a questionnaire and collection of blood samples.</p><p id="Par4127"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4128">With the purpose of evaluating the concentrations of 25(OH)D for each one of the studied groups, it was verified that the non-institutionalized group showed higher 25(OH)D values, when to compared to the institutionalized group. This result has shown to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.003. On the other hand, other variables were compared, as for example, feeding, sun exposure, chronic diseases and intake of vitamin supplements, to try to understand if they had any influence on the 25(OH)D levels. Nevertheless, concerning these parameters, no great differences were verified, because p-values were always higher than 0.005.</p><p id="Par4129"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4130">With this study, we conclude that the geriatric population presents a high lack of vitamin D, both the institutionalized group (although with higher values of 25(OH)D) and the ambulatory group.</p><p id="Par4131"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4132">1.

Error notification is a scientifically proved strategy as being one of the most effective of a safety culture [1-8], being essential for the prevention and detection of factors that contribute for the error. The Operation Room (OR) is one of the most prone health services for the occurrence of adverse events/errors [3], hence being vital the fulfilment of studies regarding this issue, to contribute to an improvement in health care and assure patient safety.</p><p id="Par4167"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4168">To determine the error notification frequency in the OR; and to characterise the safety culture of the OR.</p><p id="Par4169"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4170">Exploratory study, with a quantitively approach. A survey was conducted with 9 closed questions to 33 nurse professionals that work in a OR in a Lisbon Hospital.</p><p id="Par4171"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4172">54.6% of the adverse events that caused damage to the patient were always notified by the nurses, nevertheless, none of the participants pointed this regular notification for adverse events, that could have resulted in damage for the patient, but that did not. Of the several adverse events, 55.6% of the occurred cases were not notified, being the more frequent justification for not notifying them, the lack of time to notify. A negative correlation was obtained between professional experience and the error notification frequency, being this difference statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Regarding the factors that contribute the most for error occurrence in OR, all of the participants mentioned the pressure for working fast, 87.0% referred the lack of human resources, 85.2% absence of motivation, 82.6% professional inexperience and workload overcharge and 65.2% of the participants considered fails in communication, as a factor preponderant to error.

Error notification is a central aspect of health care, particularly in the OR, hence it is fundamental to educate teams for the setting of strategies that promote a safety culture. It is important to continuously train professionals as well as work on the errors, making them a learning opportunity to prevent new errors associated to the same causes, to achieve a quality safety culture.</p><p id="Par4175"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4176">1.

The traditional method for detection and selection of a venous access includes the use of a tourniquet, palpation, and observation. However, when veins are not visible or palpable, this may lead to successive puncture attempts, causing pain to the patient and discomfort to the nurse, which results in increased costs [2]. In this regard, nurses should consider using vascular visualization technologies that aid in vein identification and selection for difficult intravenous access [3]. However, these technological resources available today, are still underutilized in Portugal.</p><p id="Par4188"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4189">This study aims to explore an alternative method (ultrasound) for assistance of the traditional venous cannulation, in order to ensure the satisfaction of the patients and of the health professionals.</p><p id="Par4190"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4191">The search method used was the integrative literature review, which analysed relevant research that supports decision-making and the improvement of clinical practice [4].

The search was conducted in the following databases: Medline, Cinahl, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, MedicLatina, ERIC, Business Source Complete, Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts e Academic Search. We used two search strategies P1 and P2 with the following descriptors, respectively: Ultrasound AND Peripheral catheterization AND Cannulation; Ultrasound AND Peripheral catheterization AND ultrasound guided NOT Paediatric NOT PICC NOT Artery.

An adequate response requires multidisciplinary professionals that must be experienced and specialized in the field. There is evidence that nurses are important in a catastrophic situation as key-elements that can contribute positively in these situations, because of their broad care-giving skills, that can be applied in a variety of disaster settings, with high levels of creativity, adaptability, and leadership [1]. Nevertheless, nurses need to be competent in disaster nursing, in order to make the difference [2].</p><p id="Par4217"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4218">To review the available evidence regarding nursing competencies/interventions that improve victims’ outcomes in the context of catastrophe or multi-victim emergencies.</p><p id="Par4219"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4220">We completed an integrative review of the literature available from MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and grey literature, to answer the question: “<italic>Which nursing competencies/interventions contribute to improve victims’ outcomes in the context of catastrophes or multi-victim emergencies</italic>?” [3].</p><p id="Par4221"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4222">Eight articles, published between 2012 and 2016, satisfied the search criteria and were analysed. The number of participants varied between 16 and 620 nurses. Most of the articles demonstrate that nurses’ competencies have gaps in this field, due to lack of knowledge, training, and simulation, both in nursing education as in working contexts. One of the studies emphasized that nurses from military hospitals have a superior knowledge and preparation in catastrophes, when compared with nurses from civil hospitals, given their military training [4]. The academic training, and the implementation of catastrophe training in the nursing curriculum is also addressed in three of the analysed articles [4–6]. The fact that hospital administrations and nursing leadership fail as promoters of training and promotion of regular exercises and simulations of disasters, is also evidenced in three articles [5,7,8].</p><p id="Par4223"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4224">Globally, the results of this integrative review show that most nurses don’t have enough training in disaster nursing.

In Primary Health Care, patient safety becomes more important because a considerable proportion of safety incidents, detected in hospitals, originate from earlier levels of the system, from most of the interactions and from the largest volume of appointments of the functional units. At this level of health care, in family health units that provide accessible care, global and longitudinal follow-ups on the health process in a lifetime, enables greater health gains, and greater proximity to the patient. These are elementary health care units, based on multi-professional teams, composed by doctors, nurses and administrative staff. Still, many are on very different levels in terms of safety culture of the patient, although in all, the patient wants to have security.</p><p id="Par4238"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4239">Describe the patient's safety culture of health professionals from two family health units (USF), belonging to the same Health Centre, to understand the similarities and/or differences between them.</p><p id="Par4240"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4241">Qualitative study, with a semi-structured interview (to GPs and nurses), at two USFs, models A and B, of one Health Centre in the Lisbon area.

In other words, patient safety is not observed from the same perspective, although it operates in the same geographical area. There is a need for more and a better evaluation, information and training so that the safety culture develops.</p><p id="Par4246"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par4247">Functional units, Primary Health Care, Patient Safety Culture, Education and Training in Patient Safety.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1073"><title>P91 Online opinion leaders and weight loss: a literature review based model</title><sec id="Sec1074"><title>Inga Saboia<sup>1</sup>, Ana M Almeida<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1075"><title><sup>1</sup>Universidade Federal do Ceará, 60020-181 Fortaleza, Ceará, Brasil; <sup>2</sup>Universidade de Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec1076"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Inga Saboia (guiguisaboia@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par4248"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4249">Online opinion leaders shape the trends of the current Web 2.0 [1] and eHealth context [2]. In 2013, in the USA, 72% of the netizens sought out others with the same health problem [3]. This illustrates a scenario of a network among users that mutually influence health behaviours and health decisions, creating a new setting of an increasing digital literacy in health [4], in which the patient becomes an agent of their treatment. One of the most researched topics is weight control (3). The subject of this study is related to public health, specifically obesity, the epidemic of the 21st century [5].</p><p id="Par4250"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4251">This study pretends to build a model of analysis, based on a literature review.

The opinion leaders types in the current Web 2.0 context are: professionals and non-professionals, being these last ones mainly patient opinion leaders (POLs) [8] or digital influencers [9]. POLs are patients who share content as support for others [8]. Besides these agents, we see the rise of health professionals who connect directly with their audience [9]. These have conquered the media by promoting the “right way to feed” and legitimating themselves through a scientific discourse [10]. Considering the digital influencers context, a dichotomy arises: they can be taken as a threat to public health, or as partners fostering the communication between doctors and patients [9]. Furthermore, social networks have also an important role in this scenario as they connect people with a common purpose (weight loss) [10-15].</p><p id="Par4256"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4257">This study identified two types of opinion leaders: health professionals, and nonprofessional ones.

Nurses have an important role to prepare these patients to return back home. This study intends to extract the essence from the nurses' point of view, about people with ostomy of intestinal elimination.</p><p id="Par4274"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4275">To describe the social representation of nurses about the person with intestinal elimination ostomy.</p><p id="Par4276"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4277">We conducted a qualitative, descriptive-exploratory study. Data was collected with an online form. The online form had five questions focused in the aim of the study, and each participant answered each question with five words according to their perception. The sample was of convenience, non-probabilistic constituted by 64 nurses which answered to an online form. Data were collected during the month of November (2017) sending emails to all contacts of nurses in the data bases of the nursing school. Anonymity was preserved. Data analysis was computed in IRAMUTEQ.

The majority (76.6%) belonged to the feminine gender and 84.4% of participants were graduated. When the nurses think in ostomy of intestinal elimination, they think in the characteristics of the stoma. The smell has an important role in this category. Focused in person with intestinal ostomy, nurses are centred in self-care. The nurses consider support (emotional and familiar) and the teachings, the most important necessities of the person with an intestinal ostomy. When they think in the care of these persons they are focused in capacity and knowledge. The preparation to return back home is centred in the acceptance of the disease and on the relationship between nurses and patient.</p><p id="Par4280"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4281">The social representation of nurses about the person with intestinal elimination ostomy is focused in emancipatory patterns of nursing. The person is the centre of care and the care plan is focused in helping the person to live with quality with this new condition.

In 2010, 48.5 million couples worldwide were reported to have fertility problems [2], affecting both genders in 40% of the cases [3]. Due to this high and broad prevalence, infertility is acknowledged as a public health issue with prioritized intervention [4]. The prevalence in Portuguese population was first known in 2009, when a study estimated that about 260-290 thousand individuals were infertile and approximately 9% to 10% of couples displayed some type of reproductive confinement [5]. These results triggered scientific interest in the study of Portuguese infertile patients and a synthesis of the published Portuguese studies regarding infertility seems important in understanding and caring for these patients.</p><p id="Par4288"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4289">To review scientific health empirical research in the study of Portuguese infertile patients.</p><p id="Par4290"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4291">Literature review based on search conducted in December 2017.

One of the formulations produced in the hospital pharmacy is the diazepam suspension 0.4 mg/ml for paediatric use, obtained from diazepam tablets. However, the use of tablets or powders in oral liquid formulations may alter the stability of the active ingredients. Therefore, these formulations should be submitted to stability studies [2]. Nevertheless, the information on the stability of manipulated oral suspensions is scarce [3], so this study is relevant.</p><p id="Par4316"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4317">The main goal of this study is to validate a method of diazepam quantification in suspensions. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the stability of diazepam in suspensions during 30 days, after the suspension preparation, establishing an expiration date.</p><p id="Par4318"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4319">The quantification method of diazepam in oral suspensions arose from the adaptation of the method described in Portuguese Pharmacopoeia [4], for the same active ingredient in tablets. After the method’s validation, the stability of diazepam was evaluated weekly, during 30 days, and the first analysis was done immediately after the preparation of the suspension. During the study period, suspensions were stored under suitable cold conditions (4°C).</p><p id="Par4320"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4321">With an accuracy, evaluated by the mean recovery of 80%, and a precision, evaluated by the variation coefficient, varying between 6.1 and 11.5%, the method proved to be practicable. Two suspension’s samples were prepared with a similar diazepam concentration (0.43 mg/ml). The stability study of those suspensions showed that diazepam concentration decayed linearly, and that diazepam suspensions lose about 70% of their active principle within 30 days. Moreover, given the limits indicated by the Portuguese Pharmacopoeia [4] for diazepam tablets, it was verified that these suspensions only comply with these limits after 7 days, and that within the established period of validity these limits are no longer met.</p><p id="Par4322"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4323">Despite all limitations, the adapted method proved to be practicable and the results that followed have pointed to the possible instability of diazepam, when included in this oral suspension formulation. Given the dosage limits set for diazepam tablets [4] and knowing in advance that the validity period usually attributed to the suspension is 15 days, the results point to a new shelf-life of approximately 7 days. However, for a more consistent period of validity to be established, a more detailed stability study is required.</p><p id="Par4324"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4325">1.

The process of becoming a grandparent can be considered an event of great social impact.

The interest in studying the human microbiome, its diversity and human-microorganism interactions has been developing in the last years, as such it has been made available immense information in this area.</p><p id="Par4345"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4346">Bibliographic review of the intestinal microbiota: constitution, what affects it, and its influence in the triggering of some pathologies.</p><p id="Par4347"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4348">A comprehensive search was performed on the PubMed search, being obtained from this review 112 articles from which 67 were used.</p><p id="Par4349"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4350">The intestinal microbiota is considered a “superorganism” and is extremely complex. It is composed of a great diversity of microorganisms, which varies among individuals; however, it is essentially dominated by two phyla, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. It is dynamic and can be affected by several factors such as diet [2], breastfeeding [3], use of antibiotics [4,5] and type of delivery [6,7]. When an imbalance of the microbiota occurs, known as dysbiosis [1,8], the host is affected, being related to pathologies such as allergies, obesity and Crohn's disease. Some studies [9,10-14] have demonstrated that the microbiota participates in the maturation of the immune system and as such is predominant in the response to infectious processes. On the other hand, the intestinal microbiota seems to play a fundamental role in the prevention of allergies [15-26]. Inappropriate colonization after birth and excessive hygiene during childhood, may promote greater allergic reactions. Rats without bacteria have been shown to present more severe allergic reactions [22-26]. Regarding obesity, several authors [27-30] have demonstrated that changes in microbiota are strongly related to the establishment of obesity. It has been demonstrated that the type of microbiota influences obesity; rats with higher amounts of Firmicutes compared to the amount of Bacteroidetes, present greater capacity to promote fat deposition. On the other hand, a switch to a less caloric diet produced a change in the microbiota that led to a decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes. These results are surprising and suggest that future obesity control may originate from the type of intestinal microbiota.</p><p id="Par4351"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4352">Intestinal microbiota is of great relevance because it protects against external factors and the development of certain pathologies. It is therefore important to keep the population informed so that a microbiota considered “normal” can be maintained from childhood to adulthood.</p><p id="Par4353"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4354">1.

Surface electromyography was recorded from rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) portions of the quadriceps femoris, long head of the biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA) and lateralis gastrocnemius (GA). Kinematic analysis was performed with the Ariel Performance Analysis System (APAS, Ariel Dynamics-2003). The neuromuscular reaction time was defined as the time interval between the auditory stimulus and the onset of electrical activation of a muscle, while the electromechanical delay was the time interval between the onset of the electric activity of a muscle and the beginning of joint movement. Student t-test (two-tailed) was used to analyse the differences between groups, with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 (SPSS 17.0).</p><p id="Par4392"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4393">It was observed a tendency to a longer neuromuscular reaction time of the TA in veteran karate practitioners than among elite karate athletes (136.00 ± 58.80 vs 122.00 ± 45.94 ms, p = 0.566), although a significantly shorter neuromuscular reaction time was found in the RF in veteran karate practitioners (137.00 ± 27.93 vs 184 ± 51.55 ms, p = 0.030). Veteran karate practitioners presented a significantly longer RF electromechanical delay than elite karate athletes (127.00 ± 59.11 vs 39.00 ± 47.68 ms, p = 0.003).</p><p id="Par4394"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4395">The results of the study showed that with the aging process there is an increase in the electromechanical delay, although no negative impact on the neuromuscular reaction time has been observed.

Polymedication is also frequent in older individuals, impairing appetite and possibly contributing to the development of malnutrition [2].</p><p id="Par4400"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4401">The aim of this study was to identify nutritional risk in institutionalized elderly and establish a relationship between length of stay in the institution, pharmacotherapy and presence of malnutrition.</p><p id="Par4402"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4403">Day of admission, number of medications and sociodemographic data were collected from the patient’s medical file. Malnutrition and nutritional risk were assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (Short Form) (MNA-SF).</p><p id="Par4404"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4405">Seventy-eight individuals, mainly female (59.0%), with a mean age of 81.7 years (SD= 10.2) were evaluated. Mean length of stay was 6.4 years (SD= 7.8). MNA-SF classified 32 individuals (41.0%) at risk of malnutrition and 20 (25.6%) as malnourished. According to the elderly Body Mass Index (BMI) classification, 28 were at risk of malnutrition and 23 were malnourished (35.9% and 29.7%, respectively), showing a positive correlation with MNA-SF results (p &lt; 0.05). The female gender presented an overall higher risk of malnutrition (p &lt; 0.05). Those who were more dependent to feed themselves were at risk of malnutrition or malnourished (p &lt; 0.05). Fifty-seven of the subjects (73.0%) were under polymedication, with a mean number of daily medications of 7.5 (SD= 3.4). A higher number of regular medications is correlated with higher BMI (p &lt; 0.05). No association was found between length of stay or number of drugs taken and malnutrition.</p><p id="Par4406"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4407">In this population, a high prevalence of risk of malnutrition was identified, particularly in the female gender. Although previously described, a correlation between polypharmacy and malnutrition was not found. A closer look to type of medication might be necessary. In this sample, a very long length of stay was also found. Nutritional intervention in this population should be prompt since admission and regularly provided, preventing the development of malnutrition and comorbidities.</p><p id="Par4408"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4409">1.

These changes boosted the growth of the catering industry. However, they also require the evolution of techniques, so as to enable catering and catering companies to offer food of quality [1-3]. Most cases of food poisoning are due to poor hygiene habits. Structural failures and ignorance or neglection of good hygiene and food safety practices may also lead to food contamination [4,5].</p><p id="Par4415"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4416">The sample consisted of canteens of public and private educational establishments and of public and private social solidarity institutions, totalling 26 canteens and 127 professionals.

In the evaluation of food temperature, it was found that there are some foods that are served in the “danger zone” (&lt; 65°C). School cafeterias (without food confectionery) had, in majority, deficient conditions of installation because they were rooms of activities where the meals were served. For this reason, there were no water baths or meal service facilities.</p><p id="Par4419"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4420">With this work it was concluded that there are deficiencies regarding the structural and operating conditions of canteens/refectories, which could be filled by the construction/enlargement of spaces. Regarding the evaluation of the quality of the oils and temperature of the meals, there were flaws, with possible repercussions on the quality of the meals served. It is also important to develop skills for the elaboration of menus suited to the different age groups and the confection of healthier diets. Emphasis can be placed on the training of manipulators in order to raise awareness of the repercussions of their role and responsibilities in preventing contamination. Ensuring and promoting food safety is nowadays a requirement of any institution, where food is produced or distributed, as a means of ensuring the promotion of high levels of confidence and safeguarding of the consumer’s health.</p><p id="Par4421"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4422">1.

Despite the procedure’s importance for healthcare quality, it has some risks and complications such infiltration, bloodstream infection and phlebitis. Healthcare associated infections are considered a worldwide problem, having a considerable impact on the patients’ and community’s health and economy [1,2]. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, prevalence of this type of infections is 6.0% and 10.6%, in Europe and in Portugal, respectively. Bloodstream infections, related with venous catheters, have one of the lowest prevalence, but they may lead to serious consequences [2].</p><p id="Par4443"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4444">Explore the procedure of venous catheterization as a risk factor for infection. Explore the role of an innovation as a contribution to the implementation of a prevention measure, in the practice of flushing.</p><p id="Par4445"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4446">A literature review involved search in EBSCOhost databases, including articles up to 2017. Some terms used were “infection”, “venous catheter”, “catheterization”, catheter-related infection” “complication” “prevention” “management” “practices”, “flushing”. Articles regarding haemodialysis and urinary catheters were excluded. Guidelines of the societies regarding infusion nursing practices were also included.</p><p id="Par4447"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4448">Catheterization is considered a risk factor because it creates a possibility for microorganisms to access to the bloodstream. The implementation of an insertion protocol is not enough to eliminate microorganisms and avoid the formation of a biofilm. Integrated in maintenance procedures, flushing contributes to reduce the risk of complications. Studies concluded that the use of an adequate technique of flushing may reduce the biofilm and the probability of infection [3]. Infusion Nurses Society [4] and the Royal College of Nursing [5] include it as a procedure to prevent complications of the infusion therapy. Despite the recommendations, the implementation of this practice is not consistent. To explain lack of adherence, one of the reasons pointed out is the complexity of the task [6]. These results support the development of a Medical Device (MD) (double chamber syringe) that may contribute to the adherence of the flushing practice.</p><p id="Par4449"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4450">It is important to create strategies to improve adherence to guidelines in clinical context, particularly regarding healthcare associated infections.

When questioned about the conduct of their supervisor or boss, it was noted that a considerable number of respondents opted to abstain from comments, marking the option “<italic>I do not agree or disagree</italic>”. In the issue that addresses the communication in the service, the results were partially satisfactory. Regarding the frequency of reported events, there is a lack of notifications in the sector. When questioned about how patient safety is in the industry 3% (n= 2) considered it excellent, 63% (n= 38) very good and 33% (n= 20) regular.

Venous catheterization (peripheral or central) allows the administration of medication directly into the bloodstream through an inserted catheter. Although the flushing procedure is desirable between and after the administration of intravenous medication, this procedure is often not observed.</p><p id="Par4474"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4475">In order to reduce this problem, a consortium with complementary experience and skills was created between: Muroplás company, Innovation Polymers Engineering Centre (PIEP) and the Coimbra Nursing School (ESEnfC). The consortium developed the “DUO SYRINGE”, a new Medical Device consisting in a sequential-release double-chamber syringe. The benefits of this new device are several: a greater adherence to flushing by health professionals, a higher level of patient safety and a significant reduction of complications.</p><p id="Par4476"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4477">After a literature review regarding disease control and prevention, mainly sustained by the Infusion Nurses Society and Royal College of Nursing guidelines, we established important characteristics for this new MD. A focus groups with nurse experts identified and validated the technical characteristics of the device. After developing the preliminary geometry of the syringe through three-dimensional modelling (3D), a new expert panel of end users evaluated the usability of the MD alpha version sustained in Technology Acceptance Model. In the future, we also intend to carry out laboratory tests for safety validation and to perform clinical studies in a hospital environment.</p><p id="Par4478"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4479">We identified a set of characteristics that the MD should incorporate, namely syringe size, volume of the two chambers, cannon syringe configuration, and plunger configuration.

Identifying problems, creating technological partnerships with companies and technological centres allows to innovate through the development and creation of new MDs. The clinical research with MD allows the evaluation of safety, making clinical practice more effective and safe. This is a new challenge placed to the health professionals. It is desirable to display the intellectual capital available to generate innovations for citizens, reverting in gains to the quality of care.</p><p id="Par4482"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par4483">This work is funded by the FEDER fund through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation (COMPETE 2020) within project POCI-01-0247- FEDER-017604.</p><p id="Par4484"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par4485">Medical Device, Nursing, Innovation, Syringe.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1133"><title>P106 Nursing home care: nurses' perspective</title><sec id="Sec1134"><title>Tatiana Antunes<sup>1</sup>, Teresa Capelo<sup>1</sup>, Anabela Salgueiro-Oliveira<sup>1</sup>, Luciene Braga<sup>2</sup>, Pedro Parreira<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1135"><title><sup>1</sup>Coimbra Nursing School, 3046-851 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Federal University of Viçosa, 36570-900 Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil</title><sec id="Sec1136"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Anabela Salgueiro-Oliveira (anabela@esenfc.pt)</title><p id="Par4486"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4487">Nursing home care is a trend of the current society, due to the aging of the population and shorter hospitalization times, for economic reasons and also to prevent infections.

Its success is due largely in part to the use of immunosuppressants, like tacrolimus, the first-line immunosuppressant drug for people undergoing liver transplantation. It is a drug with narrow therapeutic window and great inter-individual variability. This variability is explained in part by polymorphisms of the CYP3A5 gene, which encodes the CYP3A5 metabolizing enzyme. The rs776746 polymorphism affects the CYP3A5 gene and gives rise to a non-functional metabolizing enzyme. The CYP3A5 gene is expressed in both the liver and the gut, that is, the metabolism of tacrolimus is affected by the transplanted liver (donor) genotype, as well as by the gut (receptor) genotype. The identification of polymorphisms becomes important especially in the period immediately after transplantation in order to avoid acute rejection of the organ.</p><p id="Par4517"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4518">The objective of this work was to review the influence of rs776746 polymorphism of the CYP3A5 gene on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus.</p><p id="Par4519"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4520">A systematic review was conducted through the Pubmed database search, from 2000 to 2017.

However, PEF mainly reflects changes in large airways and it is known that COPD primarily targets small airways. Adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS - crackles and/or wheezes), are related to changes within lung morphology and are significantly more frequent in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Thus, ARS may be also useful for the routine monitoring of lung function during PR programs.</p><p id="Par4541"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4542">This study explored the convergent validity of ARS and PEF in patients with COPD.</p><p id="Par4543">Methods</p><p id="Par4544">Twenty-four (24) stable patients (66 ± 9 years; FEV1 71 ± 19% pred) participating in a PR program were included.

For the definition of the Primary Care Sensitive Conditions (PCSC), the official report published by the Ministry of Health was used [4]. The crude PCSC rate was calculated by the ratio between the number of PCSC in the elderly and the reference population for the period multiplied by 10,000. Next, the PCSC hospitalization rates for the elderly were standardized by age using the direct method, using the world population [5] as the standard. To soften the historical series, as a function of the oscillation of the points, was calculated the moving average centred in three groups. The analysis was performed through the Joinpoint program, version 4.3.1, used to calculate the variation of the rates of hospitalization of elderly people by age-adjusted PCSC, in the period from 2008 to 2015, resulting in the behaviour of the rate in the period studied for each municipality of Santa Catarina.</p><p id="Par4557"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4558">The analysis showed that for each percentage point of increase in the elderly population rate, one percentage point increases in the annual rate of hospitalization rate for PCSC in the elderly (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.025).

In addition to incapacitating the sick person this disease has destabilising effects on the family, particularly because they are the caregivers. Therefore, it is important to know how informed family caregivers are about Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p id="Par4588"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4589">To characterise family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease and identify their level of knowledge about the disease.</p><p id="Par4590"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4591">A quantitative, transversal and descriptive study was carried out. For this, 52 caregivers who are relatives of people with Alzheimer's disease were identified through a convenience sample from both private homes and day-care centres in the North region of Portugal. A questionnaire was administered that contained the sociodemographic characterisation of the caregivers as well as questions that dealt with different facets of the disease, ranging from pathophysiology to intervention strategies. The questionnaire was designed for this study, underpinned by consistent theoretical bases, and was sent to five experts for evaluation. These experts were nurses with experience in gerontology/Alzheimer's disease. The questions are essentially closed, with the only open question coming at the end, relating to the difficulties experienced by the family members in caring for the patient.</p><p id="Par4592"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4593">Focusing on aspects related to literacy, the main results indicate that although 87% of these caregivers know how to define Alzheimer's disease, only about 30% understand what underlies it, while about 50% show some difficulties in identifying risk factors. Most of them (75%) are able to list symptoms of the disease but only half know how to keep the sick person active. It should be noted that only 38% can identify ways to preserve memory and that about 30% of family caregivers are unaware of the purpose of the medication.</p><p id="Par4594"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4595">It was found that there is considerable uncertainty among family caregivers about several facets of Alzheimer's disease. There was also some lack of knowledge about existing resources and support. The study also highlights the fact that the family members questioned do not often ask nurses for information relevant to the care process.</p><p id="Par4596"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par4597">Health literacy, Family caregivers, Alzheimer’s disease.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1165"><title>P114 Positive effects of a health promotion program in sedentary elderly with type 2 diabetes</title><sec id="Sec1166"><title>Luís Coelho<sup>1,2</sup>, Nuno Amaro<sup>1,2</sup>, João Cruz<sup>1,2</sup>, Rogério Salvador<sup>1,2</sup>, Paulino Rosa<sup>1,2</sup>, Ricardo Gonçalves<sup>1,2</sup>, Rui Matos<sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1167"><title><sup>1</sup>School of Education and Social Sciences, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, 2411-091 Leiria, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Life Quality Research Centre, 2001-904 Santarém, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec1168"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Luís Coelho (coelho@ipleiria.pt)</title><p id="Par4598"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4599">Diabetes is projected to be the 7th leading cause of death by 2030 by WHO (2017) [1]. Physical Activity along with a healthy diet and medication is one of the crucial options to prevent and control diabetes. About 40% of the Portuguese population aged 25 to 79 years-old presents a condition of diabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia (Observatório Nacional da Diabetes, 2016) [2].</p><p id="Par4600"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4601">To examine the impact of a health promotion program in sedentary elderly with type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="Par4602"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4603">The program consisted on a 30-minute daily walking routine and a weekly educational session regarding healthy behaviours for 8 weeks. All participants were medicated with insulin and anti-diabetics. Twenty-six elderly diabetics (16 male and 10 female) aged 70.1 ± 8.0 years old, were assessed for Body Mass (BM), Body Mass Index (BMI), Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (SBP, DBP respectively), Waist Circumference (WC), and Capillary Glycaemia (CG). Wilcoxon test was used on inferential analysis for repeated measures (pre-post). Significance level was kept at 5%. The effect size for this test was calculated by dividing the z value by the square root of N, being N the number of observations over the two times points [3].</p><p id="Par4604"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4605">All parameters measured values decreased significantly from initial to final moments: BM from 80.8 ± 8.9 kg to 78.2 ± 9.0 kg (p=0.000; r=-0.512), BMI 30.2 ± 3.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 29.1 ± 3.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (p=0.000; r=-0.543), SBP from 143.4 ± 10.9 mmHg to 134.3 ± 10.4 mmHg (p=0.002; r=-0.426), DBP from 79.5 ± 8.6 mmHg to 75.3 ± 8.7 mmHg (p=0.035; r=-0.292), WC from 100.9 ± 7.8 cm to 96.7 ± 6.7cm (p=0.000; r=-0.584), CG from 182.5 ± 56.3 mg/dl to 124.1 ± 17.7 mg/dl (p=0.000; r=-0.588).</p><p id="Par4606"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4607">The inclusion of physical activity and the awareness of engaging in healthy behaviours seem to complement the medication-based therapeutic in sedentary elderly with type 2 diabetes. Although the physical activity assessment was self-reported, sport sciences can play an important role in the prescription and monitoring of exercise in clinical patients. Multidisciplinary interventions in community health programs are recommended in order to achieve stronger and consistent results. These should include medical practitioners, physiologists and nutritionists.</p><p id="Par4608"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4609">1. World Health Organization. Diabetes Fact Sheet.

In this context, unfinished, delayed, or missed nursing care (MNC), which is a strong indicator of health care quality, can compromise quality care and patient safety.</p><p id="Par4696"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4697">To identify the most common MNC, as well as its predictors and strategies to prevent its occurrence.</p><p id="Par4698"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4699">A systematic literature review was conducted on studies available in the EBSCOhost and B-on databases. Twenty-four articles were selected based on predefined criteria. All articles were published between 2012 and 2017.</p><p id="Par4700"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4701">The studies showed that nurses and patients have different perceptions about MNC. Autonomous interventions related to early mobility and walking, repositioning every 2 hours, or oral and body hygiene are more often missed than interdependent interventions. [1-5]. Medication administration within 30 minutes of prescription, planning and update of care plans, vital signs monitoring, and treatment effectiveness assessment also emerged as MNC [5-7]. Predictive factors are associated with the patient (health status/workload) [2, 5]; the nurse (interruptions by other professionals or patients’ relatives) [4, 8]; the materials or equipment (late deliveries) [9], or the hospital’s health care policies (management/leadership and staffing) [10]. The nurse-patient/family communication emerged as MNC, whereas the nurse-other health professional communication emerged as a predictive factor because teamwork and its effectiveness are compromised [2, 11]. Nurses’ personal interests and moral sense can influence the occurrence of MNC. Therefore, the strategies used to reduce the incidence of MNC should be adjusted to the needs of each setting [2, 5].</p><p id="Par4702"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4703">Although MNCs are being explored internationally, it is an understudied topic in Portugal, which may be explained by the punitive error reporting culture. The findings cannot be generalized due to the diversity of studies. Thus, the phenomenon of MNC and its impact on patient/family prognosis should be explored in different settings, with the purpose of achieving excellence in health care and ensuring that people recognize the importance of health care.</p><p id="Par4704"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4705">1.

Mostly, the family is defined as a group of people with a common link (n= 10). Family health nursing is seen as: caring for the family; personalizing and integrating the nursing care provided to the person and to the family; the existence of a family nurse who knows all its members; the one that equates the care to the individuals according to the characteristics of the family; a health support of the group; a nurse that focuses mainly on the patient and on the family, in partnership with the respective family doctor.</p><p id="Par4726"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4727">Given the data obtained, it is understood that the conceptualization of family and family health nursing should be clarified so that nurses can focus on the internal dynamics of the families and their relationships, family structure and functioning.

However, it is not possible, to conclude that these vestibular changes are directly related to the placement of the CI.

Since the Declaration of Bolonha, nursing students are provided with a more practical and profession oriented nursing training [1, 2]. As our professionals’ skills become more recognized in the global health market, also our need to improve education and professional development rises. The best way to enhance the quality of practice education provided to undergraduate nursing students and to improve clinical outcomes is by enriching the academic <italic>curriculum</italic> with evidence-based nursing practices (EBNP) [3]. The Best Practice Guidelines Program (BPGP) was developed by the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) to support EBNP [4].</p><p id="Par4757"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4758">Provide an update on the process of implementation of RNAO’s Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs) in the nursing curriculum.</p><p id="Par4759"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4760">The implementation process was supported by the RNAO’s Toolkit for Implementing Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs) [5]. It is a comprehensive resource manual, grounded in theory, research and experience, that provides practical processes, strategies and tools to both Providers, Educational Institutions, Governments, and others committed to implement and evaluate BPGs.</p><p id="Par4761"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4762">The BPGs selection and implementation brought together some of the suggested activities from the six steps of the manual. It resulted in the selection of three clinical guidelines (Engaging Clients Who Use Substances [6]; Prevention of Falls and Fall Injuries in the Older Adult [7]; Primary Prevention of Childhood Obesity [8] and a Healthy Work Environments Guideline (Practice Education in Nursing, [9]). We considered two main areas to intervene, in order to address the challenge of generating scientific evidence for nursing practice: the academic and the clinical setting (partner institutions, where students undertake their clinical practice). The implementation process included three fundamental players from both settings: professors, nursing students and clinical nursing instructors. To evaluate our performance and measure the improvements, we created structure, process and outcome indicators for each guideline. Data collection tools were first used in the curricular units that precede clinical teaching, and results will be processed and analysed.</p><p id="Par4763"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4764">Professors, students and partner institutions were successfully engaged in the initiative. We are investing in an action plan to embed the evidence-based practice culture, through an orientation program for clinical nursing instructors. The strategy is to strengthen the relationship with providers in order to standardize evidence-based procedures and improve both nurses’ education and quality of care.</p><p id="Par4765"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4766">1.

In fact, disease prevention is surely the way to go. This is not to say that we should neglect the treatment of disease, but rather that we must make a clear bet on its prevention according to our daily behaviour and the circumstances in which we live. The practice of swimming is recommended, especially for children, since it presents benefits, namely in the treatment of respiratory diseases, allergic problems and in the improvement of motor coordination and/or postural problems. However, during swimming lessons, children are exposed to numerous harmful risk factors to the middle ear and the outer ear. Therefore, preventive measures are essentially the eviction of some factors that increase the associated risks.</p><p id="Par4779"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4780">To analyse possible audiological changes in swimming children, aged between 3 and 10 years.

Physical activity was assessed using accelerometry (ActiGraph®, GT1M model, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, EUA). Data were recorded for three consecutive days and 600 minutes of daily recording, at least. Spirometry tests were performed using the Cosmed® Microquark spirometer. The following parameters were analysed: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Expiratory Volume in one second and Forced Vital Capacity rate (FEV1/FVC). In order to analyse data, descriptive and inferential statistics were used.

It is also known that not all learning problems are due to auditory processing disorders and all cases of auditory processing disorders do not lead to learning problems. Studies also point out that an adequate and personalized auditory training may be a viable option in the rehabilitation of auditory information processing in the central nervous system (brain neuroplasticity training), being the early assessment and intervention important to minimize the associated consequences, such as the possible difficulties on the learning process.</p><p id="Par4822"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4823">To analyse the influence that auditory training has on the improvement of auditory processing disorders of children and youngsters, with learning disabilities.</p><p id="Par4824"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4825">For this purpose was conducted a systematic literature review with search of scientific papers on electronic databases B-on, PubMED, ScienceDirect and SciELO with keywords such as auditory training, auditory processing, auditory processing disorders, learning disabilities, learning difficulties, children and youngsters (in Portuguese, English or Spanish).

Nevertheless, infectious and parasitic diseases are still present in certain metropolitan areas of Brazil, despite the increased prevalence of chronic diseases. This work aims to present the general aspects of the situation of diseases related to inadequate environmental sanitation (IESDs) and of the sanitation policy of Porto Alegre.</p><p id="Par4834"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4835">The general objective was to examine the public policy for environmental sanitation in Porto Alegre, and, the specific objectives were: I) to analyse the relationship between indicators of poverty and inadequate environmental sanitation and the occurrence of diseases related to inadequate environmental sanitation; and, II) to present the situation of IESDs and the sanitation policy of Porto Alegre.</p><p id="Par4836"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4837">The method was qualitative and quantitative, with data collection and analysis of public policies. The period analysed was from 2008 to 2012. Data were obtained from Health Information Systems, DATASUS website of the Ministry of Health, along with a set of basic indicators from the Porto Alegre’s Observatory. The indicators were classified according to the specific objectives: poverty(P); environmental sanitation(S); diseases(D). Pearson's linear correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis to test the associations between poverty and basic sanitation indicators with IESDs indicators.</p><p id="Par4838"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4839">The results showed that the biggest problems related to IESDs occur in the poorest regions, which are: <italic>Restinga, Parthenon, Nordeste, Lomba do Pinheiro, Gloria, Ilhas and Extremo Sul</italic>. The higher concentration of Dengue was found in the Parthenon region; Leptospirosis in the regions of <italic>Restinga, Extremo Sul, Lomba do Pinheiro, Norte and Eixo Baltazar;</italic> Hepatitis A in the regions of <italic>Ilhas, Nordeste, Humaitá /Navegantes, Centro, Lomba do Pinheiro, Norte, Leste and Parthenon</italic>. Regarding the public policy for Environmental Sanitation in Porto Alegre, we concluded that there are some urban policies, but the subject needs greater systemic view directed to the most specific problems of the city. About the Sanitation Plans, we concluded that the regions that need the sanitation, at most - a sewage collection network - have a lower footage for infrastructure installation, such as, the region of <italic>Ilhas</italic>. The sanitation basic plan (Water) gives various information about areas that need the implementation of infrastructures of universal supply, however there is still no date of when that will be possible.</p><p id="Par4840"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4841">Finally, infectious and parasitic diseases are a reality in Porto Alegre. Still at the XXI century, there are about 1,200 annual hospitalizations in health services (SUS) and are responsible for about 750 deaths per year in the capital city.</p><p id="Par4842"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4843">1.

Nonadherence to treatment influences the health of the patient and can generate several complications. In this way, health care providers are confronted with the best strategies to promote effective management of the disease, together with patients and families. The nursing consultation seems to be a privileged setting for assisting patients for healthy behaviour changes with a personalized intervention adjusted to the needs of each one [2, 3].</p><p id="Par4872"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par4873">To analyse the factors that promote or inhibit adherence to treatment and to identify the nursing interventions that determine treatment adherence.</p><p id="Par4874"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4875">We conducted an integrative literature review with qualitative and quantitative studies through electronic databases Scielo, Scopus, Medline, LILACS and B-on, using the following selected research discriminators, “adherence”, “patient”, “hypertension” and “nursing care” from the DeCs and MeSH for articles published between 2011 and 2016. The PICOD [4, 5] method and the QualSyst [6] tool were used to evaluate the research question and the quality of the articles, respectively.</p><p id="Par4876"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4877">In this research 372 articles were found, and 10 were selected, corresponding to 2,565 hypertensive patients over 18 years old, of whom 64% were female. Despite the differences found in the methodologies of these studies, the results indicated a poor adherence to the treatment [7]. The analysis resulted in two major categories that explain patients' adherence to the treatment of hypertension, namely the factors that influence adherence and nursing interventions. The most significant factors that inhibit adherence are complex drug regimens, lack of knowledge, and poor physical activity. The nursing interventions that enhance adherence were the adoption of continued educational strategies.</p><p id="Par4878"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4879">Patient adherence is a complex issue with a huge burden for the health system because it not only implies the change of patient behaviours, but also other factors like the involvement of caregivers and families. Considering the factors described in this review, the nursing consultation, through the definition of educational strategies, seems to increase patient adherence to treatment. In future research, guidelines will be suggested that aim to increase adherence to treatment.</p><p id="Par4880"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4881">1. Direção-Geral da Saúde.

Throughout the interviews they identified constraints in the use of simulation, such as: economic and material resources, realism, time available for training resourcing to simulators and the constitution of classes, since the number of students is considered excessive, and the personality of the students is also called into question. To overcome the constraints mentioned above, teachers appeal for the acquisition of material, in sufficient numbers to respond to the constitution of the classes and the desired realism. They affirm that the practical classes should have a superior workload, with unfolding of the classes, thus increasing the time given to debriefing.</p><p id="Par4929"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4930">Our results agree with the opinion of Gomes &amp; Germano (2007) [1], Guhde (2011) [2] and Amendoeira, et al., (2013) [3], when they affirm throughout their studies that simulated practice allows a better articulation of the theoretical content with the practice, facilitating the learning of the contents taught in theory, via a consequent reflection of previous learning in the context of clinical practice, with the development of students' competences. In summary, the teachers interviewed highlight the importance of simulation, to answer to our research question, once they recognize the importance of simulation in the health field.</p><p id="Par4931"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4932">1.

A sample characterization questionnaire and the International Questionnaire on Physical Activity (IPAQ) - Short Version were administered through the Qualtrics platform. For the anthropometric measurements and body composition, the Tanita BC-545NTM scale and a Seca stadiometer were used. Satisfaction with body image was assessed through the Body Shape Questionnaire.

The 23QVS is a self-assessment tool, consisting of 23 questions and allows assessing the vulnerability of an individual to stress. The higher the final score, the more vulnerable the individual is to stress, considering that the value 43 is the value above which an individual is considered vulnerable to stress.

Seven people with mild dementia were interviewed, most diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, with a mean of 71 years old.

In fact, this study, in addition to revealing the lived experience of the person with dementia, has the potential to contribute to the improvement of nursing care in mental health.</p><p id="Par5005"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par5006">Mild dementia, Lived-experience, Hermeneutic, Illness representation.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1273"><title>P141 The institutionalized elderly person: representations of happiness and well-being</title><sec id="Sec1274"><title>Magda Guerra, Carlos Laranjeira, Zaida Azeredo</title><sec id="Sec1275"><title>School of Health, Jean Piaget Institute, Research in Education and Community Intervention, 3515-776 Viseu, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec1276"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Magda Guerra (magdasantosguerra@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par5007"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5008">Population aging in developed and developing countries is an unequivocal reality and poses multiple challenges to their communities and political entities.

Inadequate oral care develops an important role in this setting allowing various organisms to flourish in oral cavity and cause infections [1]. Many VAP prevention guidelines include oral care, but they don’t specify its demandings.</p><p id="Par5019"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5020">The aim of this study is to describe evidence-based VAP prevention oral care in ICU, in terms of products, frequency and technique.</p><p id="Par5021"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5022">Integrative review. Research was conducted on B-on, PUBMED, and RCAAP between 24 and 28 December 2015, including guidelines and original articles from the last 5 years. We found 256 documents and after analysing their abstract and methodological quality, nine documents were selected. Data were compiled in a chart in terms of grade of evidence, acceptance and applicability.</p><p id="Par5023"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5024">We found inconsistent results regarding the use of an antiseptic solution in oral care, though there were meta-analysis which indicated the benefit of chlorhexidine mostly in cardio-thoracic surgical patients [2-4]. We also found evidence that tooth brushing reduces oral bacterial colonization and may reduce VAP when used with chlorhexidine [5,6]. There is no consensus regarding the adequate concentration of chlorhexidine. Some studies, thought, find an association with the use of chlorhexidine 2% and the incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [7]. Because of this potential risk, we do not recommend the use of this type of concentration, as more randomized controlled trials are needed. We found evidence in VAP prevention oral care comprising suctioning, tooth and gums wash and rising with 15 mL chlorhexidine 0.12%. This procedure should be performed at least 2 times a day. Secretions removal and moisturization should occur between 2 to 4 times a day [1-9].</p><p id="Par5025"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5026">This review allowed us to describe the adequate oral care in ICUs in order to potentially reduce VAP. As limitation of this study, we can find the lack of high grade of evidence concerning most recommendations. More randomized controlled trials are needed to support the impact of each intervention separately.</p><p id="Par5027"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5028">1. Munro CL, Grap MJ.

To better tailor the features and digital content of the mobile app, it was important to understand some of the characteristics of the devices more frequently used by the adolescents. Moreover, it was important to understand which contents are essential for health-professionals who frequently work with these adolescents. This data is extremely important during the conception and planning phase of the creation of the mobile app.</p><p id="Par5041"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5042">This study has two main aims. Firstly, to characterize and assess the devices frequently used by adolescents, as well as the preferences of adolescents for the mobile app. Secondly, to understand what features are more important for health-professionals who work closely with adolescents to promote healthy behaviours.</p><p id="Par5043"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5044">Two samples were recruited. A sample of 15 adolescents (M = 15.20; SD = 0.68) with the characteristics of the future users of the mobile app was recruited. A sample of 11 health-professionals who work closely with adolescents was also recruited. Both samples answered 2 questionnaires specifically created for the purpose. Five-point Likert scales and open questions were used. The instruments comprised questions regarding the type of devices frequently used by adolescents, the content that both, adolescents and health-professionals, consider more important regarding the promotion of healthy behaviours, and the reasons adolescents consider to use mobile apps.</p><p id="Par5045"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5046">All adolescents use smartphones, but only 20% of the sample frequently use lifestyle and health apps, with the majority (93.3%) using social networks. The majority of the sample referred that food suggestions (93.3%) and physical activity suggestions (93.3%) should be included in the app. Adolescents also referred what reasons and features would influence them to use a health mobile app. Health-professionals (90.9% nurses and 9.1% psychologists) referred that the app should have food suggestions (90.9%) and physical activity suggestions (90.9%). They all referred that they would advise an adolescent to use a health-related app, with 81.8% referring that they would feel comfortable giving advices through a mobile app.</p><p id="Par5047"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5048">The results of our study help us tailor and choose the most important features present in the TeenPower app. Understanding what content may be more appealing for adolescents may also help the creation of future content for prevention programs.</p><p id="Par5049"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par5050">The current abstract is being presented on behalf of the research group of the project TeenPower: e-Empowering teenagers to prevent obesity, co-funded by the FEDER (European Regional Development Fund), under the Portugal 2020 Program, through COMPETE 2020 (Competitiveness and Internationalization Operational Program).

People with a more advanced age range are starting to appear in the settings of those living with HIV/AIDS [2]. Many causes are attributed: sociocultural changes, especially in sexuality; resistance in using condoms; healthcare innovations; access to antiretroviral therapy and other innovations in clinical areas [3]. Among men aged 60 years and over, in the last decade, there has been an increase in the rate of detection [4], which raises the need for public policies aimed at this reality.</p><p id="Par5055"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5056">To investigate epidemiological and clinical characteristics of men housed in a shelter for people living with HIV/AIDS.</p><p id="Par5057"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5058">Descriptive study of epidemiological and clinical information on people living with HIV/AIDS, housed in a shelter in Teresina-Piauí, Brazil. Data were collected from 28 selected records, with the following criteria: male, aged 50 years or older. The following variables were considered: age group, educational level, place of residence, time of antiretroviral therapy and clinical manifestations. The data were typed in an Excel 2007 spreadsheet, analysed through percentage differences and discussed, with reference to documents and also articles in which there was content about the proposed theme.</p><p id="Par5059"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5060">Regarding the age of the group, ages were between 50 and 64 years old, with predominance of individuals aged from 50 to 60 years old. The majority of the elderly presented a low educational level (79.75%), coming from cities with less than 50,000 inhabitants of other states of Brazil (53.57%), who seek Teresina for treatment and follow-up of their health, shelter to receive food, nursing, social and spiritual assistance and, in some cases, family reintegration. Most used antiretroviral drugs since 10 to 20 years ago, with 7.15% using it for more than 30 years. The clinical manifestations detected were: Lung Cancer, Hepatitis B and C, depression, dermatitis, tuberculosis, neuropathy and leishmaniasis.</p><p id="Par5061"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5062">This study draws attention to the increase in the detection of HIV in men aged 50 years and over, especially those aged 60 years or older, inhabitants of cities of low demographic density in Brazil, with several clinical manifestations, low educational level, which makes difficult the access to preventive information on sexual health, and under the use of antiretrovirals, from more than ten years ago. The study points towards the need for more research on HIV infection among the elderly, to help to implement more effective public policies for this group.</p><p id="Par5063"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5064">1 Gorinchteyn J.

In this study we focus in two of the components present in the platform: stress management and interpersonal relationships. It is important to focus on stress while designing prevention programs for adolescents, given that literature has associated higher levels of stress with obesity in youth. Moreover, interpersonal relationships were also found to influence obesity-related behaviours. Online sessions were specifically created to address those issues on the mobile app. This digital content (videos and posters) should not only be appealing for the adolescent but also scientifically valid and correct.</p><p id="Par5072"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5073">The main aim of this study was to assess the scientific quality and adequacy of posters and videos created for the TeenPower mobile app, regarding stress management and interpersonal relationships.</p><p id="Par5074"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5075">Digital resources in video and poster format were created. Contents regarded stress management and interpersonal relationships. Videos were 2 minutes long and posters included infographics and written content with adequate language for adolescents. These resources were developed by students of health, sports and design, in collaboration with health-professionals and researchers. The sample included adolescents with the sociodemographic characteristics of the future users of the mobile app, and health-professionals working in this field.

Besides the growing of self-diagnosis and self-medication by consumers, these products are also often consumed without any control or medical supervision, during extended periods of time, due to the general misperception that natural indicates harmless. Despite its beneficial effects, excess intake of vitamin is not innocuous.

Activity monitors, such as accelerometers, provide objective assessment of free-living PA being the preferred assessment method in research settings. However, they are too expensive to be used in resource-constrained clinical settings. Several PA questionnaires have already been validated to the European Portuguese but some of them take too long to complete, hence unfeasible for use in clinical practice. Shorter PA assessment tools are, therefore, needed.</p><p id="Par5142"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5143">To explore the relationship between the Portuguese version of a short PA questionnaire, the Brief physical activity assessment tool (Brief-PA tool), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-sf), which is a valid and reliable PA assessment tool already tested in the Portuguese population. A secondary aim was to explore the test-retest reliability of the Brief-PA tool.</p><p id="Par5144"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5145">The Brief-PA tool [1] consists of 2 questions which assess the frequency and duration of moderate and vigorous PA undertaken in a ‘usual’ week. The total score is obtained by summing the results of the two questions (range 0-8). People with a score ≥ 4 are considered ‘sufficiently active’. Since the tool is not available in Portuguese, a linguistic adaptation was conducted using the forward- and back-translation method. Then, 86 healthy volunteers (49.5±18.1 years, age range 20-69; 53 female) completed the Brief-PA tool and the IPAQ-sf. A sub-sample (n=56, 43.1±18.1 years, 37 female) completed the Brief-PA tool one week later. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) was used to assess correlations between the Brief-PA total score with IPAQ-sf results (MET-min/week). Percentage of agreement (%agreement) and Cohen’s kappa were used to assess the agreement between categorical scores obtained from the two measures (i.e., ‘sufficiently’ and ‘insufficiently’ active) and test-retest reliability of the Brief-PA tool.</p><p id="Par5146"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5147">Significant correlations were found between the Brief-PA tool and the IPAQ-sf (ρ = 0.721, p &lt; 0.001).

The data were collected in the cafeteria and snack bar that served the largest number of meals. Only non-fractioned dishes were considered in this analysis. The nutritional impact of food waste was evaluated considering the nutritional requirements of a typical costumer of the food services - an average energy value of 2000 kcal and the percentages corresponding to the two evaluation moments of the day, corresponding to 55% of the Total Energy Value (TEV), 30% to lunch and 25% to dinner [3, 4].</p><p id="Par5177"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5178">It was produced 288.9 kg of food, being 40.3 kg of plate waste. The average amount of food served per meal was 329 g and an average of 50 g per meal was plate waste. It can be concluded that about 14% of the total food produced was discarded as plate waste, which represents around 123 meals. When evaluating the nutritional impact of food waste, it was observed that the average waste per person was 84 kcal, which represents about 15.3% of the energy value of meals. It was also observed that 2.4 g of lipids, 5.6 g of protein and 9.6 g of carbohydrates were wasted, per meal, which is the equivalent to about 13.1%, 20.4% and 14.0%, respectively, of the needs of the typical costumer of the food services.</p><p id="Par5179"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5180">Based on these results, we can observe a food waste impact of about 10% of the nutritional requirements of an individual, being imperative the reinforcement of periodic evaluation of consumption and plate waste in school meals, attending that food waste is a decisive factor in terms of energy and nutritional adequacy [5].

There are non-pharmacological techniques for pain control in obstetrics. There is, the Sterile Water Injection on the Michaelis Triangle which causes immediate pain relief in the lumbosacral region. Physiologically, sterile water doesn’t act as a local anaesthetic and doesn’t inhibit the fibres that report visceral pain; however, causes a release of the C fibres and A-delta fibres associated with somatic pain. Distilled water stimulates A-delta fibres and subjugates the visceral pain reported by the C fibres, which fails to notify visceral pain, modulating afferent patterns of pain. In this way, it silences the C fibres and releases endorphins. Based on this mechanism, an experimental study has been done applying the finger ischemic compression technique to the same region, in Brazil in 2014, to characterize the technique as a tool to pain control.</p><p id="Par5251"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5252">To compare the technique of sterile water injection with the experiment of finger ischemic compression in the lumbosacral.</p><p id="Par5253"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5254">A Comparative study between those techniques through a systematic review of literature based on the Clinical Practice Guide on Normal Childbirth Care, by the Basque Government, about sterile water injection and the finger ischemic compression technique (Nursing Residency Program in Obstetrics, in Brazil in 2015). This study compares the effect versus time duration of analgesia between them.</p><p id="Par5255"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5256">The analysis of 292 studies showed that the sterile water injection into the Michaelis triangle decreased lumbar pain during delivery by approximately 60%, and the effect remained for up to 2 hours. In the finger ischemic compression experiment, there was a pain level reduction by 66%, remaining for 4 hours. However, in both cases, patients referred an intense burning during application.</p><p id="Par5257"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5258">This study contributes to pain control in obstetrics, as the two methods lead to a significant reduction of the pain level. However, finger ischemic compression had a longer duration of analgesia, when compared to sterile water injection. The injection in obstetrics is already recommended as an effective method for pain control and there is a need for further research on the finger ischemic compression experiment, to also consolidate the technique as a method of pain management.</p><p id="Par5259"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par5260">Labor pain relief, Obstetrics, Giving birth, Non-pharmacological techniques, Analgesia.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1340"><title>P158 Microencapsulation of phytosterols and/or other bioactive ingredients for minimizing cardiovascular risk</title><sec id="Sec1341"><title>Pedro Vieira<sup>1</sup>, Isabel Andrade<sup>2</sup>, Rui Cruz<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1342"><title><sup>1</sup>Pharmacy Department, Coimbra Health School, Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, 3046-854 Coimbra, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Complementary Sciences Department, Coimbra Health School, Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, 3046-854 Coimbra, Portugal</title><sec id="Sec1343"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Pedro Vieira (pedromdvieira96@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par5261"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5262">Several bioactive ingredients such as phytosterols, resveratrol, curcumin and catechin have shown efficacy in the prevention of chronic diseases, namely in cardiovascular diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the world. Besides all the potentialities, many of these bioactive ingredients present the disadvantage of instability and sensitivity to environmental factors (e.g. light and oxygen) and are also characterized by low water solubility due to its lipophilicity. Microencapsulation of bioactive compounds emerges as a strategy to improve their stability, avoiding adverse conditions and promoting their bioavailability. It includes a set of several techniques that allows the coating of these ingredients through a protective film, to guarantee its protection and to modulate its release at the target cells. Many techniques of microencapsulation and different materials can be used, the choice depends on the intended application, particle size, the release mechanism and on the physicochemical properties of both active material to be encapsulated and encapsulating agent.</p><p id="Par5263"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5264">To review the available research in this field of expertise.</p><p id="Par5265"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5266">A research was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and Elsevier databases, in Portuguese, English or Spanish languages over the last 10 years, and using as keywords Microencapsulation; bioactive compounds; phytosterols; cardiovascular risk.</p><p id="Par5267"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5268">The search retrieved 10 studies.

The research also revealed a wide range of materials that can be used, while the choice of method must take into account several factors such as its cost and necessary equipment, as well as the quality of the microcapsules formed. The microencapsulation process has a wide range of advantages, namely the ability to increase gastrointestinal absorption of the bioactive compounds encapsulated, and in addition, while the conversion of those compounds into the powder form is enhanced, their stability increases and their handling is facilitated.</p><p id="Par5269"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5270">The use of microencapsulation avoids some undesirable characteristics, proving to be an alternative to increase the bioavailability of the bioactive compounds.

Based on the identified specifications, it was defined the corresponding criteria, which must be evaluated and weighted regarding their relative importance to each of the other criteria. These weights were summed for each criterion. As experts from different areas were involved, it was decided that each expert group should weigh, considering their experience.

The involvement of men in this period is associated with their own psychological well-being as well as the whole household [3]. This is a transition with implications for the couple, for the father/child relationship, and child development [4]. Contemporary fatherhood emphasizes the involvement of men and greater affective contact with their children, in addition to their traditional role as a financial provider [5].</p><p id="Par5301"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5302">This study sought to understand the experiences of men as they transition to fatherhood during the prenatal period, aiming to contribute to a complete assistance to the family and improving the health gains of the family.</p><p id="Par5303"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5304">Qualitative research paradigm. Exploratory, descriptive, cross-sectional and retrospective study, with the participation of 10 men experiencing, for the first time, the pregnancy of their partners, in the last trimester, in a common-law marriage and with gestation without maternal-foetal pathology. Data collection was performed using the semi-structured interview. The data was analysed with the content analysis technique, with semantic categorization and an inductive approach.</p><p id="Par5305"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5306">Through content analysis three themes emerged, “experiencing transition”, “development of father identity” and “(de)construct bridges to transition.” The results revealed a male experience of pregnancy characterized by an enormous psychic and emotional depth. Men accept and try to actively engage in the pregnancy process and experience a panoply of positive and negative feelings and emotions, sometimes ambivalent. The prenatal period triggers the development of paternal identity. During this process, expectant fathers revaluate their personal values, reflect on their own fathering experiences and reshape their view of the world and themselves. Despite their proactive role in the fatherhood journey, they find obstacles and not bridges to their transition. The fact that they feel peripheral in prenatal care services makes it more difficult to embrace fatherhood and may compromise overcoming the transition process.</p><p id="Par5307"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5308">This study provided insight on the complex nature of this developmental transition and showed fragile environments in the approach of the expectant fathers to the prenatal care services.

The current therapy for DLBCL is the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP). R-CHOP-14 and R-CHOP-21 are two subtypes of R-CHOP, which differ in their treatment, like CHOP-14 that has better results within high dosage in advanced stages, while CHOP-21 has better efficiency and better overall survival in elderly patients. These treatments have increased the survival of patients, though about 40% of patients there is still a failure rate of treatment.

Concerning elderly patients (&gt; 80 years), the addition of rituximab, namely, a reduced dose R-CHOP provides a good compromise between toxicity and the efficiency of overall survival. The survival of patients with DLBCL with more than 66 years has improved substantially since the introduction of rituximab.

Family caregivers of these patients usually are overloaded with caring activities [2], being more vulnerable to psychological disturbance and burden due to the care provided [3].</p><p id="Par5392"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5393">To characterize the care provided; access the burden experienced by informal caregivers of mental health patients and identify its determinants.</p><p id="Par5394"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5395">Cross-sectional correlational study, with a non-probabilistic sample of 113 Portuguese relatives and caregivers of mental health patients. Data were collect in the first semester of 2015. Caregivers were interviewed about sociodemographics, type of care (wholly compensatory, partially compensatory, supervision), time spent in self-care daily activities and its intensity (0-7) and with the Portuguese version of the Zarit Burden Interview [4]. Ethical procedures, according to Helsinki Declaration, were taken into account.</p><p id="Par5396"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5397">Caregivers were mainly females (n=80), with a median age of 51 years, married (n=84), with 12 years of education (n=33) and patients-mothers (n=20). These patients had majorly depressive disorders (36.3%). Caregivers cared for their relatives from 0 up to 54 years (Median=3.25; Mean=7.86; SD=10.78). Most of them (42.5%) corresponded to someone who provided care occasionally. Nevertheless, they provided a wholly compensatory care in most areas of patient self-care daily activities (Mean=26.58; SD=31.20). Preparing and providing meals (Mean=3.54; SD=3.29), Organizing medication (Mean=3.57; SD=3.16) and its administration (Mean=3.30; SD=3.29) was the most frequent self-care provided. Intensity of wholly compensatory care provided was higher in female (t=-2.950; p=0.004) older (r=0.215; p=0.022) relatives, who took full responsibility for caring (p&lt;0.001), living with the patient (t=-2.762; p=0.007). Most caregivers revealed no burden (62.8%; Mean=38.31; SD=22.54). Burden was higher in females (t=-2.869; p=0.005), older (r=0.259; p=0.006) and among primary or secondary caregivers (p&lt;0.001). Impact of giving care, interpersonal relations and perceptions of self-efficacy were also higher in older females with lower education relatives, primary caregivers and caregivers that perspective gravity of their relative illness higher.</p><p id="Par5398"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5399">The caregivers inquired were mainly secondary and provided total care in all areas. The burden presented by those was low, and they provided care especially in preparing meals and organizing and administering medicines. In this sample, care provided and burden were higher in older female caregivers, low educated and with a high perspective of gravity of their relative illness. Intervention among these caregivers is needed, promoting knowledge, improving skills and providing support, which can allow to reduce the psychological consequences of the needed assistance by the relatives.</p><p id="Par5400"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5401">1.

It is based on scientific evidences of health promotion, on which the need to refocus the action on the results implies the development of appropriate interventions [1, 2]. It is a multi-regional project outlined in the national strategy of smart specialization, in a partnership between IPSantarém – ESSS and ESGT, IPLeiria – ESSL e IPViseu – ESSV, the Agupamento de Escolas da Chamusca, the Agrupamento de Escolas da Golegã and ACES Lezíria – UCC Chamusca/Golegã.

This Program was developed by the social responsibility of the Viseu city council and is very important among the community, to promote physical activity in the population. Elders were randomly assigned to Experimental (n=10) and Control (n=10) groups. During this study all individuals maintained the physical activity training of the “Atividade Sénior” Program, where the experimental group had a training with aerobic, flexibility and strength components, associated with stimulation. The exercise program lasted 12 weeks with a frequency of 3 times a week, with each session lasting 30 minutes. The study was pre and post-tested, with the following scales: Timed Up and Go (TUG), to check the functional capacity [3] and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to check pain level [4], with the use of body chart for identifying the site of pain. The study was submitted to the International Ethics Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p id="Par5430"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5431">In the study population, 80% of the elderly indicated some type of back pain. Of these, 50% indicated that the pain is chronic and 81.2% indicated that the main location is low back pain. At the beginning of the study participants had a mean pain according to the VAS of 5.70; the experimental group with a mean pain score of 7.10 and the control group with an average of 4.30. After 12 weeks, the participants presented a reduction in pain level (3.78), the experimental group with a significant reduction to 3.38 (p= 0.034), and the control group also with a reduction to 3.70 (p= 0.529). Regarding the functionality, according to the TUG, the experimental group obtained the mean initial time of 21.10 +10.06 and the final time of 16.32 ± 7.80 (p= 0.043), compared to the control group (p= 0.436).</p><p id="Par5432"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5433">The implemented program demonstrated that physical exercise in general allows global improvements in the elderly population of day centres, and the specific implementation of a functional mobility physiotherapy program has allowed significant results.

The validated PES scale for the Portuguese population is adequate to evaluate the conditions for nursing practice, and it was validated in Portugal in hospital settings but not in primary health care. This study proposes to make content validation for primary health care and its psychometric validation, having obtained previous authorization of the author for this validation.</p><p id="Par5447"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5448">Validation of the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) for Primary Health Care.</p><p id="Par5449"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5450">The original scale was submitted to a panel of 5 experts. We decided to keep items with levels of agreement greater than 75%, after analysing and after making the changes suggested, we submitted the scale to a second round by the same panel of experts. The new version was used to determine its psychometric characteristics and its revalidation.</p><p id="Par5451"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5452">The PES version adapted for primary health care presents a Cronbach value of 0.905, meaning a very good internal consistency, with reasonable correlation values for each item with the total of the scale (0.315-0.685). In the analysis through the matrix of main components, only factorial loads above 0.30 were considered, so it was necessary to regroup the items by factors, other than the original scale. Considering the KMO value of 0.797, which indicates that there is a good correlation between the variables, and with a Bartlett test (1407.494, p &lt; 0.001), we could infer that the variables are significantly correlated and consequently we can confirm the validity of the adapted scale. Between the original scale and the one obtained, we identified factors that focus on the same areas, but there was a change in the items that make up these factors. These changes are expected and show greater adequacy regarding the differences between primary and hospital health care. There are differences regarding the items that portray the nurse's functions, which is in line with the evidence that shows that the community context is generally more favourable for nurses to perform autonomous functions.</p><p id="Par5453"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5454">It is considered essential to use valid instruments to evaluate the characteristics of the nursing practice environment in Primary Health Care, since it is the first “door” to access to health services, with nurses having a central role in this context.</p><p id="Par5455"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par5456">Public Health Nursing, Continuous quality management, Validation studies.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1391"><title>P171 Elaboration of an IAP prevention clinical practice guideline using the ADAPTE methodology</title><sec id="Sec1392"><title>Ana Sousa<sup>1,2,3</sup>, Cândita Ferrito<sup>4</sup>, José A Paiva<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1393"><title><sup>1</sup>Universidade Católica Portuguesa, 4169-005 Porto, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Centro Hospitalar S.

We evaluated the document regarding its quality through the application of the AGREE II instrument and its clarity, content and applicability through the presentation of the CPG draft and the application of a questionnaire to all its users in three ICUs. These results were processed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences system.</p><p id="Par5463"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5464">After assessment of evidence grade, applicability and acceptability, we included in the CPG eight recommendations: avoid endotracheal intubation; daily sedation assessment and reduction; daily ventilator weaning; change ventilator circuit only when visibly soiled; head of bed elevation of 30-45º; early exercise and patient mobilization; maintenance of endotracheal tube cuff pressure between 20-30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; oral hygiene care with chlorhexidine 0.12% or 0.20% [5-9]. Regarding the application of the AGREE II, the CPG obtained a rating of 7 in all domains, which corresponds to a high quality. The questionnaire obtained a total of 82 responses, which corresponds to a rate of 45.6% of the respondents. All of the health care professionals stated that CPG’s objective is clear, relevant and agree with the content and the adequacy of the recommendations. Regarding applicability, 89% of the respondents stated that is applicable.</p><p id="Par5465"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5466">There is a lack of systematization and adequacy concerning CPG’s elaboration. This methodology allowed us to find the most recent recommendations regarding IAP prevention and adapt to a specific scenario successfully according to quality and user’s evaluation. We can find a limitation of the study in the fact that the evidence supporting some of the recommendations included in the CPG is moderate, and there is a shortage of experimental studies that assess the impact of implementing each individual recommendation.

Concerning their reliability, in the validation study for the Portuguese population in 2005 (n=236) was obtained an Alfa of Cronbach of 0.88 and in a recent study in 2011(n=308) of 0.93 [1].</p><p id="Par5481"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5482">To determine a scale factorial structure and its psychometric properties.</p><p id="Par5483"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5484">Methodological study.

Data analyses - The correlation matrix of the items was evaluated through exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis. The factorial load as well as the internal consistency estimated the dimensionality.</p><p id="Par5485"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5486">In the reliability analysis with 21 items was found an Alfa of Cronbach of 0.89, all communalities &gt;0.40, KMO=0.88 (p&lt;0.001) and 58.42% of explained variance by 5 factors. When extracted item 18 (item-total correlation 0.16), all items assumed an item-total correlation &gt; 0.20; alpha increased (α=0.90) and KMO increased to 0.88 maintaining the stability of the Bartlett test; communalities maintained above 0.40; total variance explained by the 5 factors increased to 60.4%, but 5 factors diverged from theoretical matrix and 10 items weighed in more than one factor. Through confirmatory analysis (excluding item 18) forcing for the 2 original scale factors, we verified that 4 items had commonalities &lt;0.30. The total variance explained after the spin fell to 43.11% and 4 items weighed in more than one factor. We explored with 3 factors, KMO maintained in 0.88, Bartlett test remained within criteria, total variance explained after de rotation stayed 49.6%. Although this structure presents 3 items weigh in more than one factor, justifies its maintenance by underlying the theoretical model. Alpha is higher to initial (α=0.90). The extraction of any item will weaken scale consistency. The most stable structure was with 3 renamed factors: 1- Personal satisfaction and self-care (8 items) (38.5% explained variance); Social Family situation (8 items) (7.4%); 3- Socio professional and economic situation (4 items) (6.5%). The fidelity of the scale is reinforced by the internal consistency of its subscales, factor 1 α=0.85; factor 2 α=0.79; factor 3 α=0.72 and by the correlation between them (0.51-0.67; p&lt;0.01).</p><p id="Par5487"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5488">Good internal consistency.

In the year 2016 and until June 30, 2017, 1,030 new cases of HIV infection were reported, corresponding mostly (99.7%) to individuals aged ≥ 15 years. Portugal has had the highest rates of new cases of HIV and AIDS infection in the European Union [2]. We found that it is not possible to stop the HIV epidemic only with medical interventions. It is vital to address in everyday life the underlying social issues that prevent people from accessing interventions for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infection, including unequal human rights, stigma and discrimination. When a person is stigmatized or unable to access services as a result of discrimination, the health of the entire community is threatened and epidemic HIV transmission continues to expand rather than to contract [3].</p><p id="Par5524"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5525">To understand how people live with HIV/AIDS, everyday life in an island space.</p><p id="Par5526"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5527">Qualitative study, grounded theory [4], in-depth interviews were carried out, in a convenience sample, to seropositive adults of any sexual orientation who wished to talk about their experience.

The strategies used and suggested will give subsidies to the health system and nursing professionals towards the design of new programs that will enable each patient to respond to their individual needs with the resources that each one has.</p><p id="Par5532"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5533">1.

Teaching has been ranked as one of the most stressful profession and its nature is applicable to all professional teaching roles. Several research reports have consistently documented physical and psychological symptoms experienced by teaching professionals. Several physical complains and psychosomatic symptoms such as lower back pain, headache, voice disorders and anxiety are frequently faced by teaching professionals, both in secondary and higher education, especially in women [1-5]. Presence of psychopathology symptoms in teachers are related to their rating of children mental health behaviors [6], as well as determinants to professional burnout. Therefore, identification of psychological symptoms among teachers is relevant in secondary and higher education.</p><p id="Par5578"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5579">To identify the prevalence of self-reported psychological symptoms; Characterize the symptoms by its dimension and determine the differences in psychological symptoms between high school teachers and higher education professors.</p><p id="Par5580"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5581">Cross-sectional correlational study, with a non-probabilistic sample of 96 Portuguese teaching professionals.

Professors (37.5%) were from different fields, including health, engineering, arts, communication, social sciences, marketing and sports. High school teachers (62.5%) were mainly from sociology, philosophy and mathematics. The most scored dimension was Obsession-Compulsion in high school teachers (Mean=1.03; SD=0.75). Globally high school teachers revealed more symptoms of distress than higher education professors. Significant differences between groups were found in Somatization, Obsession-Compulsion, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Phobic Anxiety, Psychoticism, GSI and PST (p &lt; 0.05). In the 53 BSI items, the PST was low (Mean=19.09; SD=12.70).</p><p id="Par5584"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5585">Prevalence of symptoms were high in the samples of teaching professionals, although they experienced psychological distress in low intensity. Differences between high school teachers and higher education professors were highlighted in this study. Therefore, there is a need for intervention among high school teachers to minimize the impact of detecting mental disorders in students, as well as preventing professional absents and burn-out.</p><p id="Par5586"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5587">1.

For this reason, patients must be adequately informed about their health status and about the medicines they are using. One of the most important resources of medicines information, available for patients, is the information leaflet. It provides a set of understandable information and should contribute to the appropriate and safe use of information, complementing the information given by health professionals.

The de-escalation technique prevents the escalation of aggressiveness, allows a relationship of trust to be established by demonstrating understanding of the client’s problems and concerns [1]. The same authors performed the psychometric validation of the English modified De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale (EMDABS). This scale aims to evaluate the education/training and de-escalation skills of health professionals, based on seven items: “valuing the client; reducing fear; inquiring about client’s queries and anxiety; providing guidance to the client; working out possible agreements; remaining calm; risky”.

The new model care reorganized and changed work contexts and human resources. The new organizational paradigm requires adaptation of the professionals to this new reality. In any situation of change people reacts with resistance in greater or lesser intensity. Also changes in organizations can create resistances that can manifest themselves with absenteeism. In health organizations the absenteeism of nurses constitutes a complex problem and needs to be valued and monitored by nursing managers [1].</p><p id="Par5708"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5709">To identify the presence and causes of absenteeism and analyse the relationship between absenteeism and demographic and professional variables.</p><p id="Par5710"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5711">Quantitative, exploratory and cross study was used as methodology. A sociodemographic/professional questionnaire and questions related to absenteeism were used for the collection of data. The sample was composed by 109 nurses working at primary health care units of northern Portugal. The sample was composed by 77.1% of females, 54.1% aged more than 36 years, 72.5% married, 82.6% working on fixed schedules, 51.4% with nearly 14 years of job experience (varied between 7 and 33 years), and 81.7% considered their job as stressful.</p><p id="Par5712"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5713">Of all nurses, 66% admitted to having been absent from service in the last year: 28.4% due to their own illness and 16.5% due to their relatives’ illness. Statistically, there were found significant differences in the association between the variables of to have children (p = 0.007), place of work (p = 0.045) and absenteeism. We also found that nurses with children and those who work in Health Family Units are the ones that are absent from work most frequently.</p><p id="Par5714"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5715">We believe that the results can induce the development, implementation and evaluation of preventive measures, aiming at the promotion and protection of nurses' health.

The assessment and intervention of a family with psychosocial problems requires the nursing team to use models that allow the design of care oriented both for data collection and for the planning of interventions in domiciliary context.</p><p id="Par5722"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5723">To analyse the care needs in a family with mental illness using the Dynamic Model of Family Assessment and Intervention (MDAIF).</p><p id="Par5724"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5725">The case study focused on the process of family intervention developed with a family in a domiciliary context in Primary Health Care, according to MDAIF. The following data collection instruments were applied: genogram, ecomap, FACES II, Graffar and Family Apgar Scales.</p><p id="Par5726"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5727">The family consists of a middle-aged couple, childless, lower middle class (grade IV, Graffar, 1956). The woman is the main care provider of her husband, with mental illness. They have an extensive network of community support, namely in Social Solidarity Institutions, Recreational Associations, the extended family and the Community Care Unit (health team). As a couple, they show good cohesion and adaptability facing everyday problems (Faces II Scale) and perceive their family as highly functional (score 10 - Apgar Scale), despite the perception of communicational difficulties and emotional expression. After the interventions of the nursing team, in the different dimensions of the MDAIF, gains were obtained in the knowledge and capacity of income management, heating system of the residential building, management and knowledge about the mental illness, communication and marital satisfaction and the role of caregiver. In this way, the caregiver has been trained in knowledge and skills in the field of care for the dependent person and with mental pathology, in order to maximize their health, as well as in the care and importance of the satisfaction of her own needs.</p><p id="Par5728"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5729">The valuation of caregiver perspectives is essential for the adjustment of the formal responses of the nursing team. Empowerment of family caregivers - as well as being able to express themselves and be an active element in the healthcare process, as well as the articulation of formal and informal responses constitute challenges for health professionals. The support provided by the health team to the caregiver and dependent patient has proved to be effective not only in improving family functioning but also in reducing stress, burnout and isolation of the caregiver.</p><p id="Par5730"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par5731">Caregiver, Family, Nursing, Primary health care.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1457"><title>P188 Elderly people, physical therapy services and human resources: current and future challenges</title><sec id="Sec1458"><title>Carla Leão<sup>1,2</sup> (carlaleao@sapo.pt)</title><sec id="Sec1459"><title><sup>1</sup>Escola Superior de Saúde, Universidade Atlântica, 2730-036 Barcarena, Portugal; <sup>2</sup>Instituto Português de Relações Internacionais, 1000-155 Lisboa, Portugal</title><p id="Par5732"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5733">The aging process implementation in Portugal, and the consequent increase in the number of elderly people is evident and constitutes an increasing process. Undeniably, the elderly people are the main users of health services and specifically physiotherapy services. The economic and financial crisis that affected Portugal, has imposed restrictions on the health system and specifically on the National Health Service (NHS) [1]. Considering this scenario, we have put as a guiding question: <italic>Are, in Portugal, physiotherapy health services and human resources included in the health system at NUTS III regional level, and essentially in the NHS, proportional to the number of elderly people and respond to their current and future needs?</italic> [NUTS III - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) with level III corresponding to the territorial division constituted by 30 regions, according to the division of 2013].</p><p id="Par5734"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5735">We aim to understand the current and future numbers of the elderly people at the regional level (NUTS III); to know the current number of physiotherapy services and human resources at the same regional level; to prospective the future physical therapy services and human resources, considering the health political trends related to services and human resources; and to assess if these services and human resources respond to the needs of the current and future elderly people.</p><p id="Par5736"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5737">For this purpose, we performed a statistical analysis at the regional level NUTS III, considering the indicators - number of elderly people and physical therapy services and human resources.

Despite the potential of this technique there are a few studies referring to subcutaneous tissue analysis with US. This allows the evaluation of altered tissues such as gynoid lipodystrophy, a very common alteration in female. the better the characterization, location, definition of the affected areas and the degree of severity of LDG, the greater the success of treatment. In this study US and densitometry was performed to evaluate the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue and the body mass composition, such as lean mass and fat mass.</p><p id="Par5748"><bold>Objective</bold></p><p id="Par5749">The aim was, by using two different images modality, to evaluate the subcutaneous tissue in normal weight and overweight, as well as the possible relation with the percentage of fat in women with cellulite.</p><p id="Par5750"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5751">The study was performed in 25 individuals aged between [18-60] years old.

We concluded that the percentage of fat measured by bone densitometry does not correlate with the thickness of subcutaneous tissue, with the percentage of fat being higher in overweight women but the thickness of subcutaneous tissue varies from woman to woman. The only possible relationship is between the bone mineral density and the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue of the right gluteus that leads to force that the greater the thickness the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the greater the bone mineral density, because although they are structurally different both respond to the stimuli of atrophy and hypertrophy.</p><p id="Par5756"><bold>Keywords</bold></p><p id="Par5757">Subcutaneous tissue, Ultrasound, Dexa.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="Misc"><title>Publisher’s Note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></notes></back></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Health Administration</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Health Informatics</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Medicine &amp; Public Health</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Nursing Research</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Public Health</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">BMC Health Services Research</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2018</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"/><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
