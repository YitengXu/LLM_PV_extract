However, up to now, the reported vesicular PTAs are generally self-assembled from small molecules like liposomes, and polymer vesicles have seldom been used as PTAs due to the unsatisfactory photothermal conversion efficiency resulting from the irregular packing of chromophores in the vesicle membranes. Here we report a nano-sized polymer vesicle from hyperbranched polyporphyrins with favorable photothermal stability and extraordinarily high photothermal efficiency (44.1%), showing great potential in imaging-guided PTT for tumors through in vitro and in vivo experiments. These excellent properties are attributed to the in situ supramolecular polymerization of porphyrin units inside the vesicle membrane into well-organized 1D monofilaments driven by π–π stacking. We believe the supramolecular polymerization-enhanced self-assembly process reported here will shed a new light on the design of supramolecular materials with new structures and functions.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Photothermal therapy (PTT) has recently emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy.

Up to now, both inorganic and organic nanomaterials have been used as PTAs for PTT studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Organic PTAs can be divided into two categories in view of the structure: one is solid organic PTAs such as carbon nanomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, conducting polymer nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, black phosphorus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, nanodots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and so on, the other ones are hollow organic PTAs like vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Among them, vesicular PTAs have received considerable attention due to their superior light-harvesting ability resulting from multiple reflections of incident light in hollow compartments of vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and prominent versatility by trapping hydrophilic functional units in their hollow cavities as well as hydrophobic units in the membrane. Zheng et al. are pioneered in the vesicular PTAs self-assembled from porphyrin lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, up to now, most of the vesicular PTAs are limited to liposomes. The stability of liposomes is not good enough and should be enhanced by the addition of cholesterol or else for further application in PTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, it is highly challenging to develop vesicular PTAs with both stable structure and high photothermal conversion ability.</p><p id="Par4">Polymer vesicles feature not only hollow lumens but also stable and designable membranes. Thus polymer vesicles should be very potential in PTT application. However, to our great surprise, hitherto, it is still very rare to use polymer vesicles as PTAs. The main challenge lies in the poor photothermal conversion efficiency for polymer vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Generally, the membrane fluidity of liposomes is much higher than that of polymer vesicles. Thus, the chromophores inside liposomes can move freely to reach a well-organized π–π stacking state, which leads to a high conversion of harvested light into heat energy. On the contrary, the polymer vesicles are too tough to realize the desirable organization of chromophores, and thus result in a lower photothermal conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To meet the challenge, herein, we develop a novel polymer vesicle with both favorable stability and high photothermal conversion efficiency. In recent years, our groups have reported a serious of polymer vesicles with controlled size from the self-assembly of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Most importantly, the HBP vesicles show combined advantages of block copolymer vesicles and liposomes; for example, they have robust membrane structures like traditional block copolymer vesicles and excellent membrane fluidity like liposomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the present work, we prepare a nano-sized polymer vesicle from the self-assembly of a hyperbranched polyporphyrin. Porphyrins are chosen as model molecules owing to their unique large π conjugated structure and excellent light-harvesting ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Due to the inherent good fluidity of the HBP vesicles, the porphyrin units inside the vesicle membranes can tune the conformation in a well-organized way through directional π–π stacking. As a result, abundant one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular polymers consisting of linearly staked porphyrin units, like polyporphyrin nanofilaments, are formed inside the vesicle membranes. The vesicles enhanced by supramolecular polyporphyrins inside show unexpectedly high photothermal conversion effect of 44.1% in vitro and satisfactory physiological and photothermal stability. To our knowledge, it is the first report on the vesicles generated through the combination of covalent polymer self-assembly and supramolecular polymerization. Thus we define it as a “supramolecular polymerization-enhanced self-assembly” (SPESA) process. Moreover, the obtained hyperbranched polyporphyrin nanovesicles present excellent biocompatibility and PTT efficiency at the cell level and in vivo. Besides, the vesicles can be facilely functionalized through the encapsulation of functional molecules such as Rhodamine b (Rb) and Cy 7.5, which endow the vesicles with fluorescence monitoring and imaging-guided properties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and characterization of THPG polymer vesicles</title><p id="Par6">We firstly synthesized a new amphiphilic hyperbranched polyporphyrin. To date, the reports on hyperbranched multi-porphyrin polymers are somewhat limited because of the challenge in synthesis. Previously, Frechet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> prepared a hyperbranched polyporphyrin through an A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>3</sub> proton-transfer polymerization. Inspired by them, herein we employed an anion-initiated A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>4</sub> ring-opening polymerization method to prepare amphiphilic hyperbranched polyporphyrins named as THPG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) by using di-epoxy ether as an A<sub>2</sub> monomer and meso-tetrakis (4-hydroxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTHPP) as a B<sub>4</sub> monomer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). It should be noted that a very slow adding of the ZnTHPP to di-epoxy ether solution and keeping low solid content is crucial to avoid gelation during the polymerization. As shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>,  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, the structures of ZnTHPP and THPG polymers were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectra. The as-prepared polymers have a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 6.4 kDa and molecular weight distribution of 1.8 from the GPC test by using THF as the eluent (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). We also synthesized other THPGs with the feeding ratio between di-epoxy ether and ZnTHPP of 1:1. As expected, the obtained THPG<sub>11</sub> polymers have more unreacted phenolic hydroxyl groups according to the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>A schematic diagram of hyperbranched polyporphyrin vesicles for photothermal therapy.</title><p>Nano-sized polymer vesicles from the self-assembly of hyperbranched polyporphyrins show effective photothermal killing of tumors in vivo.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2020_15427_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">The self-assembly of THPGs was induced by dropwise adding the selective solvent of ultrapure H<sub>2</sub>O into the polymer/dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, followed by dialysis against deionized water to remove DMSO. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement shows that the supramolecular aggregates of THPGs are spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 127 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), which is smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter of 176 nm acquired from the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). It is probably due to the shrinkage of the aggregates during the drying process in the SEM measurements. Fortunately, some of the nanoparticles were broken to show the hollow lumens, which indicates the particles are polymer vesicles rather than spherical micelles (inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The hollow vesicular structure was also proved by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements according to the broken particles featured with bright openings (light green circles in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The scanning TEM (STEM) measurements of a typically broken particle provided further evidence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Nitrogen and zinc elements derived from ZnTHPP units in the particle are not abundant, and the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>) show the typical vesicular skin/pool structure. While the oxygen and carbon elements are more abundant, and the hollow lumen of the vesicle from the broken opening can be seen clearly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f, g</xref>). Thus, THPG vesicles were formed confessedly according to these characterizations. Moreover, the average wall thickness of the vesicles measured from the SEM images is ca. 21 nm. This value is much larger than one bilayer thickness (ca. 3 nm), indicating THPG vesicles should have a multi-lamellar structure. The vesicle wall thickness is about 23 nm according to the Bragg equation of <italic>d</italic> = 2<italic>π</italic> <italic>q</italic><sup>−1</sup> determined by the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which agrees well with the SEM results. The self-assembly of THPG<sub>11</sub> also generated spherical vesicles according to the TEM image (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). However, the vesicle size is around 500 nm and is much larger than that of THPG vesicles. It is because more epoxy ether units in THPGs afford higher hydrophilicity compared with THPGs<sub>11</sub>, leading to a smaller vesicle size.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Characterizations of THPG vesicles.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The representative SEM image of THPG vesicles.

Considering the amphiphilic nature of THPGs, long-range hydrophobic interactions should play a significant role in the vesicle formation. Besides, the π–π stacking interaction is also important for the self-assembly process. As showed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>, the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectrum of THPG unimers in tetrahydrofuran (THF, a good solvent) exhibits two strong absorption regions assigned to B band (425 nm) and Q band (from 545 to 626 nm) of porphyrins. However, the absorption peak of THPG vesicles in water was significantly broadened, the B band markedly red-shifted to 463 nm, and the Q band extended to longer wavelength ranging from 560 to 650 nm. It is very rare to observe such a large redshift for most of the porphyrin self-assemblies, which suggests the formation of strong J-aggregates due to the π–π stacking among porphyrins in THPG vesicles. Besides, we also used 5% Triton X-100 as an aqueous detergent solvent for THPG vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. As a result, the J-aggregate peak in 463 nm disappeared and the peaks of THPG unimers appeared again in UV–Vis spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>), indicating the importance of π–π stacking for keeping the vesicle structure. In addition, it also suggests that there is only the supramolecular interaction in the THPG vesicles without chemical cross-linking, and vesicles can disassemble into unimers in the presence of Triton X-100 aqueous detergents.</p><p id="Par9">The molecular arrangement mode in the membrane of THPG vesicles was also carefully studied. A typical broken vesicle was selected for high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and the marked black nanofilaments and white stripes were observed from the enlarged HR-TEM images of the cross-section of the vesicle membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). Considering the electron density difference, the black nanofilaments should result from the supramolecular polymerization of hydrophobic porphyrin units through π–π interaction, while the white stripes should derive from hydrophilic di-epoxy ether moieties. The orientation arrangement of the nanofilaments in the vesicles was further proved by two evident diffraction points shown in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) image (Inset in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) deduced from the selected small yellow square area in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. The average width of the black nanofilaments was measured to be ca. 9.3 Å from the HR-TEM images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Meanwhile, a peak in 9.2° with a corresponding d-space of 9.5 Å was observed from the XRD spectrum of THPG vesicles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>), which agrees well with HR-TEM observation to support the formation of well-organized porphyrin nanofilaments in the vesicles.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Proposed membrane structure of THPG vesicles.</title><p>A representative HR-TEM image (<bold>a</bold>) and the magnified ones (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold>) of a single broken THPG vesicle.

However, this thickness is a little bit smaller than the width of the ZnTHPP molecules (1.08 nm in length of side and 1.56 nm in diagonal length from a 3D molecular structure in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>). Thus, it is not possible for ZnTHPP molecules to pack in the form of H aggregates (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>). On the contrary, there should be some inclined arrangement with a tilt angle among ZnTHPP units in the nanofilaments as shown Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10c</xref>, supporting the J-aggregation process. As further evidence, the synchrotron SAXS measurement (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) shows two sharp peaks at <italic>q</italic> = 1.72 and 1.56 Å<sup>−1</sup> in the spectrum, which can be attributed to the π–π stacking between adjacent porphyrin units with corresponding distances of 3.6 and 4.0 Å according to Bragg equation, respectively. The distance of 3.6 Å is generally assigned to a typical face to face paralleled arrangement among porphyrins, while the distance 4.0 Å should originate from the non-paralleled porphyrin pairs with a certain angle of tilt. Moreover, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of THPG vesicles in solid state shows weak chiral signal (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>), which also suggests the porphyrins should be supra-polymerized into nanofilaments in the vesicles with a slight spiral twist structure.</p><p id="Par11">A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was further carried out to prove the self-assembly mechanism. Here we constructed a simplified model of THPG molecule with one porphyrin linked four arms (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), and put nine of them in a water box sized 8.0 × 8.0 × 8.0 nm<sup>3</sup>. The self-assembly structure in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> shows that porphyrin moieties are apt to ordered arrangement through π–π stacking. Moreover, the porphyrin moieties took a certain spiral arrangement with a tilt angle in chain direction, and the intermolecular distance between two porphyrin units was measured to be 3.6 Å for parallel arrangement and 4.5 Å for titled arrangement. The simulation results support the experimental data well, and the average energy of each porphyrin pairs due to the π–π stacking was calculated to be ca. 29.7 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup>, which is comparable with that of other porphyrin aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Combining all these experimental and simulation results, the self-assembly of THPG vesicles can be summarized as follows. THPGs first self-assembled into vesicles with membrane thickness ca. 23 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, g</xref>) in water driven by hydrophobic interactions. Such a covalent polymer self-assembly process triggered the close aggregation of intra- or inter-molecular porphyrin groups, which prompted the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrin groups into nanofilaments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) with a little helical J-aggregation driven by π–π stacking interactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). The average width of porphyrin nanofilaments is ca. 9.5 Å. Thus, the THPG vesicles are greatly enhanced by the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrin units inside the membranes. To our knowledge, such a unique vesicle structure induced by the synergistic covalent and noncovalent polymer self-assembly process has not been reported so far.</p><p id="Par13">The photoluminescence performance of THPG vesicles was studied as well. THPG polymers showed strong fluorescence in THF, however, it decayed gradually with the addition of water until totally quenched in pure water (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). As mentioned above, the addition of water into the THPG/THF solution triggered the self-assembly of THPG vesicles. As a result, the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrin moieties driven by π–π stacking interactions happened to form nanofilaments inside the vesicles, leading to the strong fluorescence self-quenching. As further evidence, the fluorescence showed a significant recovery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) with the addition of 5% Triton X-100 as aqueous detergents into THPG vesicles, which was induced by the disassembly of vesicles into unimers due to the disruption of π–π stacking inside the vesicles. The self-quenching ratio reached up to ca. 1100, which is higher than the value of most porphyrin assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Generally, dyes with strong self-quenching are able to produce good photothermal conversion as proposed by Zheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and thus THPG vesicles might be promising as efficient PTAs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Photothermal efficiency and stability of THPG vesicles.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Fluorescence spectra of THPGs in various THF/water solutions and 5% Triton X-100 detergent solution. <bold>b</bold> Solutions of PBS, 0.3 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> THPG micelles and 0.3 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> THPG vesicles irradiated with 635 nm laser (200 mW cm<sup>2</sup>) and imaged with a thermal camera. <bold>c</bold> Linear fitting curve of the cooling time of THPG vesicles as a function of negative logarithm of temperatures (<italic>τ</italic><sub>s</sub> is the time constant of the sample system). <bold>d</bold> Photothermal stability evaluation of THPG vesicles exposed under 635 nm laser (200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>) in water.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2020_15427_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">To verify the photothermal property of THPG vesicles, the temperature changes of aqueous vesicle solution (0.3 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) irradiated under 635 nm laser were recorded by an infrared (IR) thermal mapping apparatus, and PBS solution was served as the control. As expected, a rapid temperature rise from 24.1 °C to 46.8 °C was observed for the THPG vesicle solution even at a very low laser power density of 200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, while the temperature of PBS solution only rose slightly to 26.3 °C under the same laser exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). It indicates the generating heat mainly results from the light-harvesting of THPG vesicles and subsequent conversion to thermal energy, but not from the laser itself. An average thermal equilibration time constant (<italic>τ</italic>) related to radiative heat transfer was calculated to be 80.3 s according to the fitting curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. Based on this value, the photothermal conversion efficiency of THPG vesicles was calculated to be 44.1% by combining the Eqs. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>–<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref> (shown in the methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. It is higher than most of the organic photothermal agents reported in literatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. THPG vesicles also show excellent photothermal stability. The equilibrium temperature of THPG vesicles remained about 46.1 °C after three heating and cooling cycles under 635 nm laser (200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>), and there was only a negligible drop compared with the initial temperature of 46.8 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">To our knowledge, THPG vesicles represent the first polymer vesicles with such excellent photothermal properties, which should be owing to their unique self-assembled structures. The good membrane fluidity of hyperbranched polymer vesicles facilitates the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrin moieties inside the vesicles into ordered nanofilament structure, which greatly enhances the photothermal property of vesicles. As a control experiment, spherical micelles were prepared by using a fast precipitation method from the same THPG polymers, as shown in the TEM image (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>). Under the same laser irradiation, the equilibrium temperature of 0.3 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> THPG micelles solution only reached 42.5 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), which is lower than that of 0.3 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> THPG vesicle solution. Besides, the relatively lower fluorescence self-quenching ratio of THPG micelles ca. 720 than that of THPG vesicles (1100) suggests the less ordered π–π stacking of porphyrin units in the micelles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13b</xref>). These results demonstrated that the vesicular structure and the ordered nanofilaments inside vesicle membranes formed by supramolecular polymerization of porphyrin units both contribute to the outstanding photothermal property of THPG vesicles. We also used the 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as the photosensitizer to evaluate the photodynamic effect of THPG vesicles by monitoring the generated singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) under the laser irradiation at 635 nm (200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The photodynamic ability of THPG vesicles was significantly inhibited due to the strong π–π stacking between porphyrins in the vesicles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14a</xref>), and it was significantly recovered (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14b</xref>) when the THPG vesicles were disassembled into polymers.</p><p id="Par16">The stability of nanovesicles in a physiological environment with albumin was evaluated by the absorption intensity ratio between J-aggregates (463 nm) of THPG vesicles and the THPG unimers (425 nm) throughout 48 h (<italic>n</italic> = 3, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As a result, the ratio shows only slight change both in PBS and PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which suggests the high optical stability of THPG vesicles in a physiological environment. Such superior stability should be attributed to several aspects, including the strong π–π stacking interaction between porphyrins in ordered nanofilaments inside vesicle membranes, multi-layer membrane structure, and hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic units.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>In vitro cell experiments</title><p id="Par17">The potential cytotoxicity of THPG vesicles in vitro was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay against NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.

The flow cytometry analysis of MCF-7 cells incubated by free Rb (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>) shows the uptake of THPG-Rb vesicles is much easier than that of free Rb. The 3D CLSM image indicated the internalized vesicles were mainly located in the cytoplasm rather than the nuclei of the MCF-7 cell after 2 h incubation with THPG-Rb vesicles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20a, b</xref>), while the free Rb preferred to the nuclei than to the cytoplasm for the MCF-7 cells incubated with free Rb (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20c, d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Furthermore, THPG vesicles w/o Rb internalized by the MCF-7 cancer cells are very stable within 4 h inside cells to keep the fluorescence quenched according to the CLSM measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>) and flow cytometry assays (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>). All these control experiments from Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref> indicate the facile internalization of THPG vesicles into the MCF-7 cells through incubation, and the red fluorescence observed from Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref> should be attributed to the Rb loaded in THPG vesicles but not from THPG vesicles themselves or the free Rb released from vesicles.

It has been well accepted that AM with green fluorescence stains live cells and PI with red fluorescence (recoloring to be magenta pink color here) stains dead cells. As seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, the MCF-7 cells were very healthy with no magenta pink fluorescence in the control experiment. Besides, it was found that neither the THPG vesicles nor the 635 nm laser irradiation alone could induce prominent cell necrosis. However, for the MCF-7 cells incubated with THPG vesicles at a concentration of 200 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> and irradiated with the laser for 10 min together, the number of dead cells increased with the increase of laser power. When the laser irradiation power reached 200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, no green fluorescence was observed in the cells, revealing all MCF-7 cancer cells were killed.</p><p id="Par21">Moreover, we employed the MTT assay further to quantify the PTT performance of THPG vesicles in vitro. MCF-7 cells were incubated with THPG vesicles at the concentrations varying from 0 to 200 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> with or without 635 nm laser irradiation at 200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> for 10 min. About 93.7% MCF-7 cells were thermally ablated under the optimal condition of 200 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> THPG vesicles with laser power at 200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> for 10 min. In contrast, the MCF-7 cells with 200 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> THPG vesicle incubation without laser irradiation only induced 3.1% death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Besides, more MCF-7 cells incubated with THPG vesicles were killed with the increase of the illuminated laser power, while the MCF-7 cells without THPG vesicles incubation survived for 86.5% even under the 200 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> laser illumination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). These quantitative cell viability results agree well with the AM/PI double staining assay: the THPG vesicles internalized by the MCF-7 cells can absorb light energy from the laser and then convert it into heat effectively, which triggers the death of the cancer cells. Based on the above results, we can conclude that as-prepared THPG vesicles present excellent PTT ablation efficacy in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>In vivo animal experiments</title><p id="Par22">Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to analyze the blood retention of THPG vesicles.

After post-injection of 24 h, we found that the fluorescence signal of free Cy7.5 around the body was much weaker than that of THPG-Cy7.5 vesicles, suggesting the longer retention of THPG-Cy7.5 vesicles in vivo and the rapid clearance of free Cy 7.5 due to the small molecule nature. Moreover, almost no accumulation of free Cy7.5 in the tumor tissue was found within 24 h post-injection. In contrast, the fluorescence signals of THPG-Cy7.5 vesicles increased from 1 to 8 h in the tumor location and were still remarkable after 24 h.

The as-prepared polymer vesicles with an average diameter of 176 nm possess excellent biocompatibility and structural stability. Most importantly, due to the inherent good membrane fluidity of hyperbranched polymer vesicles, the porphyrin units in the vesicle membranes can further self-assemble into nanofilament-like supramolecular polymers driven by the 1D directional π–π stacking interactions, which leads to a very high fluorescence self-quenching ratio up to ca. 1100 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 44.1% in vitro. Besides, the hollow structure endows the vesicles with fluorescence monitoring and imaging-guidance capacity through the encapsulation of hydrophilic functional molecules such as Rhodamine b and Cy 7.5. As a result, the as-prepared polymer vesicles have shown excellent thermal ablation efficacy for both tumor cells and tumors in mice, thus making them very potential in photothermal therapy. The supramolecular polymerization-enhanced self-assembly process, as reported here, has combined the covalent polymer self-assembly and noncovalent supramolecular polymerization, and such a combination can strengthen the final self-assembled structure and enhance the functions in a synergistic way, which might be a promising way to extend the applications of the obtained supramolecular materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Synthesis of hyperbranched multi-porphyrin polymers (THPGs)</title><p id="Par30">Most of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification.
