The DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs composite exhibited the broad UV-visible light absorption and fluorescence quenching, which was a direct indication of photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process between the intercalated DAS (donor) and DNS (acceptor) anions. This was confirmed by the matched HOMO/LUMO energy levels alignment of the intercalated DAS and DNS anions, which was also compatible for water splitting. The DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs composite was fabricated as the photoanode and Pt as the cathode. Under the UV-visible light illumination, the enhanced photo-generated current (4.67 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.8 V vs. SCE) was generated in the external circuit and the photoelectrochemical water split was realized. Furthermore, this photoelectrochemical water splitting performance had excellent crystalline, electrochemical and optical stability. Therefore, this novel inorganic/organic hybrid photoanode exhibited potential application prospect in photoelectrochemical water splitting.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep12170.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep12170" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep12170</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Solar energy has been regarded as the most ideal alternative for fossil energy resource due to its combination of powerful, renewable, affordable and sustainable properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, efficiently water splitting into applicable hydrogen by solar energy was considered as the ultimate solution for the energy and environment crisis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, tremendous attention has been focused on water splitting for hydrogen generation by photocatalysis or photoelectrochemical (PEC) process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Since the pioneer work of Honda <italic>et al.</italic> on a TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the principle of PEC hydrogen production was successfully extended into systems of inorganic semiconductor particulates. However, several key factors, such as low light absorption at visible-light, rapid charge recombination and instability of semiconductor materials during chemical process, strikingly restricted the realization of large-scale industrial application for this “dreaming technology”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In general, the activity of water photolysis was highly dependent on co-catalyst and most reaction systems needed the incorporation of other oxidizing or reducing species as sacrificial agents to participate in the reaction. All these work was focused on inorganic semiconductors based on the water reduction/oxidation by photo-excited electron/hole on the band edge.</p><p>On the contrary, there existed numerous organic molecules with various HOMO/LUMO electron levels, which could form electron donor-acceptor (D-A) system when in contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Charge-transfer complex salt with organic electron donor, such as BEDT-TTF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and κ-(BETS)<sub>2</sub>FeBr<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, showed excellent conductivity and magnetic properties. The D-A pairs based on organic polymers and small molecules semiconductors had been widely used in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, organic photoconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and D-A type heterojunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> as organic solar cells (like P3HT/PCBM blends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, C<sub>70</sub>/zinc phthalocyanine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). In these D-A systems, the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process across a D-A interface was the key process, which dominated the efficiency of photoelectric conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the D-A organic systems were rarely applied into the PEC water splitting, maybe due to the expensive price of D-A molecules and the photo-instability of most organic molecules. Toshiyuki <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> recently reported that the organic PTCBI/CoPc bilayer could act as a stable photoanode that was capable of evolving O<sub>2</sub> at the CoPc/water interface. Therefore, it was necessary to study the novel inexpensive and photo-stable D-A system to effectively realize the PEC water splitting.</p><p>4,4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DAS) and 4,4-dinitro-stilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DNS) are cheap industry intermediates and have been widely used in the production of optical brighteners and synthetic dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The nitro/amino group substitution lowered/raised the electron energy levels of DNS/DAS, respectively, compared to the unsubstituted parent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, it could be expected that DAS and DNS molecules could be designed as electron D-A system upon mixing. In order to immobilize this D-A molecular system in solid state to facilitate their PET effect, Zn<sub>2</sub>Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs), [Zn<sub>2</sub>Al(OH)<sub>2</sub>](NO<sub>3</sub>)·<italic>m</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, with versatility in terms of their chemical composition, layer charge and capability of ion exchange was selected as the host layers. DAS and DNS anions could be co-intercalated into the 2D interlayers of the LDHs layers to create their close contact, which was the primary condition for the PET process. Furthermore, the co-intercalated system was fabricated into the thin film which realized the broad and strong optical absorption and fluorescence quenching, implying the obvious PET process between the intercalated DNS and DAS anions. The DAS and DNS co-intercalated Zn<sub>2</sub>Al-LDHs thin film photoanode exhibited excellent abilities of PEC water splitting. This electron D-A type 2D co-intercalation composite was unique due to the following points, i) the positive-charged host layers will affect the photoexcited electron/hole, which was favorable for the charge separation during the PET process; ii) the interlayer water molecules adsorbed on the LDHs nanosheets would be accessible for the photolysis; iii) the energy levels of photoexcited electron/hole could be apt to modify by various co-intercalation design; iv) in contrast with the band edge absorption of inorganic semiconductor, this 2D composite possessed the broad and strong optical absorption in the UV-visible region, due to the organic π*-π electron transition of guest anion, in favor of the absorption of solar light; v) the intercalation of organic molecules into Zn<sub>2</sub>Al-LDHs interlayers could improve the photo/thermostability of composites due to the UV-shield effect of host layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterizations of DAS(<italic>x</italic>%)-DNS/LDHs</title><p>DAS/DNS co-intercalated Zn<sub>2</sub>Al-LDHs powder was prepared by hydrothermal co-precipitation method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and was nominated as DAS(<italic>x</italic>%)-DNS/LDHs; <italic>x</italic> is the molar percentage of DAS account for all interlayered anions. It was found that the DNS and DAS anions could be co-intercalated into the interlayers of Zn<sub>2</sub>Al-LDHs with arbitrary ratio (<italic>x</italic> = 0 ~ 100). Interestingly, the 003 diffraction peaks of DAS(<italic>x</italic>%)-DNS/LDHs were almost at the same position due to the similar shape of DAS and DNS anions (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1 in SI</xref>). The layer spacing was varied from 1.44 nm to 1.50 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2 in SI</xref>), which meant that the co-intercalated DAS/DNS anions were monolayered orderly aligned with the electrostatic interaction and π-π stacking effect (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> inset), according to the analysis of interlayer spacing (1.5 nm), one LDH layer (0.48 nm) plus the lateral dimension of DAS(0.90 nm)/DNS(0.93 nm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>). The co-intercalation was also confirmed by their FT-IR spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4, S5</xref>).

As an energy matched electron D/A pair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, when the DAS and DNS anions were mixed together with different ratios, both luminescence were quenched to different extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S7B</xref>).

Coincidentally, the DAS/LDHs and DNS/LDHs powders were luminous at 445 nm and 530 nm, respectively, being similar with the DAS and DNS solutions.

It can be found that the <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> of intercalated DAS/DNS was narrowed compared to the pristine DAS/DNS anions and the energy level was decreased on the whole, which may be caused by the 2D confined effect of LDHs.

Compared with the reversible hydrogen/oxygen electrode potential of H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O, it also revealed that this HOMO/LUMO energy level alignment of DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs was compatible for PEC water splitting, provided that no remarkable difference of energy levels between the co-intercalated and single-intercalated composite.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The measured electrode potentials and energy levels of the DAS/LDHs, DNS/LDHs, DAS and DNS.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center"><p><bold><italic>E</italic></bold><sub><bold>ox</bold></sub><sup><bold>a</bold></sup><bold>(V)</bold></p></th><th align="center"><p><bold><italic>E</italic></bold><sub><bold>HOMO</bold></sub><sup><bold>b</bold></sup><bold>(eV)</bold></p></th><th align="center"><p><bold><italic>E</italic></bold><sub><bold>LUMO</bold></sub><sup><bold>c</bold></sup><bold>(eV)</bold></p></th><th align="center"><p><bold><italic>E</italic></bold><sub><bold>g</bold></sub><sup><bold>d</bold></sup><bold>(eV)</bold></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>DAS/LDHs</p></td><td><p>0.76</p></td><td><p>−5.50</p></td><td><p>−2.68</p></td><td><p>2.82</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DNS/LDHs</p></td><td><p>1.08</p></td><td><p>−5.82</p></td><td><p>−3.48</p></td><td><p>2.34</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DAS</p></td><td><p>0.63</p></td><td><p>−5.37</p></td><td><p>−2.27</p></td><td><p>3.10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DNS</p></td><td><p>1.03</p></td><td><p>−5.77</p></td><td><p>−2.83</p></td><td><p>2.94</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Oxidation potentials measured by cyclic voltammetry.</p><p><sup>b</sup><italic>E</italic><sub>HOMO</sub> (eV) = −4.74 − <italic>eE</italic><sub>ox</sub>.</p><p><sup>d</sup><italic>E</italic><sub>LUMO</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>HOMO</sub> + <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>.</p><p><sup>c</sup>The band gap (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>) was estimated from the UV-vis. absorption spectra and PL emission spectra.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The PEC properties</title><p>The photon-generated current of DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs photoanode showed the prominent current above the onset voltage (0.4 V vs. SCE) and was remarkably enhanced (4.67 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.8 V vs. SCE) under light illumination, compared with its dark current (3.73 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.8 V vs. SCE), while the single-intercalated DAS-LDHs or DNS-LDHs photoanode was inert or poor electric conductive in dark or in light (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Concomitant with the remarkable photocurrent, hydrogen and oxygen was evolved and bubbled at the Pt cathode and photoanode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S11</xref>), respectively, indicating the PEC water splitting occurring. In the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the diameter of semicircle curves corresponded to the interfacial charge-transfer resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>), which controlled the electron transfer kinetics of the redox species at the electrode interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The obviously smaller EIS semicircle diameter of DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs in light confirmed that the electron conductivity was augmented (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> inset). However, the single-intercalated DAS/LDHs and DNS/LDHs photoanode were electric insulative without the EIS semicircle no matter in dark or in light. And the EIS semicircle diameters of other ratios for DAS(<italic>x</italic>%)-DNS/LDHs were diminished to some extent in light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S12</xref>), which was consistent with the <italic>I-V</italic> curves in light (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Therefore, It could be concluded that the 2D PET process appeared in other DAS(<italic>x</italic>%)-DNS/LDHs composite; nevertheless, the ratio for the most efficient 2D PET process was 50%. This was also an obvious evidence of 2D photo-induced charge separation and transfer process within the interlayers of Zn<sub>2</sub>Al-LDHs.

For other ratios otherwise, these values were all less than that of the 50% composite, which demonstrated that the DAS/DNS anions with equal amount in the interlayers was the most efficient ratio for the 2D PET process.

The structural stability of photoanode before and after photo-electrochemical process was characterized by SEM and HRTEM. The surface morphology of DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs remained unchanged after photoelectrochemical water splitting. Moreover, the HRTEM image of pristine DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs nanosheets exhibited well-defined (110) lattice fringe and hexagonally arranged spots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> in FFT pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S13</xref>) also remained after the PEC water splitting, which confirmed the crystallization stability of the co-intercalated system for the PEC water splitting. To investigate its electrochemical stability, long-term cycling stability of DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs was investigated by performing continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) between −0.1 and 0.8 V vs. SCE at 50 mV·s<sup>−1</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S14A</xref>, a negligible difference can be observed between the curves measured at the initial cycle and that after 100 CV cycles, suggesting the excellent electrochemical durability of DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs composite during the long-term CV cycling. When a constant potential of 0.8 V was applied, a continuous PEC water splitting process occurred to generate molecular hydrogen and oxygen. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S14B</xref>, the current density exhibited a slight degradation even after a long period of 1200 s, which might be caused by the consumption of water or the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> on the electrode surface that hindered the reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, the stability under continuous water splitting process was identified for DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs. This excellent long-term electrochemical and photo-stability was not surprised because of the remarkable UV stability of DAS and DNS (they are industrial fluorescent brighteners) in addition to the UV screen ability of Zn<sub>2</sub>Al-LDHs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The proposed 2D PET mechanism scheme and the energy level alignment was illustrated in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, which indicated that the photo-generated electron would transfer from DAS to DNS anions.

The co-intercalated DAS/DNS anions was orderly aligned within the interlayers and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the intercalated DAS and DNS anions were affected to match and couple as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. The DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs showed the remarkable PET performance with the 1.31% IPCE at 365 nm and enhanced photo-generated current (4.67 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.8 V vs. SCE) for water splitting under UV-visible-light illumination with excellent crystalline, electrochemical and photo-stability. The DAS(50%)-DNS/LDHs composite exhibited the obvious 2D photo-induced charge separation and transfer process, which was a novel prototype for solar energy conversion. Further in-depth study was underway including designing the other suitable D/A pairs for optimizing the PEC water splitting and improving the IPCE efficiency and stability. This novel inorganic/organic composite photoanode exhibited potential application prospect in PEC water splitting and the flexibility of organic D/A pair selection and co-intercalation design for this inorganic/organic hybrid composite paved a broad and promising way to develop a kind of new, low-cost and simple layered PEC system for solar energy conversion and application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials</title><p>4,4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, DAS) and 4,4-dinitrostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, DNS) were supplied by J&amp;K Chemical Co.
