The purpose is to fill existing data gaps for life cycle assessment (LCA) of electric vehicles. The model comprises new and easy-to-use data with sufficient level of detail to enable proper component scaling and in-depth analysis of inverter units. The aim of this article (part II) is to describe the modeling of all production steps and present new datasets. Another objective is to explain the strategies for data collection, system boundaries, and how unit process datasets were made to interact properly with the scalable design model (part I).</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Data for the manufacturing of the inverter unit was collected from a variety of literature, technical specifications, factory data, site visits, and expert interviews. The model represents current levels of technology and modern industrial scale production. Industry data dates back to 2012. Some older literature is referred to, but only if it was found to remain relevant. Upstream, new data has been gathered to the point where the Ecoinvent database can be used to model a full cradle-to-gate inventory. To make the LCI model easy to use, each flow crossing the system boundary is reported with a recommended linked flow to this database.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par3">The screening and modeling of manufacturing inverter units resulted in a substantial compilation of new inventory data. In close integration with the design model, which is scalable in size over a range of 20–200 kW in nominal power and 250–700 V in DC system voltage (part I), it forms a comprehensive scalable LCI model of a typical automotive power electronic inverter unit intended for traction motor control. New production data covers electroplating of gold, electro-galvanization, machining and anodizing of aluminum, ceramic substrate fabrication, direct copper bonding, photoimaging and regenerative etching, power module assembly with a two-step soldering process, and the assembly of automotive printed circuit boards.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Interviews with experts were found to be vital for effective data collection and the reporting of details a key to maintaining data usability over time, for reuse, rework, and criticism by other LCA practitioners.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Assembly</kwd><kwd>DCB</kwd><kwd>Direct copper

Similarly, the fabrication and assembly of printed circuit boards (PCBs), as well as the modules for packaging power semiconductors, require a variety of materials, process chemicals, and furnace heat treatments (Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>; Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>), with related environmental impacts. Such electronics play a key role in automotive electric powertrains, to convert currents and voltages and to control the electric motor (Çaǧatay Bayindir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>; Emadi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>). However, there is a clear gap in life cycle assessment (LCA) literature on this topic and few studies can be found that focus on automotive power electronics (Hawkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Even so, two case studies were published recently. Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>) investigated an automotive power module, the main active part of an inverter unit. They include upstream production of material constituents but no processing of parts beyond energy use, and they give few details on the modeling of the manufacturing (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>). Hernandez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>) studied an inverter operating as a traction motor controller, closely integrated with the electric motor. The manufacturing stages were modeled for energy requirements using the Ecoinvent database (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>). This database contains composition and production data for several different PCB components as well as generic production effort datasets for different component types such as capacitors (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>). However, important production steps required for the power module are not covered.</p><p id="Par7">Indeed, there is aggregated life cycle inventory (LCI) data for complete automotive power electronic units available in Ecoinvent (Del Duce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>; Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>), accounting for scrap losses and production energy use. Still, proper use of these datasets requires additional collection of often inaccessible information, i.e., component mass in combination with electrical requirements, and they are not suitable for scaling since the reference flow is one “kilogram of component,” with a fixed mass composition regardless of the electrical functionality, as discussed in part I of this series. Consequently, there is a lack of manufacturing data for power electronics, particularly for modeling units of varying size and functionality. There is also an overall need for more vehicle production records, as pointed out by both Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>) and Del Duce et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">However, acquiring new inventory data is both challenging and time consuming (Baumann and Tillman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>; Finnveden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>). Conventionally, LCA guidelines and standards specify what types of data to collect (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2006</xref>; JRC-IES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>) or the format and requirements for data documentation (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2002</xref>), but descriptions on how to go about to fill the data gaps have been missing. In contrast, acknowledging the lack of data specifically for electric vehicles, the eLCAr guidelines (e-mobility Life Cycle Assessment recommendations) discuss two strategies for deriving new data—theoretical modeling or approximating from similar process data (Del Duce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>). But modifications of previous database records, or linked complementary modeling, call for deep understanding of existing datasets. Not only information tabulated on unit process level in a standardized format is useful, but also free text descriptions of the acquisition context and possibilities for data treatment, as recognized by the ISO standard for data documentation (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2002</xref>) and exemplified by overviewing journal articles describing revisions of and additions to Ecoinvent (Del Duce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>; Treyer and Bauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Purpose and content: the scalable LCI model and the article series</title><p id="Par9">In response to the lack of data for vehicle power electronics, a scalable LCI model was developed. It provides mass composition and manufacturing data for an inverter unit intended for controlling electric vehicle propulsion motors. The purpose of the model is to provide detailed component inventory data for LCA. It generates data on inverters ranging within 20–200 kW in nominal power and within 250–700 V in DC system voltage. The model results include a complete gate-to-gate inventory covering the production of the inverter, from materials and ready-made subcomponents, to a complete unit. It represents a typical stand-alone three-phase inverter unit with insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). The model excludes adjacent powertrain components, such as the electric motor, but additional user options allow modifications of the coverage, making it easier to combine the results with other data as if the unit is integrated in another part, e.g., a combined inverter and DC/DC voltage level converter.</p><p id="Par10">Part I of this article series describes the technical design of a typical automotive inverter unit, how it has been represented in the LCI model and the principles for scaling of different subparts. It exemplifies how the model calculates detailed mass composition results for the inverter unit, and compares the model results for different input parameters with data for real and state-of-the-art inverter units published between 2013 and 2016, to validate the model. Challenges in the modeling work and the structure, technical scope, and user options of the LCI data model are explained.</p><p id="Par11">An important overall aim when developing the LCI model was to provide a tool which is easy to use for LCA practitioners and to make the design scalable in size from easily acquired engineering parameters. This required not only mass composition data but also manufacturing data with sufficient resolution to capture the effects of scaling the inverter unit in size, also in production. All manufacturing processes were followed upstream to a point where LCI data for representative material production or subcomponents existed in the Ecoinvent database (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>), in order to facilitate the creation of a cradle-to-gate LCI. The inventory model can be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> The manufacturing data can also be used independently, e.g., in LCA studies with identical productions steps for other electronic products.</p><p id="Par13">The aim of this article, part II, is to describe the modeling of power electronics <italic>manufacturing</italic>, including assembly of PCBs, machining and surface treatment of die cast casing parts, and foremost, the making of the IGBT power module in several steps. The integration of these datasets is what turns the scalable design model (part I) into an LCI model. All new data is described to provide the technical context, but only three actual unit process datasets are reported in this paper, as examples (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The total data compilation is available in the SPINE@CPM LCA Database, including an underlying model report (Nordelöf and Alatalo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>). Also in this paper, the selection of system boundaries for manufacturing is explained as well as the proposed use of Ecoinvent for upstream flows of materials, subcomponents, and production efforts, in order to fulfill the intended coverage of all production steps.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Examples of unit process data—(a) electroplating of gold upon nickel including surface activation, (b) patterning of the DCB by photoimaging and regenerative etching, and (c) assembly of PCBs for automotive applications with conformal coatings on both sides with 20% pad density.

The intention was to keep it representative on a global level, yet within the context of an industrialized country (see Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>). Transportation of goods is not included, but expected to be added by the user if found relevant for the study in which the model is used. For the technical scope, the modeling of manufacturing processes was cautiously surveyed to interact properly with the scaling of the design, i.e., the level of detail allows for an appropriate account of the function in each production step. For example, in the process of making a circuit pattern on the power module substrate (shown in the <italic>etching dataset</italic> of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), photoimaging data relates to the area being patterned, whereas the subsequent etching step is reported per unit of mass being removed. Consequently, the etching unit process dataset has dual reference flows, i.e., mass and area. This is a key feature of the LCI model. Although built with conventional unit processes, it keeps track of multiple parameters in the process flows, to adjust the representation of manufacturing in agreement with the scalable design model (part I). Examples are given in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>a, b.</p><p id="Par18">Time-wise, both design and manufacturing data represent the current level of technology. Measured data from industry dates back to 2012. Many technical reports, datasheets, and research articles are from the same time period. However, older literature sources are also referred to, if they were judged to remain relevant, such as the extensive textbook on power modules by Sheng and Colino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>) describing the standard power module design, which has remained similar since the 1990s (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2010</xref>; Volke and Hornkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Production activities and upstream links to Ecoinvent</title><p id="Par19">As a general approach, manufacturing data was compiled to properly account for the scaling of the design, whereafter the model was expanded upstream to establish the system boundary where relevant and explicit matching flows for the input of semiprocessed materials or complete subparts were found in the Ecoinvent database (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>). Using the LCI model for a full cradle-to-grave LCA requires the gate-to-gate inventory to be linked to datasets representing both upstream and downstream processes. Downstream, the user is expected to model the inverter unit in a use phase context and further treatment when the unit is ready for disposal. Upstream, the user is recommended how to make use of Ecoinvent to establish a cradle-to-gate model.</p><p id="Par20">In addition to material input, the gate-to-gate model accounts for the input of processing supplies, both energy and materials, and outputs in the form of emissions and wastes. To make the model easy to use, all inputs and outputs are reported with a recommendation for a <italic>linked flow</italic> in Ecoinvent version 3 (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>) (marked as E3 in the model report), except in cases where it is suggested that the user should make a deliberate methodological selection. This is then noted as <italic>optional</italic>, e.g., for electricity use in production.</p><p id="Par21">Ecoinvent also offers a set of activities that reshape and integrate several singular material flows into more aggregated subproducts in a certain type of production effort or service activity. The model makes use of several such Ecoinvent datasets, since they were found to provide the best available data for how to model certain material transformations and the production of several subparts from their material constituents. An <italic>extended system boundary</italic> was defined to include these activities in a separate list of the LCI model file, to avoid confusion and make a distinction from the regular system boundary (the technical boundary referred to so far), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The reason for the two separate boundary setup is the formulation of these transformation activities and production efforts in Ecoinvent. They are formatted as services that reshape 1 kg of input raw material or semifinished product into 1 kg of output product (Hischier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>; Steiner and Frischknecht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2007</xref>; Classen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>), but they do not include the materials and products being reshaped. Instead, they include energy use, wastes, and emission and compensate for losses in terms of material input for the product. As a result, the process reference flow represents the activity and not the output product. This is also the case when expressed as a mass, see for example, the description of “hot rolling” in Classen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>) or capacitor production in Hischier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>).

Moreover, considering the focus on scaling throughout both papers in the series, it is worth mentioning that the scale of production, e.g., in terms of underlying data for equipment type and energy use, is kept constant and represents high volume production for each unit process of in the LCI model.

For the LCI model, this production was placed outside the system boundary and the user is referred to an Ecoinvent dataset for complete wafer production of integrated circuits (ICs) (Hischier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>; Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>). However, there are differences between wafers intended for ICs and power IGBTs.

No data was found for an evaluation of this difference, but higher purity typically requires more processing. In contrast, Schmidt et al.

The latter step is called activation and is especially important when gold is plated on nickel, as the nickel otherwise might peel off (Schlesinger and Paunovic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2010</xref>). In functional plating (for industrial purposes), nickel plating baths are often based on (nickel) sulfamate, gold baths are cyanide-based, and zinc in solution with acid chloride is common for galvanization (Schlesinger and Paunovic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2010</xref>).

The powder is ball milled into a slurry with a solvent, a binder, a plasticizer, and a dispersant (Bengisu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The slurry is casted and flattened by a blade into a tape, before it is dried and stamped into the desired shape.</p><p id="Par51">Next, the substrate is sintered in air at 1600–1700 °C. Sintering times can differ from 20 to 60 min for small batches (Bengisu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>) up to 24 h for industrial scale furnaces with large continuous throughput of substrates (Hedlund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>). During sintering, the “green body” densifies to its final substrate shape. The organic components added to the slurry evaporate during drying or burn-out in the sintering step (Blackwell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">All steps of this process are very similar to those of other thin ceramic products, for example, substrates made of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) (Yuping et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2000</xref>; Bengisu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>; Pehnt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2003</xref>). Consequently, data for the energy consumption of the sintering process was adapted from the making of solid oxide YSZ ceramics, including slurry mixing and milling, tape casting, stamping, drying, and a 24-h sintering cycle with an average output of more than 10 m<sup>2</sup> total substrate area per hour (Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>). The originally stated energy use of 22.6 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> for a 500-μm-thick substrate (Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>), became 21 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> after an adjustment for material density. The slurry recipe was gathered from Yuping et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2000</xref>). Waste and emission figures were established from general data about ceramic (European Comission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>) and constituents’ specifications (ScienceLab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">b</xref>; Vanderbilt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2014</xref>; Haynes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>). Twenty percent of the dispersant mass evaporates as ammonia and the remainder as volatile organic compounds. For the binder and plasticizer, it was assumed that half of the carbon content will decompose into carbon monoxide and the other half into carbon dioxide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Direct copper bonding and the making of the conducting pattern</title><p id="Par53">Copper foils are bonded to both sides of the ceramic substrate in a “direct copper bonding” process. The parts are cleaned, stacked, and sent into a furnace with nitrogen or argon gas and a very precise amount of oxygen (0.4% by mass) (Burgess and Neugebauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1973</xref>; Ning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2003</xref>; Torrey Hills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2017</xref>). The temperature cycle is regulated to oxidize the copper in a thin layer on the surface of the foils. It melts just above 1065 °C and forms a “eutectic” layer (Burgess and Neugebauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1973</xref>). The temperature must remain below 1083 °C to avoid all the copper melting. The total cycle is typically 5.5 h long and takes place in a belt furnace (BTU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>; Lenz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>; Ning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2003</xref>; Torrey Hills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2017</xref>). It results in a strong bond, and the final part is referred to as a direct copper bonded substrate (DCB).</p><p id="Par54">The data for the direct bonding process was gathered and established from several sources. Batch-wise ultrasonic cleaning using various chemicals was based mainly on Ning et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2003</xref>) and Unger and Landis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>). The underlying data for the energy estimation for the furnace bonding cycle was gathered from an experiment made by Franz and Weilguni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>), where multiple-layered co-fired ceramic substrates were laminated in an industrial belt furnace (BTU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). They report the electricity use for heating and for running compressors, the sample size and the throughput, over 24 h of furnace operation. Using this data, a simple furnace model was created, where the temperature in different zones was rescaled and the throughput remodeled based on geometry. Ventilation data was adapted from Aros (see Section <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">6.1</xref>) and nitrogen use from Ghasemi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">In the next step, the upper copper foil of the DCB is turned into a conducting pattern by photoimaging and etching. The DCB is cleaned and coated with an UV reactive and etching-resistant organic “photoresist” (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2004</xref>; Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). The coating process involves heating, either as pre-baking or drying. The resist is adhered to the copper in a desired image by exposure to UV light through a mask. Non-adhered resist is washed away with a “developer.” The DCB is dried before the upper foil is etched in the exposed pattern to remove copper and create a circuit design. Cupric chloride is a common etching solution, which can be operated with continuous regeneration (Cakir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>; Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Chemcut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). Regenerative systems based on chlorine gas are common because of low cost and easy control, but the method is sometimes avoided for safety reasons (Cakir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). The process requires continuous addition of water and chlorine gas. Hydrochloric acid is used to increase the etch rate (Chemcut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). The copper that is etched off the DCB can be recovered as excess cupric chloride.</p><p id="Par56">Finally, a stripper is used to remove the remaining photoresist. There are many options for chemicals used as resists, developers, and strippers. Among the latter two, carbonate or hydroxide of sodium or potassium is common (Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Kuehr and Williams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2003</xref>; OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2004</xref>). There are also several water rinsing steps.</p><p id="Par57">The foils of the DCB were assumed to cover 95% of the substrate area (both sides) before etching and 90% after etching (KCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>). Specific data for all steps in patterning the DCB was not found. Instead, data from different references was combined. The oven drying procedure was adapted (rescaling with temperature) from Aros data, and the energy required for UV exposure was found negligible. The quantity of processing chemicals was based on patterning of semiconductor wafers (Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2002</xref>) but reworked to account for one surface layer only (Greig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>; Mack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2006</xref>). Due to the many different possible options, the photoresist compound is not explicitly specified. Instead, the recommend linked flow to Ecoinvent (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>) states an average organic chemical. Air emissions from drying of resist were included (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2004</xref>). The regenerative etching was modeled with data from Chemcut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>) and water use adopted from electroplating (Moing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2009</xref>). The data compiled for the patterning step is provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>b, as an example of unit process data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Power module assembly</title><p id="Par58">The fabrication of the power module requires several different bonding processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Soldering is often used to attach the power chips to the DCB (chip soldering) and the DCB to the baseplate (system soldering) (Volke and Hornkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2012</xref>; Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>). This is conducted using a two-step approach, with chip soldering in the first step, and system soldering in the second. In the latter, it is important to avoid the chip solder remelting since chips might shift out of position, leading to failure during operation. Traditionally, lead-based solders with 25–40 °C difference in melting points were used (Olszewski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>; Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>). The shift to lead-free bonding became a challenge, since all standard solders have melting points within 218–240 °C (Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>). However, newer production methods have evolved that can create joints withstanding above 400 °C without melting, using standard lead-free solders and ordinary reflow temperatures of 240–260 °C (Guth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>; Volke and Hornkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2012</xref>; Khaja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>). The key is to make the solder joint very thin (10–15 μm) and to apply pressure or vacuum during the reflow process, so that thin alloy phases of solder and the bonded metals occur in the joint, called “diffusion soldering.” This is primarily used for the chip attachment but is also possible for system soldering. The main disadvantage is costly equipment (Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par59">For the LCI model, it is assumed that the chip attachment is achieved in a combined vacuum and “vapor-phase soldering” (VPS) diffusion process, i.e., a vaporized liquid is used to transfer heat to the soldering object (Leicht and Thumm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2008</xref>; Khaja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>). In addition, a thin layer (20 μm) of solder paste is stencil printed very precisely onto the DCB and the chips are machine-positioned (Khaja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>; Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par60">In the next step, the baseplate is stencil printed and placed in a fixture together with the DCB, and these go through system soldering in a convection reflow oven with nitrogen atmosphere. The reflow soldering data from Aros (see Section <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">6.1</xref>) was judged to be a good representation for the system soldering process, since the temperature profile and the oven type are identical. It was also used as an estimate for the chip soldering process, based on a comparison of vacuum VPS technique with convection reflow soldering at similar temperatures. Vacuum VPS soldering is more efficient (IBL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>; Leicht and Thumm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2008</xref>) while the time required for diffusion soldering is longer (Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Khaja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>), and, by coincidence, the two factors were found to balance each other numerically. However, vacuum VPS does not require nitrogen flow gas.</p><p id="Par61">Stencil printing requires cleaning of stencils and frames. There are also cleaning steps for the power module before and after the soldering. Pre-solder cleaning was modeled as ultrasonic aqueous cleaning followed by a vacuum furnace bake for 4 h at 150 °C (Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>). Postsolder cleaning is conducted using acetone and isopropanol and was based on the dataset for photoimaging (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>b).</p><p id="Par62">The assembly process continues when the molded plastic frame with pre-anchored terminals and contacts is attached to the baseplate using screws and a thin layer of adhesive. Subsequently, the module is cleaned again in a process called plasma cleaning—radio frequencies are powered in argon gas—before the upper side of the chips and the DCB circuitry are wire bonded. There are many options for this step, but for this model, ultrasonic wedge bonding was assumed. When applied for copper to copper bonds, it is referred to as ultrasonic welding (Volke and Hornkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2012</xref>). It is also used for connecting the contacts to the DCB. The number of bonds was approximately related to the chip area. Next, the module is filled with silicone potting gel and cured with UV light (Henkel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>; MTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>; Wacker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014</xref>; Volke and Hornkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2012</xref>). Lastly, silicone adhesive is used again to glue the lid onto the frame and seal the power module before it is transported to the inverter assembly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>The assembly factory</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Surface mounted assembly of the printed circuit board</title><p id="Par63">Un-mounted PCB panels are divided into boards at the assembly factory. Boards are wiped clean and placed in a stencil printing machine where solder paste is applied. The paste is a mixture of solder metal alloy powder and “flux” with the role to remove impurities. Typically, it consists of alcohols and natural rosins (Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). The stencil makes sure that the paste is applied on the pads of the board where the solder joints are to bond the components. For surface mount PCBs complying to automotive thermal requirements, the pad area of a well populated board is only about 20% of the total area (Edgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). Some solder paste is lost during printing and caught in filters during regular ultrasonic stencil cleaning. But most losses are due to disposal of degraded paste (Edgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par64">Next, boards are transported by conveyors through a pick-and-place machine, placing the miniature SMDs precisely on the solder paste deposits. The PCBs enter a reflow oven with a nitrogen atmosphere—to prevent oxidation and improve the bonding (Sheng and Colino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>; Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). Peak temperature during the cycle is at most 260 °C and the processing time 5–7 min (Coombs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). Most of the flux is evaporated as air emissions. The board passes onto inspection, in circuit testing and conformal coating. The latter means that a polyurethane lacquer or a silicone coating is applied to protect against mechanical wear and various contaminants. Typically, the coating is sprayed onto the PCB with very precise control, only onto selected areas, and with uniform coating. If a lacquer is used, this requires an oven drying and hardening process for about 20 min at 80 °C, where the solvents evaporate.</p><p id="Par65">Data for the PCB assembly was gathered from Aros: site visit notes; electricity consumption charts, purchase summaries, and waste data (Aros <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">e</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">f</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">g</xref>; Stena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2014</xref>; Welin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">b</xref>); and through interviews (Edgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). The received electronic information extended back to 2007, but the data compilation reflects production during 2013. This data was complemented by multiple machine and process chemicals specifications. As for the power module, the solder paste was modeled to consist of 89% lead-free Sn95.5Ag3.9Cu0.6 solder and 11% flux, matching the existing Ecoinvent dataset (Hischier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>; Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>). A paste with similar composition and flux of no-clean type is used at Aros (with 45% denatured alcohol and 55% natural rosin). Hence, the boards need no cleaning of flux residues after reflow. The washings of printing stencils and frames are the main cleaning steps in the PCB assembly, supplemented only by manual wiping of panels and general cleaning of the machinery. Data for the PCB assembly is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>c.</p><p id="Par66">The actual solder paste consumption at Aros was not used to estimate the amount of paste used on the PCBs, partly because there was no information to differentiate the amount of board area subject to different soldering processes (reflow, wave, and selective soldering). Also, the component density and the layout of the design vary, depending on the application. Instead, information from Deubzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>) and Edgren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>) was combined to estimate the total paste use for the automotive boards to 94 g/m<sup>2</sup>, including losses. This equals 84 g/m<sup>2</sup> of paste applied on the board after printing and 75 g/m<sup>2</sup> of solder on the finished board. Total losses of un-mounted panel, components, and assembled boards are very small, under 0.1% according to Edgren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Complete inverter unit assembly and technical building services</title><p id="Par67">In the final assembly, all parts are brought together into one unit, using mostly handheld tools. The thermal interface material (a mix of aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, and silicone oil) is dispensed on the bottom of the casing and spread uniformly before the power module; the DC-link capacitor and cable glands are secured into the housing compartment of the casing. The driver and logic boards are mounted on top of the power module, and the laminated bus bar interconnects the power module, DC-link capacitor, and the terminals.</p><p id="Par68">For the model, it was assumed that the PCBs are connected to the power module using pin connectors instead of being soldered. However, one more bonding step takes place before the final assembly—the external signal connector, which is through-hole soldered to the logic board. This was modeled with an automated selective soldering process based on Aros data. Next, the connector and logic board are mounted in parallel into the housing compartment and the casing wall.</p><p id="Par69">There are several basic functions necessary to running an electronics factory, additional to the specific manufacturing processes. These functions are often referred to as technical building services and relate to the total activity of the plant, including for example, ventilation, lighting, tools, and computers for various work and tasks. At Aros, almost all machines use compressed air in addition to electricity (Edgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). This is generated by a compressor powered by electricity.

Along with the model of the design, which is scalable in size from easily acquired engineering parameters (part I), it forms a complete LCI model of a typical automotive power electronic inverter unit intended for traction motor control. The new production unit process datasets cover electroplating of gold on nickel; electro-galvanization of steel; machining and anodizing of aluminum casings; ceramic substrate fabrication; direct copper bonding; photoimaging and regenerative etching; power module assembly including cleaning, a two-step soldering process with lead-free solder and ultrasonic wedge bonding; the assembly of surface mount automotive PCBs; and final assembly of the complete unit with building services. In addition, other required steps in the production are included by incorporating adequate existing datasets from literature and by modeling with specific Ecoinvent manufacturing activities. Furthermore, recommendations are made for linked flows in Ecoinvent to represent semiprocessed materials and ready-made subparts.</p><p id="Par72">The data is reported in relatively great detail, both in papers I and II, but foremost in the model report (Nordelöf and Alatalo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>). One reason is that the target audience is multidisciplinary, with different prior knowledge about power electronics and expected use of the model details. Another motivation is that these documents are intended to cohere and explicate the standardized data documentation (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2002</xref>) available directly in the SPINE@CPM LCA database, both for the LCI model and single new unit process datasets. Standardized tabulated information is indeed important, and during the work, it was found very useful when comparing specific properties of already existing datasets, such as temporal validity, geographical coverage, or overviewing technical scope. However, the locked structure also implies fragmentation and sometimes leads to that contextual information is missing. In fact, the project exposed that detailed free text descriptions of data often provided the required clarity and transparency to enable reuse, rework, and criticism of older datasets which is vital to maintaining their usability over time. This can be exemplified by several Ecoinvent datasets where reports (Classen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>; Hischier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>; Hischier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>; Hässig and Primas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>; Steiner and Frischknecht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2007</xref>) and journal articles (Del Duce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>; Muller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2016</xref>) were found to provide context and explain specific details and features of different datasets much more comprehensibly than the information provided on unit process level (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>). Consequently, LCA practioners compiling inventory data are recommended to complement any standardized records with free text which describes the datasets in a broader context, including motives behind assumptions and procedural details.</p><p id="Par73">The two different starting points for the data collection—the Aros factory data as one root source and a few main literature data sources as the other—both exemplify the need for “data building,” as discussed by Nordelöf and Tillman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2018</xref>). Data building can be regarded as a combination of the two strategies suggested by the eLCAr guidelines (Del Duce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>) for data collection, i.e., theoretical modeling and approximating from similar data (see Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">1.1</xref>). More precisely, it means to combine and adapt existing or newly gathered data from different sources to fit together in one process dataset, sometimes requiring recalculations based on theory. Often in LCA literature, a typical data collection procedure is depicted as uncomplicated, where a complete and ready-to-use LCI dataset can be acquired from one single source, or at least several sources describing the same process or facility (Nordelöf and Tillman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2018</xref>). And indeed, with quick look at one example, the data gathered from the Aros factory for PCB assembly can be viewed as complete from one single source, but when going into details there was a need for adaption and supplements. This was illustrated during the modeling of solder paste application where literature data (Deubzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>) and expert judgments (Edgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>) had to be combined with the factory data, in order to model the processes in line with the inverter design. A benefit of data building is that the dataset can be made flexible and relevant.</p><p id="Par74">Using the data building approach, the role of expert consultation cannot be underestimated as a method to clarify specific details, to provide general technical information as a basis for assumptions and simplifications, and to confirm examples of practices or procedural descriptions provided by research articles and textbooks, as in the case when Lenz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>) confirmed the industrial relevance of the precise DCB bonding heat cycle described in a journal article by Ning et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par75">Finally, it was found that modeling of furnace processes in different stages of electronics manufacturing is a challenge. Frequent reasonability checks were required, because results were non-intuitive. A good example is given by the energy per square meter of product required for sintering ceramic substrates at 1600–1700 °C for 24 h (21 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>), which is much lower compared to the total energy for the surface mounting of PCBs, where reflow soldering at 260 °C and oven drying of the conformal coating at 80 °C, taking a total time of less than 30 min, are the main consumers of energy (46 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>). The key observation is that energy consumption per unit is always highly dependent on the throughput, i.e., the ability to utilize the furnace efficiently in terms of load rate and stand-by time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Accessing the LCI model file and model report</title><p id="Par76">The life cycle inventory model file (Nordelöf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2017</xref>) and the model report (Nordelöf and Alatalo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>) can be downloaded from the SPINE database provided by Swedish Life Cycle Center:</p><p id="Par77"><ext-link xlink:href="http://cpmdatabase.cpm.chalmers.se/Scripts/sheet.asp?ActId=JT-2017-06-26-43" ext-link-type="uri">http://cpmdatabase.cpm.chalmers.se/Scripts/sheet.asp?ActId=JT-2017-06-26-43</ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I would like to express my gratitude to the Area of Advance Energy at Chalmers University of Technology for funding the project.
