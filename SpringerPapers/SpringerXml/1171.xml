Using lasers and microwaves as vectors, long-distance wireless power transmission technology can be applied to terrestrial power distribution systems, space energy utilization, unmanned networking, and unmanned clusters. Wireless transfer of power between subsystems and “unlimited” power supply for weapons equipment can be achieved in principle. This paper mainly analyzes the technical characteristics of laser wireless power transmission and microwave wireless power transmission systems, and proposes two types of methods for testing the performance of such wireless power transmission systems. Compared with the existing methods, our methods has the following advantages: (1) The components and systems are tested respectively, and the size, power and efficiency evaluation indexes are put forward; (2) According to the evaluation index, the specific measuring point position, testing instrument and testing process are put forward; (3) The wireless energy transmission system has greater power and longer transmission distance, which has more practical reference significance. In addition, a performance test that uses a testing device is carried out, some key parameters such as power and efficiency are obtained, which provides the basis for the subsequent development of relevant work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Related work</title><p id="Par3">The long-distance wireless power transmission technology mainly considers laser wireless power transmission and microwave wireless power transmission systems. The principle of laser wireless power transmission is the transmitting end converts the electrical energy into a laser beam using a photoelectric device, and the receiving end converts the laser beam energy back into electrical energy. Its merits are long transmission distance, strong directivity, small transceiver antenna aperture, concentrated energy. Its shortcomings are high energy consumption, sensitivity to clouds and obstacles, low transmission efficiency. Laser wireless power transmission is commonly used for unmanned aerial vehicles, microsatellites, space probes, wireless sensor networks. Microwave wireless power transmission’s transmitter uses a vacuum device to convert the electrical energy to microwaves, and the receiver uses a rectifier to convert the microwaves to direct current. Its merits are large transmission power, small transmission loss in the atmosphere, one-to-many transmission. Its shortcomings are large scattering loss, jamming communication equipment, low efficiency, large antenna aperture. Microwave wireless power transmission is commonly used for distributed satellite platforms, solar power stations, deep space exploration.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Laser wireless power transmission</title><p id="Par4">In the laser-based wireless power transmission process, the electrical energy in a power grid or energy storage unit is converted by a laser power source and is provided to a laser. The laser converts the electrical energy into a laser beam, which is captured by a photovoltaic array. The laser output is converted into electrical energy at the receiving end after free-space transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The laser-based wireless power transmission technology is advantageous owing to its high energy density, strong energy convergence, strong directivity, long transmission distances, and small transmission/reception aperture (only 10% of that of a typical microwave wireless power transmission system). After long-distance transmission, the laser beam is still concentrated and suitable for powering long-distance mobile devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, laser-based energy transmission can be used for ground electric energy distribution, spatial scientific research, spatial energy utilization, and concealed spatial communications. It provides energy for mobile electric equipment such as mobile base stations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), airships, robots, deep-space probes, and module spacecraft.</p><p id="Par5">In 2004, inspired by concentration cells, Howell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] designed a receiver for laser-based power transmission signals. On the front surface of a GaAs photovoltaic cell (diameter, 4 mm), a lens (diameter, 3.7 cm) was used for collecting light. In the experiment, the laser wavelength was 830 nm and the power was 0.52 W. The optimized photoelectric conversion efficiency of the laser-receiving system was above 56%. In 2010, the US Naval Laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] simulated the effects of different laser power densities on the characteristics of InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells, which were irradiated by three laser systems (wavelengths at  555 nm,  860 nm, and  1510 nm). The objective was to optimize the laser wavelength and power density through calculations. In 2013, He [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] reported a laser power transmission ground system for studying the energy transmission efficiency. Using this system, the effects of the laser wavelength and different photovoltaic device materials on the energy transmission efficiency were quantified. In 2014, Qiao and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] studied the effects of the laser wavelength and laser power density on the energy conversion efficiency of GaAs photovoltaic cells. In their experiment, lasers with the wavelengths of 532 nm, 671 nm, 808 nm, and 980 nm irradiated GaAs batteries at 2 m, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the irradiated GaAs batteries exhibited a single-peak characteristic as a function of the laser power density.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Microwave wireless power transmission</title><p id="Par6">In the microwave-based wireless power transmission (MWPT) process, the city power system completes the conversion of high-voltage direct current (DC) through a power supply. Alternating current (AC) is converted into microwaves by a vacuum device, and the resulting waves are emitted using a transmitting antenna. Using a rectifying device, the receiving antenna receives and converts the microwave energy into DC power output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The output power range is 10–100 kW; the transmission distance range is 1–20 km. The microwave-based wireless power transmission technology is advantageous owing to its high transmission power, strong environmental adaptability, flexible focusing and scattering, high conversion and transmission efficiency, low atmospheric loss, and strong penetration. This technology can be used for high-precision controlled beam pointing. With high security, it is suitable for powering long-distance unmanned equipment and for information exchange in complex environments. It can also be used for ground power distribution, space energy utilization, and microsensor-based energy communications, providing fast and convenient energy requirements for mobile electrical equipment such as microsensors, drones, and distributed satellites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In 1984, Brown applied the plane technology to designing a rectifier antenna for microwave wireless power transmission systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in which the receiving antenna was a planar dipole and the rectifier diode was directly connected to two metal strip lines (the so-called CPS transmission line). Later, Chang and co-workers applied a CPS-feeding dual rhombic loop to the receiving antenna. This loop had high gain, broadband, and circular polarization characteristics. In 2014, Yang and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] published a review on the two types of rectifier antenna elements and arrays. AC-band MWPT system was designed for meeting the requirements of high beam capture efficiency to the distribution of the transmitting antenna aperture. Japanese Mitsubishi researchers converted 10 kW of electricity into microwaves and used wireless power transmission to successfully power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the receiving device, from a distance of 500 m. From 2008 to 2011, technical research has been performed in the US about the ground microwave wireless power transmission tests at a distance of 100 km, an airship energy supply test for a height of 20 km, a space solar power station platform ground test for 100 kW, and a microwave driven lunar rover ground test for 20 kW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods for testing the laser wireless power transmission systems</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Testing index</title><p id="Par8">Technical indexing can be divided into transmitter, space transmission, and receiver indices, according to the system composition, and it can also be divided into size, power, and efficiency indexing, according to the index type.

The efficiency of the AC-optical power conversion was reduced by 10%, and the waveform was consistent with the trend of the electro-optical conversion efficiency. The energy loss in semiconductor lasers can occur via five routes: (1) Joule heating, (2) carrier leakage, (3) subthreshold spontaneous emission, (4) voltage loss, and 5) photon scattering and carrier absorption loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As the power supply of the laser increases, the carriers are injected into the active region, and the non-radiative recombination loss and photon scattering loss also increase. The structural parameters of the laser make these mutually restrictive. When an optimal working point is reached, the balance is broken; past the optimal working point, the efficiency starts to decrease slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The AC-optical power conversion efficiency exhibits similar trends.

The increasing temperature affects the performance of the power amplifiers gain, gain flatness, and linearity; thus, affecting the systems transmission efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The partial data measured in the experiment are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Diagram of the microwave-based power transmission system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13638_2020_1874_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">The transmission frequency of the high-power microwave transmission system was 10 GHz, the transmission distance was 100 m, the transmitting antenna aperture area was 2 m<inline-formula id="IEq25"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq25_Math"><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq25_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The power of the microwave-based wireless power transmission system was 4500 W, and the electric-electric conversion efficiency reached 10.4% for the transmission distance of 70 m. The key parameters of the components and systems were obtained from these testing experiments, proving the feasibility of the proposed testing methods. The results provide a solid framework for the performance evaluation of long-distance wireless power transmission systems.
