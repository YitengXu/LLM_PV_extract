For example, dual- and triple-junction solar cells based on III–V compound semiconductor materials such as InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs have been demonstrated to show over 37% power conversion efficiency (PCE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, several other photovoltaic materials, including a-Si, CIGS and various polymers, have also been explored in order to fabricate efficient tandem solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition to the tandem structure achieved with similar class materials, two substantially different solar cell materials have also been incorporated into tandem solar cell construction. For example, tandem solar cells fabricated with a-Si and a polymer have been demonstrated to show enhanced voltage and power conversion efficiency compared to conventional single-junction solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the tandem architecture of a DSSC with GaAs or polymer is reported to show high voltages of 1.8 and 1.36 V, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recently, Liska et al. and Wenger et al. suggested the possibility of a tandem type of architecture with DSSC and CIGS based on mechanical stacking as well as a monolithic conjunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Such a tandem construction of DSSC with CIGS seems to be an ideal design owing to the optical band-gaps of DSSC (~1.7 eV) and CIGS (~1.1 eV), making them suitable for use as top and bottom cells, respectively (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, CIGS offers the feasibility of tuning the band-gap by adept control of its composition. This property is particularly beneficial for tandem solar cell applications. For example, by substituting In with Ga and/or Se with S, the band-gap of CIGS can be gradually increased in the range between 1.0 (CuInSe<sub>2</sub>) and 2.4 eV (CuGaS<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, from the viewpoint of manufacturing costs, the DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell would be a competitive option, given the advantage of the economic viability of DSSCs prepared by solution processes. However, to realize a further reduction in the cost of DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cells, it is necessary to develop low-cost and high-throughput solution processing methods (e.g., printing) for the fabrication of the bottom CIGS cell, which is currently fabricated by a vacuum-based method such as co-evaporation. Recently, solution-based fabrication methods for CIGS thin films have attracted much attention due to their potential for realizing low-cost and printable solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The highest efficiencies of solution processed CIGS thin film solar cells have been reported to be 15.2% (hydrazine based)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and 12% (non-hydrazine based)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Among the various solution-based synthesis methods, the fabrication of CIGS thin films using nanoparticle ink has potential. This method offers the advantage of fabricating CIGS thin films with uniform and well-controlled compositions by starting from stoichiometry-controlled CIGS nanoparticles, thereby eliminating the impurity phases that could significantly deteriorate the device performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. With subsequent sintering of the as-prepared film, the nanoparticles are converted to uniform films of high crystallinity and a large grain size, which in turn lead to a high solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 12%, as demonstrated by Guo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup><fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of the DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell structure (upper) and spectral irradiance of solar light adapted from reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> and external quantum efficiencies of a DSSC (red) and a CIGS (blue) single-junction solar cell used in the study (bottom).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08970_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>One of the major issues in the fabrication of efficient tandem DSSC/CIGS cells (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) is to control the electrical/optical properties of the interface between the DSSC and the CIGS. A Pt-based catalytic layer is deposited on the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer of the CIGS thin film solar cell such as Al-doped ZnO (AZO) and Sn-doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (ITO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The role of the Pt catalytic layer is effectively to reduce the overpotential for the reduction of the <inline-formula id="IEq1"/> ions to I<sup>-</sup> ions by the photoelectrons coming out from the underneath CIGS solar cell. However, the existence of the Pt catalytic layer inevitably decreases the optical transmittance, which should lead to a decrease in the photocurrent from the bottom cell and to a photocurrent mismatch in the tandem solar cell. Therefore, it is desirable to prepare Pt catalysts with high catalytic properties and high optical transmittance simultaneously. The Pt catalytic layer in a DSSC is conventionally prepared via a simple thermal decomposition method using a Pt precursor (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>), followed by sintering at 380–450°C under ambient conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, this method cannot be applied during the fabrication of a DSSC/CIGS tandem cell, as the bottom CIGS cell, fabricated prior to the Pt layer, is vulnerable to high-temperature treatments. Therefore, it is crucial to identify a suitable low-temperature preparation method for the fabrication of the Pt layer.</p><p>In this study, a Pt interfacial layer was deposited by the arc-plasma deposition (APD) technique, which is considered to be a low-temperature and softer deposition method that could minimize the damage to the AZO and CIGS absorber films. The DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell was fabricated via a simple solution-based process by preparing the CIGS absorber film for the bottom cell using CIGS nanoparticle ink. We have therefrom demonstrated a DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell that shows a higher solar cell performance (PCE of 13.0%) than the corresponding single-junction devices of DSSC (~7.25%) or CIGS (~6.2%). Note that this value is higher than the champion cell efficiencies of the constituent single-junction solar cells in the literature, i.e., 11.2% of N719 dye-based DSSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and 12% of nanoparticle ink-based CIGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As mentioned earlier, one of the most important components in the DSSC/CIGS tandem architecture is the Pt catalyst deposited on the AZO layer of a CIGS thin film solar cell. The APD method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> involves the direct evaporation of a solid metal target into a highly ionized plasma pulse in vacuum (~3x10<sup>−5</sup> Torr). The kinetic energy of the evaporated metal nanoparticles is relatively low (tens of eV) and hence these nanoparticles can be deposited onto a substrate without causing significant damage to the substrate surface. The pulsed deposition mode (i.e., enough idle time between plasma pulses) along with the low kinetic energy of the evaporated nanoparticles also prevents the temperature from increasing in the samples (&lt;100°C). Another advantage of the APD method is that the amount of metal deposits can be controlled easily and accurately by changing deposition parameters such as the number of plasma pulses (<italic>n</italic>), the discharge condenser voltage (<italic>V</italic>) and the discharge condenser capacitance (<italic>C</italic>). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2a–e</xref> show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Pt catalysts deposited using the APD method with different values of <italic>n</italic> (10, 20, 40, 60 and 80), where glass substrates with an amorphous carbon film were used for the coverage estimation. Isolated Pt nanoparticles with a diameter of ~2 nm were observed after 10 plasma pulses (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and the density of Pt nanoparticles increases with an increase in the number of plasma pulses, resulting in an almost continuous Pt film after 60 pulses. The catalytic properties of the APD-deposited Pt layer was investigated in terms of the conversion efficiency of DSSCs incorporating APD-Pt catalysts with different values of <italic>n</italic> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, filled squares), where the conversion efficiency increases with an increase in the number of plasma pulses. This result shows that more Pt catalysts with more plasma pulses would be beneficial to enhance the device performance of the single-junction DSSC. In the case of a DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell, however, the optical transmittance of the catalytic layer is also very important, because it directly influences light harvesting by the bottom CIGS solar cell and the resulting photocurrent generation. In this context, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of Pt layers deposited on glass substrates using the APD method with different values of <italic>n</italic> have been investigated. Given that the bottom CIGS cell can only absorb photons that have passed through the top DSSC, transmittance values at 800 nm are compared (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> (open squares), the optical transmittance at 800 nm decreases with an increase in the number of plasma pulses, especially after 40 pulses, which is consistent with the TEM analysis. Owing to the trade-off between the DSSC performance and light harvesting by the bottom CIGS, the optimal condition for the Pt deposition by APD was set to 40 pulses. It should be noted that the conversion efficiency of a DSSC with a Pt layer deposited by APD (40 pulses, 7.25 (±0.26)%) was slightly higher than that of a DSSC with Pt layer deposited by the conventional thermal sintering method (7.16%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Pt nanoparticles deposited on amorphous carbon films by the arc-plasma deposition (APD) method with different plasma pulses (a) 10, (b) 20, (c) 40, (d) 60 and (e) 80 and optical transmittance at 800 nm of APD-Pt layers on glass substrates (left y-axis in (f)) and conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with APD-Pt catalyst (right y-axis in (f)) as a function of the plasma pulses.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08970_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In order to realize the solution processed fabrication of a DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell, we adopted the nanoparticle ink-based coating method for the deposition of CIGS absorber film. In this study, the method that was originally developed by Guo et al. was slightly modified for the fabrication of the absorber film of the CIGS bottom cell (see Methods section). Briefly, the CIGS film was formulated from CIGS nanoparticles, which were synthesized via the hot injection route using Cu, In and Ga acetylacetonate precursors and elemental S. Subsequently, ink composed of CIGS nanoparticles and hexanethiol was doctor-bladed and preheated under ambient conditions. After a sodium treatment, the film was annealed under selenium vapor to allow the substitution of Se for S and to facilitate crystal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> shows the cross-sectional configuration of the CIGS bottom cell. As shown in the figure, the CIGS thin film shows large-sized grains (~1 μm) with a very low degree of porosity (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3a and b</xref>). Moreover, we could observe an amorphous layer with a thickness of 540 nm at the interfacial region of the Mo substrate, as marked by the dashed lines in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. This amorphous layer could be a residual carbon layer of the type often observed in solution-processed CIGS thin films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This hypothesis was further substantiated by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) for an elemental analysis, which confirmed the presence of carbon near the Mo layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, the selenization of the Mo substrate resulted in the formation of a MoSe<sub>2</sub> layer with a thickness of 580 nm. Furthermore, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, a</xref> CdS buffer layer and i-ZnO and AZO window layers were deposited onto the top surface of the CIGS absorber film. Owing to the deposition of the AZO film, the top surface of the CIGS bottom cell appears to be very dense (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In particular, we deposited a thicker AZO film (2500 nm), approximately five times thicker than the conventional CIGS solar cell (500 nm), in order to protect the underneath CdS/CIGS layers during the deposition of Pt. Pt deposition by APD (40 pulses) resulted in the formation of smaller Pt nanoparticles on the top of the AZO surface, corresponding to the single-layer thickness of Pt particles (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The representative single-junction CIGS thin film solar cell (closest one to the average efficiency value, 6.1 ± 0.5%, among the five cells) formed using the ZnO/CdS/CIGS films deposited onto Mo-coated glass shows a power conversion efficiency of 6.2%, with <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> and FF values of 26.3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, 450 mV and 52.3%, respectively (see <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of bottom CIGS cell (AZO/i-ZnO/CdS/CIGS/Mo) (a), top-view SEM images of the CIGS film only (b) and AZO/i-ZnO/CdS/CIGS film (c) and TEM image of Pt nanoparticles deposited on AZO/i-ZnO/CdS/CIGS film by APD.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08970_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Current density-voltage (<italic>J–V</italic>) characteristics of DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell and DSSC and CIGS single-junction solar cells under 1 sun illumination.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08970_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The DSSC top cell was fabricated according to the conventional procedures reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. As in the typical process, a mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> film of thickness 20 μm was prepared by a paste-coating method, followed by sintering at 500°C. A TiO<sub>2</sub> blocking layer was also deposited between the FTO and mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> film in order to enhance the transmission of light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. N719 dye and <inline-formula id="IEq2"/> ions were employed as a sensitizer and redox couples, respectively. As mentioned earlier (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), the efficiency of a DSSC varies with respect to the deposited amount of the Pt layer. For tandem cell fabrication, we used a DSSC top cell with an average efficiency of ~7.25%, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.</p><p><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows the <italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic> characteristics of the DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell along with the DSSC and CIGS single-junction solar cells. The as-fabricated DSSC/CIGS tandem cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 13.0% (champion device) with an open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) of 1.17 V, a short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>) of 14.6 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a fill factor (FF) of 0.77. The measured <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of the tandem cell (1.17 V) was in fairly good agreement with the sum of the individual average <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> values for DSSC and CIGS single-junction cells (1.18 V). The plateau value of <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> for the tandem device (14.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) was slightly lower than that of the DSSC (14.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>). The <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> of CIGS bottom cell in the tandem configuration cannot be measured with two terminal electrodes (on top of the DSSC and at the bottom of the CIGS). It is also far from simple to estimate it by covering the CIGS with a dummy DSSC cell, due to the difficulties in applying DSSC components identical to those used for the top cell in the tandem structure. Nevertheless, the observation that the <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> of tandem cell is quite close to that of the DSSC suggests that the <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> values from both sub-cells are well balanced.</p><p>The FF of the tandem cell (0.77) was found to be much higher than those of the constituent DSSC (0.68) and CIGS (0.52) samples. This can be explained in part by considering the series and shunt resistances (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub>) connected in series. In principle, the <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> of a series-connected tandem device should be the sum of the <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> values for DSSC and CIGS samples. The slope values, d<italic>J</italic>/d<italic>V</italic>, at <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of the tandem and single-junction devices (7.59 Ωcm<sup>2</sup> for DSSC and 4.46 Ωcm<sup>2</sup> for CIGS) were thus compared as approximations to <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> values. The measured d<italic>J</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> value at <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of the tandem device (7.41 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>) was found to be smaller than the sum of d<italic>J</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> values for the constituent single-junction cells, 12.05 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>. The discrepancy is likely due to the absence of the FTO contribution to <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> in the tandem configuration (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> evaluation from the d<italic>J</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> value at high <italic>V</italic> regime of dark <italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic> curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>) also showed that the <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> of the tandem cell (1.1 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>) is smaller than the sum of the <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> values for DSSC (0.55 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>) and CIGS (1.2 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>). Similarly, it was proved that the series-connected shunt resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub> = (1.2 ± 0.5) × 10<sup>4</sup> Ωcm<sup>2</sup>) is also determined by the higher value of the two sub-cells, i.e., <italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub> of DSSC ((1.4 ± 0.8) × 10<sup>4</sup> Ωcm<sup>2</sup>). In comparison, <italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub> of CIGS was (3.1 ± 0.5) × 10<sup>2</sup> Ωcm<sup>2</sup>. As a consequence, the slope of the tandem device in the range of 0 to 1.0 V looks as flat as a DSSC, in contrast to a CIGS cell. This feature is an additional advantage of a tandem cell, particularly when employing a single cell with high shunt conductance, such as a CIGS cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A hypothetical tandem cell with two subcells having exactly complementary absorption profiles that do not overlap at all would have the efficiency close to the sum of the individual cell efficiencies. It is clear that this is not the case with the present combination of DSSC and CIGS solar cells as there is some amount of overlap in the absorption profiles of DSSC and CIGS, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Although we could not measure how high the CIGS bottom cell performs in the tandem configuration, we could estimate each device parameter of the bottom cell as follows. The <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of CIGS bottom cell (operating in the tandem cell) is rather straightforward to estimate, that is, <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>(CIGS) = <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>(tandem) − <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>(DSSC) = 1.170 V − 0.725 V = 0.445 V. This value is slightly smaller than that of the single-junction CIGS cell (0.450 V), which is reasonable. Assuming that the subcell current densities are well matched, the <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> of the CIGS bottom cell should be that of the tandem cell, i.e., 14.6 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Namely, the CIGS bottom cell loses its current by ~45% in comparison with the CIGS single cell (26.3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>). If the FF of CIGS bottom cell improves to such an extent that compensates for the current loss, the bottom cell may operate at the efficiency of PCE = <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> × <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> × FF = (0.445 V)(14.6 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)(0.79) = 5.1% having a <italic>J</italic>-<italic>V</italic> behavior shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>, where the FF of CIGS bottom cell, 0.79, was assumed to be slightly higher than that of tandem cell (0.77). The significant enhancement in FF value of CIGS bottom cell can be attributed to the reduction of shunt conductance that is in turn due to the series connection of shunting path of CIGS bottom cell to that of DSSC top cell as well as to the reduction of series resistance due to the absence of lateral collection path along the TCO layer. The sum of the resulting individual cell efficiencies is, thus, 7.3% (DSSC) + 5.1% (CIGS) = 12.4% (Tandem). If we used the highest efficiency value of our single junction DSSC (7.5%) the expected tandem cell efficiency can increase up to 12.6%. Although this estimation is very rough, we think it is enough to show that the measured tandem cell efficiency (13.0%) is not unrealistic. Besides this, the subcells used in tandem construction can be different from each single cell due to the insufficient reproducibility, as is implied by efficiency deviation (6.1 ± 0.5%) of single junction CIGS thin film solar cells.</p><p>It is worth noting that the present PCE (13.0%) is the highest value among the monolithic DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cells reported thus far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This is significant progress in that the present device fabricated with solution-processed CIGS surpasses the DSSC/CIGS tandem devices based on the vacuum-processed CIGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, we should also note that our current tandem solar cell devices are not stable enough mainly due to usage of corrosive idodine electrolyst (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5</xref>). The improvement of stability of the tandem cell device is under investigation in our lab by applying less corrosive electrolyte.</p><p>In brief, we present a strategy to construct an efficient DSSC/CIGS tandem architecture by solution-based coating method. A Pt-based interfacial catalytic layer is the most important component in a DSSC/CIGS tandem cell; therefore, its catalytic properties and optical transmittance should be well optimized to achieve a highly efficient tandem solar cell. The APD method was successfully employed for the Pt interfacial layer, showing best solar cell performance with 40 pulses. Notably, the DSSC/CIGS tandem solar cell revealed much higher solar cell performance (PCE of 13.0%) than the corresponding single-junction devices of DSSC (~7.25%) or CIGS (~6.2%) cells. Moreover, these are higher values than the champion cell efficiencies of the constituent single-junction solar cells, i.e., 11.2% from a N719 dye-based DSSC and 12% from a nanoparticle ink-based CIGS cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Fabrication of the DSSC cell</title><p>Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses (Pilkington, TEC-8) were washed in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath.
