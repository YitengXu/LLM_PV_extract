sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par19">Amid the findings of vast reserves of shale oil and convenient negligence towards its (alleged) side-effects on the environment, the utopian world of ‘hydrogen economy’ still looks distant. One of the key bottlenecks is the unavailability of economical and eco-friendly ways of hydrogen production. Credible research is underway for developing sustainable processes producing hydrogen through electrolysis of water using wind and solar power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, more alternatives are needed to complement these technologies. In this respect, fermentative hydrogen (biohydrogen) production at a higher temperature, thermophilic biohydrogen production, using renewable biomass can be a viable option.</p><p id="Par20"><italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species belong to a group of extremely thermophilic obligate anaerobes, which possess a natural ability to produce hydrogen from a wide range of mono-, di-, and oligo-saccharides and raw materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to this, various other beneficial metabolic features enable the genus <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> as one of the best, yet not ideal, groups of bacteria with the natural ability to produce H<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Within this genus, <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus</italic> and <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor owensensis</italic> are two of the best-studied species, both known to produce H<sub>2</sub> near the theoretical maximum of 4 mol · mol<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">However, increasing <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> (volumetric H<sub>2</sub> productivity; mmol · L<sup>−1</sup> · h<sup>−1</sup>) is one of the major challenges in developing a cost-effective biohydrogen process with <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species. The <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> depends on various factors such as cell density, extent of substrate conversion, and reactor configuration. The cell density can be increased by retaining more cells through different approaches, such as immobilization, cell entrapment, or cell retention. However immobilized or trapped cells can face mass transfer issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In contrast, biofilms, are well-organized structures, and are inherent to cell retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, biofilms generally follow ‘feed-and-bleed’ cycles allowing cell growth, which can be significant for growth-dependent product formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species, <italic>C. owensensis</italic> has been previously reported to form biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] mainly by flocculating at the bottom of the reactor. However, no further information could be found regarding the factor(s) leading to biofilm formation by <italic>C. owensensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) has been recognized as a ubiquitous secondary messenger in bacteria with multilayer control, i.e. at transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The c-di-GMP is synthesized using two molecules of guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) by the enzyme diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and is hydrolyzed by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Numerous studies have proven that high intracellular levels of c-di-GMP promote expression of extracellular-matrix related components needed for biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">So far, most of the research pertaining to biohydrogen has been performed to investigate the physiological properties of H<sub>2</sub>-producing microbes. These studies have mainly been performed in continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). However, CSTR systems do not allow cell retention. Hence, it is of paramount importance to evaluate alternative reactor types that can help retain the biomass. Several different reactor types, such as packed bed reactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], membrane bioreactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], anaerobic sequencing blanket reactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], trickle bed reactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and up-flow anaerobic (UA) reactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] aiding cell retention have been reported to produce H<sub>2</sub> at higher rates. In fact, UA reactors are widely exploited for studies pertaining to biogas production. Their medium recirculation loop aids in achieving higher substrate conversion and also allows cells to adhere to the biofilms flocculated at the bottom of reactor. On the other hand, in case of the CSTR, using carriers has been reported to increase <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> by several folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In this study we aimed to evaluate the biofilm forming potential of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> and <italic>C. owensensis</italic> in pure culture, and also evaluate whether <italic>C. owensensis</italic> through biofilm formation aids <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> when cultivated in co-cultures. Furthermore, we report the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP in both the organisms and its relationship with biofilm formation. We also evaluate the potential of UA reactors in improving <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> compared to CSTRs and whether carrier materials affect retaining the biomass and improving <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microorganism and its maintenance</title><p id="Par24"><italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> DSM 8903 and <italic>C. owensensis</italic> DSM 13100 were purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen (DSM) und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany).

The water height in the UA reactor was maintained at approximately 20 cm. The pH was maintained at 6.5 ± 0.1 at 70°C by automatic titration with 4 M NaOH. The temperature was thermostatically kept at 70 ± 1°C. In case of the CSTR, a condenser with 5°C cooling water was fitted to the bioreactor’s headplate and the stirring was kept at 250 rpm unless specified otherwise. The UA reactor’s top was fitted with a rubber cork inserted with a collection tube releasing the flue gas out of the reactor. During batch cultivations, culture samples were collected at different time intervals for monitoring growth, and the culture supernatant was collected for analysis of glucose, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, and ethanol. Gas samples were collected from the headspace to analyze levels of H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. During continuous cultures, samples for c-di-GMP were collected at steady state.

Thus, further investigations are needed to determine the implications of high d (h<sup>−1</sup>) on a biohydrogen process.</p><p id="Par50">Numerous studies have asserted that biofilm formation improves substrate conversion leading to increased <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similarly, in this study, formation of biofilm by co-cultures of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> and <italic>C. owensensis</italic> improved the substrate conversion in the CSTR as well as the UA reactor (Case A and E). However, it had a varied effect on <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub>. In the UA reactor biofilm formation indeed improved <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub>. In the CSTR, however, improved substrate conversion was accompanied by an increase in lactate production (Case A), which consequently subdued <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub>. This abnormality of the CSTR accumulating relatively higher amounts of reduced by-products, such as lactate and ethanol, than UA reactors (Case A and E) was also observed in a similar study comparing conversion of wheat straw hydrolysate using mixed culture in CSTR and UA reactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the present study, the aforementioned abnormality may have occurred due to the presence of a higher proportion of <italic>C. owensensis</italic> compared to <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> in the planktonic phase at high d (&gt;0.2 h<sup>−1</sup>) in the CSTR. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that <italic>C. owensensis</italic> produced higher amounts of lactate than <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> regardless of the reactor system (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C), and that unlike the CSTR, the UA reactors inherently allow biomass retention, thus perhaps a higher fraction of cells of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> were retained in the UA reactor compared to the CSTR when operated at higher d (h<sup>−1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Designed co-cultures versus pure cultures</title><p id="Par51">Regardless of the reactor system used, the co-cultures converted higher amounts of substrate and, in the UA, displayed higher <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> than the pure culture of each species. This is in agreement with previous studies, where designed co-cultures of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> and <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii</italic> showed higher H<sub>2</sub> yields than their pure cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

A similar observation has been made for <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> excreting compound(s) that boosted the growth of <italic>C. kristjanssonii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In fact, co-culture <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> boosted the growth performance of <italic>C. kristjanssonii</italic>, which can be interpreted as altruistic behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the current study, a similar behaviour was seen with <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> fortifying <italic>C. owensensis’</italic> ability to form biofilm. On its turn, <italic>C. owensensis</italic> showed altruistic behaviour by aiding <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> to take part in the biofilm formation (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This phenomenon is explained by ‘kin selection theory’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], according to which closely related species help each other to reproduce to pass its own genes on to next generation, even if indirectly. According to Hamilton’s rule, higher relatedness (r) between the species, higher fitness benefit (b) to the beneficiary, and lower fitness cost (c) to the altruist will ensure better cooperation (r × b – c &gt;0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This may explain why the co-culture of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> and <italic>C. kristjanssonii</italic> reported higher H<sub>2</sub> yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] than any of the mixed cultures consisting of microorganisms of various genera ever reported.

Finally, the observation of an unusual increase in biomass yield in the pure culture of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> (Case C) near its critical d (0.3 h<sup>−1</sup>) can be attributed to relatively higher energy spent by the culture on cell growth than product formation, as a reaction to wash-out conditions at a high d (h<sup>−1</sup>). A similar observation was reported in a previous study performed with <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As far as we know, this has not been described before in the literature, and a clear rationale behind this phenomenon is lacking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Effect of reactor system and culture conditions</title><p id="Par54">In UA reactors, only granular sludge provided a supporting bed to the flocculating biofilms of <italic>C. owensensis</italic> and <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic>.

Similar results were obtained in a previous study performed with <italic>Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum</italic> PSU-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, despite its benefits, the risk of contamination from hydrogenotrophic methanogens threatens the stability of UA reactors when granular sludge is used.

A recent study reported an increase in <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> yield by 70% and 30%, respectively, when cells of <italic>Thermotoga neapolitana</italic> were immobilized on porous glass beads in a CSTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Although, higher <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> (&gt;15 mmol · L<sup>−1</sup> · h<sup>−1</sup>) is desirable for better process economics, a higher H<sub>2</sub> yield (&gt;3 mol · mol<sup>−1</sup>) can certainly contribute to improving the process economics when relatively expensive raw materials are used.

Although the samples were collected from planktonic biomass and not the biofilm itself, since the biofilms go through feed-and-bleed cycles, the planktonic cells can be assumed to be representative of the cells in the biofilm. Conversely, in the absence of any biofilm, very low c-di-GMP levels were observed when stirring was applied in continuous cultures in the CSTR (Case B). However, batch cultures of <italic>C. owensensis</italic> accumulated high levels of c-di-GMP but no biofilm was observed, perhaps due to the stirring. Moreover, c-di-GMP levels in co-culture performed without stirring (Case A) increased as the concentration of residual sugar increased beyond 2 g · L<sup>−1</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This may be because of a combination of the fact that the flocculating cells of <italic>C. owensensis</italic> at the bottom of the CSTR did not have access to the influent feed being dropped from the top of the CSTR, and that cells of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> dominating the planktonic phase consumed most of the substrate until a d of 0.1 h<sup>−1</sup>, after which the residual concentration increased beyond 2 g · L<sup>−1</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Beyond that point the glucose gradient may have reached <italic>C. owensensis</italic> at the bottom, allowing the development of biofilms at d ≥0.2 h<sup>−1</sup>. Thus, it can be argued that if the co-cultures were performed at high substrate concentration, biofilm could have been obtained even at d &lt;0.2 h<sup>−1</sup>. This knowledge may help in achieving SLRs as well as biofilms at low d (h<sup>−1</sup>), similar to those obtained at high d (h<sup>−1</sup>) in this study. However, the vulnerability of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> to high osmotic pressure limits the option of performing cultures using feed with high substrate concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Alternatively, a reactor system such as a UA reactor which feeds the influent from bottom may also be more appropriate, as shown in the present study.</p><p id="Par58">Although, <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> possesses genes required for the synthesis of c-di-GMP, its intracellular levels are well below the critical level (40 μM).

Arguably, overexpression of DGC may elevate the levels of c-di-GMP in <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic>, allowing biofilm formation. Thus, encouraging <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> to form biofilms on its own may provide a better alternative to its co-culture with <italic>C. owensensis</italic>, considering the propensity of the latter to produce lactate and ethanol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">Only when grown together in co-culture do, <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> and <italic>C. owensensis</italic> form substantial amounts of biofilm, improving substrate conversion and <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub>.

Granular sludge showed superior support to biofilm formation in UA reactors. However, as sludge can be a potential source of methanogenic contaminants, it either needs proper pre-treatment, or more suitable alternatives should be found.

The maximum <italic>Q</italic><sub>H2</sub> obtained in this study was obtained at very high d (h<sup>−1</sup>) which may not be ideal for a reasonable process economics. Alternatively, a biofilm forming pure or co-cultures of <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species, which can withstand feed containing high substrate concentrations, can be operated at a reasonably low d (h<sup>−1</sup>), which will allow similar substrate loading rates to that obtained in this study at high d (h<sup>−1</sup>). The way forward for industrial application is to further exploit the concept of this designed co-culture in UA-type reactors using granular sludge-type of carriers for obtaining higher volumetric hydrogen productivities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SSP acknowledges support from the Swedish research council (VR).
