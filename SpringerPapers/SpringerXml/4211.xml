Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the microbiome profiles present in the human body have become publicly available. Hence, many works have been done to analyze human microbiome profiles. These works have identified that different microbiome profiles are present in healthy and sick individuals for different diseases. Recently, several computational methods have utilized the microbiome profiles to automatically diagnose and classify the host phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In this work, a novel deep learning framework based on boosting GraphSAGE is proposed for automatic prediction of diseases from metagenomic data. The proposed framework has two main components, (a). Metagenomic Disease graph (MD-graph) construction module, (b). Disease prediction Network (DP-Net) module. The graph construction module constructs a graph by considering each metagenomic sample as a node in the graph. The graph captures the relationship between the samples using a proximity measure. The DP-Net consists of a boosting GraphSAGE model which predicts the status of a sample as sick or healthy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real and synthetic datasets corresponding to diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. The proposed model achieved a highest AUC of 93%, Accuracy of 95%, F1-score of 95%, AUPRC of 95% for the real inflammatory bowel disease dataset and a best AUC of 90%, Accuracy of 91%, F1-score of 87% and AUPRC of 93% for the real colorectal cancer dataset.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The proposed framework outperforms other machine learning and deep learning models in terms of classification accuracy, AUC, F1-score and AUPRC for both synthetic and real metagenomic data.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metagenomics</kwd><kwd>Disease prediction</kwd><kwd>Ensemble GNN</kwd><kwd>GraphSAGE</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Deep learning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>126</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12859_2023_Article_5251.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Bioinformatics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Microarrays</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computational Biology/Bioinformatics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Appl. in Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Algorithms</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par23">The human body is the habitat for trillions of diverse and complex microbes (microbiota or microbiome). These microbes reside in various body sites (skin, gut, ear, mouth, nose, stool etc.) and play a vital role in (a) shaping and controlling human health, (b) developing the human immune system and (c) affecting human metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most abundant and the largely studied microbes are found in the human gut. Research works have found that the dysbiosis of the human gut microbiome can cause many host diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity, diabetes, and liver cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, due to the emergence of various next generation sequencing techniques, huge amounts of human microbiome sequence data are available. This in turn has become the motivation for developing computational methods to identify the relationships between bacterial composition and functions with the diseases.</p><p id="Par24">The microbiome sequence data is used to characterize the microbiome profiles for a deeper analysis. Many tools such as QIIME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], MetaPhlAn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] are available for taxonomy profiling of the human microbiome sequence data. These tools provide the relative abundance of each taxonomic group or the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in the microbiome sequence data. Thus, a sample in the human microbiome metagenomic dataset is described by the abundance of the OTUs. This abundance of the different taxa of microbiomes are used as meaningful indicators for the disease status of each host sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Due to the availability of vast amounts of human metagenomic data, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are being used to analyze and identify the relationships between different microbes and the relationship between microbes and host diseases. Recently, many works have been published in automatic disease prediction using human gut microbiome metagenomic data with ML and DL techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These works essentially used ML algorithms like support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), deep forest (DF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and DL methods like convolutional neural network (CNN) and autoencoders. The ML and DL methods have achieved relatively moderate results as they suffer due to high dimension of the metagenomic datasets. Thus, there is still room for improving the classification performance of these models.</p><p id="Par26">Researchers have always tried to improve and optimize classification models to achieve better accuracy. Ensemble learning is a widely used technique to improve the classification accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It could also help with metagenomic datasets where a single classifier model might not obtain superior performance due to the huge dimension of the datasets. It aggregates two or more base classifiers to improve the predictive performance of the combined classifier. Thus, it overcomes the weakness of a single weak base classifier.</p><p id="Par27">Though several ML and DL models are used for metagenomic disease prediction, it could be noted that the graph neural network (GNN) models such as Graph SAmple and aggreGatE (GraphSAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and graph convolutional network (GCN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have not been applied for this purpose. One possible reason might be that the metagenomic data lack the inherent graph structure, as GNNs require graph structured data as input. The previous works on metagenomic disease classification using ML and DL methods have used the abundance of the OTUs present in the human microbiome metagenomic sample as the features for the disease prediction problem. However, these works have failed to model the relationship between the samples in the dataset for disease classification purpose in the form of a graph.</p><p id="Par28">Inspired by ensemble learning and GCNs, this work proposes a novel framework for automatic metagenomic disease prediction. The proposed framework involves three steps. Firstly, the distance matrix is calculated from the OTU table. Secondly, a metagenomic disease graph (MD-graph) is constructed using the distance matrix. The MD-graph models the samples as the nodes. The edges between the graph nodes are constructed based on the assumption that similar samples exhibit similar features. Finally, the Disease prediction Network (DP-Net) module is constructed with ensemble of GraphSAGE models. The DP-Net is used to predict the sample phenotype.</p><p id="Par29">All things considered, the proposed framework put forward the following contributions. <list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par30">An ensemble model based on GraphSAGE for disease prediction using human gut microbiome metagenomic data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">A novel graph construction method to construct the MD-graph from the gut microbiome metagenomic data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">The efficiency of the proposed framework is studied by applying it to two different real disease datasets like IBD, and CRC.

The study done in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] performed a comprehensive study by applying classical ML methods like SVM and RF for disease prediction to six metagenomic datasets spanning five diseases (type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, liver cirrhosis, CRC and IBD).</p><p id="Par34">Subsequent to this, the work conducted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] analyzed various ML algorithms like SVM, RF, XGB, DF and an autoencoder pre-trained deep neural network (AutoNN) for disease prediction from metagenomic data. The work applied the ML and DL algorithms to six disease datasets to predict the sample status as healthy or sick. The authors used two features such as <italic>k</italic>-mer abundances and OTU abundances.</p><p id="Par35">An automated software called MetaDP was developed by the study of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to perform data analysis of amplicon-sequenced metagenomic data for disease classification. The disease addressed in this work was intestinal bowel syndrome (IBS), and SVM was used as the classifier. In a similar work in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], an ML framework called MicroPheno was proposed to classify host phenotypes as healthy or disease using metagenomic data. The Micropheno framework predicted Crohn’s disease using SVM and RF classifiers. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], SVM and MLP were used for classifying a given metagenomic sample into IBD or healthy class. The work combined two types of features such as the OTU abundances and gene group abundance and finally developed a hybrid classifier.</p><p id="Par36">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], a DL model called metaNN was proposed to classify the host phenotype into IBD or healthy with an IBD dataset. This work used two neural networks (NN) models like MLP and a CNN, along with sample augmentation using statistical methods and microbe abundance profiles. The authors observed that data augmentation improved the classification performance of both ML and DL models. Also, results indicated that DL models are better than ML models as they perform automatic feature engineering.</p><p id="Par37">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] a new method called met2Img was proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The authors used T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor (t-SNE) embeddings for generating synthetic images from abundance data. Then, a CNN was used to classify five diseases. By converting each sample feature as images, the CNN could efficiently retrieve the patterns present in the sample. In another work by the same authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], a CNN was used for classifying samples from a CRC dataset from different cohorts such as Chinese, Austrian, American, German, and French into sick or healthy samples. A NN model called TaxoNN was proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which utilized an ensemble of CNNs for disease prediction. TaxoNN applied the model on two disease datasets such as T2D and cirrhosis. The model incorporated a stratified approach to group the entire OTUs into phylum clusters, and different CNNs were trained within each cluster. Finally, the features obtained from each cluster were concatenated, which improved the classification accuracy of TaxoNN.</p><p id="Par38">A CNN based model proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] implemented a new layer called phylo-conv layer to discriminate the subclasses of IBD. Patristic distance was used to find neighbors of taxa from the phylogenetic tree. Then, the phylogenetic tree OTUs were embedded in a euclidean space using multi-dimensional scaling. CNN was used to apply convolution over <italic>k</italic> nearest neighbors of the OTUs in the dataset. The proposed CNN reported promising results when compared with state-of-the-art ML algorithms. Another recent study by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] proposed a model called pophy-cnn, which was built using a CNN to predict the host phenotype of sample from four different disease datasets. The biological information of taxa present in a sample is obtained from the phylogenetic tree. This information and the relative abundance value were embedded in a 2-dimensional matrix. Then, a 2-dimensional CNN was used for classification. The authors claimed that their model got significant improvement in performance when applied on nine disease datasets.</p><p id="Par39">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents a summary of the review done on the disease classification in metagenomic data. According to the literature, many works have used both ML and DL methods. Most of the works used CNN as the DL method for classifying metagenomic samples. There are few works which used GCN and variational auto encoders (VAE) for feature extraction and reduction from genomic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, we observed that GNNs, such as GraphSAGE, have not been widely applied in the area of microbiome analysis to predict diseases. Moreover, none of the existing works have converted the OTU data into a graph and utilized the success rate of GraphSAGE in node classification.</p><p id="Par40">In this work, the metagenomic data is converted to a graph called MD-graph using a novel graph construction method and a boosting GraphSAGE is used to predict the class label of samples in the dataset.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of work done on disease classification in metagenomics data using ML/DL methods</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Reference</p></th><th align="left"><p>ML/DL approach(es) used</p></th><th align="left"><p>Diseases considered</p></th><th align="left"><p>Input features</p></th><th align="left"><p>Remarks/observations</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>SVM, RF</p></td><td align="left"><p>T2D, CRC, cirrhosis, IBD, obesity</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>RF with feature selection outperformed basic RF and SVM classifiers with best AUC of 74%, 88.1%, 94.6%, 89.3%, 65.6% with T2D, CRC, cirrhosis, IBD, and obesity datasets respectively.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>SVM, RF, XGB, DF, AutoNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>T2D, CRC, cirrhosis, IBD, obesity</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance, <italic>k</italic>-mer frequency</p></td><td align="left"><p>The proposed AutoNN model achieved the best accuracy of 66.3% using OTU feature on T2D dataset.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>SVM</p></td><td align="left"><p>IBS</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The software package called metaDP can be used for classifying other disease samples.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>SVM, RF</p></td><td align="left"><p>Crohn’s disease</p></td><td align="left"><p><italic>k</italic>-mer frequency</p></td><td align="left"><p>The best F1-score of 76% was achieved by RF classifier with <italic>k</italic>-mer feature.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>SVM, MLP</p></td><td align="left"><p>IBD</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance gene group abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The proposed hybrid classifier achieved an AUC of 80%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>MLP, CNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>IBD</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The model achieved the best AUC of 89% with MLP by using data augmentation technique.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>CNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>T2D, IBD, cirrhosis, CRC, obesity</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The model achieved the best accuracy of 84.2% and 66.3% for IBD and obesity datasets respectively.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>CNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>CRC</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The model achieved the best AUC of 75.7% with CNN .</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>CNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>T2D, cirrhosis.</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The ensemble CNN achieved 76.2% AUC on T2D dataset and 91.1% on cirrhosis dataset</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>CNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>IBD</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance</p></td><td align="left"><p>The model ph-CNN achieved the best Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 92%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p></td><td align="left"><p>CNN</p></td><td align="left"><p>IBD, T2D, obesity, cirrhosis</p></td><td align="left"><p>OTU abundance, phylogenetic relationship</p></td><td align="left"><p>The model PopPhy-CNN achieved the best F1-score of 58.7% for Obesity dataset.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par41">Disease prediction from metagenomic samples is the task of predicting if a given sample is healthy or sick based on the microbiome profile.

In this work, to begin with, we use the median of the values (<italic>m</italic>) of the distance matrix as the threshold value <italic>t</italic>. The reason behind selecting the median value as the threshold is that the median of a set of values mark the middle value. Moreover, choosing the median value resulted in inclusion of reasonable amount of neighbors (that is less than the maximum number of neighbors for a graph node) for all the graph nodes for all the datasets. If we do not use a distance threshold, then every graph node is considered as the neighbor of every other graph node. In that case, the resulting MD-graph would be too dense.

The node feature representations are helpful for prediction and graph analysis tasks. GraphSAGE uses an inductive approach, where the model discovers rules from the train samples, which are then applied to the test samples. Also, GraphSAGE has two improvements to the original GCN. Firstly, unlike the full graph training used in GCN, GraphSAGE uses a small batch training method by sampling the neighbors of a graph node. Secondly, the algorithm implements different aggregator functions for aggregating the features of the neighbors. Thus, GraphSAGE generates feature representation for each node by sampling and aggregating the features of nodes in its neighborhood.

The iterative phase comprises of M boosting rounds. At each boosting round, bootstrap samples of size N are drawn from the train set. These samples are used to train the base GraphSAGE at that round. Once the base GraphSAGE at a boosting round is learned, the train set is supplied as input to the model, which predicts the class labels of all the samples in the train set. The predictions are used to calculate the error rate and the importance of the base GraphSAGE. It should be noted that if the error rate is high then, the importance of the base GraphSAGE is low and vice versa. The importance of the base GraphSAGE is then used to update the weights of the samples in the train set for the next boosting round. Thus, the boosting GraphSAGE model works by assigning adaptive weights to each sample in the train set (i.e) the weights of the samples are changed at each boosting round. The sample weights also play an essential role in drawing the bootstrap samples (i.e.) the higher the weight of a sample, the higher the probability of the sample being included in the bootstrap. Formally, the steps in boosting GraphSAGE algorithm can be explained as follows</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Initialization phase</title><p id="Par69"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par70">The entire dataset is split into train and test set, where the train set is used to train the M base GraphSAGEs in the boosting GraphSAGE model sequentially.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par71">The weight vector <inline-formula id="IEq99"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq99_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq99_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The comparison is made according to the results achieved by each model in terms of the AUC, ACC, F1-score and AUPRC. Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> presents the summary of results achieved by all the models on real datasets. From the results it is evident that the boosing GraphSAGE model outperforms all the graph ensemble models, the single GraphSAGE, the single GCN, and other traditional ML and ensemble models in classifying the real disease datasets.</p><p id="Par104">For the IBD dataset, the results show that ML models like SVM, RF, DF, XGB and MLP exhibit low F1-score. Among the ML models the SVM classifier achieves the best F1-score. One possible reason for the low performance of these classifiers can be the data imbalance. By analyzing the results of the single GNN models, the single GraphSAGE model outperforms the single GCN. In addition, the single GNNs outperform all the individual ML and ensemble ML models. Even though all the ensemble GNN models significantly improve the performance, the boosting GraphSAGE outperforms all the other models for all considered evaluation metrics. The boosting GraphSAGE achieves the best performance with an AUC of 93%, an ACC of 95%, an F1-score of 95% and an AUPRC of 95%.</p><p id="Par105">For the CRC dataset, it is evident from the results that all the individual ML and ensemble ML models face difficulty achieving good results even though the dataset is balanced. The poor results may be due to the small sample size and high dimensionality of the dataset. From the results, it can be observed that SVM is the worst-performing classifier. The XGB performs better when compared to individual ML and ensemble classifiers. When analyzing the GNN models, it is observed that all the GNN models (i.e.) the single and ensemble models outperform the individual ML and ensemble models. Out of the GNN models, the single GCN performs poorly. The boosting and bagging GCN perform better than the single GCN but their performance is less than that of a single GraphSAGE model. However, the boosting GraphSAGE model achieves the best results, of 90% AUC, 91% ACC, 87% F1-score and 93% AUPRC.</p><p id="Par106">Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> presents the summary of results achieved by all the models on synthetic datasets. The synthetic datasets have more samples than the real datasets and follow the same ratio of data imbalance as in the real dataset. As the number of samples increased in the synthetic dataset, the performance of all the models improved. From the results, it can be observed that for the IBD_synthetic dataset, the SVM classifier and all the variations of the GCN model (i.e., single GCN, boosting GCN, and bagging GCN) perform poorly when compared to other models with respect to ACC, AUC, F1-score and AUPRC. The RF classifier achieves good AUC but a reduced F1-score. Apart from SVM, RF and all the variations of the GCN models, other classifiers perform similarly on the IBD_synthetic dataset. The best AUC of 99% is achieved by RF, DF, MLP, XGB, and boosting GraphSAGE classifiers. The XGB classifier achieves the best ACC of 100%. However, DF, GraphSAGE, and boosting GraphSAGE classifiers also achieve a nearest ACC value of 99%. The best F1-score of 99% is achieved by boosting GraphSAGE, bagging GraphSAGE, and XGB classifiers. Similarly, the best AUPRC of 99% is achieved by DF, XGB, GraphSAGE, and boosting GraphSAGE classifiers.</p><p id="Par107">The results of CRC_synthetic dataset show that the SVM, MLP and all the variations of the GCN model perform poorly when compared to the other models with respect to ACC, AUC, F1-score and AUPRC. The best AUC of 99% is achieved by boosting GraphSAGE, XGB, and RF classifiers. The boosting GraphSAGE achieves an ACC of 98%, which is slightly lower than the ACC achieved by GraphSAGE and the DF classifier. Also, the best AUPRC of 99% is achieved by RF classifier. However, the best F1-score is achieved by RF, DF, and all variations of GraphSAGE classifiers including the boosting GraphSAGE.</p><p id="Par108">To sum up, the single GraphSAGE model is able to accurately discriminate the sick and healthy metagenomic samples in real and synthetic disease datasets. The sampling of neighbors and the aggregation of features from the sampled neighbors positively help the GraphSAGE model to get a better representation of the nodes and, thereby, effectively classify the nodes. Since, single GraphSAGE performs well, the ensemble GraphSAGE model improves the classification performance. Out of the two ensembles, bagging GraphSAGE and boosting GraphSAGE, the boosting GraphSAGE outperforms because the boosting GraphSAGE is able to tackle the misclassifications at each base classifier. However, it should be noted that for synthetic data, most of the ensemble ML models and the proposed model perform similarly. Comparing the results of ensemble ML models on real and synthetic datasets, the models achieve an increased performance in synthetic dataset because of the increased number of samples. But, still the proposed model is able to handle the data imbalance in both the real and the synthetic datasets. It could be observed from the results that the proposed model is not able to achieve the best ACC on both the synthetic datasets. However, it is evident that the performance of the proposed model exceeds all the other models for the real datasets.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of

The proposed framework achieves an AUC of 93% on the IBD dataset. However, the metaNN and GEDFN achieved an AUC of 89% and 84% respectively. Similarly, for the CRC dataset, the RF model obtained an AUC value of 84% while the proposed model achieves an AUC of 90%.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of AUC values with previous work done on the real IBD (left) and the real CRC datasets (right)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12859_2023_5251_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO25"/></fig></p><p id="Par111">In summary, the improved results of the proposed framework prove that the boosting GraphSAGE model can effectively generate a powerful representation for each node by gaining relevant information from its neighbors. The ensembling technique has helped to improve the classification performance by overcoming the challenge of high dimensionality coupled with low sample size associated with metagenomic datasets. Additionally, the results also favor the modeling of the metagenomic datasets in the form of a graph for the application of graph based models to yield better performance. Furthermore, it should be noted that the proposed framework achieves considerable results for highly imbalanced datasets such as IBD, where all the other models failed to achieve good results. One reason for the improved result is the MD-graph construction procedure for the imbalanced dataset which has effectively addressed the imbalance problem by setting a different neighbor threshold for nodes from different classes. The different neighbor threshold helps the MD-graph to avoid unnecessary connections and to keep only the relevant relationship between the nodes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Case study</title><p id="Par112">The case study aims to analyze the effectiveness of the MD-graph construction module of the proposed framework in capturing the neighbors of a graph node for the two real datasets.</p><p id="Par113">Two sick samples S2, S10 and two healthy samples S7, S16 are considered from the real IBD dataset and the abundance of the microbial biomarkers in these samples is analyzed.

In particular, the ability of GraphSAGE to work effectively on graph-based data is used for the binary classification task. We also proposed a novel graph construction approach using a dissimilarity measure for computing the dissimilarity between the samples. The graph was constructed by considering the data imbalance present in the dataset, which helped the proposed model to achieve the best results on the highly imbalanced dataset. The experimental results using real metagenomic disease datasets and synthetic datasets show that the proposed framework outperformed most competing methods in classification performance. Also, from the results, we confirm that the proposed framework can be effectively used for disease prediction and personalized medicine for microbiome-related diseases. In future, the proposed framework can be applied to other metagenomic and medical datasets for disease prediction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SK and AAJ proposed the main idea and implemented all computational work; NK supervised the biological aspects of the work.
