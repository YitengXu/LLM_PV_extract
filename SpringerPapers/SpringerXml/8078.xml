The associated rapid depreciation and replacement of fossil-fuel-related physical and natural capital entail a profound reorganization of industry value chains, international trade and geopolitics. Here we present evidence confirming that the transformation of energy systems is well under way, and we explore the economic and strategic implications of the emerging energy geography. We show specifically that, given the economic implications of the ongoing energy transformation, the framing of climate policy as economically detrimental to those pursuing it is a poor description of strategic incentives. Instead, a new climate policy incentives configuration emerges in which fossil fuel importers are better off decarbonizing, competitive fossil fuel exporters are better off flooding markets and uncompetitive fossil fuel producersârather than benefitting from âfree-ridingââsuffer from their exposure to stranded assets and lack of investment in decarbonization technologies.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par3">The traditional understanding of obstacles to climate change action highlights economic costs and free-riding.

New energy and climate scenarios have been developed to provide such evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Net-zero emissions targets have since been adopted for 2050, notably in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea, and for 2060 in China, which together imply substantial reductions in global fossil fuel use and large markets for low-carbon technology. Reducing emissions requires increased investment in low-carbon technology, with much debated macroeconomic implications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Large quantities of fossil fuel reserves and resources are likely to become âunburnableâ or stranded if countries around the world implement climate policies effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The transition is already underway, and some stranding will happen, irrespective of any new climate policies, in the present trajectory of the energy system, with critical distributional macroeconomic impacts worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although concerns over peak oil supply have shaped foreign policy for decades, the main macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges may, in fact, result from peaking oil (and other fossil-fuel) demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Climate action has traditionally been framed as economically detrimental to those who pursue it. From this perspective, climate action taken by a country is plagued by âfree-ridingâ by others not taking it, who nevertheless benefit from global mitigation, without the economic burden of environmental regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, this motive is not supported by the evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. More fundamentally, the nature of strategic incentives is misrepresented by this framing: incentives may now be more about industrial strategy, job creation and trade success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The costs of generating solar and wind energy, which depend on location, have already or will soon reach parity with the lowest-cost traditional fossil alternatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and investment in low-carbon technologies is generating substantial new employment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The notion that a country should benefit from free-riding on other countriesâ climate policies can also be challenged. Incremental decarbonization, increasing energy efficiency and the economic impacts of COVID-19 have led oil and gas demand and prices to decline substantially. This has affected the viability of extraction in less competitive regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, despite new fossil fuel subsidies in recovery packages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, although the recovery has been rapid and generated substantial market uncertainty. Fossil fuel exporters can be economically impacted by the climate policy decisions of other countries through a lower global demand and lower prices, and abandoning climate policies to boost domestic demand or maintain high prices is not sufficient to compensate for declining exports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this article, we question the traditional framing of climate policy and explore the emergence of a new incentives configuration. We find that positive payoffs may arise for fossil energy importers who reduce imports, whereas negative payoffs arise for energy exporters who lose exports, both being far larger than the actual costs of addressing climate change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Geopolitical context</title><p id="Par8">The transition to a low-carbon economy has raised major questions of geopolitics in the international relations literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Here we adopt Vakulchukâs definition of âgeopoliticsâ, as the connection between geography, resources, space and the power of states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. It has become increasingly clear, with the pace at which renewables are growing, that traditionally fossil-fuel-dominated energy geopolitics must be revisited.

Whether and how fast fossil energy markets peak and decline is primarily decided by the major energy importers (China, India, Japan and the European Union). These have an economic incentive to decarbonize and their decisions impact producers in general. The magnitude of the re-organization of high-value oil and gas markets depends strongly on choices of energy output made by OPEC countries, a dimension of agency that other producers do not possess. With the impact of the transition on their fiscal position, GDP and jobs of the transition can be largely overcompensated by their output strategy and a compelling narrative emerges in which OPEC countries choose to protect their national interests, fiscal position and geopolitical power at the expense of economic, financial and political stability in the high-cost producers that their strategy affects (the United States, Canada and Russia). Meanwhile, a lack of commitment or withdrawal from climate policy in high-cost producer countries does not maintain sufficient domestic demand to overcompensate export losses, and the balance of power remains in the hands of major importers. As low-carbon transitions are under way in the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other nations, as evidenced in technology data, export losses for high-cost exporters (HCEs) are likely to be permanent.

The model is demand-led, which means that the demand for final goods and services is first estimated, and the supply of intermediate goods that lead to that supply is determined using inputâoutput tables and bilateral trade relationships between all the regions.</p><p id="Par36">The model features a positive difference between potential supply capacity and actual supply (the output gap), as well as involuntary unemployment of the labour force. This implies that when economic activity fluctuates, short-term non-equilibrium changes in the employment of labour and capital can arise and, notably, unemployed resources can become employed. The model follows the theoretical basis of demand-led post-Keynesian and Schumpeterian (evolutionary) economics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> in which investment determines output, rather than output determining investment and capital accumulation, as is done in general equilibrium models. This implies that purchasing power to finance investment is created by banks on the basis of the creditworthiness of investors and investment opportunities, and repaid over the long term. The model therefore possesses an implicit representation of banking and financial markets in which the allocation of financial resources is not restricted by crowding out from other competing activities, as the creation of money in the form of loans can accelerate during periods of optimism, and decline in periods of depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. For this reason, E3ME is the ideal model to study the business cycle dynamically, as it does not assume money neutrality and is path dependent.</p><p id="Par37">The closed set of regressions includes estimating, as dependent variables, household consumption (by construction equal to supply), investment, labour participation, employment, hours worked, wages, prices (domestic and imports), imports and the expansion of industrial productive capacity. Endogenous growth is generated by the inclusion of technology progress factors in several equations, which represent sectoral productivity growth as the economy accumulates scale, knowledge and knowhow with cumulative investment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Final energy demand and the energy sector as a whole is treated in detail similarly, but separately in physical energy quantities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>FTT</title><p id="Par38">E3ME estimates energy demand and related investment for all the sectors and fuel users of the global economy with the exception of the four most carbon-intensive sectors (power, transport, heat and steel), for which technological change is modelled with a substantially higher definition using the FTT family of models. FTT is a bottom-up representation of technological change that reproduces and projects the diffusion of individual technologies calibrated on recent trends. FTT:Power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> represents the market competition of 24 power technologies, which include nuclear, coal- oil- and gas-based fuel combustion (with CCS options), PV and concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind, hydro, tidal, geothermal and wave technologies. FTT:Transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> represents the diffusion of petrol, diesel, hybrid, CNG and EVs and motorcycles in three engine size classes, with 25 technology options. FTT:Heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> looks at the diffusion of oil, coal, wood and gas combustion in households as well as resistive electric heating, electric heat pumps and solar heaters in 13 technology options. Lastly, FTT:Steel represents all the existing steel-making routes based on coal, gas, hydrogen and electricity in 25 types of chains of production. Technologies not represented in FTT currently have very low market shares, which necessarily implies, in a diffusion framework, that their diffusion to such levels, which would invalidate the present scenarios, is highly unlikely within the policy horizon of 2050 (for example, nuclear fusion and hydrogen mobility).</p><p id="Par39">FTT is a general framework for modelling technology ecosystems that is in many ways similar to modelling natural ecosystems, based on the replicator dynamics equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. The replicator equation (or LotkaâVolterra system) is an ubiquitous relationship that emerges in many systems and features nonlinear population dynamics, such as in chemical reactions or ecosystem populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. It is related to discrete choice models and multinomial logits through adding a term in the standard utility model to represent agent interactions (for example, technology availability limited by existing industry sizes and social influence), which gives it the distinctive S-shaped diffusion profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par40">The direction of diffusion in FTT is influenced by the economic and policy context on the basis of suitable sector-specific representations of decision-making, by comparing the break-even (levelized) cost of using the various technology options in a discrete choice model weighted by the ubiquity of those technology options. The various levelized costs include a parameter that represents the comparative non-pecuniary costs and advantages of using each technology. This parameter is used to calibrate the direction of diffusion to match what is observed in recent trends of diffusion, notably important for PV, wind, EVs and heat pumps (see Mercure et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par41">A key recent innovation in FTT:Power is a detailed representation of the intermittency of renewables through the introduction of a classification of generators along six load bands, following the method of Ueckerdt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, with the addition of an allocation of production time slots to available generators according to intermittency and flexibility constraints. This ensures that the levels of grid flexibility to allow the introduction of large amounts of renewables are respected, which maintains model results within a range deemed to represent a stable electricity grid. Intermittency, optimal intermittent renewable curtailment and energy storage parameters are estimated by Ueckerdt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> based on solar and wind data and optimization modelling results. The result in FTT is that the main obstacle for solar and wind penetrating grids is the rate at which the required flexibility can be accommodated. The addition of this electricity market model has implied, in comparison with earlier work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> based on cruder and more restrictive stability assumptions, that renewables can penetrate the grid more rapidly and effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>GENIE</title><p id="Par42">GENIE, an intermediate complexity Earth system model, simulates the global climate carbon cycle to give the future climate state driven by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, land-use change and non-CO<sub>2</sub> climate forcing agents.

Changes are only imposed to production to reserve ratios of OPEC countries, to either achieve a production quota that is proportional to global output (QU scenario, and thereby reduce production to reserve ratios accordingly) or attempt to maintain constant absolute production as global demand peaks and declines (SO scenario, and thereby increase production to reserve ratios).

Production in the model is proportional to existing reserves in each producing region, and the proportionality factor is determined by the data such that production data are consistent with reserve data. The production-to-reserve ratios in the three OPEC regions are modified by applying the values that achieve either production quotas that remain proportional to global oil and gas outputs (QU scenario) or constant in absolute value (SO scenario). In the central scenarios, production-to-reserve ratios are maintained constant.</p><p id="Par79">SO scenarios could be defined for other regions, notably the United States and Russia; however, we consider these unlikely to materialize without SO responses from OPEC, which, due to its higher competitiveness according to the Rystad data, always wins price wars in the model. Thus, such SO scenarios for regions other than OPEC add little information to what is already shown here. In reality, SO strategies could be plagued by refining capacity bottlenecks or strategic stockpiling behaviour. We assume that refining and fuel transport capacity remains undisrupted (for example, by regional conflict) and that current capacity outlives peak demand. This is reasonable given the existing capacity and the fact that demand growth declines. We furthermore assume that incentives to stockpile drastically decline in situations of peak demand, as overproduction is likely, which reduces opportunities for arbitrage. Trade tariffs on oil and gas could be imposed to protect domestic industries, notably in the United States, which decouples them from global markets, but are not modelled here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>InvE scenario</title><p id="Par80">This scenario involves no other assumptions than policies present in the TDT and replacing all FTT outputs (energy end use and energy sector investment) with exogenous data consistent with the IEAâs World Energy Outlook 2019 current policies scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

The InvE scenario cannot be reached under any realistic set of assumptions in E3ME-FTT projections, as it would violate the model premise of near-term continuity in observed technology diffusion trajectories. This scenario was chosen as a proxy for recent past expectations for the future of fossil energy markets, of investors who may still entertain beliefs of indefinite growth in future fossil fuel markets. As it is not possible to determine which investors entertain which expectations, the realism of the InvE scenario as a proxy for expectations cannot be assessed; therefore, it is used only to develop a what-if comparative narrative.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the Global Systems Institute (Exeter), C-EERNG and Cambridge Econometrics for support and funding from UK NERC (J.-F.M., N.R.E., P.S., G.S. and J.E.V., âFRANTICâ project grant no NE/S017119/1), the Leverhulme Trust Leverhulme Research Centre Award (N.V., N.R.E. and P.B.H., no.

The dashed lines show PV and EV levelised costs (the break-even service costs for one unit of electricity or transport), while the dotted lines show the levelised costs of the best fossil alternative, gas turbines and petrol vehicles (for vehicles, the mid-range class was used). The solid lines, associated with the right-hand side vertical axes, show the diffusion of solar PV and EVs. The dynamics show that costs going down incentivise more technology uptake, which generates cost reductions, in a positive reinforcing cycle. Fossil technologies are mature, without substantial learning, their cost dominated by resource costs. In the case of gas turbine costs, the fluctuations are related to variations in capacity factors (or load hours) that vary according to how the plants are used to balance the electricity grid.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41560_2021_934_Fig6_ESM.jpg" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></p><p id="Par85"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="Fig7" xlink:title="Extended data"><label>Extended Data Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Projections for all scenarios of all major energy vectors in the economy.</title><p>Dashed lines are guide to the eyes indicating totals of other scenarios in the same quantity.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41560_2021_934_Fig7_ESM.jpg" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></p><p id="Par86"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="Fig8" xlink:title="Extended data"><label>Extended Data Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Projections for all scenarios of non-renewable energy use by region.
