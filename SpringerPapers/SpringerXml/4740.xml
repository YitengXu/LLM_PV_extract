There are around 4.1 million sufferers worldwide. It is characterised by motor <bold>impairments</bold> that result from the death of certain nerve cells in the brain. Therapies are not yet available. However, researchers at the University of Tübingen have now discovered that vitamin B3 has a positive effect on damaged nerve cells and can <bold>boost</bold> their energy metabolism. Vitamin B3 application will now be examined to determine whether it could be a new therapeutic approach for treating Parkinson’s.</p><p id="Par16">Parkinson’s is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. The disease affects around two percent of people over 60 worldwide, and the numbers are rising. Between 250,000 and 280,000 people have the disease in Germany alone. Typical symptoms of this still incurable disease include motor impairments such as unsteady hands, stiff muscles and slow movements. The disease is caused by the loss of dopamine-containing nerve cells in a certain brain region called the black substance (substantia nigra). Little is yet known why these nerve cells die.</p><p id="Par17">For many years, junior professor Dr. Dr. Michela Deleidi and her research group at the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research and the University of Tübingen have been studying how Parkinson’s disease develops. “Some time ago, we <bold>came up with</bold> the idea that the disease is caused by damaged nerve cells with a dysfunctional energy metabolism, and <bold>hence</bold> damaged mitochondria,” explains Deleidi. “And indeed, in one of our studies, we found that the mitochondria in the affected nerve cells of Parkinson’s patients did not work properly. So we then decided to look for a way to repair and improve mitochondrial function.”</p><p id="Par18">In search of a “mitochondrial rescue”, as Deleidi calls it, the researchers came across vitamin B3. “It has long been known that vitamin B3 plays a role in central metabolic processes, and some studies have shown that the vitamin plays a role in maintaining healthy mitochondria,” says the neurologist. “So it was natural for us to look at the vitamin and its potential role in the treatment of Parkinson’s.”</p><p id="Par19"><bold>Vitamin B3 Can Save Nerve Cells</bold></p><p id="Par20">The scientists took skin cell samples from patients with Parkinson’s, i.e. patients that carried a defect in the so-called GBA <sup>∗</sup>gene, in order to find out whether damaged mitochondria cause Parkinson’s disease. A mutation in this gene is one of the major risk factors for Parkinson’s disease. After removal, the cells were converted into stem cells using protocols that were developed specifically for this purpose. “All artificial nerve cells had a characteristic mutation in the GBA gene, which is the most frequent risk gene for Parkinson’s,” says Deleidi “And we were able to show that the mitochondria and energy metabolism of these cells were impaired.”</p><p id="Par21">The scientists from Tübingen subsequently treated the damaged cells with a vitamin B3 variant. “And fortunately, we were able to eliminate most of the cells’ abnormalities,” said the junior professor. “In the flies that we were using as models of ageing, we even found that <bold>the sought after compound</bold> is a true anti-ageing product.” The researchers, who are part of an international research consortium, took flies of the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic> that had a defective GBA gene and hence problems moving around, and fed them the vitamin B3 variant to boost the formation of new mitochondria. “And there too, we were able to show that the vitamin considerably improved neuronal functions and behaviour,” says Deleidi.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Nicotinamide Riboside Improves Cellular Energy Production</bold></p><p id="Par23">The researchers did not use vitamin B3 – the nicotinamide – for the investigations, but a variant of the vitamin called nicotinamide riboside. <bold>The latter</bold> is <bold>the precursor</bold> of the coenzyme NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which plays an important role in many metabolic processes involved cellular energy production. “We now know that the administration of the vitamin B3 variant nictoinamide riboside leads to <bold>the elevation</bold> of the intracellular NAD level and hence to considerable improvement of many biological processes, including microchondrial function and cellular energy generation,” said the researcher. “Our experiments suggest that the loss of mitochondria does indeed play a significant role in the development of Parkinson’s disease.”</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Vitamin B3 – A Universal Anti-Ageing Product?</bold></p><p id="Par25">Administering nicotinamide riboside may be a new starting point for treating Parkinson’s. “At present, several clinical trials involving healthy volunteers and people with other mitochondrial diseases are underway.” “The goal is to find out how the vitamin B3 variant works”, says Deleidi. “While we are waiting for these results to be available we will continue characterising the substance and its metabolism in greater detail. Previous studies indicate that the vitamin B3 variant does not lead to serious <bold>adverse effects</bold>. However, the dosage will have to be very high because the drug needs to be taken orally. I am often asked by patients if they can start taking the substance. But I think that we need more results before giving the go-ahead for this.”</p><p id="Par26">The researchers are already working with ChromaDex on the optimisation of nicotinamide riboside. ChromaDex is an American company that specialises in <bold>phytochemicals</bold> and has already supplied the Tübingen researchers with nicotinamide riboside for a recently completed study. “In addition to our previous findings, the study shows that our approach is not only specifically directed at the age-related degradation of metabolic processes in the human body, which includes Alzheimer’s, muscle loss and eye problems,” says Deleidi. And the sooner you can do something about this, the better. If the outcome of the clinical trials is positive, vitamin B3 would really have what it takes to become the new “anti-ageing pill”.</p><p id="Par27">∗GBA = Genombezeichnung</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>General Questions</title><p id="Par28"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par29">First of all write a summary of the text.

Blue, i.e. marine biotechnology, is one of the less known branches. Biotechnological methods are used to investigate marine life and the results obtained from these investigations advance research in the fields of medicine and energy and into substances used as food supplements and cosmetics. The area of marine biotechnology is fairly diverse. Although it is not on the coast, even the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg is involved in marine biotechnology.</p><p id="Par63">The sea – the yrr∗ invented by German science fiction author Frank Schätzing live in it, Jules Verne’s protagonists travel 20,000 leagues under it and SpongeBob’s pineapple house sits on its bed. Only around one percent of the ocean has been studied, which is why a lot of myths, speculation and fairytales <bold>revolve around</bold> it. However, new terms like “drugstore from the bottom of the sea” or “marine pharmacy” have started to be <bold>bandied around</bold>. Marine microorganisms have had around three billion years more to develop than life on land. They have adapted to extreme environmental conditions in the sea – from the cold of the Antarctic ice to the hot, bubbling deep-sea volcanoes. This is where biotechnology <bold>comes in</bold>, or rather marine biotechnology, to be more exact. Marine biotechnology is the application of science and technology to marine organisms. Marine microbes, <bold>sponges</bold> and algae produce substances that have been found to be effective against cancer and AIDS, they are also likely to become important <bold>providers</bold> of energy, they are used to produce substances such as glass or to obtain important knowledge for the production of new <bold>washing detergents</bold> active at lower temperatures.</p><p id="Par64">Some pharmaceutical substances isolated from marine organisms have already been placed on the market. Rather like tiny factories embedded in coral reefs, cyanobacteria, also known as blue algae, are among the most important producers of a broad range of different substances (more than 200), including bioactive with antitumour, antibiotic, <bold>anti-inflammatory</bold> and antiviral effect.</p><p id="Par65">Yrr∗ – fictious, marine, unicellular jelly-like life form whose mission is to eliminate the human race by devasting the Earth’s oceans. The protagonist of the novel, Norwegian scientist Sigur Johanson, calls this life form “yrr”, a name he created by typing three letters <bold>at random</bold> on his keyboard (eds. note).</p><p id="Par66"><bold>Biotechnological Research Involving Marine Organisms</bold></p><p id="Par67">Algae have the potential to be used in many different areas. They produce hydrogen, which will make them important sources of energy in the future; algae genes are transferred into <bold>soy</bold> and <bold>rapeseed</bold>, where they lead to the increased production of omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesised by the human body, but are vital for normal metabolism. Researchers also focus on marine sponges, small <bold>sessile animals</bold> that have colonised the oceans for around 800 million years and developed an arsenal of mechanisms to defend themselves against <bold>predators</bold>. The substances, which <bold>scare</bold> predators <bold>off</bold> rather than killing them, contain toxic and pharmaceutically active substances which are now used in cancer research, in particular in leukaemia research.</p><p id="Par68">Only a small fraction of biotechnological research – around one percent – involves marine organisms. Marine research is very expensive and the prospect of commericialising new discoveries is still a distant dream. The coastal states of Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein are leaders in the field of marine biotechnology in Germany. The Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel – GEOMAR – investigates the chemical, physical, biological and geological processes of all marine <bold>habitats</bold> and is also active in the field of marine microbiology. “Many of our projects are focused on marine microorganisms from which we can isolate natural substances. We are also very much focused on turning our research results into marketable <bold>commodities</bold>,” said Johanna Silber of GEOMAR, going to add that GEOMAR has already identified a number of marine microbial compounds that are used in cosmetics, antibiotics and even pesticides.</p><p id="Par69"><bold>Sessile Organisms as Pharmaceutical Factories</bold></p><p id="Par70">Despite the fact that Baden-Württemberg is not on the coast, the marine life sciences branch is nevertheless represented here in the form of sponge and algae projects. Even a sponge species was discovered in Baden Württemberg: <italic>Tethya wilhelma</italic> was discovered and characterised by Franz Brümmer and Dr. Michael Nickel in the zoo “Wilhelma” (Stuttgart) around ten years ago. The small, white sponge is ball-shaped. But what differentiates it from all other sponge species is that it is able to move around.</p><p id="Par71">Researchers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology are focused on marine sponges and algae. Using <italic>Aplysina aerophoba</italic>, also known as Gold-sponge, as a model organism, Christoph Syldatk and his team are studying the <bold>metabolite</bold> production of <bold>ex situ</bold> sponge cultures. They are particularly interested in improving the cultivation of sponges from a biotechnological point of view. Cultivating sponges with the aim of producing bioactive substances in relatively large quantities has always been very difficult.</p><p id="Par72"><italic>Aplysina aerophoba</italic> is a common sponge in the Mediterranean. It is of great interest to researchers due to its ability to produce the pharmaceutically active substance aeroplysinin-1 as a natural metabolite. The <bold>brominated</bold> low-molecular metabolite has an antibacterial effect and also impairs the growth of tumor cells. Although aeroplysinin-1 is commercially available, it still needs to be extracted from sponges. Sponge-associated microorganisms have also been found to produce some of the bioactive natural substances that were previously thought to have been produced by the sponge.</p><p id="Par73"><bold>Algal Bioreactors from Baden-Württemberg with Great Potential for the Future</bold></p><p id="Par74">The energy sector is another important area of application for marine biotechnology. When energy is <bold>scarce</bold>, people tend to <bold>clamour</bold> for new, efficient and environmentally friendly energy carriers. In addition, new energy sources must have an environmentally friendly CO<sub>2</sub> balance and must not use land set aside for agriculture. Algae could be a way out of this situation. Algae are relatively versatile; they can be used as food supplements and to produce biodiesel, oil and bioethanol. In addition, algal bioreactors like the ones produced by Baden-Württemberg-based Subitec GmbH can be set up anywhere. Subitec optimises its bioreactors for the cultivation of marine and freshwater algae according to the specific requirements of its clients. Many products can be produced with algae, including substances used as food supplements or in the cosmetics industry. Dr. Peter Ripplinger, CEO of Susitec, also points out that raw materials such as carbohydrates and lipids could be produced with algae as energy producers.“ Future energy production will not be dominated by rapeseed; I firmly believe that the future production of energy from biomass will be based on algae”, said Ripplinger.</p><p id="Par75">Algae bind CO<sub>2</sub> as they grow. However, this CO<sub>2</sub> is released when energy is produced. Algae can therefore be characterised as CO<sub>2</sub> neutral. However, they can do even better than that: Prof. Clemen Posten and his team at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology are working on bioprocesses that enable them to cultivate the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> in a way that <bold>triggers</bold> it to produce environmentally-friendly hydrogen, both more cheaply and more energy efficiently than has been possible up until now.</p><p id="Par76"><bold>Processing of Marine Waste in Europe</bold></p><p id="Par77">Marine waste can be further processed using biotechnological methods. Chitin, which is found in the shells of shellfish that are removed prior to being packed and sold – quantities of around 750,000 t of shells per year are removed in Europe – is already being converted into chitosan in Asia. Chitosan is still very much in its infancy in Europe. The shells of European shellfish contain too much chalk which renders the further processing of chitin into chitosan uneconomical. However, the “ChiBo” project, which is funded under the European 7th Framework Programme, is seeking to improve the situation.</p><p id="Par78">The Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology (IGB) in Stuttgart is part of the project and is focused on the development of enzymes that degrade chitin into monomers. Dr. Antje Laber (GEOMAR) does not regard marine biotechnology as a different branch of traditional biotechnology. “We are working with the same methods, devices and principles as the other branches. The only difference is that we are working with algae. I imagine that the potential of new characteristics and potentials offered by marine substances will in future become an integral part of classical biotechnology,” Laber said. And what this means in concrete terms is that marine biotechnology can support and stimulate the other branches of biotechnology with its findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>General Questions</title><p id="Par79"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par80">State at least two advantages and disadvantages of blue biotechnology.

But one <bold>outfit</bold> with deep pockets, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, eventually paid attention, hoping the research might help <bold>alleviate</bold> global poverty.</p><p id="Par116">Now, after several years of work funded by the foundation, the scientists are reporting a remarkable result.</p><p id="Par117">Using <bold>genetic engineering techniques</bold> to alter photosynthesis, they increased the productivity of a test plant – tobacco – by as much as 20 %, they said Thursday in a study published by the journal Science. That is a huge number, given that plant breeders struggle <bold>to eke out</bold> gains of 1 or 2 % more conventional approaches.</p><p id="Par118">The scientists have no interest in increasing the production of tobacco; their plan is to try the same alterations in food crops, and one of the leaders of the work believes production gains of 50 % or more may ultimately be achievable. If the <bold>prediction is borne out</bold> in further research – it could take a decade, if not longer, to know for sure – the result might be nothing less than a transformation of global agriculture.</p><p id="Par119">The findings could also intensify the political struggle over genetic engineering of the food supply. Some groups oppose it, arguing that researchers are playing God by moving genes from one species to another. That argument has gained some <bold>traction</bold> with the public, in part because the benefits of <bold>gene-altered crops</bold> have so far been modest at best.</p><p id="Par120">But gains of 40 or 50 % in food production would be an entirely different matter, potentially offering enormous benefits for the world’s poorest people, many of them farmers working small <bold>plots</bold> of land in the developing world.</p><p id="Par121">“We’re here because we want to alleviate poverty,” said Katherine Kahn, the officer at the Gates Foundation overseeing the grant for the Illinois research. “What is it the farmers need, and how can we help them get there?”</p><p id="Par122">One of the leaders of the research, Stephen P. Long, a crop scientist who holds appointments at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at Lancaster University in England, emphasized in an interview that a long road lay ahead before any results from the work might reach farmers’ fields.</p><p id="Par123">But Dr. Long is also convinced that genetic engineering could ultimately lead to what he called a “second Green Revolution” that would produce huge gains in food production, like the original Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, which transferred advanced agricultural techniques to some developing countries and led to reductions in world hunger.</p><p id="Par124">The research involvers photosynthesis, in which plants use carbon dioxide from the air and energy from sunlight to form new, energy-rich carbohydrates. These compounds are, in turn, the basic energy supply for almost all animal cells, including those of humans. The mathematical description of photosynthesis is sometimes <bold>billed</bold> as “the <bold>equation</bold> that powers the world.”</p><p id="Par125">For a decade, Dr. Long had argued that photosnythesis was not actually very efficient. In the course of evolution, several experts said, Mother Nature had focused on the survival and reproduction of plants, not on putting out the maximum amount of seeds or fruits for humans to come along and pick.</p><p id="Par126">Dr. Long thought crop yields might be improved by certain genetic changes. Other scientists doubted it would work, but with the Science paper, Dr. Lang and his collaborator – Krishan K. Niyogi who holds appointments at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory – have gone a long way toward proving their point.</p><p id="Par127">Much of the work at the University of Illinois was carried out by two young researchers from abroad who hold positions in Dr. Long’s laboratory, Johannes Kromdijk of the Netherlands and Katarzyna Glowacka of Poland.</p><p id="Par128">No one plans to eat tobacco, of course, nor does the Gates Foundation have any interest in increasing the production of that health-damaging crop. But the researchers used it because tobacco is a particularly fast and easy plant in which to try new <bold>genetic alterations</bold> to see how well they work.</p><p id="Par129">In a recent interview here, Dr. Kromdijk and Dr. Glowacka showed off tiny tobacco plants <bold>incorporating</bold> the genetic changes and described their aspirations.</p><p id="Par130">“We hope it translates into food crops in the way we’ve shown in tobacco,” Dr. Kromodijk said. “Of course, you only know when you actually try it.”</p><p id="Par131">In the initial work, the researchers transferred genes from a common laboratory plant, known as thale cress or mouse-ear cress, into <bold>strains</bold> of tobacco. The effect was not to introduce alien substances, but rather to increase the level of certain proteins that already existed in tobacco.</p><p id="Par132">When plants receive direct sunlight, they are often getting more energy than they can use, and they activate a mechanism that helps them shed it as heat – while slowing carbohydrate production. The genetic changes the researchers introduced help the plant turn that mechanism off faster once the excessive sunlight ends, so that the machinery of photosynthesis can get back more quickly to maximal production of carbohydrates.</p><p id="Par133">It is a bit like a factory worker taking a shorter coffee break before getting back to the <bold>assembly line</bold>. But the effect on the overall growth of the tobacco plants was surprisingly large.</p><p id="Par134">When the scientists grew the newly created plants in fields at the University of Illinois, they achieved <bold>yield</bold> increases of 13.5 % in one strain, 19 % in a second and 20 % in a third, over normal tobacco plants grown for comparison.</p><p id="Par135">Because the machinery of photosynthesis in many of the world’s food crops is identical to that of tobacco, theory suggests that a comparable manipulation of those crops should increase production. Work is planned to test that in crops that are especially important as dietary staples in Africa, like <bold>cowpeas</bold>, rice and <bold>cassava.</bold></p><p id="Par136">Two outside experts not involved in the research both used the word “exciting” to describe it. But they emphasized that the researchers had not yet proved that the food supply could be increased.</p><p id="Par137">“How does it look in rice or corn or wheat or sugar beets?” said L. Val Giddings, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington and a longtime advocate of <bold>gene-altered crops</bold>. “You’ve got to get into a handful of the important crops before you can show this is real and it’s going to have a huge impact. We are not there yet.”</p><p id="Par138">Barry D. Bruce of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, who studies photosynthesis, pointed out that the genetic alteration might behave differently in crops where only parts of the plant, such as seeds or fruits, are harvested. In tobacco, by contrast, the entire aboveground plant is harvested – Dr. Bruce called it “a leafy green plant used for cigars!”</p><p id="Par139">Dr. Bruce also noted that, now that the principle has been established, it might be possible to find plant varieties with the desired traits and introduce the changes into crops by conventional breeding, rather than by genetic engineering.

They wove clothes and fabrics from wool, cotton or silk, dyed them with colours derived from plants and animals. Trees provided the material to build houses, furniture and fittings. But this all changed during the first half of the twentieth century, when organic chemistry developed methods to create many of these products from oil. Oil-derived synthetic polymers, coloured with artificial dyes, soon replaced natural fibres in clothes and fabrics. Plastics rapidly replaced wood and metals in many consumer items, buildings and furniture. However, biology might be about to take revenge on these synthetic, petroleum-based consumer goods. Stricter environmental regulations and the growing mass of non-degradable synthetics in <bold>landfills</bold> have made biodegradable products appealing again. Growing concerns about the dependence on imported oil, particularly in the USA, and the awareness that the world’s oil supplies are not limitless are additional factors prompting the chemical and biotechnology industries to explore nature’s richness in search of methods to replace petroleum-based synthetics.</p><p id="Par191">An entire branch of biotechnology, known as, white biotechnology is devoted to this. It uses living cells – from yeast, molds, bacteria and plants – and enzymes to synthesize products that are easily degradable, require less energy and create less waste during their production. This is not a recent development: in fact, biotechnology has been contributing to industrial processes for some time. For decades, bacterial enzymes have been used widely in food manufacturing and as active ingredients in washing powders to reduce the amount of artificial <bold>surfactants</bold>. Transgenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are used to produce human insulin in large-scale fermentation tanks. And the first rationally designed enzyme, used in detergents to break down fat, was introduced as early as 1988. The benefits of exploiting natural processes and products are <bold>manifold</bold>: they do not rely on fossil resources, are more energy efficient and their substrates and waste are biologically degradable, which all helps to decrease their environmental impact. Using alternative substrates and energy sources, white biotechnology is already bringing many innovations to the chemical, textile, food, packaging and health care industries. It is no surprise then that academics, industry and policy makers are increasingly interested in this new technology, its economy and its contributions to a <bold>sound</bold> environment, which could make it a credible method for sustainable development.</p><p id="Par192">One of the first goals on white biotechnology’s agenda has been the production of <bold>biodegradable</bold> plastics. Over the past 20 years, these efforts have concentrated mainly on polyesters of 3-hydroxydacids (PHAs), which are naturally synthesized by a wide range of bacteria as an energy reserve and carbon source. These compounds have properties similar to synthetic thermoplastics and elastomers from propylene to rubber, but are completely and rapidly degraded by bacteria in soil or water. The most abundant PHA is poly(3-hydroxy-butyrate) (PHB), which bacteria synthesize from acetyl-CoA. Growing on glucose, the bacterium <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> can amass up to 85 % of its dry weight in PHB, which makes this microorganism a miniature bioplastic factory.</p><p id="Par193">A major limitation of the commercialization of such bacterial plastics has always been their cost, as they are 5–10 times more expensive to produce than petroleum-based polymers. Much effort has therefore gone into reducing production costs through the development of better <bold>bacterial strains</bold>, but recently a potentially friendly alternative emerged, namely the modification of plants to synthesize PHAs. A small amount of PHB was first produced in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> after the introduction of <italic>R. eutropha</italic> genes <bold>encoding two</bold> enzymes that are essential for the conversion of acetyl-CoA to PHB (Poirier <bold>et al.</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1992</xref>). Monsanto (St. Louis, MO, USA) then improved this process in 1999. Although this new wave of polymers has enormous potential, the timing of its evolution is uncertain. After initial enthusiasm, Monsanto and AstraZeneca (London, UK) abandoned these projects due to cost concerns. “Producing biopolymers from plants is a promising and fascinating scientific challenge,” said Yves Poirier from the Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology at the Institute of Ecology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. He thinks that companies are <bold>reluctant</bold> to pursue these projects because they need long-term investments that do not meet the companies’ financial and time schedules. “Further genetic modifications still need to be introduced in the plants for their improvement,” he said, “and once these plants are created, they will require specific harvesting and treatment protocols, with respect to regular plants. All this translates into heavy investments in new infrastructures and processing systems and into a considerable amount of time.” Eight to ten years is his rough estimate of how long it will be before plant-produced PHAs might become economically <bold>viable.</bold></p><p id="Par194">Plans to manufacture a T-shirt from corn sugar have reached the same <bold>impasse</bold>. Dupont (Wilmington, DE, USA), the company that invented nylon, has for many years been developing a polymer based on 1,3-propanediol (PDO), with new levels of performance, <bold>resilience</bold> and softness. Adding an environmentally responsible dimension to the production, Dupont’s polymerization plant in Decatur, Illinois (USA) has now successfully manufactured PDO from corn sugar, a renewable resource.</p><p id="Par195">But although their corn-based polymer, called Sorona R, is more environmentally friendly and has improved characteristics, it is again up to the markets to make it a success. “The company plans an effective shift from the petroleum-based production to the bio-based one,” said Ian Hudson, Sorona R Business Director at Dupont, “but this will happen if the economic process and market demands justify the transition.”</p><p id="Par196">Cargil Dow (Minnetonka, MN, USA) has gone a step further. The company has developed an innovative biopolymer, NatureWorks <bold>TM</bold>, which can be used to manufacture items such as clothing, packaging and office furnishings. The polymer is derived from lactic acid, which is obtained from the fermentation of corn sugar. It has already been brought to the market effectively and has recently appeared in US grocery stores as a container for organic food.</p><p id="Par197">Another product that could benefit greatly from innovative biotechnology is paper. Much of the cost and considerable pollution involved in the paper-making process is caused by ‘krafting’, a method for removing lignin from the wood substrate. Lignin is the second most abundant polymer in nature after cellulose and provides structural stability to plants. In view of the significant economic benefits that might be achieved, many research efforts went into reducing the amount of lignin or modifying lignin structure in trees, while preserving their growth and structural integrity. Genetically modified trees with these properties already exist (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>; Chabannes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>), but money will probably not be made from them anytime soon. Although the paper industry could make a considerable profit by reducing production costs, no large projects in this direction have yet been undertaken. Alain Boudet, Professor at the Centre for Vegetable Biotechnology at the University Paul Sabatier (Castanet-Tolosan, France), identified two major <bold>roadblocks</bold> for the commercialization of transgenic wood. “First of all, trees with altered lingin will need more tests on their actual field performance outside the laboratory before being widely used,” he explained. “Secondly, and with much more difficulty, it will be necessary to conquer the public’s acceptance to yet new transgenic organisms and to the distribution of products deriving from them.”</p><p id="Par198">White biotechnology also concentrates on the production of energy from renewable resources and biomasses. <bold>Starch</bold> from corn, potatoes, sugar cane and wheat is already used to produce ethanol as substitute for gasoline – Henry Ford’s first car ran on ethanol. Today, some motor fuel sold in Brazil is pure ethanol derived from sugar cane, and the rest has 20 % ethanol content. In the USA, 10 % of all motor fuel sold is a mixture of 90 % petrol and 10 % ethanol. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s 2001 report on biotechnology and industrial sustainability, the USA now has 58 fuel plants, which produce almost 6 billion litres of ethanol per year.</p><p id="Par199">But turning starch into ethanol is neither the most environmentally nor economically efficient method, as growing plants for ethanol production involves the use of <bold>herbicides</bold>, pesticides, <bold>fertilizers, irrigation</bold> and machinery. Companies such as Novzymes (Bagsward, Denmark), Genencor (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and Madygen (Redwood City, CA, USA) are therefore exploring avenues to derive ethanol specifically from celluloid material in wood, grasses and, more attractively, agricultural waste. Much of their effort is concentrated on developing more effective bacterial cellulases that can break down agricultural waste into simple sugars to create a more plentiful and cheaper raw substrate for the production of ethanol.</p><p id="Par200">Hopeful visionaries have already started to talk about a ‘carbohydrate economy’ replacing the old ‘hydrocarbon economy’. However, “making biomass an effective <bold>feedstock</bold> is not a cheap process,” reminded Kirsten Staer, Director of <bold>Stakeholder</bold> Communications at Novozymes. To get the production of biofuel up and running on a commercial basis, alongside the development of new feedstock collection systems and the creation of special production plants, a different pricing of biofuel will be required, she commented. “The price structure for fossil fuel is fixed in the market by <bold>regulator</bold>y frameworks. If the biofuel production is to be successful, it will be necessary to enforce policies that introduce <bold>subsidies</bold> to bioethanol production, for instance, or put taxes on fossil fuel production,” Staer said.</p><p id="Par201">This has not stopped J. Craig Venter from founding the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA) in Rockville, Maryland (USA) last year to <bold>advocate</bold> the production of cleaner forms of energy. IBEA recently received a US 53 million grant from the US Department of Energy, primarily to engineer an artificial microorganism to produce hydrogen. <bold>Deprived</bold> of the genes for sugar formation that normally use hydrogen ions, this organism could devote all of its energies to the production of excess hydrogen and, ideally, become a synthetic energy producer.</p><p id="Par202">White biotechnology may also benefit medicine and agriculture. Vitamin B 2 (riboflavin), for instance, is widely used in animal feed, human food and cosmetics and has traditionally been manufactured in a six-step chemical process. At BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany) more than 1000 tonnes of vitamin B2 are now produced per year in a single fermentation. Using the fungus Ahsbya gossypii as a biocatalyst, BASF achieved an overall reduction in cost and environmental <bold>impact</bold> of 40 %. Similarly, cephalexin, an antibiotic that is active against Gram-negative bacteria and is normally produced in a lengthy ten-step chemical synthesis, is now produced in a shorter fermentation-based process at DSM Life Sciences Products (Heerlen, The Netherlands). However, vitamin B2 is just a single success story – other vitamins and drugs are still cheaper to produce with classic organic chemistry than by innovative white biotechnology.</p><p id="Par203">Nevertheless, the potential environmental benefits of shifting to biofeedstocks and bioprocesses are substantial, thinks Wolfgang Jenseit from the Institute for Applied Ecology (Freiburg, Germany). “The new bioproduction processes substitute complex chemistry reactions. This, of course, corresponds to significant energy and water savings” he explained. It also benefits the atmosphere: the carbon needed to make bioethanol from biomass was <bold>sequestered</bold> by plants from the atmosphere, so putting it back by burning ethanol does not add to global warming. Jenseit pointed out. This is certainly good news for the countries that <bold>committed to</bold> limiting greenhouse-gas emissions by ratifying the Kyoto treaty.</p><p id="Par204">And the economic benefits are expected to follow. According to the global consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Company, white biotechnology will occupy up to 10–20 % of the entire chemical market in 2010, with annual growth rates of Euro 11–22 billion. Huge differences exist, however, in the ways white biotechnology is managed in Europe and the USA, says Jens Riese, a Frankfurt-based Principal Associate at McKinsey &amp; Company. “First of all, the overall sum invested in the US in the white biotech business is 250 million USDollar, a sum which by far exceeds the total European investment”, he said. “Probably driven by a stronger geopolitical will of becoming independent from fossil fuel import, the US has shown a clearer <bold>propensity</bold> in the development of such technologies. Europe, on the other hand, is culturally more <bold>cautious</bold> and less <bold>adventurous</bold> in accepting innovative methodologies.”</p><p id="Par205">But white biotechnology has drawn interest in Europe. “There is consciousness about the need for innovation in this direction,” said Oliver Wolf, Scientific Officer at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in Seville, Spain. “Although as yet no specific legislation exists, important steps are being taken towards the promotion of white biotechnology in Europe.” White biotechnology has potentially large benefits, both economically and environmentally for a wide range of applications. The way for its development is being paved, but it remains a relatively young technology that has to compete with a <bold>mature</bold> oil-based chemical industry that has had nearly a century to optimize its methods and production processes. Nevertheless, the growing concerns about the environment and the possibility of cheaper oil in the future make white biotechnology a serious <bold>contender.</bold></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>General Questions</title><p id="Par206"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par207">Find a headline for each paragraph of the text.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par208">State at least three innovations of white biotechnology, describe them more closely.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par209">Clarify what problems go along with new white biotechnological inventions?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par210">Exemplify the reasons for the environmentally-friendliness of white biotechnology.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par211">Some adversaries say that biofuel is not environmentally-friendly.

For example, blue biotechnology includes practices utilizing ocean resources, whereas red biotechnology is related to pharmaceutical products or biomedical engineering. Yellow biotechnology involves the use of bio-engineering to make food. A classic example of yellow biotech’s adaption of natural resources for our palates is brewing beer – harnessing the natural yeast fermentation process to fuel college fraternities and connoisseurs alike.</p><p id="Par278">A current hot topic within the food industry and culture and therefore yellow biotech, is sustainability. It is well known that the meat industry, in particular, has a drastic, and <bold>pervasive</bold>, effect on local and global environments.<sup>1</sup> This damaging effect results from resource diversion used to create farms, as well as the subsequent byproducts and run off from their existence.<sup>2</sup></p><p id="Par279">Deforestation, clean water usage, and heavy feed requirements are necessary to raise the livestock, while antibiotics, pesticides, animal waste, and hormones directly pollute land and water to maintain them. The meat industry overall is responsible, for up to 24 % of greenhouse gas emissions, with no sign of slowing down.<sup>3</sup> Despite the implications for both human health and the environment, meat demand is increasing even as our natural resources are diminishing.</p><p id="Par280">However, from great demand comes great potential. Within the yellow biotech sector, biologists and <bold>foodies</bold> are rising to the challenge. One exciting company, founded by Dr. Mark Post, uses <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture techniques on adult cow stem cells to manufacture <bold>bovine</bold> muscle tissue – aka hamburger meat. The end result lowers land use by up to 99 %, water use by 96 %, and greenhouse gas emissions by 96 % when compared to other animal meat products.<sup>4</sup> Dr. Post conducted this research at Maastricht University, Netherlands, and live aired the first tasting of his “test tube meat” made up of over 20,000 hand-cultured muscle strands. In August 2013, taste testers noted the lack of fat or juiciness, but gave full points for the mouth feel and definitively preferred the <italic>in vitro</italic> meat to a vegetable-based substitute.</p><p id="Par281">Since then, Dr. Post has taken his technology towards the market with his company MosaMeat. The cost of the first hamburger was a <bold>daunting</bold> Euro 250,000 (over USD 311,000). According to the company however, many of these costs were due to standard academic laboratory fees and the overall cost of operating at such a small scale. Ideally, this could be <bold>remedied</bold> by scaling up production and further refining their growth process. Considering the company plans to go global to help fill the hunger gap, achieving efficiencies of scale is very much a part of their long term plans. Still, the company has a few things to work out moving forward on the science end. The current culture system requires fetal bovine serum to grow the cells into functional supplement used daily in cell culture labs, for a company intent on using as minimal animal products with the smallest environmental impact possible, the question remains if a synthetic serum might be able to take its place.</p><p id="Par282">Overall, MosaMeat and other <italic>in vitro</italic> meat companies show huge potential and have momentum on their side. With the current rate of research and initial progress shown, both environmentalists and animal lovers, as cheap, sustainable hamburger on the table, without the costs to the animals or environment.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par283">To see where <italic>in vitro</italic> meat might take us in the future, check out this website for Bistro in vitro.

These are all, according to the vast majority of scientists, exactly what we can expect to see more and more of. However, what is often overlooked are the sociopolitical consequences of these climatic changes, in other words, we tend to view these natural disasters in a vacuum without recognizing the <bold>myriad</bold> ways in which climate change is both directly and indirectly shaping economies, cultures and governments.</p><p id="Par347">This being the case, looking back at conflicts such as those in Syria and the Sudan, it has become increasingly clear that climate change played a role in <bold>triggering</bold> the instability that led to these conflicts. Which begs the question could these conflicts have been prevented through non-political measures that responded to changes in climate?</p><p id="Par348">The answer increasingly seems to be yes. Further developments in biotechnology and a deeper understanding of what triggered the conflicts in Syria and Sudan point to novel prevention solutions grounded in modern agriculture. The arrival of genetically engineered (GE) drought-tolerant crops can <bold>withstand</bold> longer and more intense droughts could have the potential to prevent future conflicts.</p><p id="Par349">Both the conflicts in Syria and the Sudan followed intense, climate change-<bold>induced</bold> drought periods that caused mass crop failures and famine. Beginning as early as 1998 and continuing into the 21st century, Syria and the surrounding region experienced a drought that, according to research published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was the worst the region had experienced in 900 years.</p><p id="Par350">The subsequent crop failure and famine eventually forced rural populations into urban centers to seek out food and better living conditions. The unfortunate result of this mass migration of people was the failure of Syrian cities to provide basic goods and services, leading to public unrest and eventually conditions ripe for civil war.</p><p id="Par351">Had these farmers been better prepared to deal with years-long drought conditions, might Syria have avoided their civil war? The answer is not clear, as the conflict in Syria is complex and it is impossible to say whether it could have been prevented by any one action.</p><p id="Par352">However, learning from Syria, we can assume that in the future, reducing the <bold>impacts</bold> of drought on particularly at risk populations through implementation of modern farming practices and the introduction of GE drought-tolerant crops could play a major role in preventing political instability.</p><p id="Par353">Though there are few GE drought-tolerant crops on the market today, scientists all over the world are developing new crops in an effort to better prepare farmers for the increasingly severe droughts we expect to see.</p><p id="Par354">Researchers at the University of Cape Town in South Africa are working to genetically engineer <bold>teff</bold>, an African grain important to many <bold>indigenous</bold> groups, in order to increase its ability <bold>to bounce back</bold> from water <bold>deprivation</bold>. The group intends to pull genes from a <bold>non-edible</bold> native plant, <italic>Myroflammus flabellifolius</italic>, which has the ability to enter <bold>dormancy</bold> during intense drought, but then <bold>bounce back</bold> in the event of rain. Small scale, public projects such as these that <bold>pinpoint</bold> specific crops in specific areas will be the key to combatting the effects of climate change.</p><p id="Par355">Similarly, Xiaophang Yang at the Oakridge National Laboratory in Tennessee is attempting something more ambitious and wide reaching in this research on understanding how naturally drought-resistant plants use a different type of photosynthesis to endure the stressful conditions of drought.

This biotech future presses in daily, <bold>sparking</bold> imaginations. At the same time, it <bold>elicits</bold> wariness or even fear that humanity is gaining too much power or too little choice over human evolution and destiny. The political climate, <bold>permeated</bold> as it is by a ferocious “moral approach” to science policy, heightens this public concern. We seem to have lost our capacity for rational discourse in the public arena. The biotech industry has increasingly realized that not only regulatory schemes but also <bold>contentious</bold> public and political debate can either enable or <bold>constrain</bold> research and development. For better or worse, science is political.</p><p id="Par427"><bold>We Can, but Must We?</bold></p><p id="Par428">Since the birth of Dolly the cloned sheep, public concern about advancing biotechnology has been enflamed by the suspicion that science is at the mercy of the technological imperative, the <bold>propensity</bold> to think that because something can be done, it is inevitable. This seemingly easy slide from can to will – because it is technically possible to clone a child into existence, it will become an everyday occurrence, for example – leaves some with a sense of <bold>fatedness</bold>, a sense that science is unstoppable. Hence, for those people, science is not a subject of ethical concern. In this view, at best, ethics takes a <bold>quietistic</bold> turn; at worse, it becomes completely irrelevant. A mantra of ‘if we can, we inevitably will’ places troubling limits on our critical thinking and moral imagination. We must recognize that the possible – however <bold>captivating</bold>, however <bold>daunting</bold> – is not inevitable.</p><p id="Par429">As human biotech research continues, scientist and layperson alike have the opportunity to deliberate about the ethical <bold>ramifications</bold> of the possible futures opened by scientific research. The science of ethics asks us to justify our actions and account for our intentions. It is not enough just to intend the good or to do something to bring it about. We must give good reasons why we do what we do. In the <bold>realm</bold> of biotechnology, our reasoning needs to address three main areas:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par430"><bold>Incentives</bold> or the ways that we encourage scientists to do particular kinds of research</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par431"><italic>Intentions</italic> or the goals of that research</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par432"><italic>Actions</italic> or the potential applications of research results</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par433">When considering ethical reasons for our actions, it is prudent to avoid “the Dolly effect,” that is, attempting to slam the ethical door well after the sheep has <bold>scurried away</bold>. The <bold>unanticipated</bold> arrival of new biotechnologies – from cloning to xenotransplantation – leaves the public, and the scientific community, without a framework for considering the attendant ethical issues. As we quickly learned after Dolly’s birth announcement was published in the <italic>New York Times</italic>, paying close attention to the direction biotechnology is headed is infinitely better than potentially overreacting once it gets there. To avoid the Dolly effect, the biotech community must initiate ethical discussions within itself and with the wider public.</p><p id="Par434"><bold>Questions Come First</bold></p><p id="Par435">To that end, it is well to begin with some questions. Ethics is about questions: about who asks, what they ask for and how we as individuals and communities respond. In reference to biotechnology, what questions should be posed? What aspects should be considered?</p><p id="Par436">Along with the “golly wow” response to biotech innovation, we must ask, what are the personal and social impacts of biotechnology? What are its potential impacts on our values, our virtues, and our relationships? Does a particular application of biotechnology protect or endanger human or individual rights? Are the benefits and burdens distributed fairly? Does biotechnology advance or <bold>impede</bold> the common good? What are the risks, burdens and benefits? On whom do they fall? How are they distributed? What is an acceptable way to achieve a given benefit? May we do anything, as long as the outcome is good on balance? Or are there limits on what we do, even in the name of human health? And, what – or whom – have we not thought about?</p><p id="Par437">The first step in answering any of those questions is quite difficult for people not well-versed in human biology and genetics: get the facts. Many disagreements result from not grasping the facts of the matter. It is impossible to make sound judgements about the appropriate uses of genetic testing, for example, without understanding some genetic science and the nature of the information gathered through such testing. It is <bold>incumbent</bold> upon scientists and others working in biotechnology to educate the public in general, and the media in particular, about the scientific method and experimental results. The trend toward releasing experimental results to the press before publication in a <bold>peer-reviewed</bold> journal, which is problematic in and of itself, at least requires scientifically <bold>savvy</bold> journalists whose duty is, in turn, to provide an adequate set of facts to the public.</p><p id="Par438"><bold>Ethical Reasoning</bold></p><p id="Par439">Of course, facts only describe what is; ethics deals with what ought to be. How do we responsibly move from what is to what ought to be? It is the job of philosophical ethics to provide standards that help us identify what ought to be done.</p><p id="Par440">Utilitarianism: one way to think about “the ought” is through the lens of utility, which looks at various options for action, asking who will be affected and to what extent each <bold>stakeholder</bold> will be benefited or harmed. In the utilitarian view, an ethical action is the one that produces the greatest balance of good over harm or the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Regarding research in human molecular genetics, for example, the utilitarian might argue that the potential benefit of relieving human suffering outweighs the possible dangers of manipulating human genes and evolution through germ-line intervention.</p><p id="Par441">Rights: A different approach presumes that what makes human beings more than mere things is our ability to choose freely what type of lives to lead and the right to have our choices respected. This view from rights describes an ethical action as that which protects people from being used in ways that they do not choose. Importantly, each human has a right not to be treated as means to another’s end, even an undeniably good end. The right not to be used encompasses other rights: the right to be told the truth, the right to privacy and the right not to be harmed are among those particularly relevant to biotech research and genetic medicine. For example, respecting rights may set limits on human subject research in molecular genetics by requiring adequate informed consent including an honest assessment of risks and benefits, or it may require that experimental gene transfer therapy to be undertaken only as a last resort. In this view, actions that violate individual or human rights are wrong.</p><p id="Par442">The justice approach to ethics is rooted in the principle of “treating equals equally and unequals unequally.” Justice mandates fairness in that people must be treated the same way unless they differ in ethically relevant ways. For example, when two runners cross the finish line at the same time. It is unfair to award the blue ribbon to Jeff and not to Jake unless, for example, Jake has cheated.</p><p id="Par443">The primary form of justice in medicine and medical research is distributive justice, which is concerned with the fair distribution of benefits and burdens across society. Distributive justice, which is concerned with the fair distribution of benefits and burdens across society. Distributive justice seeks clarity regarding those aspects of individuals and society that may justify drawing distinctions in how benefits and burdens are allocated. That is, it seeks to identify under what conditions treating unequals unequally would be justified. Such material conditions could include distribution based on determinations of need, social worth, contribution, or effort. For example, the principle of need would support mechanisms for providing access to cutting-edge treatments to all who would tangibly benefit irrespective of their ability to pay for them. A principle of contribution might suggest that a family who sponsored research into an illness might have more influence on the direction of the research and greater access to its fruits than the rest of us.</p><p id="Par444">The common good rests on a vision of society in which all people join in the pursuit of shared values and aims. Because individual good is <bold>inextricably</bold> woven into the good of the whole community, pursuing the common good includes creating a set of general conditions that are equally to everyone’s advantage. Together with respecting individual rights and freedoms, the common good approach requires that common goals, such as human health and well being, be pursued through biotech innovation and a stable health care infrastructure.</p><p id="Par445">A consideration of virtue assumes that certain ideals allow for the full development of our humanity. A person who has <bold>inculcated</bold> these core ideals, or virtues, will do what is right when faced with an ethical choice. Virtues are dispositions that facilitate acting in ways that develop human potential and allow human flourishing. Virtues are good habits in that they are acquired through repetition and practice and, once acquired, they become characteristic of a person. Honesty, integrity, prudence, courage, wisdom and compassion are examples of virtues. Once a person has developed a virtuous character, his or her <bold>inclination</bold> is to act in ways consistent with ethical principles. In much the same way as Barry Bonds is inclined to hit home runs, the virtuous person will be inclined to tell the truth and act with compassion and courage.</p><p id="Par446">Virtue ethics, with the emphasis on character and ideals, captures the idea of “the good scientist” – intelligent, honest, compassionate, determined – much more so than the principle-based approaches of utility, justice and rights. The development of pharmaceuticals for “compassionate use” echoes an ethics of virtue.</p><p id="Par447"><bold>Reasoning into Biotech Practice</bold></p><p id="Par448">Those five approaches suggest that biotech ethics should ask five questions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par449">What benefits and what harms can be predicted for biotech innovations in both the research and application phases, and which courses of action will result in the best consequences overall? It is important to remember that determining consequences is more or less a guessing game. In instances of profound uncertainty and sizable risk, it is best to <bold>err</bold> on the side of caution when calculating benefits and risks. Neither hopes nor fears should be over-sold.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par450">Who are the ethically relevant stakeholders, and what rights do they have? Which course of action protects those rights? Is human dignity respected? The consideration of specific individual and group rights requires <bold>coming to grips</bold> with the right to health care – a right that Americans claim but which remains unfulfilled for many.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par451">Which option treats everyone the same unless there is an ethically justified reason to treat them differently? Biotech justice might hold up “need” as a criterion for access to innovative treatments.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par452">Which course of action seeks the common good? Certainly, the recent SARS epidemic has heightened concern for the health of the whole and for the creation of common conditions that maximize individual and communal well being.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par453">Which option best develops virtues? And which virtues, such as trust and compassion, might be particularly relevant to biotech development and human health?</p><p id="Par454"><bold>Putting It Together</bold></p><p id="Par455">This framework for ethics does not offer an easy or automatic solution to ethical dilemmas. That is not its goal. The frame work helps identify what ethics requires of us: to consider benefits and burdens, rights and justice, virtues and the common good. Each of these approaches gives us key information about ethical options in a given situation. In the end, each of us brings our moral judgement to bear in carefully considering the facts of the matter and what is right-making and wrong-making about our options for acting. When we do this reasoning together, through public discourse, we have a chance to develop a healthcare vision for our society. Such a vision would provide the necessary – and currently absent – criteria for determining which research <bold>trajectories</bold> to follow and which to ignore.</p><p id="Par456">As we deliberate, we have a further obligation. Because biotech innovations may eventually involve germ-line manipulation, the actions we take today may effect every future generation of human beings, making the coming generations stakeholders in our ethical analysis. Consideration of transgenerational consequences may impose limits on what we do now in the interest of those who come after us. Minimally, we should not knowingly inflict harm. Many indigenous peoples speak of responsibilities that extend to the next seven generations. There is moral wisdom for us in that approach. As we approach cutting-edge issues in biotechnology, this very ancient moral wisdom can serve us well.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="FPar13"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="Par457">The general framework for ethical decision making on which this article is based was developed by Manual Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, and Michael J.

At the time, the Todd lab was also collaborating with researchers in Germany on an ongoing study, called BABYDIET, examining the effects of a gluten-free diet during the first year of life on children’s development and risk of Type 1 diabetes. BABYDIET requires regular collection of blood from participants over many years.

From the BABYDIET dataset, they found that 23 % of all genes examined varied with the seasons.</p><p id="Par573">Grouping the seasonal genes from the BABYDIET cohort into categories, the researchers found that overall, pro-inflammatory gene expression rose in the winter and fell in the summer, following the same general expression pattern as ARNTL.</p><p id="Par574">Next, the researchers turned to publicly available data from two additional studies, on diabetes and asthma, the latter a multi-center study involving participants of summer and winter gene expression observed in the BABYDIET cohort were reversed in the dataset from an Australian asthmatic cohort, indicating that the seasonal trends were consistent even across hemispheres. In an asthmatic cohort from Iceland, which undergoes periods of 24-hour sunlight, seasonal patterns were irregular.</p><p id="Par575">Using genetic markers of each cell type, the team found that levels of individual blood cell types in the BABYDIET cohort seemed to vary by season. Examining the composition of blood donated to Cambridge Bioresource for research throughout the year confirmed that the makeup did vary seasonally.</p><p id="Par576">In a population from The Bambia, a Western African country just north of the equator, the researchers examined patterns of cellular blood composition using data gathered through the Keneba Biobank, finding that the blood’s cellular makeup was tied to the rainy season. The researchers hypothesized that these seasonal changes in the cellular composition of blood are the major drivers of the seasonal variation in gene expression.</p><p id="Par577">Studying gene expression in <bold>biopsies</bold> of adipose tissue from an independent twin study also revealed seasonal gene-expression variation, extending this seasonal variation trend beyond blood and immune cells.</p><p id="Par578">An outstanding question is whether expression levels of <bold>pro-inflammatory</bold> genes rise in the winter as an offensive measure against <bold>pathogens</bold> or as a response to heightened pathogen exposure. “That’s the ‘chicken and egg’ argument,” said Todd.</p><p id="Par579">Knowledge of seasonal gene expression could potentially help researchers better understand and treat seasonal diseases. For example, it is known that death from cardiovascular disease is more likely in the winter when, according to this research, expression of pro-inflammatory genes is high.</p><p id="Par580">‘Our observations help explain why some chronic diseases are seasonal in that our immune systems are heightened to be pro-inflammatory so that when we have a cardiovascular disease, we’re more <bold>prone to</bold> developing the pathology that might lead to cardiovascular death,’ said Tod. “I’m sure that the greater infectious disease burden that we suffer is also a contributing factor to the changes that we’ve seen, I think it’s both.”</p><p id="Par581">Cermakian said it is too soon to consider the clinical utility of these findings. “What is sure,” he noted, “is that timing information, circadian but also possibly seasonal/annual, will need to be taken into account more and more in the future, with the aim of providing the most adequate treatment to patients. The response to a treatment might be very different at one time of the year or six months later.”</p></sec><sec><p id="Par582">Castro Dopico X et al.

On the other, it emphasises the role of biogenic material flows. The bioeconomy model is expected to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels in the long term. In order to implement the shift from a fossil-based economy to a biobased economy on the regional level, the Baden-Württemberg government launched the Bioeconomy Research Strategy in summer 2013.</p><p id="Par642">It is a very large wheel that natural scientists, engineers, economists, ethicists, politicians and others are starting to turn. A wheel that, understandably, is only slowly gaining <bold>momentum</bold>. After all, it is a question of creating a whole new raw material basis for industry and the economy. It is about developing a new system in which science, industry and value creation interact in different ways than they did before. In the transition from a fossil-based to a biobased economy, oil, natural gas and coal will gradually become less important. These fossil fuels will be replaced by plants, plant residues, biowaste and other biobased materials.</p><p id="Par643">More than ever before industry and science will have to act as a system, and previously non-existent connections will be established between different value creation chains.</p><p id="Par644">Important economic factor: hydrocarbons</p><p id="Par645">The industrialization of the past 250 years is based on good ideas, drive and fossil fuels. Therefore, all industrialised economies are built on oil, gas and coal. Oil plays a particularly important role as it is used to produce organic chemicals, i.e. hydrocarbons. These are the basis for energy carriers such as petrol, diesel fuel and kerosene. Hydrocarbons form the economic basis of the chemical industry.</p><p id="Par646">Solvents, paints, plastics, basic and fine chemicals, additives and many other products are produced from oil using complex, but well structured and established industrial processes. Moreover, our mobility, communication, nutrition, agriculture as well as the energy sector and others are directly dependent on fossil hydrocarbons. Our everyday life is unthinkable without fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas. Hydrocarbons are an important element of the economies of industrial countries where value is created by the efficacy with which hydrocarbons are converted into marketable products; they also make a decisive contribution to shaping the global economic system.</p><p id="Par647">Four challenges</p><p id="Par648">If the vision of a bioeconomy is to become reality, it must not be based on replacing existing infrastructures. Instead a bioeconomy must be built on existing industrial processes. This means that it should initially offer <bold>drop-in solutions</bold> in order to gain a <bold>foothold</bold> in industry. At the same time, new processes, products and value creation chains need to be established. Four challenges need to be solved.</p><p id="Par649">First: The bioeconomy must ensure a solid and reliable raw material base through agricultural and forestry production. These raw materials must be distributed in a way that assures human nutrition as well as taking into account all the economic sectors that use these raw materials.</p><p id="Par650">Waste management is an important source of raw materials in a biobased economy. It can provide large quantities of biogenic waste – plant residues, fermentation residues, organic waste and material from landscape management. These materials can primarily be used for the production of energy, chemicals and materials. However, it will be necessary to adapt waste management material flows to the new value creation chains of the bioeconomy.</p><p id="Par651">The second challenge relates to the conversion of biobased materials into hydrocarbons using so called conversion processes. Conversion processes can be seen as the bridge between petrochemistry and the new green chemistry. The production of hydrocarbons directly from biomass is already possible; however, the methods need to be further developed on a large industrial scale.</p><p id="Par652">Conversion is only one field where a bioeconomy offers sales opportunities. Further potential lies in new materials. The fine-tuned process control of chemical, thermal and biotechnological process steps has the potential to release and use these potentials. One example is the biobased polyamide-5,10 developed by the Biopolymers/Biomaterials cluster.</p><p id="Par653">The third challenge is sustainability. Sustainability is inseparable from bioeconomy. No sustainability, no bioeconomy. This statement underlies further fundamental requirements. Although some have been discussed and dealt with over the past years and decades, they need to occupy a more prominent place in discussions relating to the economy and industry of the future, and include such issues as the effective protection of the climate, water, soil as well as biodiversity. The objective of using raw materials from fields, forests and meadows for industrial production is more than ever associated with the need to manage and maintain the respective ecosystems. This includes rigorous protection of the climate, water, soil and biodiversity. This is where biodiversity research comes into play, which essentially means that the bioeconomy needs to promote a wide range of species, i.e. a biodiversity. It would be contradictory and dangerous for biodiversity if land-use methods that were focused simply on mass production were to be applied.</p><p id="Par654">A bioeconomy also touches on ethical and social issues. Agricultural land is limited. We need to decide how much land is to be set aside for the production of food and feed, fuels and biobased materials. Against a background of hunger, species extinction, environmental and climate protection, the competition between food and fuel calls for a fundamental <bold>assessment</bold> of the respective fields of action in ethical terms. The Baden-Württemberg Bioeconomy Strategy Circle emphasises that the transition to a biobased economy also needs to take social interest into account.</p><p id="Par655">The fourth challenge is to convert technological solutions that are established in the different sectors of the bioeconomy into jobs, production plants, services and goods for export. This fulfills the economic and commercial aspects of a bioeconomy. In addition, criteria that enable the economic assessment of environmental and climate protection as well as biodiversity need to be developed. A bioeconomy also requires us to change our <bold>mindset</bold>. On the one hand, questions relating to immaterial values must be asked and answered and on the other hand, soft factors such as biodiversity need to be recognized as being able to create added value.</p><p id="Par656">Bioeconomy research in Baden-Württemberg</p><p id="Par657">These challenges result in a considerable need for research. Scientists in Baden-Württemberg are investigating some of the topics that are of key importance in the transition from a fossil-based to a biobased economy.</p><p id="Par658">The University of Hohenheim carries out research into biomass production, biomass potentials, land use, land-use changes and many other aspects associated with biobased raw materials. The Institute of Farm Management led by Prof. Dr. Enno Bahrs at the University of Hohenheim is mainly focused on efficiency. How can land be used efficiently? Which plants are best for which purpose? How must material flows and production systems be designed and implemented in order to achieve ideal efficiency?</p><p id="Par659">Prof. Gero Becker from the Institute of Forest Utilisation and Work Science at the University of Freiburg is focused on research to improve the industrial utilisation of forest wood products. His research takes into account biomass quantities and resources as well as biomass quality in terms of conversion.</p><p id="Par660">Professor Henning Bockhorn at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) has developed a method known as “biomass steam processing” that enables the production of biochar from residual biomass.</p><p id="Par661">The transition to a biobased economy cannot be achieved without science and research, i.e. an increase in knowledge. This is why the term “knowledge-based bioeconomy (KBBE)” is often used. The Baden-Württemberg government launched the Baden-Württemberg Bioeconomy Research Programme in summer 2013, for which the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts will provide around 12 million euros between 2014 and 2019. Funding will be provided to research that is specifically focused on biogas, the use lignocellulose and the use of microalgae.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec107"><title>General Questions</title><p id="Par662"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par663">Explain the meaning of biogenic material flow.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par664">Give at least three examples of products you use which are made out of fossil fuels.
