Seven science-driven innovations are elaborated in this chapter, each with some concrete examples. We stress that policy innovations, institutional innovations, and technology innovations are closely connected and actually need to be pursued in an integrated approach. Without accelerated interdisciplinary food system science, the necessary innovations for a sustainable food system will not be achieved. We note the need for systems innovations rather than only single-issue innovations, and call on the science communities to commit to enhanced collaboration among all relevant different disciplines of sciences for this purpose. Moreover, science is not naÃ¯ve vis Ã¡ vis power relations: social sciences explicitly uncover them and must identify options for innovations that help to overcome adverse effects. Food system science and food system policy need a stronger framework for constructive and evidence-based interaction for moving ahead. We call upon governments and UN agencies to initiate a process to explore options â existing as well as new â for a strengthened global science-policy interface for a sustainable food system.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-031-15703-5_Chapter_50.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Food systems (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2021a</xref>) at the global level, and in many countries and regions, are failing to end hunger, provide adequate nutritious foods for healthy diets, or deliver safe foods. Between 720Â million and 811Â million people face hunger and are undernourished â that is, every tenth person â 150Â million children under 5Â years of age are stunted (short for their age), and two billion people are overweight or obese. These numbers have been high and/or growing for a number of years now, and with COVID-19 disproportionately impacting poor and food-insecure populations, they are continuing to rise, with an estimated 118Â million more people facing hunger in 2020 than in 2019 (FAO et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>; Klassen and Murphy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>). About 600Â million people fall ill each year due to the consumption of contaminated or unsafe foods (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2020</xref>). We are losing ground on the progress that we have already made, and we face the prospect of severely compromising the achievement of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda.</p><p id="Par3">Besides escalating hunger and all forms of malnutrition (micronutrient deficiencies, underweight, overweight/obesity and related NCDs), poverty and inequalities between and within countries are widespread and becoming entrenched. For many people, engaging in activities in the food system would seem to offer the most viable opportunities to escape poverty, yet they are being left out of earning their fair share of the benefits from engaging in food systems, and are condemned to jobs that do not provide livable wages and decent working conditions and livelihoods. Fundamental human rights to food, health, safe water and sanitation, and education continue to be violated. Ending poverty and gross inequalities remains essential for achieving the SDGs.</p><p id="Par4">Food systems relate to the three basic dimensions of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental (Dury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>; FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>). Many food systems are based on production and distribution systems that are simply not sustainable. Scientific assessments indicate that many aspects of current food production systems drive the degradation of land and soil, water, and climate, as well as biodiversity loss (IPBES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>; HLPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>). Climate change is increasingly adversely impacting food security. The global food system emits about 30% of global greenhouse gases, contributes to 80% of tropical deforestation, and is a main driver of soil degradation (Food and Land use Coalition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>) and desertification, water scarcity, and biodiversity decline. Climate change, along with soil and environmental degradation, is partly caused by â and has negative impacts â on the food system. It is very clear that how we produce and consume food has profound implications for the health of people, animals, plants, and the planet itself (Bron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The Food Systems Summit took place in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has revealed the close intertwining of food, ecological, and health systems (Webb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2020a</xref>). The pandemic is having a significant impact on the global commodity markets and trading systems, economic growth, incomes, and poverty levels, with disproportionate burdens on vulnerable communities in both urban (Moustier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>) and rural areas. This is likely to worsen inequalities and undernutrition, including child undernutrition, which can have life-long consequences. Modeling projects that COVID-19 could result in an additional 9.3Â million children wasted (low weight for height) and 2.6Â million children stunted (low height for age) by 2022 (Osendarp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>). COVID-19 further increases food insecurity and poverty, which may become much more serious if comprehensive policy responses â especially equitable global vaccination coverage â are not implemented in a timely and evidence-based manner (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Science needs to explore the root causes of emerging zoonotic diseases and closely engage with policy innovations, including those related to land use and animal production. Going forward, it is abundantly clear that more attention will need to be paid to how to make food systems more resilient to health shocks and pandemics, associated economic shocks and slowdowns, and violent conflicts and other crises, just as more attention is now being paid to how to make food systems more resilient to extreme weather events and other stressors induced by the changing climate (Webb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2020b</xref>; Mushtaq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). This will require integrated approaches that create greater synergy across government efforts to deal with health and other social services, as well as food system failures, in rural areas and other marginal communities (Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>; Wouterse and Badiane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The changing state of the art of science and innovation and the important lessons that they offer for food system transformation, need to be recognized. As noted earlier, science has at least two important roles in food systems: first, science generates new breakthroughs that can become innovations in food systems (e.g., genomics, plant nutrition, animal production and health, bio-sciences, earth sciences, social sciences, remote sensing, AI and robotics, digitization, big data, health and nutrition science, behavioral research, etc.); and second, science helps to inform and shape decisions, investments, policies and institutions, and can also be involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of actions needed to learn and draw lessons for impact at scale (Hainzelin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>). This also includes science that focuses on knowledge gaps, risks, uncertainties, and controversies. Many approaches, from discovery research to implementation research, and including both primary research and modeling techniques, can contribute valuable evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Opportunities for Science and Innovation</title><p id="Par8">Science and research are fundamental drivers of innovation. All three â science, research, and innovation â are essential for accelerating the transformation to healthier, more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems (Fears and Canales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>). To enable theÂ full inclusion of poor and marginalized populations â including smallholder communities (Diao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2021</xref>) â in the process of and benefit from food system transformation, investments in technology-based innovations must be accompanied by institutional innovations (including social, business and policy innovations), underpinned by science: basic sciences and applied sciences, natural sciences and social sciences. The Scientific Group underlines not only its respect for Indigenous Peoples (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2021a</xref>) knowledge systems, but also recommends investing more in programs that explore mutual learning and innovation across traditional and modern knowledge and science systems, considering both on equal footing. This may include documenting this knowledge and jointly studying it scientifically.</p><p id="Par9">We highlight the need for systems innovations, rather than merely single-issue innovations, and call for enhanced collaboration between and among different disciplines of sciences for this purpose. We suggest a focus on seven science-driven innovations to catalyze, support, and accelerate food system transformation to achieve the SDGs, and SDG2 in particular. These innovations emerge from our conceptual framework and the building blocks and linkages therein (see Box). We hasten to emphasize that technology-based innovations and policy and institutional innovations are in synergy among each other: in other words, many technology-based innovations need policy and institutional innovations to fully realize their potential (for instance, innovative financing mechanisms), and, similarly, many policy and institutional innovations need technology-based innovations to be properly implemented and monitored (for instance, information systems). Further, in many instances, food system innovations must be place-based, adapted to the local contexts and capacities. We provide <italic>examples of science-based innovations in the seven action areas below, identifiable in cursive format</italic>. Alignment of technological change with sustainability concerns certainly requires attention and joint engagement by researchers from all areas of the food system-related sciences (including social sciences) guiding innovation arrangements.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Innovations to End Hunger and Increase the Availability and Affordability of Healthy Diets and Nutritious Foods</title><sec><p id="Par10">More than three billion people cannot afford healthy diets, and more than 1.5Â billion people cannot even afford a diet that only meets the required levels of essential nutrients (FAO et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>; Masters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2021</xref>). The contribution of science and innovation here relates to identifying optimal context-specific investment opportunities and their implementation. Broadly speaking, the investment opportunities include productivity enhancement, peopleâs skills and empowerment, agricultural research, social protection, nutrition programs, etc. (Center for Development Research (ZEF) of the University of Bonn in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). Policy innovations are needed to <italic>repurpose subsidies towards related supportive investments that facilitate a sustainable food system</italic> (Hendriks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021a</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Food Is Undervalued</title><p id="Par11">The value of food from the cultural, social and economic perspectives needs revisiting. An important role of science here is also to identify the indirect effects of these perspectives, while efforts must be made to embrace the true value of food (Hendriks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021b</xref>). External costs associated with climate change (Hansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>), biodiversity loss, and adverse health effects need to be considered. The current costs of environmental and health externalities of food systems are estimated to range within 4â11Â trillion USD and 3â39Â trillion USD, respectively. Compared to the current total global food consumption of nine trillion USD, the true cost of food, including environmental, health and economic externalities, is 19.8Â trillion USD.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref><italic>True-cost accounting</italic> approaches are to be pursued throughout the whole food system, and related capacities built up in the corporate and public sectors. Capacities for internalizing such externalities are limited.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> Cautious approaches are warranted to develop price and non-price instruments, including regulatory-based instruments, to help deal with such externalities. Fostering positive externalities of the food systems, such as through carbon farming and biodiversity-enhancing land use, should be considered and tested where justified (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>). Nonetheless, if food prices were to reflect true costs, healthy diets may become unaffordable for low-income consumers, and social safety nets would need to be put in place.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Healthy Diet Concepts Benefit from a Strong Scientific Basis</title><p id="Par14">Measures that incentivize the production and market supply of fruits and vegetables and related innovations enhance consumption and can increase the income of smallholders (Zilberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2019</xref>; Zarnowiecki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2020</xref>). However, rising incomes for consumers do not automatically lead to the increased consumption of healthy diets: even when accessibility and affordability are not constraints, the consumption of healthy diets is not assured, as people may still not change their consumption behavior. Approaches to creating demand for healthy diets and nutrition must be explored. At the same time, we have to be careful not to put all of the blame for poor nutrition on consumer behavior (Herrero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021a</xref>).

There is a lack of scientific consensus on the dietary recommendations for animal-sourced proteins (ASF); these are nutrient-rich, but some are evidenced to increase the risk of diet-related chronic diseases if consumed at high levels. Plant-based diets have been evidenced to lower the risks of non-communicable diseases, and meet protein and adult micronutrient requirements. Changes in the consumption of ASF â reducing consumption, in particular, of processed forms of meat in communities where current levels are high and increasing consumption among vulnerable groups â can ensure a sustainable livestock sector while retaining the positive nutritional impact of ASF (Herrero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021b</xref>). Plant- and insect-based meat alternatives and protein sources can substitute for ASF without compromising its nutritional benefits.

Such transformation entails new supply-side investments, effective trade and markets, and modified consumer behavior, with a fast transition towards more sustainable and healthy diets and sharp reductions in food loss and food waste. SDG12 (responsible production and consumption) is a key goal for the successful transformation of global food systems to achieve SDG2.</p><p id="Par47">With an integrated modeling framework, Laborde and Torero (this volume) model six individual interventions similar to those presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> with respect to their impact on food systems, the prevalence of undernutrition, ecological effects in terms of GHG emissions, land and energy use, and the use of chemical inputs. Given the synergies and complementarities between these scenarios, the authors assess them as a package. The sensitivity to the results is also assessed under different governance principles, such as land use policies.</p><p id="Par48">The scenarios are listed in Laborde and Torero (this volume) and organized around three main pillars: achievement of a more <italic>efficient</italic> and <italic>inclusive</italic> system, allowing consumers and producers to make <italic>better choices</italic>. The results of the different scenarios are consistent with the baseline of <italic>The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020</italic><bold>,</bold> namely that, in 2019, there were 690Â million undernourished people in the world and healthy diets were unaffordable for almost three billion people. The findings confirm that ending chronic hunger at a 5% level is feasible by 2030 with the appropriate balance of interventions. While no intervention alone could solve the problem, key interventions to increase the efficiency of food systems â through increased <italic>farm productivity</italic> and a reduction of <italic>food loss and waste</italic> â will reduce the number of people in chronic hunger by 314Â million by 2030. Beyond hunger, 568Â million people will be able to afford healthy diets. To target the remaining population, <italic>safety nets</italic> and targeted programs like <italic>school-feeding</italic> interventions are required. When adding such safety nets into the model, it is possible to cover the 2.4Â billion remaining people without access to healthy diets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Number of people (mio) removed from a state of chronic undernourishment in 2030.

Since the needs are unevenly distributed globally, a significant solidarity effort is required for global coordination, especially to support the transformation of food systems in low-income countries.</p><p id="Par53">As previously shown, no single intervention can end malnourishment. The actions modeled will generate trade-offs in greenhouse gas emissions (emissions from agricultural production and net emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use, or AFOLU), chemical inputs (increased use of chemical inputs per hectare), biodiversity (reduction of forest habitat and agricultural land) and energy consumption.</p><p id="Par54">The effects indicate environmental improvement as a consequence of reducing food loss and waste. However, when it comes to net agricultural emissions and AFOLU, the effect is negative, as is the case for forest land. This highlights the need for policies that can stimulate investments in innovation for carbon farming â growing carbon in soil and trees as a tradable commodity â and related payment schemes for ecosystem services, as indicated in Sect. <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref>Â concerning the science and innovation actions above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Enabling Food System Transformation</title><sec><p id="Par55">Transformation of food systems that are under way do not guarantee that the food-related SDGs â especially SDG2 â will be achieved.

We highlight below the required additional actions in the follow-up to the UNFSS 2021 in the fields of finance, capacity, and governance.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Finance</title><p id="Par56">Enabling food system transformations requires constant investment in science that has the potential to produce positive change in systems. In 2018, the world science âoutputâ in terms of peer-reviewed publications was 4.04Â million, and of these, 14% were related to agricultural and biological sciences (about 298,000) and environmental sciences (about 273,000).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> Thousands of potentially game-changing insights are generated by the worldâs scientific communities every year. More attention is needed to identify actionable insights for innovations, and that requires strengthening capacity and innovative financing.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par58">Science systems have been decimated in many countries, especially in the global South. To tap the potentials of science, the public funding of food system science and related research partnerships needs to expand. Governments need to change their low levels of spending on food system-related research and innovation. We call on governments â especially in the global South â to review the level of their investments in food system science and allocate at least 1% of their food system-related GDP to food system science and innovation with a perspective to substantially exceed this target. LDCs should be assisted in quickly reaching the equivalent of this target. About 20Â years ago, African ministers responsible for science and technology had already committed to increase public expenditures on research and development to at least 1% of GDP per annum.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> As basic sciences â for instance, <italic>bio-chemical and nutrition and health sciences</italic> â are becoming increasingly relevant for food systems, the investment in these must also be accelerated and systems for sharing the sciences related to food systems expanded (Beintema et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; von Braun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2020</xref>). There are important new opportunities for engaging private sector science to address public goods in food system innovations, particularly in partnership with the public sector (Herrero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). The private sector here is a broad concept, ranging from semi-subsistence farmers to large corporations. It is often overlooked that the former are also proven innovators (Tambo and WÃ¼nscher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017</xref>). The knowledge of Indigenous Peoples is another important component of local food systemsâ innovation landscape. Intellectual property rights protection issues require revisiting so as to align them with sustainability expectations, especially for scientific opportunities that address overcoming hunger and malnutrition (Zilberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2019</xref>; Zarnowiecki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2020</xref>). New institutional arrangements may be discussed for sharing intellectual property that could directly reduce hunger and address sustainability concerns.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par60">The follow-up to the Food Systems Summit needs to consider how the investments in the identified priority actions may be financed, and that is where innovative finance approaches that economics research can explore shall be considered. Research suggests that mobilizing the necessary financial resources may include a combination of actions, such as (1) provision of additional â actually double the current amount â international development funds (ODA) for agricultural and rural development, food and nutrition security; (2) reallocation of agricultural subsidies towards investment in sustainable development and the scaling up and redesigning of social safety nets; (3) initiation of a new dedicated âend hungerâ fund, perhaps through expanded IDA; and (4) possibly the financing of innovative financial mechanisms such as âEnd Hunger Bondsâ through support from incremental special drawing rights (SDRs) (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2021b</xref>; DÃ­az-Bonilla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>). The private sector should be part of this resource mobilization, expecting long-term returns from a more prosperous society. Research shall identify what combinations of finance may contribute to the sustainable financing of food system transformation.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Capacity</title><p id="Par61">Of particular importance are investments in <italic>improving data, methods, models and tools for all food system components</italic> and actors, as well as building or <italic>enhancing (shared) research infrastructures related to (research) data, modeling platforms, observation and monitoring networks</italic> to support the required advances in research and innovation, especially in the global South (Inter-Academy Partnership <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>). Integrated <italic>global food system models</italic> are needed, as existing models do not have consistent global coverage and are not designed to assess the impacts of all elements of food systems (Webb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2020b</xref>). Besides global foresight work, strengthening national and â where possible â subnational/local policy scenarios and foresight work is also necessary. More attention needs to be paid to strengthening local research capacities, <italic>expanding research collaboration among public and private sector research and indigenous systems</italic>, sharing research infrastructure and data, developing more inclusive and equitable science partnerships and follow-up mechanisms, systematically learning what works and what can be scaled up and translating that knowledge into action, improving the efficiency in the way knowledge is generated and shared, and <italic>addressing intellectual property rights issues when they hinder innovations</italic> that can serve food and nutrition security, food safety, and sustainability goals (Hendriks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021b</xref>). With the increased recognition of their central role in achieving many development goals, food systems will be expected to perform a more complex set of activities, and this requires new and more appropriate holistic metrics. Protection of the freedom of science to innovate and experiment while adhering to ethical standards needs to be continually reinforced.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par62">Because significant components of food systems are local, the Summit has to ensure that its outcomes and deliverables turn into positive local actions. This requires science to align with national and local agendas for the implementation actions. The proximity of science to decision-making is important to connect the timeliness and relevance of science to policy where and when it is needed. Similarly, the development of national and local infrastructure and expertise to effectively link science to decision-making is important. The science underpinning food system transformation becomes more inter- and trans-disciplinary, more open to a wide range of innovations and their diverse stakeholders, and more appropriately configured and scaled to different contexts. Relatedly, it would be important to innovate and <italic>improve the methods for analyzing the performance of food systems</italic> (e.g., analyzing their impact on health, nutrition and sustainability goals) at different levels (local, national, global).</p></sec><sec><p id="Par63">Transformation is not possible without science, and in many instances, citizen participation in research and implementation can be very supportive for the transformation of farming, the application of new technologies, the shift to healthy diets, and other key elements of successful food system transformation. Citizen science has an important role to play in inclusive food system transformation, especially with farmers as co-designers directly participating in the development of innovations and with scientists being more open to and collaborating on fair terms with start-ups. Indigenous Peoples knowledge systems should be partnered with in such approaches.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par64">The international sharing of science and the participation of science in the follow-up to the Food Systems Summit as part of implementation agendas is vital. Proposals for international collaboration include supporting low- and middle-income countries in building and sustaining capacities to acquire and deploy technologies through joint research, education and training programs. Beyond investing in capacities to undertake research, it will be important to also invest in capacities to act upon research: in other words, to put to effective use the knowledge and innovations that already exist (e.g., traditional and indigenous knowledge) or that are generated from new research. This calls for investing in <italic>strengthening the skills of all food system actors</italic>, especially in emerging economies, where these skills tend to be more limited. In many instances, what is lacking is actionable knowledge that may contribute to systemic changes, which requires supporting local innovations and encouraging and facilitating the co-creation/co-design of knowledge. In support of this, <italic>leading research organizations from world regions could form networks (or alliances)</italic> to share science and develop actionable knowledge that supports food system transformations.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Governance and Science-Policy Interface</title><p id="Par65">In contrast to other subjects of global concern that were agreed upon at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, agriculture, food security and nutrition do not have an international agreement or convention to consolidate actions. Climate, biodiversity and desertification have their dedicated conventions and ensuing subsidiary bodies, secretariats and further protocols. Fueled by regular meetings of the conference of parties and underpinned by a solid science-policy interface, they have made enormous progress. Thus, we believe that the time has come to consider such a set of agreements and mechanisms for the complex area of food systems, obviously fully recognizing existing efforts and agents. The UNFSS may wish to consider opening a process for <italic>exploring a treaty on food systems</italic>. In a related manner, food system science and policy need a stronger scientific framework for constructive and evidence-based interaction that will allow it, too, to move ahead for the long term (von Braun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2018</xref>). At the national level, coherent national food systems research policies need to be better integrated into national development policies, such that countries develop their own context-specific food systems policies and strategies. At the international level, some have proposed strengthening the contribution of science to policymaking for transformational food systems with an Intergovernmental Scientific Advisory Panel, while others advocate strengthening and better connecting existing mechanisms (Hendriks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021a</xref>; Inter-Academy Partnership <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>; von Braun and Kalkuhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2015</xref>). We suggest exploring options for an inclusive, global science-policy interface (SPI) for a sustainable food system that connects national and global food systems concerns and will assist in an evidence-based follow-up to the proposed Summit actions and for the long term. This proposition is based on three considerations: (1) the growing complexity of food value chains from resource use to human nutrition and their increasing globalization, which urgently requires a new integrated approach that draws on all related science for sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition systems; (2) the absence of a comprehensive and timely system to collect, analyze and assess data on the diagnosis and technical, economic and social solutions for creating long-term sustainable, affordable, nutritious and safe food systems; and (3) the limited or non-existent translation and traceability of scientific data and experiences into evidence-based policy that precludes the application of experiences across countries and regions (Hendriks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2021c</xref>; Hodson de Jaramillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>; Moughan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2021</xref>; Fan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>; Serova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>; Gulati et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>). Addressing these considerations requires a global mechanism that mobilizes the leading food systems scientists worldwide and across disciplines to support the SPI through co-production, open access, and communication of knowledge. The effective and independent participation of research communities from low-income countries and emerging economies in the SPI must be strengthened to enhance credibility, relevance and legitimacy. We call upon governments and UN agencies to <italic>initiate a process to explore options â those already existing</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref><italic>as well as new â for a global SPI</italic> for a sustainable food system. As such, this would be a concrete outcome of the UNFSS.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par67">Science and policy have a lot to gain from cooperation, but the independence of science to address policy and institutional opportunities and failures with evidence-based insights must not be compromised. Nonetheless, science that produces new insights also needs to constantly earn the trust of society, and in view of the cultural sensitivity of all matters related to food, policies and rules must assure confidence in scientific endeavors. Anti-science sentiments exist in parts of society. While pursuing new insights and truths, there are many issues upon which scientists themselves do not agree, which sometimes irritates policymakers and practitioners. Adhering to responsible and ethical principles, science must collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders. The improved quality and timeliness of science translation and communication for policymakers and non-technical audiences are helpful, along with attention to ethics, peer review, scientific integrity and excellence, transparency and declarations of interest in science.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par68">In closing, science, innovation, and technologies play critical roles among the measures to achieve food system transformations. All sciences â natural sciences and social sciences, basic sciences and applied sciences â in collaboration with diverse traditional knowledge systems must deliver innovations and make significant contributions for the necessary food system transformation in order to achieve the SDGs, especially SDG2, and the complete 2030 Agenda.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors developed this chapter in close collaboration with the Scientific Group of the UN Food Systems Summit, which has engaged extensively with scientific communities around the world, including the partners and contributors of more than 40 reports and briefs prepared specifically for the Scientific Groupâs evidence-based contributions to the Summit.
