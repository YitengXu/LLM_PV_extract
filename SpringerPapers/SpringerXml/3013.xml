In 2018, the added value of China’s industrial sector was 30.5 trillion RMB, accounting for 33.9% of GDP. Energy is consumed by the industrial sector for fuel combustion and raw materials, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2017, The end-use energy consumption of the industrial sector registered at 2.83 billion tce, comprising 64.8% of the total end-use energy consumption. Energy consumption of the industrial sector is mainly attributable to six energy intensive industries, including power, steel, cement, petrochemical, chemical and non-ferrous metal, which made up 75.1% of the total primary energy consumption of the industrial sector in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref>). Industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions include those from energy activities and industrial production processes. However, due to delayed survey and accounting, the statistics of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the industrial sector is relatively not up to date and inconsistent with the accounting standard of industrial output and energy consumption. The <italic>First Biennial Update Report on Climate Change</italic> reveals that the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion in the industrial and construction sectors and from industrial production processes in China totaled 8.48 billion tons in 2012, or 91.0% of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the year (including land use changes and forestry), of which CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion of the industrial and construction sectors stood at 7.28 billion tons, which is 83.8% of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy activities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 3.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy consumption mix of China’s industrial sector (2017)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The expanding industrial output has resulted in rising energy consumption and carbon emissions of the industrial sector, but a notable slowdown has been observed. In terms of energy consumption, in 2017, the end-use energy consumption of the industrial sector was 2.83 billion tce, 1.9 times higher than in 2000 with an average growth of 6.5% year-on-year. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. From the perspective of carbon emissions, the published <italic>National Greenhouse Gas Inventory</italic> suggested total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion in the industrial and construction sectors and from industrial production processes rose by 3.37 billion tons from 2005 to 2012, averaging 7.5% growth rate year-on-year, exceeding the 6.1% average year-on-year growth rate of industrial energy consumption in the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yet as China enters the advanced stage of industrialization and becomes a post-industrialized economy, a major slowdown in the growth of industrial energy consumption has been detected with a continuous decline in end-use energy consumption of China’s industrial sector, which registered negative growth for two years in a row (2014–2016). Despite a bounceback in 2017, the figure was still 1.5 million tce lower than that in 2014. From 2011 to 2017, the industrial sector consumed an additional 186 million tce—a mere 30% of the added energy consumption in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">3.2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 3.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Changes in added energy consumption in China and in the industrial sector from 2010 to 2017</p><p>(Data source: China Energy Statistical Yearbook)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">Improvements are continuously made in energy conservation and emission reduction policies with sustained enhancement in energy efficiency and optimization in energy consumption mix. Through continued supply-side structural reform in coal and steel industries, campaigns and implementation of key energy-saving projects such as comprehensive upgrading of coal-fired boilers for energy conservation and eco-friendliness, energy efficiency enhancement of motor systems, reduction and replacement of coal consumption, energy performance contracting, etc., China has shown a slowdown in the growth of major energy-intensive products and sustained improvement in industrial energy efficiency with some sectors ranking among the global leaders in this regard (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3.3</xref>). From 2000 to 2016, energy efficiency grew by one-third for the steel industry and a half for the cement industry in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, through coal reduction and substitution, promotion of electrification and technical progress in production, notable changes have taken place in the end-use energy consumption mix of the industrial sector, with 2012 as a turning point, when a decline was seen in both the total use and the proportion of coal and coke in the industrial sector, while the consumption of natural gas and electricity had been on a sharp rise. In 2017, the share of coal and coke consumption fell back to 44.8%, while the proportion bounced to 6.8% for natural gas and 24.6% for electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3.4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy consumption in major energy-intensive products compared to 2010 level</p><p>(Data source: Wang Qingyi, Energy in China 2018)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 3.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>End-use energy consumption mix of the industrial sector by category</p><p>(Data source: China Energy Yearbook 2018)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par7"><bold>Outlook on Energy Consumption and CO</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold> Emission Trend of China’s Industrial Sector</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par8">With ample potentials in its development, China’s industrial sector is facing mounting pressures on energy demand. As the biggest developing country in the world, China is still in the intermediate stage of industrialization with considerable space for further growth and growing pressure of energy consumption and carbon emissions of the industrial sector. Despite being a manufacturing powerhouse, China trails way behind the US, EU and Japan in terms of core technologies, quality, efficiency and indigenous innovation, etc., with its manufacturing sector on the lower end of the global arena. At the per capita level, China’s industrial added value was 1.3 times of that of the world average yet merely 35.6% of the US in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the same year, China’s per capita industrial end-use energy consumption was around 95% higher than the world average and 16% higher than OECD countries, but still 12% lower than US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. At the global level, industry remains the key pillar for economic growth with minimal sign of “de-industrialization”. At the constant price of 2010, manufacturing as a percentage of global GDP climbed from 14.8 to 16.0% from 1991 to 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite a slowdown or even decline in total energy demand of the industrial sector in major developed countries, global industrial energy demand is set to grow continually. Studies have found that from 2017 to 2040, annual growth in energy demand of the world industrial sector will average around 1.3%, and major developed economies such as the US and EU might witness a drop in total demand, yet the share of industry in end-use energy consumption will slowly move along a rising curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Especially with the onslaught of COVID-19, increasing awareness of industrial security, independence and controllability is found in all countries, and the global industrial chain is approaching a new round of restructuring, which spells mounting strains for China to consolidate, shore up and empower its industrial chain.</p><p id="Par9">The growth in energy demand will see a substantial slowdown as the industry shifts from extensive growth to quality development. As China transforms from a “world factory” to a manufacturing powerhouse and moves towards quality development, industrial energy demand is set to experience a tremendous slowdown despite its continued growth. In terms of industrial structure, as China’s industrial economy advances towards medium and high-end, the mainstay of the industry will shift from traditional sectors such as steel, building materials, and textile towards emerging industries of strategic importance, high-tech and advanced manufacturing, with increasing decoupling of industrial development and energy consumption. Meanwhile, as China succeeds in building a moderately well-off society, its urbanization rush is likely to tide off and the demand for major energy-intensive products will be saturated, which will downsize a portion of the energy-intensive sectors. Besides, amid a sweeping new round of global industrial revolution, the massive application of new technologies such as industrial robotics, AI and industrial internet catalyzed by growing industrial digitalization, internet penetration and intelligence, the existing mode of industrial production and organizational structure will be disrupted, producing a far-reaching impact on the energy mix of the industrial sector. To illustrate, industrial robotics and 3D printing will tremendously boost the energy efficiency and the electrification of the industry while replacing the traditional way of production and manual labor arrangement.</p><p id="Par10">As industrial electrification picks up its pace, the peak will occur sooner in carbon emissions than in energy demand of the industrial sector. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the sector hinge on energy demand, energy efficiency and energy mix, among other factors; with the slowdown in energy demand of the industry, improved electrification and constant changes in power mix of the society, industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will peak before its energy demand. With emerging industries such as modern manufacturing on a fast track of development and fossil fuels such as coal being increasingly replaced in heavily polluted areas, energy demand of the industry will primarily come from electricity and natural gas with reduced demand for coal and more electric and lower-carbon energy mix. Studies have shown that electricity of non-energy-intensive sectors will comprise 47% of the end-use energy consumption in China by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among industrial sectors, building materials and textile would peak emissions prior to steel and non-ferrous metals, etc.; while the energy demand and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the petrochemical industry might peak later due to the rapidly growing output. In the meantime, the fast growth of petroleum and coal as raw materials of the petrochemical industry will also lead to an earlier peak in industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than energy demand.</p><p id="Par11">The transition towards low-carbon industry remains unpredictable, with deep emission reduction as a daunting task. Ranking the top in industrial output, China is at the forefront of a new round of industrial revolution with tremendous emission reduction potential in employing innovative technologies and promoting integrated development of industrialization and low-carbon energy, electrification and information technologies. However, despite the sustained enhancement in energy efficiency of the industry, the development model featuring high input, consumption, and emissions has not been essentially reversed. Recently, many key petrochemical and coal chemical projects, including coal-to-aromatics, coal-to-ethanol, and coal-to-hydrogen projects, are under planning due to multiple factors, which brings additional pressure on controlling industrial energy consumption and carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the prevalent overcapacity and inter-regional imbalance in industrial development generate substantial challenges for energy-intensive sectors to widely reduce intensity. With a sizable existing industrial capacity and the limited operation time of many carbon-intensive plants, a premature retirement would incur massive sunk asset losses and potential unemployment risk. In addition, the lock-in effect stemming from the existing market stronghold of carbon-intensive technologies and industries is another stumbling block for the rapid expansion of low-carbon or zero-carbon technologies. Industrial transformation is highly associated with high-quality economic and social development, calling for an overhaul in the pattern of production and consumption across the society. Studies have suggested that postponing the goal of industrial transformation to 2035 would mean an extra 100 million tce consumption and 260 million tons of more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the industrial sector in 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

A comparison between the policy scenario and the 2 °C scenario is conducted as an example (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">3.10</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 3.10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sources of potential of achieving the 2 °C scenario by 2050 (as compared to Reinforced Policy Scenario)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">Under the reinforced policy scenario, the industrial energy demand is set to be 2.04 billion tce in 2050, which can be reduced to 1.62 billion tons under the 2 °C scenario through a bunch of technological and policy measures.

In terms of technical route, optimized production processes, especially the massive deployment of deep decarbonization technologies in energy-intensive sectors helps reduce energy demand by 150 million tce, plus a 80-million-tons cut in non-energy-intensive sectors—a combined 230 million tons are saved, or 54.8% of the total energy conservation. In terms of energy efficiency, energy-intensive sectors are on track to reduce its energy use by 45 million tce by boosting energy efficiency while 50 million tons can be saved in non-energy-intensive sectors, adding up to 95 million tons or 22.6% of the total energy conservation.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par38"><bold>Cost–Benefit Analysis of Investment Under Different Scenarios</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par39">Now, the industrial sector boasts the greatest potential for emission reduction among all end-users, but the potential is likely to narrow down in the future with the rapid proliferation of energy-saving and carbon-reduction technologies and equipment. In the current stage, much potential still exists in emission reduction at low or negative cost in the industry, yet considering the fact that China shall remain the world’s biggest manufacturer over a long period of time, plus the inertia of industrial development and barriers of energy-saving and low-carbon technology progress, the rising cost of industrial emission reduction and increasing difficulties in deep emission reduction are inevitable. A look at the sources of emission reduction potentials shows that technical transformation in industrial production, development in energy efficiency technologies, and application of renewables mostly depend on an overhaul of the industrial investment structure and direction; however, a high level of electrification and hydrogen scale-up would rest on the supply of low-cost green electricity and hydrogen, of which the investment and benefit analysis goes beyond the industrial sector itself. Besides, cutting redundant demand for industrial products depends on the transition of China’s development model, the progress in China’s industrial productivity as compared to other countries, the implementation of industrial and restructuring policies and shifts in consumption pattern, etc. It would be difficult to carry out an accurate and quantitative assessment of the direct investment cost and benefit.</p><p id="Par40">With these factors in mind, this research focuses on analyzing the main investment increment under the four scenarios, in other words, extra investment associated with shrinking demand due to restructuring will not be considered while investment in changes of technical routes, energy efficiency improvement, and energy or material substitution will be the focus of the study. A bottom-up method is employed and a production capacity resetting method is used for key sectors such as steel, cement, and petrochemical to compare the accumulative changes in investment in production capacity associated with production scale, technology and process improvements, by 2050 under different scenarios; for other industrial sectors, the accumulative investment demand for higher energy efficiency and electrification under different scenarios are compared through case studies of investment in energy conservation and electrification. For the industrial application of hydrogen, the statistics concerning investment cost is scant in existing studies and demo projects, while it remains unclear whether investment in hydrogen generation and transmission is included. In this study, a hypothesis is made that industrial hydrogen consumption is mainly generated from low-carbon energy without taking into account the investment demand for hydrogen generation.</p><p id="Par41">Given the complexity of sectors, products and technical processes involved in the industrial sector, priority-setting and categorization shall be adopted in calculating energy-saving and decarbonization investment i.e. focusing on energy-intensive sectors such as steel and cement with non-energy-intensive sectors as secondary consideration, and categorizing mainstream energy-saving and decarbonization technologies into “average energy efficiency” (currently average performance), “advanced energy efficiency” (currently advanced performance), “leading energy efficiency” (globally leading performance) and “near theoretical efficiency” (close to theoretical energy efficiency) based on technical features, investment benefit, and application prospects, in order to explore the investment required for varied levels of penetration and structure of production capacity. Under the policy scenario, corporate energy efficiency witnesses continued improvement driven by technical progress, and the sector-wide energy efficiency migrates from “average” to “advanced” by 2050; under the reinforced policy scenario, cost-effective and energy-saving technologies are both adopted for the sector-wide energy efficiency to reach “leading” level by 2050; under the 2 °C scenario, cutting-edge and ground-breaking technologies and processes are deployed, helping most businesses to hit “near theoretical” energy efficiency with zero-carbon energy and carbon-free processes utilized to some extent; under the 1.5 °C scenario, high cost processes that drastically lower carbon emissions will be adopted on a massive scale.</p><p id="Par42">Taking cement as an example, according to the <italic>Global Roadmap of Cement Sustainable Development in 2050</italic> published by IEA, low carbon development is to be achieved in cement industry through enhancing energy efficiency, promoting alternative fuels, and applying CCS technologies. Building on the aforementioned research approach and scenario setting, and the investment needed for plants and processes of varied types of energy efficiency, the incremental investment for the cement industry and the investment required per ton of cement under different scenarios are calculated (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">3.11</xref>).<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 3.11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Incremental investment needed for different scenarios for cement industry</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">Under the reinforced policy scenario, the energy efficiency reaches “leading” level with alternative fuels making up 30% of the fuel mix, thus increasing the investment needed per ton of cement capacity to 840 RMB from 680 RMB under policy scenario, while the incremental investment under the reinforced policy scenario and policy scenario is 30 billion RMB. Under the 2 °C scenario, energy efficiency rises to “near theoretical level” with the penetration of 50% for alternative fuels and 30% for CCS, and the investment per ton of cement capacity rises to 1,200 RMB, an extra investment of 100 billion RMB compared to reinforced policy scenario. Under the 1.5 °C scenario, CCS penetration grows to 80% while alternative fuels rise up to 70% of the fuel mix, driving up investment per ton of cement capacity to 1,590 RMB with approximately 240 billion RMB more investment than the 2 °C scenario. Specifically, the application of CCS entails an extra investment of around 250 billion RMB while retrofitting for alternative fuels requires an extra 40 billion RMB, accompanied by a drop in energy efficiency investment of 56 billion RMB due to reduced capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Key Pathways and Policy Enablers</title><p id="Par44"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par45"><bold>Structural Transformation and Shrinking Demand</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par46">The development of service-oriented economy and inherent restructuring of the industry will promise more economic output with less energy consumption. Due to the huge discrepancy of energy productivity among industries and sectors, generally speaking, the service sector requires less energy than the industrial sector, light industry less than heavy industry, and emerging industries less than traditional ones when generating the same economic output (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">3.12</xref>). Changes in industrial structure, organizational structure and positioning of product value chain of a country all exert tremendous impact on the energy efficiency of a country in a broad sense. The replacement of traditional industries by emerging industries will spur economic restructuring and a fresh round of economic growth, during which the internal restructuring and industrial modernization will boost the efficiency of energy allocation among different sectors as the energy consumption per unit of output in high value-added industries is much lower than that of energy-intensive and traditional industries, providing a strong buttress for the overall energy productivity of the industrial sector. Studies have found that during the 11th Five-Year Plan period, restructuring only contributed 4% of energy conservation of the industry, but the figure surged to 34% during the 12th Five-Year Plan period and is on track to approach 50% during the 13th Five-Year Plan period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 3.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of energy consumption per unit of output by sector (2015)</p><p>(Data Source: National Statistics Bureau and calculations by the research team)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par47">Elimination of wastage due to massive demolition and construction and improvement in material strength and quality will cut the demand for energy-intensive products from the source. Statistics show that the demolished housing area in China is around 37 ~ 41%<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> of newly built commercial residential houses, and the demolished buildings of short life cycle account for around 23% of newly built ones in urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The demolished buildings in China are 25–30 years of age on average despite their designed service life of 50–100 years. Such massive demolition and construction have been the cause of severe waste of energy and resources and environmental pollution. Based on 2.5–3 billion m<sup>2</sup> of newly completed buildings annually and an annual demolition of short-lived buildings comprising 25% of such, an extra 40 to 50 million tons of steel and 220 to 260 million tons of cement are consumed annually. Taking into account the energy consumed throughout the construction process, an extra energy consumption of approximately 120 million tce is recorded each year—around 5% of the current energy consumption countrywide. What’s also generated from this process are 400 million tons of waste, accounting for roughly 40% of total waste throughout the year. Apart from waste reduction efforts, wider acceptance of high-strength products will significantly minimize the use of materials, which represents a major step to build a resource-efficient and environmentally-friendly society. It not only contributes to energy saving and emission reduction, but also produces apparent economic benefits as such move reduces construction spending and the overall cost, and is pivotal for facilitating the restructuring and upgrading of related industries. Taking high-tensile steel bar as an example, such twisted steel bar of a tensile strength of 400 MPa or above features desirable strength and overall performance. 12%–14% of steel consumption can be reduced by replacing steel bar of 335 MPa with that of 400 MPa; while a further 5–7% reduction will be possible if steel bar of 400 MPa is replaced by that of 500 MPa. The use of high-tensile steel bars in high-rise or wide-span buildings is even more effective as the use of steel bars can be cut down by 30%.</p><p id="Par49">The export product mix shall be optimized to reduce the export of “embodied energy”. China being the world’s biggest trading nation has seen massive export of “embodied energy” in its huge export to the overseas market. Many researchers in China and elsewhere have analyzed and calculated the embodied energy export in China’s foreign trade by the input–output method, concluding that such embodied energy export has expanded by 3.3 times from 338 million tce in 1995 to 1.438 billion tce in 2010, making up 25.8 and 44.3% of the total energy consumption of the year. With embodied energy import associated with general commodities and energy products deducted, the net export of embodied energy soared from 35.67 million tce in 1995 to 415 million tons in 2010, a 10.6-fold increase, and the share in total energy consumption of the year spiked from 2.7 to 12.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The massive growth in net export of embodied energy arising from the rapid expansion of export constituted a key driver of the upsurge in China’s energy consumption in recent years.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par50"><bold>Technical innovation and Circular Economy</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par51">Switching from traditional carbon-intensive production mode towards low-carbon or zero-carbon techniques and products while improving product quality and life span would deliver high potential for energy conservation and emission reduction. Taking cement as an example, replacing cement ingredients or fuel with low-grade materials such as urban waste and industrial waste and by-products can dramatically cut down energy consumption and emissions. In the chemical fertilizer industry, using blue-green algae to produce nitrogen or nitrate fertilizers can effectively reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from ammonium synthesis. In steel industry, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per ton of steel using DRI is only 1/3 of that of BF-BOF steelmaking process, and the integrated electrolysis technology and renewable power process—still under development—could go one step further to enable near-zero carbon emission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Meanwhile, among ten innovative energy-saving and decarbonization technologies yet to be commercialized in electrolytic aluminum industry, such as inert electrode, wet cathode, and multipole slot technology, techniques including carbothermic reduction of alumina and carbothermic reduction of kaolin are able to save 20–40% energy relative to traditional electrolysis techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Besides, polymer (such as ethylene) production from CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis process is also under development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Revolutionizing traditional production and consumption patterns, actively developing circular economy, and reducing industrial output from primary resources constitute an integral part in driving down energy demand and carbon emissions of the industrial sector. According to a study by the International Resource Panel, by 2050, the development of circular economy would reduce global resources exploitation by 28%, which, coupled with climate policies and actions, can save approximately 63% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while ensuring a 1.5% growth in global economic output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies have shown that in energy-intensive industries such as steel, cement, electrolytic aluminum, and plastics, 3.6 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be prevented each year by developing circular economy. Taking plastics as an example, with every million ton of plastics recycled, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 1 million cars will be offset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With the aggregate stock of various products reaching a high level in China, vast potentials are promised in expanding recycling. Research findings have indicated that by 2050, scrap steel can take up 31–40% in steelmaking; alternative materials such as mixed materials can account for 35% in cement output; 40% of primary aluminum can be produced from recycled aluminum while 81% of paper and carton output can be based on recycled paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By expanding plastics recycling, demand for ethylene production is set to decline by 1/3 by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Yet expansion of recycling is challenged by technological and market barriers as well as policy inadequacies, etc. Waste landfill is a case in point: landfill cost in China is only 7% of that in UK, incentivizing a preference for landfill for most plants in China over the possibilities of reduction and recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par53"><bold>Technological Advancement, Energy Conservation, and Efficiency Boost</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par54">The spread of advanced energy-saving technologies and equipment helps to continuously tap into the potential of energy conservation and emission reduction in the industrial sector. Despite notable improvement in overall industrial technologies in China, great potential exists in enhancing overall energy efficiency via leading and mature technologies. Meanwhile, with technical progress in medium and low-heat residual heat and pressure utilization and industrial intelligence, new possibilities for energy conservation and decarbonization keep cropping up. In the steel industry, analysis finds that from 2010 to 2020, the potential for energy conservation and decarbonization arising from technological advancement has exceeded that from restructuring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Meanwhile, through broader application of 36 typical energy-saving technologies, the steel industry saw its energy consumption reduced by 7.8% and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 10% in 2012, where secondary heating, power generation with residual heat from sintering and TRT are among the most promising technologies of energy conservation and decarbonization. Meanwhile, synergistic benefits such as pollutant reduction and water conservation also bear a major impact on the technical economic viability. 10 technologies are cost effective measured by energy-saving benefit alone, while over two thirds are cost effective if co-benefits of energy conservation, emission reduction and water-saving are taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A “bottom-up” study on the potential of 28 energy-saving technologies in China’s steel industry has demonstrated that from 2010 to 2050, the comprehensive energy consumption per ton of steel can be cut by 30–31% for blast furnace steelmaking and by 65–76% for electric furnace steelmaking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further analysis of the emission reduction potential and cost of the steel industry finds that the extension of mature energy-saving technologies promises the best potential and cost-effectiveness, which can deliver a total emission reduction of 818 million tons between 2015 and 2030 and energy savings of 216.9 billion RMB; besides, numerous negative-cost emission reduction technologies are available in the steel industry by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the cement industry, a clear prospect of emission reduction exists in phasing out obsolete production capacity and promoting existing mature and efficient technologies. The alternative fuel technology for cement kiln will demonstrate great potential between 2020 and 2030 while new alternative cement technology will be very attractive despite its immaturity at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">A higher level of precise management empowers smart energy use and energy saving via big data. The growing popularity of “Internet plus” and IT application make real-time monitoring, precise analysis, and dynamic adjustment of energy consumption possible for businesses. In the future, China should place greater priority to improve the intelligence digitalization of its industrial development, with whole-process management of the entire energy consumption in production and better utilization of big data for energy conservation. For instance, the eTelligence at Cuxhaven in Germany’s energy internet pilot project “E-energy” allows real-time power supply and demand to be released on the internet platform based on CCHP. To illustrate, in case of wind power surplus, power companies would send a low price alert to major industrial users, who would turn on the cooling and heating tanks to balance energy supply and demand and reduce power bill. For another example, many of the comprehensive energy service projects widely launched in China enable online monitoring of energy consumption by installing monitors and sensors on key equipment in a bid to materialize on-line monitoring of energy use, compile and analyze data, identify abnormalities and reduce waste.

For sectors with greater potentials such as non-ferrous metal and chemicals, the co-benefit of low-carbon electricity may bring about deeper decarbonization. But some researchers argue that as China’s current power mix is predominated by coal with a high CO<sub>2</sub> emission intensity, improved industrial electrification in the short term makes little difference to emission reduction. In terms of thermal demand alternatives, tremendous potentials exist with low-carbon electricity-based heat pump and electric boiler technologies as alternatives for low-temperature industrial heat demand, as heating demands at lower temperature (below 100 °C) can be met by heat pump, whose energy efficiency is 2 to 3 times higher than traditional boilers; while for mid-temperature heat demand (100 °C–500°C), alternative fuels such as biomass, low-carbon electricity and hydrogen are viable options. Studies have revealed by 2040, heat pump technology would represent a cost-effective solution to cater 6% of industrial thermal demand worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Besides, EAF, ultrared heating, and induction heating also provide opportunities, albeit at a limited scale. But for the industry’s demand for higher temperature, technological revolution is essential if low-carbon electricity is to replace traditional thermal boilers.</p><p id="Par58">Hydrogen and biomass are pushing their borders in petrochemical, chemical, and steel industries and are expected to underpin deep decarbonization across the industrial sectors. Expanding the use of industrial hydrogen, especially in combination with hydrogen generation from renewable electricity, could enable substantial reduction in carbon emissions from industrial production processes and energy consumption. In the steel industry, DRI technology allows pellets to be directly reduced under lower temperature with green hydrogen as the reducing agent to produce sponge iron (directly reduced iron), with vapor and extra hydrogen released from the top of boiler, where the vapor can be reused after condensation and washing, thus achieving deep decarbonization. According to the statistics obtained by SSAB, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per ton of steel produced with long process technique is 1600 kg (the average level ranges between 2000 and 2100 kg in other European countries) and electricity consumption is 5385 kWh; while CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per ton of steel produced with HYBRIT technology is only 25 kg with 4051 kWh of electricity consumed. In petrochemical and chemical sectors, combining technologies such as renewable electricity and hydrogen generation from water electrolysis, or developing cutting-edge technologies such as hydrogen generation from methane decomposition can reduce carbon emitted from the traditional SMR process. For biomass, studies have shown that increased use of biomass can replace 15–20% of energy consumption from industrial raw materials and fuels by 2050; for example, biodiesel can be a source of bionaphtha for refineries while ethylene can be produced from biopetroleum through dehydration, the latter already industrialized in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

Some new adhesives can even react with CO<sub>2</sub> to bring down carbon intensity in cement production by 30–90%.

Hydrogen also stands to be a high achiever in reducing emissions from industrial processes. Electrolyzed water based on renewables can be used to produce hydrogen-rich chemicals such as ammonia or methanol for various industries such as precursors (as in nitrogen fertilizers), reducing agents (as in low-emission steelmaking) and fuels, while hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> can be used for producing olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons.</p><p id="Par61">Embracing negative emission technologies such as CCS will make a significant difference to the emission reduction target. For instance, in the cement industry, up to over 90% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be captured by post-combustion capture (chemical absorption or membrane separation), oxy-fuel combustion (full or partial), e, or calcium cycle, etc. In the steel industry, the ratio exceeds 85% via chemical or physical absorption, membrane separation, and oxy-fuel combustion. In coal chemical industries such as ammonia synthesis, methanol production and coal to olefins, CO<sub>2</sub> captured can be used to produce chemical products such as carbonates, borax, dicyandymide, hydroxy, etc., which is expected to prevent over 300 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Building Sector</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Status and Trend</title><p id="Par62"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par63"><bold>Overview of Building Energy Consumption in China</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par64">Building sector represents a major energy consumer, consisting of residential buildings as well as public and commercial buildings.

In other words, China is now at a crucial juncture of deciding the pathway toward an energy-efficient building sector, and the choice would mean a great deal to the future trend, which directly bears on the trajectory of the total energy consumption and carbon emissions of China.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par73"><bold>Building Energy Consumption by Sub-sectors</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par74">Given the differences in winter heating pattern, building types in urban and rural areas, lifestyle as well as people’s activities in residential and public buildings and energy-powered equipment between southern and northern regions in China, building energy consumption can be grouped into four sub-sectors, namely north urban heating (NUH), urban residential buildings energy consumption (UR buildings, excluding NUH), commercial and public building energy consumption (C&amp;P buildings, excluding NUH), and rural residential buildings (RR buildings) energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Each accounting for around one fourth of total building energy consumption in China, these four categories each features its own characteristics. A look at their changes between 2001 and 2018 shows a substantial growth in total energy consumption of all categories except for biomass in rural regions that saw continuous decline, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">3.17</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 3.17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Year-on-year changes in total energy consumption by category (2001–2018)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig17_HTML.png" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par76">Changes in total energy consumption and intensity between 2001 and 2018 by category and the main causes are provided below:</p><p id="Par77">Energy consumption for NUH is rising but with a continuous drop in consumption intensity, which signals the progress made in building energy conservation and clean heating in recent years as the average energy consumption per unit of floor area has fallen from 23 kgce/m<sup>2</sup> in 2001 to 14 kgce/m<sup>2</sup> in 2018, to which major contributors include better building insulation, higher proportion of efficient heat sources and improvement in heating system efficiency.</p><p id="Par78">Total energy consumption of C&amp;P buildings (excluding NUH) registers a four-fold increase, accounting for the biggest share among the four categories with the consumption intensity per unit area on constant rise from 8 kgce/m<sup>2</sup> to 14 kgce/m<sup>2</sup> and electricity use per square meter climbing from 35 kWh<sub>e</sub>/m<sup>2</sup> to 63 kWh<sub>e</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>.

The increase is mainly attributable to the growing demand driven by domestic hot water, air-conditioning and home appliances, etc.; with energy-saving lamps widely used, no significant increase in lighting energy consumption is observed in households while the energy consumption intensity of cooking remains largely unchanged. Yet the growing energy consumption of winter heating and home air-conditioning in regions with hot summer and cold winter has sparked extensive debates on the path of energy conservation for heating and air-conditioning.</p><p id="Par80">Commodity energy consumption has doubled in RR buildings, accompanied by a continuous and rapid drop in the use of biomass. Greater access to electricity, better income and increased number and use of home appliances in rural households are the main drivers for the surging electricity consumption per rural households. Meanwhile, a growing portion of biomass is replaced by other commercial energy, resulting in the sharp drop in the share of biomass in domestic energy consumption in rural regions. An analysis on the development of energy consumption in rural residential households indicates no major change in total consumption per household but a steep reduction in the share of biomass; the commercial energy consumption and electricity consumption per household rose from 459 kgce/hh to 1131 kgce/hh and from 435 kWh<sub>e</sub>/hh to 1770 kWh<sub>e</sub>/hh respectively while biomass consumption per household nosedived from 1212 kgce/hh to 612 kgce/hh.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par81"><bold>Forecast in Related Studies</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par82">Much has been studied in the energy consumption of the building sector in China, of which some results are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">3.18</xref>.<fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 3.18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Forecast of energy consumption of China’s building sector by some organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513787_1_En_3_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p id="Par83">As is illustrated above, under reference scenario, it is generally believed that building energy consumption in China will experience sustained growth by over 60%; under the scenario where ambitious energy-saving and emission-cutting measures are taken, energy consumption of the sector is generally believed to reach a plateau or start to fall around 2030 until it reaches 600–800 million tce by 2050, close to the current energy use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Scenario Analysis</title><p id="Par84"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par85"><bold>Scenario Design</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par86">The following four scenarios are set for this research:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par87">Policy scenario</p><p id="Par88">The policy scenario is based on the assumptions that the occupant behavior modes in China will move towards an intermediate level and that the building stock and energy intensity will stay on the current track of growth, the energy consumption per capita by 2050 would draw close to energy-efficient countries in the developed world, with energy-saving policies in the sector introduced and implemented on schedule.

Between 2007 and 2018, the private car ownership in China skyrocketed from 57 million in 2007 to 204 million in 2019, with a average growth rate of 8.8% year-on-year. The exponential growth has led to a sharp rise in carbon emissions. In 2013, private cars overtook taxis as the biggest contributor to carbon emissions in urban passenger transport. With relatively less room and more challenges of reducing the carbon emission intensity of passenger transportation in China, it’s essential to come up with a holistic plan to strike a perfect balance between energy conservation, emission reduction and service improvement. To this end, public awareness for a sensible consumption pattern holds the key, which should neither compromise convenience, safety and comfort of travels for the sake of emission reduction nor pursue maximum comfort at the cost of excessive carbon emissions.</p><p id="Par179">Vast potentials, however, are observed in cargo transportation where efficiency improvement is paramount. Throughout the past decades, China’s economy has flourished with a remarkable rise in demand for bulk goods such as steel and cement, among other materials for infrastructure, which are primarily transported by road. For example, cargo turnover of road transportation experienced an annual growth of 8.6% from 2005 and 2019, and 90% of road transportation depends on fossil fuels for energy, prompting continual increase in carbon emissions. On the other hand, demand for urban home delivery has apparently picked up with the advent of e-commerce, from which carbon emissions as a percentage of freight transport has nearly doubled from 2010 to 2019. In the future, modern logistics should be given much greater priority with enhanced organized transportation and efficiency to lower the energy intensity and carbon emissions from freight transport.</p><p id="Par180">Optimized transportation structure, intermodal transportation, adoption of advanced means of transport and low-carbon energy technologies and smart transport solutions are the major avenues for low-carbon development of the transportation sector. By employing a mixture of measures such as planning, pricing, investment, publicity, education and organization, passenger and freight transport should be encouraged to switch from carbon-intensive options such as cars and trucks to railway, waterway and public transportation with less carbon emissions. High-speed rail and intercity rail should be built to link cities and light rail, maglev and suburban railway are recommended in urban environment for more intensive city or city cluster to form with the aid of energy-efficient, large-capacity and high-speed transportation modes, thereby shaping an intensive and low-carbon transportation supply system. The development and application of new transportation technologies, alternative fuels, IT and smart transport should be valued, especially when it comes to alternative fuels and new transportation technologies, together with a clear roadmap for technology innovation.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par181"><bold>Analysis of Transportation Demand and Structure</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par182">In freight transport, demand will change gears from high speed to a slower but steady growth, of which the transport of bulk cargo will peak prior to 2030 while the demand for high-value, decentralized, small-sized and time-sensitive cargo deliveries will pick up rapidly; low-carbon policies will also steer towards an enhanced freight transport structure.</p><p id="Par183">Chinese economy has shifted from a high-speed growth to high-quality development with more progress in supply-side structural reform. The growth in demand for cargo transport will slow down, but as industrialization and urbanization forge ahead, such demand will maintain a medium growth before 2030. China will embark on a new journey of new industrialization underpinned by technological innovation from 2030 to 2040, during which the growth in industrial output and cargo transport will slacken off. Cargo turnover will move toward the peak after 2040 and slowly decline afterwards.</p><p id="Par184">In 2018, China took the world’s top spot in the output and transport of bulk goods. With greater strides in terms of supply-side structural reform, shift in development mode, economic structure and transition of growth drivers, the heavy chemical industry is set to report a slower growth, cutting the demand for bulk goods such as coal, iron ore and steel. It is expected that the demand for transporting bulk commodities will reach a high plateau from 2020 to 2030 before a decline after 2030 as urbanization and massive infrastructure works come to fruition. Given the sheer size of China’s territory and population and uneven resources endowment, no drastic reduction is expected even after the peaking of bulk commodity transport, which would be kept relatively stable in the short term.</p><p id="Par185">Logistics is becoming more “personalized” thanks to internet-based customization and the shift from centralized to decentralized reinforced control of industrial production, among other new trends, which has rapidly driven up the demand for decentralized and small-sized cargo transportation. Meanwhile, the demand for small-sized, multiple-lot and high-value freight transport is rising as a result of improved living and consumption standards, which also requires faster, more convenient and more timely delivery and spurs the growth of cargo transportation by air and road. A remarkable increase is noted in the share of high added-value and lightweight products, whose value per unit of transport far exceeds bulk commodities. These changes in the category of goods will drive sustained growth of containers and express delivery transportation.</p><p id="Par186">With continuously upgraded road network and the advantage of “door-to-door” delivery, road will remain the primary means of cargo transportation. The weight of railway and waterway transportation is subject to policy measures: forceful low-carbon transportation policies will shift part of the cargo transport from road to railway and waterway, resulting in an increased share of railway and waterway turnover; incentives for railway-waterway intermodal transportation will also foster new opportunities in railway and waterway transportation.</p><p id="Par187">With economic restructuring taking place in China, bulk goods transportation by road such as coal, grain and mineral ores will gradually move towards railway and waterway, while road will undertake more small-quantity, multiple-lot, lightweight, high added-value and time-sensitive cargo transport. On the other hand, with the increase in the length of highway and improvement in logistic delivery system, the average distance for road cargo transport will be longer. Passenger transportation will see the total demand rapidly pick up, but the growth would be dragged down as urbanization slows down. The booming city clusters will spur the growth in intercity passenger transport while urban passenger transportation is set to grow further, driving the development of private cars and public transport.</p><p id="Par188">More often than not, rapid urbanization is accompanied by high total demand and growth of passenger transport, while in later period of urbanization, the demand is featured by a high volume but minor growth. Currently in the medium phase of urbanization, China is expected to enter a transition period by 2030 when industrialization and urbanization move from medium to medium-to-late phase with a mid- to high-speed growth in passenger transport. Between 2030 and 2050, China’s urbanization will gradually mature, which means a slower growth in passenger transport as urbanization loses its momentum.</p><p id="Par189">An important embodiment of the urbanization drive in China, city clusters will see strengthened economic and social ties, and the share of intercity passenger travels between major city clusters grows in total passenger transport across the country.</p><p id="Par190">Demand for urban travels will continue to rise with ongoing urbanization and economic growth. The emergence of new technologies and new models such as autonomous driving and carpooling will encourage more people to travel by car for speed and comfort; when better infrastructure becomes available and awareness of low-carbon and green mobility gets stronger, public transportation might also be a preferred option.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par191"><bold>Development Trend of Transportation of Typical Freight Categories in China</bold></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par192">The composition of freight categories for railway, inland waterway, coastal waterborne and expressway artery transportation is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">3.10</xref>.

With higher penetration of electrification in railway, lightweight vehicles and fuel and power saving technologies, wider acceptance of autonomous driving, eco-driving and fleet, upgrading of engine and vehicle manufacturing technologies in road transportation, application of precise flight management technology and biofuels in aviation, remarkable progress will be made in transportation technologies, which will in turn contribute to higher energy efficiency and emission reduction. Faster market penetration of clean energy and new energy vehicles and vessels and accelerated use of aviation biofuels will catalyze cleaner and lower-carbon energy supply in transportation.</p><p id="Par203">Progress in railway transportation technology is mainly manifested in the level of electrification and lightweight vehicles. In light of the progress in railway electrification rate, lightweight trains, power and fuel efficiency and smart management, etc., energy consumption from railway is on track to drop by 15–30% in 2030 and 35–50% in 2050.</p><p id="Par204">Advancement in road transportation technologies is mainly demonstrated by better fuel economy. For over a decade, fuel consumption of passenger vehicles in China has continued to fall. According to the statistics from MIIT, corporate average fuel consumption (CAFC) was 7.02 L/100 km in 2015, followed by an average growth of 1.7% annually after the implementation of Phase I Standard of Fuel Economy in 2006. <italic>Made in China 2025</italic> and <italic>Energy-Saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap</italic> have specified targets for reduction in fuel consumption for varied passenger car technologies, which have been supported by multiple measures adopted by the national government. Phase IV Standard of Passenger Vehicles has entered into effect in 2016 with stricter fuel consumption standards in the future. Given the technological upgrades in engine and vehicle manufacturing, eco-driving, truck fleeting and road network optimization, energy consumption by road transportation is set to fall by 35–50% in 2030 and 55–70% in 2050.</p><p id="Par205">Technological progress in waterway transportation is mainly reflected in vessel building standards. With vessel scale-up technology and vessel type standardization, its energy efficiency will increase by 20–50%.</p><p id="Par206">Such progress in civil aviation, on the other hand, is most remarkable in terms of flight management technology and biofuels. With the development of delicacy flight management technology, biofuel application and development and use of new engines/aircrafts, energy efficiency of aviation is projected to improve by 20–70%.</p><p id="Par207">China has seen an upsurge in new energy vehicles (NEV) in terms of production and sales, which boast tremendous potential for future growth. From 2011 to 2018, annual sales of NEV shot up from less than 10,000 to 1.256 million units, making China the world’s biggest NEV market. The production and sales of fuel cell vehicles (FCV) hit 1527 units. The industry has grown to over a hundred billion yuan from a few billion at the outset. The industrial chain, consisting of upstream mineral resources and key raw materials, mid-stream core components such as battery, motor and controller and downstream vehicle and charging piles, has evolved and matured, with the emergence of many world-leading businesses. As the market takes off, the end sales and penetration will continue to climb. From the second half of 2017, many countries have announced plans and timetables to ban the sale of oil-fueled vehicles. Studies have shown that in light of the development stage of Chinese carmakers, industrial structure and transportation conditions, China is expected to impose the ban (except for trucks for special purposes and heavy-duty trucks) around 2030 to pave the way for NEV.</p><p id="Par208">NEV will be quickly universalized in the future and become the overwhelming market mainstream by 2050. <italic>Energy-Saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap</italic> issued by the national government in 2016 stated that NEV, including EV, will partially replace vehicles with internal combustion engines by 2025, and its ownership will account for 2–3% of the total, and such replacement will be scaled up by 2030 to 5–10%. According to CATARC, the manufacturing cost of BEV will be on the par with the average HEV by 2025 and further reduced to the level of traditional vehicles by 2033, after which BEV will enjoy the best cost-competitiveness among its peers, and the market will be the lever for wider acceptance of NEV. Based on consumer choice, it is expected that annual sales of BEV and NEV will respectively make up around 60 and 70% by 2050, when NEV will be the overwhelming market mainstream, of which FCV will comprise a bigger share in the category of coaches and mid- to heavy-duty trucks.</p><p id="Par209">Biomass energy represents the future of clean energy for aircrafts. Studies have indicated that compared to conventional fuels, the use of biofuels during cruising will cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 60–98%, with which biofuels can be directly mixed for use. IATA has unveiled a forecast report and introduced plans and roadmap in this connection. Given that biofuels are fully adaptable to the existing aviation system and will not cause erosion of rubber sealing elements of fuel pipes, no major changes will be needed in aircrafts or ground systems. It is expected that 30% of aviation fuels around the world will be biofuels by 2030, and 50% by 2040.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Introduction of Scenario Setting</title><p id="Par210">Building on the above analysis, one should see that with new climate targets such as the “carbon peak” and the strategic move to build a strong nation through transportation development, transport is moving ever closer to the goal of low-carbon growth.</p><p id="Par211">Meanwhile, with the application of mobile internet, IoT, cloud computing, big data and other new technologies, disruptive innovations have taken place in NEV, energy storage and autonomous driving, and the notion of “internet + ” has permeated into all areas of transportation, which has given birth to new business models and revolutionized the transportation landscape.</p><p id="Par212">CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transportation will be subject to multiple factors in the future, such as the model and pattern of transportation, energy efficiency of conveyance, relations between public transportation and private cars, tendency in transportation demand, etc.</p><p id="Par213"><bold>Four scenarios, namely the policy scenario, reinforced policy scenario, 2 °C scenario and 1.5 °C</bold><bold>scenario, are set in this study.</bold> Energy consumption and carbon emissions of the transportation sector are calculated with the metrics in the four scenarios for comparison and analysis.

Urban public transportation should be prioritized in the planning, land approval, finance and right of way; accelerate the construction of BRT, bus lanes and rail transit, and slow traffic such as bicycle and pedestrian lanes; large-capacity public transport system should be developed; exercise differentiated transport management and hold down the rise of private car ownership; enhance management and control measures through driving up the user cost of private cars and discourage the use of private cars on the road.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par239">Reinforce financial incentives such as green transport finance and taxes. Employ policy packages comprising market-based policy measures, i.e. carbon tax, license tax, congestion charge and parking fee as well as mandates and control measures, i.e. biofuel standard, fuel economy/carbon standard in order to ensure the coordinated and effective management of demand, energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the transport sector.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">National Bureau of Statistics (2019) China statistical yearbook 2019.

Generally speaking, the final energy consumption is the sum of these three categories calculated with electrothermal equivalent method. In this section, considering the scale of centralized heating in North China where the heating source upgrading has long been the main task of energy conservation efforts in China, which is not discussed in the chapter of energy supply. In this chapter, direct heat consumption is converted into primary energy consumption (i.e. coal, natural gas, electricity etc. needed to generate heat) to sum up, i.e. building energy consumption in this chapter refers to the sum of direct energy consumption, electricity consumption and heat consumption converted into primary energy consumption, calculated with electrothermal equivalent method. In carbon emission calculation, direct carbon emission only includes the part attributable to direct fuel consumption in buildings; while carbon emissions from indirect heating and electricity are correlated with heating and electricity consumption respectively.</p></fn><fn id="Fn4"><label>4</label><p id="Par68">Carbon emission coefficient of electricity is defined as 553 gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh.</p></fn><fn id="Fn5"><label>5</label><p id="Par160">Electricity consumption in the transportation sector is converted into coal equivalent with electrothermal method: 1 kWh = 122.9 gce.</p></fn></fn-group></back></book-part></book-part-wrapper></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Civil Law</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy Policy, Economics and Management</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environment</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environmental Management</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environmental Policy</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Sociology, general</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Sustainable Development</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">China's Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Strategies and Pathways</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2022</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"><facet-value count="1">China</facet-value></facet><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Book</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
