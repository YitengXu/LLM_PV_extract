Here we identify three distinct mode types of absorber-coated plasmonic metasurfaces: localized and propagating surface plasmons and a previously unidentified optical mode type called absorption-induced scattering. The extinction of the latter mode type can be tuned by controlling the morphology of the absorber coating and the spectral overlap of the absorber with the plasmonic modes. Furthermore, we show that surface plasmons are backscattered when the crystallinity of the absorber is low but are absorbed for more crystalline absorber coatings.

Metasurfaces are typically composed of arrays of sub-wavelength metallic nanostructures where the macroscopic electromagnetic properties of the surface arise from the collective response of the individual nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This collective response has led to a host of intriguing optical phenomena, such as negative refractive index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, phase control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, optical cloaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and electromagnetic field enhancements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. When plasmonic (meta)materials are coated with absorbers, many additional effects have been observed, such as absorption-induced transparency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, strong coupling between plasmons and excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, plasmonic splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and enhanced absorption within the absorber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. For practical applications, it is important to understand how the properties of plasmonic metasurfaces are influenced by the presence of semiconductor absorber thin films. Furthermore, besides the unique optical phenomena exhibited by absorber-coated metasurfaces, the effects of morphology and crystallinity of absorber coatings on metasurface optical properties have not been widely considered. Because of their propensity for solution-based deposition and applications for bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ-OPVs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, organic semiconductors are practical materials to employ to investigate the interactions between absorbers and plasmonic metasurfaces.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we elucidate the optical modes supported by silver plasmonic metasurfaces coated with organic semiconductor absorbers using dark-field (DF) scattered-light spectroscopy. In particular, we identify two interesting optical phenomena that arise from the absorber-coated metasurfaces: a previously unidentified optical mode type called absorption-induced scattering (AIS), and out-coupling of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). AIS is shown to originate from electromagnetic coupling between optical transitions of absorber materials and scattering modes, regardless of whether the scattering modes are plasmonic, localized or collective in origin. We then show that the crystallinity of the organic absorber affects out-coupling of SPP modes, with lower crystallinity absorber coatings facilitating greater out-coupling of SPPs. We conclude by showing that these optical modes affect absorption within both the absorber coating and metasurface materials to different extents: localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) contribute more to absorption in the coating than in the metal, while AIS and SPPs are absorbed more by the metasurface. However, total absorption arising from AIS and SPPs is smaller than that for LSPRs. This work serves to highlight a previously unexplored optical scattering phenomenon that occurs from thin-film semiconductor absorber layers and to further our understanding of how to control light–matter interactions at metasurfaces for practical optoelectronic applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Absorber-coated plasmonic metasurfaces</title><p id="Par5">We fabricated large-area disordered plasmonic metasurfaces composed of Ag nanoparticle arrays (AgNPAs) on Ag thin films (that is, AgNPA/Ag) by nanotemplating (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,c</xref>; Methods).

However, since PC<sub>70</sub>BM absorbed strongly in the 400–600 nm wavelength range, LSPR scattering was partially absorbed by PC<sub>70</sub>BM.

With P3HT, PTB7 and P3HT:PCBM coatings, a peak occurred at the absorption edge of the coating (670 nm for P3HT and P3HT:PCBM, 756 nm for PTB7). This peak occurred at very similar wavelengths to the Mie-AIS peak observed for absorber-coated planar Ag films; however, unlike Mie-AIS, nanoscale surface roughness on the absorber coating was not the primary cause of this scattering peak since the peak was observed in simulated data for coated metasurfaces, even with a planar organic-air interface (Methods). The electric field profiles, in addition to the simulated scattered-light spectrum of a high-refractive-index (<italic>n</italic>=2.0) dielectric-coated AgNPA/Ag metasurface (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), revealed that this long-wavelength scattering arose predominantly from the hybrid AgNP-Ag film SPP (Mode II; <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The scattering peak was pinned just beyond the absorption edge wavelength of the organic semiconductor due to the large increase in refractive index and significant drop in absorption of the coating (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM701">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Since this scattering arose from the collective response of plasmonic modes modified by absorption transitions of the coatings, it is called ‘plasmon-AIS.’ Plasmon–AIS peaks were observed for all absorber-coated metasurfaces and followed the absorption edge of the coatings. We will discuss the physical origin of AIS extensively in the proceeding section. For P3HT- and P3HT:PCBM-coated metasurfaces, there was an additional plasmon–AIS shoulder at ∼580 nm, which arose predominantly from the combined response of the Mode I LSPR and the increased refractive index due to the S<sub>0</sub>→S<sub>1</sub> 0–1 singlet exciton vibronic absorption in P3HT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM701">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">For the PCDTBT-, PCDTBT:PC<sub>70</sub>BM- and PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM-coated metasurfaces, there were two distinct components observed empirically for the long-wavelength scattering regime: one component occurred just beyond the absorption edge wavelength of the coatings (665 nm for PCDTBT and PCDTBT:PC<sub>70</sub>BM; 772 nm for PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM) due to plasmon–AIS, and another broader and more intense component occurred at even longer wavelengths (740 nm for PCDTBT; 780 nm for PCDTBT:PC<sub>70</sub>BM; ≥845 nm for PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM). Since the broader, more intense component of the long-wavelength peak occurred for absorber-coated AgNPA/Ag metasurfaces, but not for absorber-coated AgNPA/glass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM701">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), and this component appeared to be broadband, based on scattering from PMMA-coated AgNPA/Ag metasurfaces (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; note the elevated baseline relative to the simulated spectrum), we hypothesized that out-coupled SPPs contributed to this scattering. This long-wavelength scattering component was not present in the backscattered simulations and it occurred empirically only for certain coatings.

For periods ≥250 nm, two branches of the long-wavelength peak were observed: one dispersive, which was attributed to the Mode II hybrid NP-film SPP (based on its presence for the uncoated and dielectric-coated AgNPA/Ag metasurfaces; <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM701">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>), and one non-dispersive, corresponding to plasmon–AIS arising from the Mode I LSPR.

The AgNPs, while not causing out-coupling of SPPs, caused near-field excitation (that is, in-coupling) to the SPPs (Mode V; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM701">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Out-coupling of surface plasmon polaritons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Spectral in-plane (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) and out-of-plane (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>) electric field distributions through the forward vertical monitor located 100 nm away from the nearest AgNP for P3HT:PCBM-coated AgNPA/Ag metasurface.

Compared with bare planar Ag (which exhibited minimal absorption) and bare AgNPA/Ag (where part of the LSPR was observed at ∼370 nm), absorption increased on coating with a transparent PMMA film, which we attribute to red-shifts and trapping of LSPRs and SPPs due to the higher refractive index environment.

The simulations showed that absorption enhancement in the coatings was indeed broadband, although different spectral regimes were enhanced to a larger degree than others. In general, the maximum absorptance enhancement for all three coatings occurred at wavelengths corresponding to the LSPR peaks from the AgNPA (∼340 to 480 nm), with a maximum enhancement factor of 1.36 observed in this wavelength range for PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM/AgNPA/Ag relative to PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM/Ag (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). The absorptance enhancement remained large for wavelengths beyond the absorption edge of each of coating, with enhancement factors reaching values up to 1.34 for P3HT:PCBM/AgNPA/Ag at 710 nm (attributed to coupling into SPPs) relative to P3HT:PCBM/Ag. Near the plasmon–AIS peak wavelength, particularly for P3HT:PCBM and PCDTBT:PC<sub>70</sub>BM coatings, dips in the coating absorptance enhancements occurred, indicating increases in scattering losses and/or parasitic absorption loss in the metal. However, on either side of the plasmon–AIS peak wavelength, there were peaks in the absorptance enhancement, confirming that there was electromagnetic coupling between the absorber optical transition and scattering mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The absorptance enhancement dip was not observed for the PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM coating because of the poor spectral overlap between the absorption edge and the scattering modes (note the lower intensity of the plasmon–AIS peak for PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM compared with the other two coatings). When the LSPR of the metasurface was tuned to spectrally overlap with the absorption edge of the coating (that is, by switching from a AgNPA/Ag metasurface to a CuNPA/Cu metasurface with a P3HT:PCBM coating), the absorptance enhancement at the absorption edge of the coating was significantly increased (to a value of ∼1.5) relative to P3HT:PCBM/Cu, and the absorptance enhancement had very well-defined peaks on either side of the plasmon–AIS peak wavelength, suggesting stronger coupling between the P3HT:PCBM optical transitions with the LSPR of the CuNPA/Cu metasurface. However, for other spectral regimes, the absorptance in the P3HT:PCBM coating was reduced relative to P3HT:PCBM/Cu. Thus, although the absorption enhancement was maximized by overlapping the LSPR with the absorption edge, the absorption in the coating was reduced relative to planar Cu substrates for other spectral regimes. Overlapping the LSPR with the absorption edge is beneficial when strong absorption in the coating is desired at particular wavelengths, such as for photodetectors or sensors, but for broadband absorption enhancement, spectrally separating the LSRP from the absorption edge is more beneficial.

This was attributed to very small or negligible absorption coefficients of the organic semiconductors in the wavelength regimes of plasmon–AIS and SPPs compared to those in the wavelength regimes of the LSPRs, coupled with the fact that absorptance enhancement had both dips and peaks in the wavelength regime of plasmon–AIS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21">Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of the scattered-light spectroscopy, electromagnetic simulations, surface morphology and crystallinity studies for the various organic semiconductor absorber coatings and are schematically represented in <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a–c</xref>.

Since, in this work, we have shown that the physical origin of AIS is electromagnetic coupling between optical transitions of absorber materials and scattering modes, we expect that AIS was present in these and other prior studies and contributed to some extent to the enhanced absorption or photocurrent near the absorption edge of the semiconductors.</p><p id="Par23">By comparing empirical scattered-light spectra with GIWAXS results, scattering from out-coupled SPPs was found to be lower in intensity for polymer or polymer:fullerene coatings with higher degrees of crystallinity (P3HT, P3HT:PCBM, PTB7) than for the more amorphous coatings (PCDTBT, PCDTBT:PC<sub>70</sub>BM, PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM). We suggest that semicrystalline coatings trapped SPPs to a greater extent than amorphous coatings due to a combination of: (1) total internal reflection at the absorber–air interface, since semicrystalline materials tend to have higher refractive indices than amorphous materials; (2) more tightly bound, shorter propagation length SPPs, again due to the higher refractive indices of semicrystalline coatings; (3) absorption of long-wavelength SPPs by photoinduced absorption from delocalized polarons in crystalline domains, which is known to occur at ∼730 nm for regioregular P3HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> (photoinduced absorption from localized polarons in disordered P3HT domains occurs at ∼950 nm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>)). Furthermore, SPPs were out-coupled to a greater degree empirically because the simulations did not account for effects such as surface roughness, crystallinity and the conformal nature of the organic coatings, or irregular regions of the metasurface where there were no AgNPs due to imperfections in the fabrication process. In these studies, although amorphous coatings facilitated out-coupling of SPP modes and, hence, their detection by DF spectroscopy, since semicrystalline coatings trapped SPPs better, SPP modes should be more efficiently absorbed by semicrystalline polymers and polymer:fullerene blends. We suggest that if these AgNPA/Ag metasurfaces are employed as electrodes in PLEDs, then amorphous polymer coatings could increase the out-coupling efficiency of emitted light coupled to tightly bound SPP modes, which is a major loss channel in PLED devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. From our results, it is apparent that assessment of the impact of metasurfaces on organic semiconductor morphology and crystallinity should be conducted along with optical studies to fully account for the empirically observed optical properties.</p><p id="Par24">Although total integrated absorption enhancements in the organic semiconductor layers were modest using metasurfaces (values as large as 12 %), it is expected that when incorporated into a completed optoelectronic device (that is, addition of charge transport layers, transparent electrode and anti-reflection layers), total absorption could be improved by minimizing reflection losses at the air–polymer:fullerene interface. In addition, although absorption enhancements were large for wavelengths greater than the absorption edge of the polymer:fullerene blends (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>), the total computed absorptance was still very low for these wavelengths (∼1% or less). However, empirical studies have demonstrated that there can be significant external quantum efficiency enhancements for sub-bandgap wavelengths (for example, contributing to photoinduced absorption by charge transfer states or polarons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>), suggesting that the optical modes observed through our scattering experiments and simulations could be more beneficial to optoelectronic device performance than predicted by optical absorption simulations alone. This drives the need for electrical and device measurements to fully explore the usefulness of these sub-bandgap optical modes.</p><p id="Par25">In summary, large-area metasurfaces composed of Ag nanoparticle arrays on Ag thin films coated with various organic conjugated polymer and polymer:fullerene absorber layers were characterized. Dark-field scattering studies in conjunction with atomic force microscope topography measurements and electromagnetic simulations revealed several optical modes supported by the organic semiconductor-coated metasurfaces: LSPRs; hybrid SPPs between nanoparticles and the underlying metal film; AIS, both from nanoscale organic semiconductor surface features and from coupling of surface plasmon modes to absorbers; and broadband propagating SPP modes. We elucidated the physical origin of the previously unidentified optical mode, AIS, as electromagnetic coupling of absorber optical transitions and scattering modes, regardless of whether the scattering modes are plasmonic, localized or collective in origin. Grazing-incidence X-ray scattering results demonstrated that the crystallinity of neat polymers was reduced in the presence of the metasurface, whereas the alignment of P3HT molecules and the crystallinity of PTB7 molecules in the polymer:fullerene blends were improved in the presence of the metasurface. By correlating polymer crystallinity with scattered-light spectra of the absorber-coated metasurfaces, semicrystalline polymer coatings were found to trap SPP modes better than amorphous polymer coatings. Total absorptance spectra of these structures were determined using using integrating sphere reflectance spectroscopy, and parasitic absorption was separated from absorber coating absorption using electromagnetic simulations. It was found that LSPRs led to the maximal absorption enhancement in the organic coating, although broadband SPPs and plasmon–AIS resulted in improved absorption in the organic coatings, albeit to a lesser degree. We expect that the usefulness of the near- and sub-bandgap optical modes (that is, plasmon–AIS and SPPs) was underestimated by performing optical simulations alone, and could be exploited to a greater extent in completed photovoltaic devices. We foresee that further tuning of the coupling between absorber optical transitions and scattering modes could result in greater absorption enhancements in absorber-coated metasurfaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Template-based fabrication of plasmonic metasurfaces</title><p id="Par26">Glass microscope slides (Fisherbrand, 1 mm thick) were cut into approximately 16 mm × 16 mm segments, which were then sonicated in detergent for 15 min., soaked in a solution of ethanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1:1) for 15 min., then soaked in isopropanol for 10 min. before being dried individually using compressed air.</p><p id="Par27">The base metal film underlying each of the metallic nanoparticles consisted of 50 nm of Ag on 5 nm of Cr (used as an adhesion layer).

Absorption enhancement factors were calculated by dividing absorption in the coating layer on the AgNPA/Ag metasurfaces by the absorption in the coating layer on the planar Ag substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional information</title><p id="Par44"><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Petoukhoff, C.
