Perovskites combine the semiconducting properties typically associated with inorganic photovoltaics, such as strong light absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, high charge-carrier mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, tuneable bandgap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and low recombination rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> with ease of processing from solution. As a result perovskite based photovoltaics are predicted to have a shorter energy payback time than current commercial technologies of less than half a year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Spin-coating remains the principal method for thin-film preparation in high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Whilst this method is capable of delivering films of well-defined thickness and high uniformity, it is inherently unsuitable for large-scale PSC manufacture. If PSCs are to fulfil their promise as a low-cost, high-volume source of sustainable energy, their deposition must be achieved using truly scalable techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This is a growing area of research, with perovskite materials now being deposited by ink-jet printing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, slot-die coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, doctor-blading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and spray-coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Spray-coating is a versatile coating technique that is widely employed in industry. It can be used to deposit functional films at high coating-rates, over large areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> with high material utilisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It also has the ability to apply conformal coatings to irregular surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Spray-coating has already been applied to the fabrication of standard architecture planar PSCs <italic>via</italic> single-step spray-deposition of MAPbI<sub>3−x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and MAPbI<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> reaching a PCE of up to 13%. By introducing PbAc<sub>2</sub> into the precursor ink, Tait <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> demonstrated that such devices could reach a PCE of 15.7% though the development of a dense, highly uniform perovskite crystal lattice. Comparable device performance has been demonstrated by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> through the development of a two-step spray-cast MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite deposition protocol in which a thin-film of PbI<sub>2</sub> was first spray-cast onto mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>. Onto this was spray-cast a film of methyl-ammonium iodide (MAI), with a perovskite film created via thermal annealing. Using this technique PSCs having an active-area 1 cm<sup>2</sup> were created having a PCE of 13%. Mesoscopic PSCs based on spray-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> scaffolds have also been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, comparably few examples of spray-coated inverted architecture PSCs exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To develop a practical manufacture process to fabricate large-area perovskite PV, it is imperative that all layers within the device should be deposited via a scalable technique (ideally on a flexible substrate making it compatible roll to roll processing). However, this has only been demonstrated in a few cases, with most studies using inflexible glass substrates. One study of note fabricated devices in which all layers were deposited by doctor-blading (excluding the vacuum-processed back contacts) having an average PCE of over 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This value was however reduced to 3.4% when the electrode was instead printed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, we reported on spray-coated planar inverted architecture PSCs where all solution-processed layers (namely PEDOT:PSS, perovskite and PCBM) were deposited by ultrasonic spray-coating, with an champion (average) PCE of 9.9% (7.1%) achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this paper we extend our previous techniques, and use spray-coating to prepare all the layers in a mesoporous standard-architecture PSCs (except the contact electrodes), and create devices having improved performance and repeatability. Specifically, we spray-cast compact titania (cTiO<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, mesoporous titania (mTiO<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, a CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>(3−x)</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub> precursor and doped spiro-OMeTAD layers, creating a champion cell having a PCE of 10%. We then utilise a range of microscopy and mapping techniques to explore the homogeneity and uniformity of the layers, and conclude that device efficiency is partially limited by (i) the presence of ~10 μm diameter aggregate defects in the spray-cast perovskite layer that act as local current shunts, and (ii) non-uniformities in the spiro-OMeTAD film that results in reduced charge carrier extraction and thus reduced fill-factor. We also explore our techniques to fabricate devices having an active-area of 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, reaching an efficiency of 6.6%. As far as we are aware, this is the first example of ultrasonic spray-coating being used to deposit a doped spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer, as well as the first example of a multilayer spray-cast mesoporous PSC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ultrasonic Spray-Coating</title><p id="Par7">Spray-coating was carried out using a Prism ultrasonic spray-coating system supplied by Ultrasonic Systems, Inc. This instrument employs resonant oscillation of a piezo-electric tip to shear a coating ink into a fine mist of micron-sized droplets that are then directed to a surface of interest via a focused nitrogen gas jet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Such “nozzle-less” techniques offer independent control of droplet formation and spray pattern. During the coating procedure, the spray-head is passed over the surface at a fixed height. From extensive optimization trials, we were able to adjust film thickness and drying rates <italic>via</italic> control of lateral head-speed, solution concentration and substrate surface temperature. Here, the formation of uniform thin-films is dependent on the ability of the ink to wet the surface. Unlike spin-coating, there are no lateral forces in a conventional spray-coater that act to spread a wet-film across a surface and ensure that droplets coalesce to form a continuous film. Instead, only capillary forces (which are relatively weaker) act to move liquid droplets across the substrate surface. This can lead to poor surface coverage, particularly if the solvent has a high surface tension or a low surface energy. The rate at which the film dries is also important; if the drying time is too short then the droplets can dry before forming a uniform wet film. Conversely if film drying occurs too slowly, then the wet film can undergo shrinkage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> forming “coffee-ring” patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">To address this, we have performed a detailed optimisation study in which we have developed a series of different ultra-sonic spray-coating processes and inks to deposit mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>, a MAI:PbCl<sub>2</sub> precursor and a doped spiro-OMeTAD hole-extracting layer (see further details of ink formulations and deposition parameters in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> in <italic>Experimental Methods</italic> section). For comparative purposes, the deposition of all layers was also explored by spin-casting. Small-area devices were fabricated on pre-patterned 15 × 20 mm glass-FTO substrates. The fabrication process commences with the deposition of a hole-blocking compact TiO<sub>2</sub> layer (cTiO2) by spray pyrolysis using a hand-held spray-gun. Here, TAA (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) was diluted in isopropanol and sprayed onto FTO-glass placed on a hot-plate and held at 450 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and then sintered for 1 hour. A mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> (mTiO<sub>2</sub>) layer was then deposited at room temperature to act both as a scaffold for the perovskite layer and as an electron-accepting contact. Here, a mTiO<sub>2</sub> paste was used that was diluted to 10 wt% and 22 wt% with ethanol for spray- and spin-casting respectively. After the evaporation of the ethanol, the samples underwent further sintering for 1 hour at 450 °C to harden the films into a dense mTiO<sub>2</sub> scaffold ready for perovskite precursor deposition.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of thin-film deposition protocols (*) refers to substrate temperature during ink deposition.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Parameter</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>mTiO<sub>2</sub></p></th><th colspan="2"><p>Perovskite</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>Doped Spiro-OMeTAD</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>spin</p></th><th><p>spray</p></th><th><p>spin</p></th><th><p>spray</p></th><th><p>spin</p></th><th><p>spray</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><italic>substrate temperature*</italic></p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>55 °C</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>40 °C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>annealing</italic></p></td><td><p>1 hr min @ 450 °C</p></td><td><p>1 hr min @ 450 °C</p></td><td><p>45 minutes @100 °C</p></td><td><p>45 minutes @ 100 °C</p></td><td><p>none</p></td><td><p>None</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>speed</italic></p></td><td><p>3000 rpm/30 s</p></td><td><p>60 mm s<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td><p>2000 rpm/30 s</p></td><td><p>200 mm s<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td><p>2000 rpm/30 s</p></td><td><p>150 mm s<sup>−1</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>ink conc</italic></p></td><td><p>22 wt%</p></td><td><p>10 wt%</p></td><td><p>630 mg ml<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td><p>450 mg ml<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td><p>96 mg ml<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td><p>45 mg ml<sup>−1</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>solvent</italic></p></td><td><p>Ethanol</p></td><td><p>Ethanol</p></td><td><p>DMF</p></td><td><p>DMF</p></td><td><p>CB</p></td><td><p>1:1 CF:CB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>ink temp.</italic></p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td><td><p>Ambient</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par9">The precursor perovskite films (2.95:1.00 MAI:PbCl<sub>2</sub> solution containing 1% (by volume) hydrogen iodide (HI) in DMF were then coated on the FTO/cTiO<sub>2</sub>/mTiO<sub>2</sub> surface under ambient lab conditions maintained at (20 ± 2)°C and (30 ± 5)% RH.

For spray-casting, we developed a mixed solvent system (1:1 chlorobenzene:chloroform) to deposit doped spiro-OMeTAD. This exploited solvent surface tension gradient induced flows (Marangoni effect) to produce favourable spreading capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, resulting in the formation of a relatively smooth film. It was found however that the addition of dopants (Li-TFSI, TBP, and FK209) to the spiro-OMeTAD solution (conventionally used to increase the conductivity of the final film) had the unwanted effect of increasing ink surface tension which suppressed its wetting and spreading properties (see <italic>Supplementary Information</italic>). To address this issue, we found that the addition of a small quantity (0.003 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) of a high molecular weight (M<sub>N</sub> ~ 8 MDa) polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG) to the ink increased its viscosity through chain entanglement effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Using this formulation, we were able to deposit films having improved uniformity (<italic>see</italic> Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Finally, to create a PSC device, patterned gold counter electrodes were vacuum evaporated onto the Spiro-OMeTAD surface, creating six independent cells.

We have also used laser-beam induced imaging (LBIC) to explore the homogeneity of photocurrent generation. In this technique, 405 nm light from a diode-laser was focused to a point and raster scanned across the surface in 25 µm step-sizes, with the photocurrent recorded using a pico-ammeter. Scanning profilometry using a Bruker DektakXT having a vertical and lateral spatial resolution estimated to be 1 nm and 12.5 µm (defined by the tip radius) respectively were also used to obtain topographic images of the surfaces of individual layers at various stages in the device fabrication process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Device and Film Characterisation</title><p id="Par13">We first present a summary of performance metrics from our small-area device fabrication study in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, together with statistical data recorded from 16 independent cells in a box plot in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Here, device A was fabricated by spin-coating all layers and had a PCE of (11.4 ± 1.0)%. On spray-casting the mTiO<sub>2</sub> scaffold (device B), we find that the PCE is slightly reduced at (10.9 ± 0.5)%, however the statistical significance of this reduction is low. Here, any reduction in average PCE results from a drop in V<sub>OC</sub> from (0.87 ± 0.02) V to (0.85 ± 0.02) V, and in FF from (70 ± 4)% to (68 ± 3)%. Such differences appear to result from changes in the mTiO<sub>2</sub> thickness that appears dependent on the nature of the technique used in its deposition. This is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a) and (b)</xref> respectively, where we plot topographic images of spin and spray-cast mTiO<sub>2</sub> thin-films after sintering. Interestingly, we find that the spin-cast film shows strong evidence of solutal Marangoni effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> whereby surface tension gradients cause a flow of the material to highly concentrated areas.

This results in much larger peak-to-valley thickness variations in the spin-cast film surface compared with its spray-cast analogue (90 nm compared with 20 nm respectively). Because of this, one might anticipate superior performance from device B owing to its improved mTiO<sub>2</sub> uniformity, however this is not observed. We are unable to account for the reduction in fill factor responsible for this; however we note that the efficiency of mesoporous standard architecture PSCs is very sensitive to differences in mTiO<sub>2</sub> film thickness, and the efficiency variations may simply reflect uncertainties associated with film thickness and measurement.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A summary of PSC performance metrics and deposition technique used to fabricate each layer.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><p>Device A</p></th><th><p>Device B</p></th><th><p>Device C</p></th><th><p>Device D</p></th><th><p>Device E</p></th><th><p>Device E</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Area (cm<sup>2</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.026</p></td><td><p>0.026</p></td><td><p>0.026</p></td><td><p>0.026</p></td><td><p>0.026</p></td><td><p>1.008</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>mTiO</italic><sub>2</sub></p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Perovskite</italic></p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>HTM</italic></p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spin</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td><td><p>Spray</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PCE (%)</p></td><td><p><bold>12.9</bold> (11.4 ± 1.0)</p></td><td><p><bold>11.7</bold> (10.9 ± 0.5)</p></td><td><p><bold>10.7</bold> (9.9 ± 0.7)</p></td><td><p><bold>11.4</bold> (9.9 ± 0.7)</p></td><td><p><bold>10.2</bold> (9.2 ± 0.6)</p></td><td><p><bold>6.9</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>J<sub>SC</sub>(mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)</p></td><td><p><bold>20.6</bold> (18.8 ± 1.5)</p></td><td><p><bold>20.0</bold> (18.9 ± 0.5)</p></td><td><p><bold>20.4</bold> (19.1 ± 1.0)</p></td><td><p><bold>20.1</bold> (18.2 ± 1.2)</p></td><td><p><bold>19.5</bold> (18.2 ± 0.9)</p></td><td><p><bold>18.6</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>V<sub>oc</sub> (V)</p></td><td><p><bold>0.91</bold> (0.87 ± 0.02)</p></td><td><p><bold>0.89</bold> (0.85 ± 0.02)</p></td><td><p><bold>0.82</bold> (0.79 ± 0.02)</p></td><td><p><bold>0.83</bold> (0.81 ± 0.02)</p></td><td><p><bold>0.84</bold> (0.80 ± 0.02)</p></td><td><p><bold>0.83</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FF (%)</p></td><td><p><bold>74</bold> (70 ± 4)</p></td><td><p><bold>72</bold> (68 ± 3)</p></td><td><p><bold>69</bold> (65 ± 2)</p></td><td><p><bold>72</bold> (67 ± 3)</p></td><td><p><bold>67</bold> (63 ± 3)</p></td><td><p><bold>45</bold></p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Bold is the peak value with the average and standard deviation presented in parenthesis.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Box plots showing statistical data of PSC performance from devices A–E (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for a description of device labels).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_8642_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Topographic images of mTiOx prepared on a glass/FTO/cTiOx surface.

From these plots and the images shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, it is apparent devices in which the perovskite precursor film is spray-cast are characterised by a greater density of defects (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Note, that most defect particles imaged using the surface profiler had an apparent in-plane diameter of around 10–15 μm. This value however is coincident with the spatial resolution of the surface profiler, indicating that the diameter of many of the defects is likely to be smaller than this.

We base this conclusion on the fact there is a large difference in relative solubility of PbCl<sub>2</sub> and MAI, and that PbCl<sub>2</sub> may undergo local aggregation or crystallisation during film drying as a result of fluctuations in local material concentration. It is unclear why larger aggregates apparently appear in the spray-cast films when their drying time is in fact shorter than the spin-cast analogues (15 <italic>vs</italic> 30 s respectively). We suspect that films that are spin-cast are subject to shear forces that constrain the film surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and reduce any tendency for the creation of compositional concentration gradients that lead to the formation of aggregates. In spray-casting however, such shear forces are absent, with convective flows due to the heated substrate possibly driving lateral material flow across the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> even though the overall drying time is shorter in the latter. We speculate therefore that such effects are responsible for the increased density of aggregates found in spray-cast films. Such aggregates in the perovskite film most likely result in charge-carrier leakage pathways through the top spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer that is (400 ± 10) nm thick in devices A–D. This leads to additional charge-carrier recombination losses that act to reduce V<sub>OC</sub> and reduce device performance compared to their spin-cast analogues.</p><p id="Par19">Finally, we discuss the spray-deposition of spiro-OMeTAD. Here, we again saw a reduction in device performance on spray-casting this layer as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. We now compare device D and E in which TiO<sub>2</sub> and perovskite-precursor films were deposited by spray-casting, but spiro-OMeTAD films were spin and spray-cast respectively. It can be seen that on spray-casting, the device PCE reduces from (9.9 ± 0.7)% to (9.2 ± 0.6)% as a result of a reduction in FF from (67 ± 3)% to (63 ± 3)%. We ascribe this reduction to a general decrease in HTM layer uniformity; a process that leads to a concomitant increase in series resistance. Despite the reduction in efficiency resulting from spray-coating the perovskite-precursor and spiro-OMeTAD layers, it can be seen that device E in which all layers were spray-cast has an average PCE of (9.2 ± 0.6)%. This represents a marked enhancement in performance (with a narrowed spread in device performance) compared to our previous study on all-spray inverted PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> in which we obtained an average PCE of (7.1 ± 1.7)%. For completeness, we include EQE spectra recorded from champion all spin (A) and all spray (E) devices in Supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>. The reduction in the homogeneity of devices incorporating a spray-cast spiro-OMeTAD film can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(e)</xref> (corresponding to device E) where large variations in height are evident. This is likely responsible for the reduced fill factor for these devices. Indeed, we found that the spray-deposition of doped spiro-OMeTAD to be very challenging, however highly uniform films of <italic>undoped</italic> spiro-OMeTAD could be prepared by spray-coating without apparent difficulty. We suspect that the presence of ionic dopants such as LiTFSI and FK209 may increase the surface tension of the spiro-OMeTAD ink and therefore adversely impact its wetting properties as a result of increased surface tension (<italic>see</italic> Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1(c)</xref>). This is likely to impede droplet coalescence and thus causes solution dewetting. However the uniformity of the doped spiro-OMeTAD film can be significantly improved through the addition of a PEG rheology modifier, which we found enhanced the performance of resultant PSC devices (<italic>see</italic> Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Laser Beam Induced Current Mapping</title><p id="Par20">To further characterise the uniformity of our PSCs and explore spray-cast film properties we have used Laser Beam Induced Current (LBIC) mapping. This powerful diagnostic technique can be used to create a spatial map of photocurrent homogeneity. This is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> where we plot LBIC maps recorded from devices A to E (shown in parts (f) to (j) respectively). It is immediately apparent that the efficiency of photocurrent generation across devices A and B (corresponding to devices in which the perovskite-precursor is spin-cast), is highly uniform and only varies by around 8% over length-scales of a few mm. Conversely, PSCs containing spray-cast perovskite precursors (devices C and D), are characterised by less uniform photocurrent generation, varying by 16 and 21% respectively. Interestingly in device D, we observe isolated regions having a diameter of (110 ± 10) µm that are characterized by a low photocurrent. By comparing topographic and LBIC images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4 (a) to (j)</xref> respectively) we find that regions of low photocurrent closely correlate with the large aggregate-type defects associated with perovskite spray-deposition.</p><p id="Par21">It is also apparent that there are periodic (radial) features visible in the LBIC images recorded from devices A and C that were also apparent in the topography images shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. We conclude therefore that the thickness variations in the mTiO<sub>2</sub> play a significant role in determining the efficiency of photocurrent generation, and that accurate control over this layer is of key importance for effective device optimisation. Notably such features are not observable in the LBIC images recorded from devices B and D due to the improved uniformity of the spray-cast mTiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The effect of the non-uniform spray-cast spiro-OMeTAD film on photocurrent generation in device E is clearly apparent in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(j)</xref>, and in the photocurrent histogram and cross-sectional data (<italic>see</italic> Figs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Here, the photocurrent varies by as much as 22% across the surface of the device, indicating the importance of developing improved processing protocols for this layer. For completeness, we also present cross-sectional SEM images recorded from devices A and E in Supplementary Information, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>. This confirms the results presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, with enhanced non-uniformity across both the perovskite and spray-cast spiro-OMeTAD being evident.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Large-Area Device</title><p id="Par22">In order to evaluate the scalability of our spray-casting deposition protocols, we have fabricated large-area cells on 25 × 75 mm FTO/glass slides.

Again, the devices utilised a thermally evaporated gold contact to define five independent cells, each having an active-area of 1.51 cm<sup>2</sup> (as shown Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>). To gain additional confidence in our device test protocols, we have also recorded <italic>JV</italic> characteristics of devices having an active-area of 1.51 cm<sup>2</sup> using a solar simulator at CREST, UK.

However there is a significant reduction in FF from 67% to 45% that leads to a loss in PCE associated with scale-up from 10.2% to 6.9%. This reduction in PCE results from parasitic losses as a result of increased series resistance associated with longer FTO channel lengths which tend to increase with the device area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Part (<bold>a</bold>) shows the champion reverse scan JV characteristics for the small-area (measured in Sheffield) and large-area devices (measured at CREST).

We show that this method can be used to fabricate cells with a peak PCE of over 10% and an average of 9.2%, with a relatively low distribution in cell performance (σ = 0.6). This result compares favourably with devices in which all layers were deposited by spin-casting, where devices had an average PCE of 11.4%. Note that the baseline efficiencies of spin-cast devices demonstrated here are around a factor of two lower than state of the art devices that are processed using different perovskite formulations in an inert water and oxygen-free environment. The reduced efficiencies reported here result from the fact that all processing steps here were performed in air; a condition that is likely to be beneficial when developing a low-cost industrial process. However we expect that higher efficiency devices will be possible by transferring our process to a spray-coater housed within a nitrogen filled glove-box. Using laser beam induced photocurrent mapping and optical microscopy, we attribute the reduction in performance associated with spray-casting (compared to spin-casting) to the presence of micron-sized defects in spray-cast perovskite films that reduce V<sub>OC</sub> through charge-carrier recombination losses, and significant film-thickness fluctuations in the spray-cast spiro-OMeTAD films that reduce FF by series resistance losses. We also explore the suitability of this process to fabricate larger-area devices, and fabricate fully spray-cast cells having an active-area of 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. These were characterised using a solar simulator at CREST, where a device PCE of (6.59 ± 0.16)% was determined.

This material was then doped by adding the following quantities of dopant to 1 mL of solution: 30 µl Li-TFSI (175 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> in acetonitrile), 10 µl TBP, and 20 µl of FK-209 (175 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> in acetonitrile). Films were then spin-cast onto the perovskite at 2000 rpm. For spray-coating, the doped solution was diluted to 45 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> in chlorobenzene and chloroform such that the solvent ratio was 1:1. A small quantity of the polymer PEG (5 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> in chlorobenzene) was added such that the PEG concentration was 0.003 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>. The spray parameters used to deposit the doped Spiro-OMeTAD solution were as follows: fluid pressure 20 mbar, head velocity 150 mm/s and substrate temperature of 40 °C.</p><p id="Par30">Finally an 80 nm gold top contact was evaporated in an Edwards Auto 306 bell-jar evaporator at a pressure of <italic>ca</italic> 10<sup>−6</sup> mbar.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Device characterisation</title><p id="Par31">Devices were characterised by measuring their J-V curves under AM1.5 simulated solar irradiance. When testing a large- and small-area cells the illuminated area was defined through a shadow mask having an aperture of 1.0077 and 0.026 cm<sup>2</sup> respectively. Devices were tested under ambient conditions using a Newport 92251A-1000 solar simulator. An NREL certified silicon reference cell was used to calibrate the simulated AM1.5 G light-output to 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>. A Keithley 237 source measure unit was then used to perform J-V measurements. During testing devices were swept from −1.2 V to +1.2 V, and then back to −1.2 V at a scan speed of 0.4 Vs<sup>−1</sup>. Performance metrics were extracted from the reverse J-V scan. Stabilised power measurements were performed on the cells by holding them at a fixed voltage and recording the current over the course of a few minutes.</p><p id="Par32">The champion large-area solar-cell was taken to CREST for testing using a WACOM solar simulator. Details of this test are included in the supplementary information. EQE measurements were performed using a custom-built setup. Devices were illuminated with light from a 100 W tungsten-halogen light source coupled to a monochromator (Spectral Products DK240 1/4 m). The photocurrent was recorded with an Ossila Xtralien × 100 source measure unit. The photocurrent from the device under test was compared to a reference silicon photodiode (Newport) with a known spectral response to calculate the EQE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Dektak and LBIC measurements</title><p id="Par33">Laser beam induced current (LBIC) maps were performed using a custom-built setup. A 3 mW 405 nm diode laser was passed through a spatial filter before being focused to a power density of 27 W cm<sup>−2</sup>. The sample was mounted on a computer-controlled XY-stage and moved in a sawtooth pattern. To map the sample, the beam was focused <bold><italic>via</italic></bold> a 10X infinity-corrected objective lens to a spot size of <bold><italic>ca</italic></bold> 10 μm and the stage was moved in 25 μm steps. The PSC photocurrent was collected using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit.</p><p id="Par34">Surface topographs were measured with a Bruker Dektak:XT profilometer in map scan mode (12.5 µm tip radius, 3 mg stylus force) over an area of 2.7 × 5.0 mm<sup>2</sup> with 25 (slow-scan) and 0.83 µm (fast-scan axis) step-size respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via grants EP/M025020/1 ‘High resolution mapping of performance and degradation mechanisms in printable photovoltaic devices’ and EP/M014797/1 ‘Improved understanding, development and optimisation of perovskite-based Solar cells’.
