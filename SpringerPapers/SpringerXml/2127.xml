These radicals can subsequently undergo gas phase reactions with solids, liquids and living organisms that result in non-equilibrium surface/interface physicochemical processes. The specific phenomena produced by these reactions remain largely unknown, even though these plasma-based processes could lead to disruptive technological innovations. As an example, in the case of semiconductor microfabrication processes, the density, energy and lifetime of individual radicals, as well as the reaction time constants of these species with various materials should be ascertained. This would allow the identification and control of the effective radical species during processes, such as the high-precision etching and deposition of functional thin films. In addition, the type of reactions occurring between radicals generated in plasmas with liquids or living organisms is still an unexplored area. Establishing a theoretical system for these radical reactions and controlling the associated mechanisms could lead to innovations in the fields of functional devices and materials as well as in the areas of environmental protection, medicine and agriculture/fisheries. Focusing on the non-equilibrium surface/interface physicochemical reactions between radicals and solids occurring in semiconductor plasma processing, this paper describes the formation of nanostructured thin films by top-down mechanisms based on controlled radical production and bottom-up processes involving radical-induced self-organization. As well, this review examines next-generation medical and agricultural applications, such as the selective killing of cancer cells and plant growth promotion and functionalization. These systems result from the interactions of radicals generated in atmospheric-pressure, low-temperature plasmas with liquids, or the interactions of gas or liquid phase radicals with biological species. Finally, the importance of academic research into radical-controlled plasma processes and potential future technologies based on this interdisciplinary field are examined.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par58">Beginning in the 1970s, basic research regarding the use of plasma in semiconductor manufacturing emerged and, with the development of large-scale integrated circuits, the field of advanced semiconductor plasma processing has become important. Today, plasmas are used in 80% of semiconductor manufacturing processes and contribute to the manufacture of many items used in daily life. Approximately 55 years have passed, since Moore’s law was first proposed as both a summary of and a prediction for the growing semiconductor industry (Moore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1965</xref>). This law states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (IC) chip doubles every 18 months, and highlights the importance of miniaturization in the semiconductor industry. As a result of the ongoing miniaturization of ICs based on technological innovations aimed at increasing the number of components per chip, this law has continued to hold true. The increasing integration of semiconductor chips has been closely associated with the development of plasma processes such that, at present, plasma processing is the key technology driving semiconductor microfabrication. Currently, semiconductor devices are primarily fabricated using core plasma processes, including plasma etching, deposition and surface modification techniques. As these technologies are refined, revolutionary innovations are expected to occur that will create the society of the future.</p><p id="Par59">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the innovations resulting from improvements in plasma science and technology, which has undergone a major evolution in association with the development of semiconductor plasma processing. This technology comprises plasma diagnostics, generation and control, along with modeling and simulation. Research into plasma technology incorporates disciplines within both science and engineering, including mathematics, informatics, chemistry, physics, agriculture, medicine, pharmacy and so on, making this a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. Plasma-based materials and processes have resulted in the appearance of new academic fields, such as plasma electronics and plasma chemistry, and have made significant contributions to industry. However, many of the non-equilibrium physical and chemical reactions resulting from the interactions among electrons, ions, radicals, radiation and solids in plasmas have not yet been fully elucidated. More recently, atmospheric-pressure non-equilibrium plasmas and in-liquid plasmas have been developed and have attracted significant attention based on their potential applications in industry as well as in medicine, agriculture and fisheries. In particular, new research concerning the interactions between plasmas and liquids has become a global trend. The microscopic structures of plasmas and their physicochemical reactions at the plasma-liquid interface is an unexplored scientific field. In addition, research and development of plasma processes, which is a cutting-edge core science and technology, has become extremely significant as a field that creates basic science while leading industry.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The innovations resulting from improvement in plasma science and technology</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">The non-equilibrium physical and chemical reaction fields caused by plasmas have also produced a variety of phenomena that have led to disruptive innovations. Plasmas have been incorporated into the microfabrication technology used to manufacture semiconductors because of the discovery of phenomena that cannot be realized by existing physical chemistry occurring in thermal equilibrium, opening up new fields of application. Thus, plasma science and technology is an interdisciplinary field that is expected to bring about various innovations in fields, such as nanotechnology, green technology, agriculture and fisheries, and medicine. This progress could enable the creation of future devices and materials while providing solutions to environmental problems, increased agricultural production and novel medical breakthroughs. Plasma-based technologies are also thought to have the potential to bring about social innovations such as the creation of devices and materials for digital transformation and to allow the mitigation of environmental problems, such as by ensuring carbon neutrality.</p><p id="Par61">Despite the potential of plasma-based technology, 50 years of continuous research and development in this field has not kept pace with technological progress in general. One reason for this lack of progress is that available techniques for assessing the active species in plasmas have not been used sufficiently. Of course, plasma diagnostics and measurement techniques have been developed over the past five decades (Hori and Goto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; Bruggeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>) and have revealed previously unknown phenomena and greatly advanced the development of plasma processes. In particular, methods to measure the densities and energies of electrons, ions, radicals, and radiation in plasmas have been devised and are relatively well established, with the exception of the measurement of some special active species. However, these techniques for the analysis of plasmas are not presently widely applied to plasma-based manufacturing and high-precision control processes to collect and systematize practical and reliable information.</p><p id="Par62">It is evident that plasmas involve complex reaction systems and, as such, many researchers continue to use a trial-and-error research approach based on experience and intuition. Consequently, there is a need to develop more systematic processes that use scientific data. To this end, it is especially necessary to systematize the various phenomena produced by plasmas and to evaluate plasma processes and non-equilibrium plasmas. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates a potential approach to the systematic development of plasma science. As an example, in the case of the plasma processing of semiconductors, factors such as the deposition rate are related to the plasma power, pressure and gas flow rate. These external parameters are, in turn, strongly dependent on the type and geometry of plasma equipment, such that the deposition rate characteristics vary from equipment to equipment. As such, these etching characteristics are not purely scientific data. Because a plasma comprises electrons, ions, radicals and radiation, ascertaining the density and energy of these components and describing the deposition characteristics in terms of particle-based parameters (that is, internal parameters) provides equipment-independent scientific data. Monitoring the internal parameters of the plasma, especially the particle properties, can assist in describing various plasma-induced phenomena such that a reliable scientific understanding can be achieved.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A potential approach to the systematic development of plasma science</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par63">During the plasma processing of semiconductors, particles in the plasma interact with solid surfaces and induce phenomena, such as etching and deposition. In particular, the interactions of charged ions and neutral radicals are thought to play a major role in non-equilibrium physicochemical reactions occurring on solid surfaces and/or subsurfaces. Thus, it is important to determine the types of ions and radicals on a solid surface, along with the absolute densities and energies of these species, and to evaluate the reaction rate constants and the loss probabilities of these particles. Such data can be correlated with quantitative etching and deposition characteristics so as to better understand non-equilibrium physicochemical reaction fields.</p><p id="Par64">The reactions in plasmas are diverse and complex as a result of the many reactive species that can be present. The densities and energies of electrons, ions and radiation can be measured using relatively simple methods, while the absolute densities and energies of radicals are very difficult to ascertain, because these species are electrically neutral. As noted, developing a plasma processing science will require an understanding of the behavior of particles in plasmas and of correlations between particles and processing characteristics. The difficulty associated with measuring the densities of radicals is a major challenge in realizing this approach and so the system illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> has not yet been achieved. Furthermore, because plasma treatments are carried out in various environments and there are numerous methods of generating plasmas, data regarding the in situ spatio-temporal distributions of particles, while reactions are taking place are required to understand these processes.</p><p id="Par65">When evaluating the densities of ions and radicals in plasma processes, the densities of the latter will be more than an order of magnitude higher than those of the former. Consequently, radicals play an important role in these systems and should be systematically defined. The standard definition of a free radical is a species having an unpaired electron that is extremely reactive even at room temperature. However, in plasma processes, any electrically neutral reactive particle having a relatively short lifetime that participates in chemical reactions can be referred to as a radical. In a plasma, gas molecules are typically dissociated by collisions with electrons to generate reactive particles, after which these particles collide with other species in the gas phase and eventually reach the surface of the solid or liquid. These reaction processes are very complex. In particular, as the pressure increases, the frequency of collisions between particles in the gas phase increases and the radicals produced by electron impact are transformed into more diverse types by particle collisions. Therefore, it becomes necessary to measure the spatio-temporal distributions of radicals to fully understand the plasma process and to control the behavior of these species.</p><p id="Par66">Recently, non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasmas have been developed and so the behavior of radicals at ambient pressure has attracted much attention. The mean free path of particles at atmospheric pressure is on the micrometer level and the reactions due to particle collisions in the gas phase are very complex, with many radical species being generated as a result of such collisions. Furthermore, these radical species react with solid surfaces based on their surface loss probabilities. The loss probability for radicals at the surface (equal to the surface reaction probability) is, in turn, determined by the type of radical and its energy, and this probability varies greatly depending on the interactions of the radical with ions. In general, the reactivity of radicals can be increased by irradiation with high-energy ions. The reactions of such radicals with solid surfaces can lead to etching, deposition and surface modification, and some radicals can also form structures with unpaired electrons in solids. Recently, with the development of non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasmas (that is, low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasmas), the interactions of radicals with liquids have also become of interest as gas phase radicals will react with liquids to produce new radical species in the liquid.</p><p id="Par67">The reactions of radicals in liquids are more complex than those on solid surfaces, and these species are typically transformed into chemically stable particles within a short time frame. Reactions between radicals in liquids and living organisms can also have bioactive effects, such as stimulating an organism to generate radicals and inactivating molecules in the organism by inducing various signal transductions (that is, forming in vivo radicals). The various bioactive substances that can be induced in living organisms in this manner can potentially result in the selective destruction of cancer cells as well as wound healing, gene transfer, regeneration of living tissues, promotion of plant growth, inactivation of viruses and killing of pathogens. The potential for chains of radical reactions from the gas phase to the interiors of living organisms has led to the emergence of new fields, namely, plasma medicine and plasma agriculture.</p><p id="Par68">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> provides an overview of potential future innovations that could be brought about by the systematization and control of radical reactions in plasma processes. These processes have the potential to realize nano-information devices and environmental innovations that will create an advanced future society. To accomplish these goals, several developments are required. These include devising means of assessing the spatio-temporal distributions of radicals, quantification of the fundamental physical properties of radicals (such as surface reaction probabilities) and the effects of these properties, modeling and simulation of radical reactions, development of approaches to controlling radicals, and research into new technologies to control radicals. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, innovations in silicon-based ultra-large scale integrated circuits (ULSIs), quantum devices, cell phones, artificial intelligence (AI) and nano-information devices may allow the realization of an advanced society. These innovations will require ultra-precise control of the behavior of radicals and ions in ultra-high density plasmas. In particular, the development of large-area, high-throughput, ultra-high density plasma devices and autonomous plasma generation systems capable of fine spatio-temporal control of particle fluctuations will be necessary (Hori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). It will also be a requirement to incorporate self-organized reactions to allow the fabrication of ULSIs in conjunction with ultra-fine processing on the 1 or 2 nm scale. Currently, technologies to process materials in atomic layer units (atomic layer etching) (Kanarik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>; Oehrlein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>) and to deposit thin films in atomic layer units while processing solid surfaces (ALE: atomic layer deposition) are being developed (George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>; Puurunen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2014</xref>; Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to control the spatio-temporal fluctuations of the densities and energies of radicals in the plasma and to be able to observe and precisely control the solid surface reactions induced by radicals at the atomic level.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>An overview of potential future innovations that could be brought about by systematization and control of radical reactions in plasma processes</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par69">The plasma processes on which etching is based are able to produce three-dimensional (3D) heterogenous integrated microstructures by controlling the particles in the plasma, meaning that this is a so-called top-down process. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the use of self-organization phenomena induced by plasmas has attracted attention as a mean of realizing environmentally friendly innovations related to fuel cells, batteries, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, power devices, thermal electronic devices, carbon dioxide conversion and catalysis. The tuning of radical reactions could also allow the synthesis of nanomaterials with one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) or 3D structures through self-assembly, equivalent to a bottom-up process. Thus, radical-controlled plasmas are expected to result in the creation of functional materials with ultrafine structures and new properties via the integration of top-down and bottom-up processes.</p><p id="Par70">The last part of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the development of non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasmas and non-equilibrium liquid plasmas, which has been actively pursued since approximately 2000. Studies have led to industrial applications, such as ultrafast material surface modification, bonding processes and the high-speed synthesis of nanoparticles. The development of room-temperature and room-pressure plasmas have also made it possible to irradiate pathogens, cells and biological tissues with plasmas. Starting with the use of plasmas for sterilization and disinfection, plasmas were later applied in the fields of medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and fisheries. As an example, it is now evident that plasma-based radicals can interact with various biological tissues to induce controlled and regulated cell suicide in vivo, meaning programmed cell death, such as apoptosis.</p><p id="Par71">In this review, the principles of radical-controlled plasma processes are explained in Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, followed by examinations of techniques for assessing gas phase radicals during plasma processing in Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, approaches to radical-controlled plasma processes in Sect. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, and radical-controlled plasma etching, thin-film deposition and growth processes in Sect. <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">5</xref>.

In such systems, active species such as ions, radicals and photons are generated on the basis of the ionization, attachment, dissociation and excitation of gaseous species by collisions with electrons. Reactive plasmas produce non-equilibrium physico-chemical reaction fields due to the inclusion of chemically active species, and these can be distinguished from the physical fields associated with noble gas plasmas. It is important to note that the formation of radicals in a plasma is completely different from the dissociation of molecules resulting from thermal excitation or other means. During the dissociation of a molecule in response to heat, the position and velocity of the molecule change and the distance between the nuclei along the dissociation potential curve varies. This causes the potential energy of the system to increase above the bond dissociation energy such that the molecule dissociates. In contrast, in the case of a plasma, collisions with electrons excite molecules without changing their position or velocity, leading to ionization and/or dissociation according to the Frank–Condon principle. Thus, when electrons having energies of several eV collide with gas phase molecules, high-energy active species (ions, radicals and photons) are produced. The generation of these products via thermal energy requires temperatures of several thousand degrees, whereas these can be obtained at relatively low temperatures in a plasma.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The scheme of the plasma-based process</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par73">The frequency at which a given feedstock gas undergoes electron impacts can be expressed as <italic>k</italic><italic>n</italic><sub>e</sub>, where <italic>k</italic> and <italic>n</italic><sub>e</sub> denote the rate constant for the collision process and the electron density, respectively.

It should be noted that the spatial distribution of radicals is required to estimate their contribution to the reaction using Eq. (<xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="disp-formula">2.11</xref>). The radical loss probability can vary greatly depending on several factors. These factors include the chemical binding energy, the presence of dangling bonds and defects, the surface structure and the surface morphology, all of which can affect the chemical composition and energy states of the material with which the radicals react. Other important parameters are the temperature of the material, the surface charge, and the densities and energies of charged and neutral particles. It is known that these factors can greatly affect the etching and deposition rates, especially as the interactions between the incident ions and radicals with the substrate are modified. In the case that the incident ion energy is low, the ions can interact with radicals to promote thin-film formation (Shiratani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1998</xref>) and surface modification on the substrate and/or reactor walls. In contrast, if the ion bombardment energy exceeds the material bond threshold, the substrate will be etched by reactive sputtering and the etching rate will increase along with the incident ion energy. Therefore, the loss term at the surface will vary greatly as the density and energy of the incident ions are changed.</p><p id="Par91">On this basis, it is evident that tuning the radical surface loss probability is a very important aspect of radical-controlled plasma processing. This tuning requires that the correlations between processing characteristics (such as etching rate, deposition rate and surface modification), and the surface loss probability under various conditions, are known. In contrast, when atmospheric-pressure non-equilibrium plasmas interact with liquids, the surface loss probability for radicals entering from the gas phase is expected to be almost unity, although data to this effect have not yet been reported and so this represents a new research area in this field. A variety of radical species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are generated in liquids irradiated with plasma. Since the densities and lifetimes of these radicals are greatly affected not only by the type of liquid but also by temperature and pH, there is a need to establish technology to control radicals in liquids. Of particular interest are the various radical scavengers that have been developed to inactivate radicals in solution. The resulting concentration of radicals can be determined by the balance between the generation and annihilation rates as in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="disp-formula">2.6</xref>) and adjusting these terms allows the density of radicals in the liquid to be tuned.</p><p id="Par92">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> summarizes the possible radical generation and extinction processes that are available for radical control. Radical-controlled plasma processes can be realized by adjusting the factors in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="disp-formula">2.6</xref>). In addition, Hiramatsu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>) have developed a new radical control method, which was named radical injection by Hori in which the desired radicals are pre-generated externally and injected into the plasma processing space, as described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">5.10.1</xref>.

The density and energy distribution function for electrons in the plasma, which are important factors in the generation of these radicals, can be measured using a Langmuir probe, absorption probe, laser Thomson scattering spectroscopy or microwave interferometry. Radicals produced by electron impact dissociation of the feedstock gas molecules can be classified into higher order, lower order or atomic radicals. The higher order radicals can be monitored using electron or ion attachment mass spectrometry, while lower order radicals can be measured by mid-infrared time-resolved frequency comb, infrared diode laser absorption, ultraviolet absorption, ring-dye laser absorption, cavity ring-down, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), laser resonance ionization or appearance mass spectroscopic techniques. Atomic radicals can be examined using vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (VUVAS), multiphoton LIF, appearance mass spectrometry or electron spin resonance (ESR). Comb spectroscopy in particular has recently received much attention and dual comb techniques can generate a wide range of wavelengths in the mid-to-near-infrared region, allowing OH radicals to be monitored.</p><p id="Par95">In radical-controlled plasma processing, it is also necessary to determine the spatio-temporal distribution of various radicals in the gas phase with respect to parameters, such as the absolute density and energy of the radicals (meaning the oscillation, rotation and translation temperatures). In the case of the pulsed plasmas described below, high-precision plasma processing can be obtained using pulses to control the dynamics of radical formation and annihilation based on the fundamental properties of radicals, such as their reaction and diffusion constants and extinction and attachment probabilities.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>) proposed an approach to developing a plasma-based etching process in which the reaction products are removed by an exhaust stream. For this method to be viable, it is necessary to determine the reaction products in the plasma while assuming that the products will eventually become volatile such that they can be removed using a pump. As an illustration of this process, the chemical binding energies and volatilities/vapor pressures and boiling points of the reaction products that may be produced by the interaction of radicals and ions in the plasma during ULSIs fabrication are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Based on these data, we can estimate the possible reactions that can occur in the plasma, the volatile reaction products and the required processing temperatures and energies. In particular, from the vapor pressure values, it is possible to define the gas pressure and plasma source needed to drive the desired etching reaction, shape (isotropic or anisotropic) and rate. The raw material gas that is required and the radicals that will be produced from that gas are determined based on Eq. (<xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="disp-formula">2.5</xref>). Here, the important parameter is the electron temperature, which is responsible for the majority of the gas-dependent plasma characteristics and in turn is affected by the gas pressure, gas flow rate, applied field strength and frequency, reactor structure and wall material, in addition to the processing conditions. The accumulation of the self-bias voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>dc</sub>) that appears on the surface of a substrate on a radio frequency (RF) biased electrode is also an important process parameter that can control the energy of the incoming ions and their distribution. When selecting the feedstock gas, it is also important to carefully select the global warming potential of this gas to protect the environment.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Properties of typical gases and materials used in plasma etching processes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Material</p></th><th align="left"><p>Substance</p></th><th align="left"><p>Mask</p></th><th align="left"><p>Gas</p></th><th align="left"><p>Bond dissociation Energy (eV)</p></th><th align="left" colspan="2"><p>Boiling point (℃）</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Semiconductor</p></td><td align="left"><p>Si</p><p>GaN</p></td><td align="left"><p>Organic</p><p>SiO<sub>2</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>F<sub>2</sub></p><p>SF<sub>6</sub></p><p>NF<sub>3</sub></p><p>Cl<sub>2</sub></p><p>HBr</p></td><td align="left"><p>Si-Si:3.21, Si-H:3.04</p><p>Si-F:5.97, Si-Cl:4.32, Si-Br:3.71</p><p>Ga-Ga:&lt;1.10</p><p>Ga-H:2.76, Ga-O:3.88, Ga-N:2.4</p><p>Ga-F:6.05, Ga-Cl:4.80, Ga-Br:4.17</p><p>N-N:9.76, N-H:&lt;3.51, N-O:6.55</p><p>N-F:&lt;3.62, N-Cl:3.46, N-Br:2.91</p></td><td align="left"><p>SiH<sub>4</sub>:-112</p><p>SiF<sub>4</sub>:-86</p><p>SiCl<sub>4</sub>:59</p><p>SiBr<sub>4</sub>:154</p><p>Ga<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>:139</p><p>GaF<sub>3</sub>:1000</p><p>GaCl<sub>3</sub>:201</p><p>GaBr<sub>3</sub>:279</p></td><td align="left"><p>Cl<sub>2</sub>:-34</p><p>F<sub>2</sub>:-188</p><p>HBr:-67</p><p>NF<sub>3</sub>:-129</p><p>NCl<sub>3</sub>:71</p><p>CCl<sub>4</sub>:-77</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Graphene</p></td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>H<sub>2</sub></p><p>O<sub>2</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>C-C:6.41</p><p>C-H:3.51, C-O:11.16,</p><p>C-N:7.77</p><p>C-F:5.33, C-Cl:4.09, C-Br:3.30</p></td><td align="left"><p>CO:-192</p><p>CO<sub>2</sub>:-78</p></td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Metal</p></td><td align="left"><p>W</p></td><td align="left"><p>Organic</p></td><td align="left"><p>SF<sub>6</sub></p><p>NF<sub>3</sub></p><p>Cl<sub>2</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>W-W:6.90</p><p>W-O:7.46</p><p>W-F:5.64, W-Cl:4.34</p></td><td align="left"><p>WF<sub>6</sub>:17</p><p>WCl<sub>6</sub>:337</p><p>WOCl<sub>4</sub>:232</p></td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Al</p></td><td align="left"><p>Organic</p></td><td align="left"><p>Cl<sub>2</sub></p><p>HBr</p></td><td align="left"><p>Al-Al:2.74, Al-H:2.98,</p><p>Al-O:5.20, Al-N:3.81</p><p>Al-F: 7.00, Al-Cl:5.20, Al-Br:4.45</p></td><td align="left"><p>AlCl<sub>3</sub>:180</p><p>AlF<sub>3</sub>:1276</p></td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Dielectric</p></td><td align="left"><p>SiO<sub>2</sub></p><p>SiOCH<sub>3</sub></p><p>Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>Organic</p><p>Carbon</p></td><td align="left"><p>CF<sub>4</sub></p><p>C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub></p><p>C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub></p><p>CHF<sub>3</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>Si-O:8.29, Si-N:4.53, Si-C: 4.63</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>CH<sub>4</sub>:-161.5</p><p>CHF<sub>3</sub>:-82</p><p>CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>:-52</p><p>CH<sub>3</sub>F:-78</p><p>C<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>:-21</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>CF<sub>4</sub>:-128</p><p>C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>:-78</p><p>C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>:-6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Organic</p></td><td align="left"><p>SiO<sub>2</sub></p><p>Carbon</p></td><td align="left"><p>H<sub>2</sub></p><p>N<sub>2</sub></p><p>O<sub>2</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>CH<sub>3</sub>-C(O)OH: 4.0</p><p>CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)-OCH<sub>3</sub>:4.4</p><p>CH<sub>3</sub>COOC-H<sub>3</sub>:4.2</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par97">When developing plasma processes, it is vital to understand the correlation between equipment parameters (that is, external parameters), such as pressure, power and gas flow rate, and internal parameters related to electron temperature, electron density and particle densities/energies, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

As a model process, we here discuss thin-film deposition using a SiH<sub>4</sub> plasma as an example, in accordance with Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. Chittick et al.

This research, in turn, resulted in the production of thin-film silicon devices for solar cells. Subsequently, microcrystalline silicon thin films were also employed in thin-film transistors for liquid–crystal displays, leading to new breakthroughs in electronic devices. However, it remains necessary to improve the properties of amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon thin films, and new advances in plasma processes may make this possible. For this purpose, it is necessary to understand the gas-phase and surface reactions of active species in plasmas, especially process-critical radicals, and to construct thin-film deposition models to control critical radicals, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.</p><p id="Par99">Many researchers are working to establish these methods, and the properties of particles in H<sub>2</sub> diluted SiH<sub>4</sub> plasmas are becoming clearer. Based on correlations between thin-film properties and experimentally observed radical behavior, the radicals acting as precursors for thin-film deposition (e.g., SiH<sub>3</sub>) have been identified and their densities and surface adhesion coefficients determined. Other radicals, such as H, that are considered to be important during thin-film deposition by etching and the chemical termination of surfaces have also been identified. The densities and surface adhesion coefficients for such active species have also been clarified. Observations of various radicals in plasma processes and investigations of the surface attachment coefficients for these radicals have provided important insights into the most important species involved in such processes (Perrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">1998</xref>; Hori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>). Recently, it has also become possible to predict process performance using simulations predicated on these basic parameters. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machine learning using large experimental data sets has been employed to derive important parameters for such processes. In fact, models of radical behavior constructed from assessments of the gas phase and surface reactions of these radicals have shown that SiH<sub>3</sub> are the most important species serving as precursors for the fabrication of defect-free microcrystalline silicon thin films involved in the formation of high-quality amorphous silicon (a-Si) and μc-Si thin films. Such studies have examined the spatial distributions of densities of SiH<sub>3</sub> using IRLAS (Infrared diode laser absorption spectroscopy) (Itabashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1990</xref>) and have also clarified the densities of H (Takashima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2001</xref>), which play an important role in promoting the surface reactions of SiH<sub>3</sub> in the process plasma. The reactions of these radicals have been found to be dependent on the surface temperature (Matsuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1990</xref>). A surface reaction model for radicals at relatively low pressures has been proposed by Perrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1991</xref>), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and established, based on the accumulation of many measurements of radicals in silane plasmas (Matsuda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2004</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Plasma induced surface reactions during a-Si:H film growth (Perrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1991</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par100">Interestingly, Abe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">(2013)</xref>) determined the density and extinction times for H in a SiH<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> plasma at room temperature using VUV absorption spectroscopy (VUVAS) with a micro hollow-discharge cathode lamp (MHCL) (Takashima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1999</xref>) and found that the surface loss probability for H varied from 0.01 to 0.32 as the flow rate of SiH<sub>4</sub> was adjusted. This probability was also greatly affected by the interaction between the surface and deposited species, such as SiH<sub>3</sub>, acting as thin-film precursors. Furthermore, it was found that the surface loss probability for H becomes 1 at a substrate temperature of 200 °C even after deposition.

In addition, the flux of precursors and H must be controlled to be within the range of 65–70, which is understood to be located in the transition region from a-Si to μc-Si.

It is, therefore, crucial to evaluate the densities and surface attachment coefficients (that is, the surface reaction constants) for both radicals under conditions conducive to mass production processes. The proportional contributions of these radicals to thin-film formation must also be estimated. On this basis, the properties of the resulting thin films can be predicted using an internal parameter known as the radical density ratio. Evaluating these radical-based internal parameters in a stepwise manner while clarifying their relationships with plasma processing characteristics will allow the control of radicals leading to various innovations. The systematic accumulation of large data sets concerning the behavior of radicals in the gas phase via real-time measurement and diagnostic techniques and subsequent data analysis using AI is also expected to identify important active species and improve the plasma processes by allowing control of these species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Radical-controlled plasma etching, thin-film deposition and growth processes</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design of feedstock gases for SiO<sub>2</sub> etching</title><p id="Par109">When the material to be etched is known, the possible reaction products can be carefully investigated on the basis of their binding energies and volatilities/vapor pressures.

Evidently, CF<sub>2</sub> is important for the selective etching of SiO<sub>2</sub> on Si. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> demonstrates that the initial step of designing an etching process is to select the feedstock gas. As an example, in selective etching of SiO<sub>2</sub> films against Si and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> films, fluorocarbon gases are used. In early work, CF<sub>4</sub> gas was employed but a greater variety of such compounds is now used. These include fluorocarbons having linear structures (such as C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>), cyclic structures (such as C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) and containing different atoms (such as CHF<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O). In plasmas using these gases, the electron density, electron temperature, and the type and density of active species will differ depending on the type of gas.

The ionization and dissociation reactions of the feedstock gas should selectively generate radicals and ions that are effective during the process. To achieve the desired process, it is necessary to select an appropriate feedstock gas and to control the particles in the plasma reaction vessel.

This compound efficiently produces radicals and CF<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ions in response to electron impact and so could be used to replace the fluorocarbons having high global warming potential that are conventionally used for SiO<sub>2</sub> etching. The dissociative ionization cross section for CF<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ions obtained from gaseous C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>10</sub>O is much higher than that for other ionic species (more than ten times that for C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>. This is important, because CF<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> is the most effective ion in terms of improving the etching rate of SiO<sub>2</sub>. This compound was found to generate several radicals in relative quantities of CF<sub>3</sub> &gt; CF<sub>2</sub> &gt; CF. Diluting this gas with N<sub>2</sub> or Ar was shown to decrease the densities of CF<sub>3</sub> and CF in the plasma but had no effect on the density of CF<sub>2</sub>. Consequently, the relative proportion of CF<sub>2</sub>, which provides advantageous etching properties, could be increased. In this manner, by controlling the densities of ionic and radical species via careful selection of the feedstock gas, improved etching characteristics could be achieved. As an example, the etching rate of a SiOCH film using an Ar/C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>10</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> plasma was approximately 1000 nm/min, which was much higher than the rate obtained using an Ar/C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> plasma.

Equation (<xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="disp-formula">2.5</xref>) indicate that the radical density is directly related to the density of the feedstock gas. Consequently, the radical density can be adjusted by diluting the feedstock with a noble gas that does not contribute directly to any chemical reactions.

The electron temperature and electron density of the plasma are affected by the ionization energy as well as the ionization cross section of the noble gas.

These short lifetimes are attributed to reactions with the SiH<sub>4</sub> feedstock to produce larger molecules (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) responsible for the appearance of defects. The gas-phase reactions of these short-lived radicals with heavier molecules also produced fine particles that were a factor in the formation of defects in the thin films.

SiH, Si and SiH<sub>2</sub> all have large surface attachment coefficients ranging from 0.7 to 1.0. Naturally, short-lived radicals generate defects during the surface reaction process that make it challenging to fabricate high-quality thin films. Therefore, it is very important to control not only SiH<sub>3</sub> but also these short-lived radicals.<fig id="Fig22"><label>Fig. 22</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Systematic measurement results of Si, SiH, SiH<sub>2</sub> and SiH<sub>3</sub> in a parallel-plate electrode RF SiH<sub>4</sub>/Ar plasma (Goto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>; Hori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>; For reference, the SiH<sub>3</sub> density from Nomura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1994</xref>; SiH<sub>2</sub> density from Kono et al.

The density of SiH<sub>3</sub> can be increased in an undiluted SiH<sub>4</sub> plasma but the removal of heavier molecules by an exhaust pump or other means is necessary. In the case that the plasma is diluted with Ar gas, the SiH<sub>4</sub> density decreases such that the formation of larger molecules is suppressed, while the densities of Si, SiH and SiH<sub>2</sub> increase. The latter effect is disadvantageous with regard to the formation of high-quality thin films. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, dilution with noble gases may be an important aspect of controlling the formation and disappearance of radicals to realize radical-controlled plasma processes.</p><p id="Par122">The electron temperature can also be controlled by noble gas dilution, and so is a very important factor with respect to adjusting the generation of radicals.

The addition of noble gases having different ionization potentials into the reaction gas allowed the electron temperature to be tuned, the F, CF, CF<sub>2</sub> and CF<sub>3</sub> densities to be systematically controlled, and the final radical composition to be modified. From these studies, it is apparent that the dissociation of the source gas can be adjusted by dilution with a noble gas having a low ionization potential to give a lower electron temperature. Thus, careful selection of the noble gas diluent allows the radicals generated in the plasma to be controlled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>O<sub>2</sub> plasmas</title><p id="Par123">SiO<sub>2</sub> is a very important insulating film in ULSIs but must be fabricated at relatively low temperatures (below 550 °C).

It is also evident that the O oxidation mechanism is different from the conventional dry oxidation mechanism. The addition of Kr as a diluent in this plasma-based low-temperature oxidation process has been reported to result in the formation of a high-quality silicon oxide film with a low leakage current (Ueno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2000</xref>; Sekine et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2001</xref>; Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2003</xref>; Goto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>). The incorporation of Kr at a dilution ratio of 97% or higher is believed to promote collisions between metastable Kr atoms and oxygen molecules to generate excited state O (<sup>1</sup>D<sub>2</sub>) in addition to ground-state oxygen atoms. These O (<sup>1</sup>D<sub>2</sub>) contributes to the formation of high-quality oxide films. Takeda et al.

These assessments showed that radical formation comprised [1] dissociative ionization, [2] radical ionization, and [3] Penning [metastable] ionization stages. Using the data cross section and assuming electron temperatures of 3 eV for Ar and 2.6 eV for Kr, the radical production fractions were fit to the experimental results, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig33" ref-type="fig">33</xref>. In this manner, the CH<sub>2</sub>F/CHF<sub>2</sub> radical density ratios during these three stages were estimated to be 0.3: 0.1: 0.6.

Figure <xref rid="Fig36" ref-type="fig">36</xref> confirms that the electron temperature was lowered and gas dissociation was suppressed by pulse modulation. In addition, the proportion of CF (the precursor radical for deposition) to F (the precursor radical for etching) was increased.

Pulse modulation was found to control the dissociation of the chlorine gas and to vary the chlorine radical density by changing the electron temperature over time. Figure <xref rid="Fig37" ref-type="fig">37</xref> summarizes the relationships between electron density and electron temperature with modulation time and demonstrates that the electron temperature increased at the start and end of the pulse but decreased after the power was turned off (Sugai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">1997</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig38" ref-type="fig">38</xref> provides data related to the densities of chlorine radicals and ions over time. Note that the absolute density of chlorine radicals was determined using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (Sugai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">1997</xref>). When the power was turned off, negative ions and chlorine radicals were generated by the dissociative attachment of low-energy electrons to chlorine gas: Cl<sub>2</sub> + e → Cl<sup>−</sup> + Cl. On the application of power, there was no significant change in the density of chlorine radicals, but spikes in the density of these radicals occurred in conjunction with power-on and power-off events. Specifically, at – 40 μs, the chlorine radical density increased due to the dissociation reaction shown above as a result of electron impact because of the high electron temperature. The peak at 20 μs indicated that the chlorine radical density was increased because of dissociative attachment caused by the decrease in electron temperature. These results confirm that the chlorine radical density changed along with the electron temperature, meaning that the radical density could be controlled by pulse modulation.<fig id="Fig37"><label>Fig. 37</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Temporal variations in electron density ne (open circles) and electron temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>e</sub> (closed circles).

In this etching process, the products formed by the reaction of chlorine with silicon were decomposed in the gas phase to form SiCl, oxides and other unsaturated molecules. Radicals such as oxychloride species have a large dipole moment and thus a greater probability of attachment to SiO<sub>2</sub> than to Si. This is because the SiO bonds on SiO<sub>2</sub> are also polar and, therefore, attract dipole molecules based on Coulomb forces. As a result, only the SiO surface was covered with silicon chloride or oxychloride and this protected the surface from etching by chlorine ions. It was proposed that this protective film inhibited etching of the SiO<sub>2</sub> and resulted in a high poly-Si/SiO selectivity ratio. As such, the polarization of radicals could be used to control their reaction adhesion coefficient by selective deposition or other means.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Radical injection</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Carbon nanowall growth by H injection</title><p id="Par149">In general, the types and density of radicals are determined by the choice of gas species, the shape of the plasma device, the gas pressure and the applied power, as shown in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="disp-formula">2.7</xref>).

The growth of these nanowalls was also found to be independent of the substrate material (Fig. <xref rid="Fig42" ref-type="fig">42</xref>). The relationship between the growth of the carbon nanowalls and manufacturing conditions such as the type of feedstock gas was investigated. A C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> system was determined to generate vertically aligned carbon nanowalls on the substrate, while the nanowalls grown using a CH<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> system were wavy and as thin as 10 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig43" ref-type="fig">43</xref>).

This apparatus used a small light source to monitor atomic radicals using VUVAS. The behavior of atomic radicals in the plasma was ascertained in real time and the data were fed back to the device to ensure that the processing conditions remained optimal. It was proposed that this device could realize nanoscale microfabrication of thin films by controlling radicals in the plasma in a time-resolved manner. In addition, the effectiveness of this concept was demonstrated by controlling H and N during plasma etching of organic low-k thin films (Nagai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par159">Figure <xref rid="Fig49" ref-type="fig">49</xref> shows the variations in the patterns etched onto organic low-k films using various proportions of H and N and different substrate temperatures (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2012</xref>). During the etching of organic thin films, H contribute to the actual etching while N form a protective film on the sidewalls of the etched pattern. This prevents the pattern from becoming bowed due to undercutting by H. It is also known that, when the density ratio of N to H is increased, the thickness of the sidewall protection film layer consisting of C–N bonds increases and the pattern changes to a tapered shape, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig50" ref-type="fig">50</xref>. Thus, by precisely controlling the H and N, it is possible to form fine patterns with vertical shapes. The ratio of these radicals can be adjusted by monitoring their densities in plasmas generated using mixtures of H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> by VUVAS and controlling the relative flow rates for the two gases based on these data. In this manner, the fine pattern shape of an organic low-k thin film can be controlled. However, the loss probability (that is, the reaction coefficient) for H and N at the organic thin film varies greatly as the substrate temperature is changed, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig49" ref-type="fig">49</xref>. Throughout the plasma etching process, the substrate temperature rises due to the energy released by the collisions of ions. Yamamoto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2012</xref>) found that vertical fine pattern shapes could be successfully obtained by changing the H/N ratio as the substrate temperature varied, as demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig51" ref-type="fig">51</xref>. As an example, a H/H + N ratio of 0.8 produced a pattern having a significantly bowed morphology, because the reaction rates for H radicals increased along with the substrate temperature, such that precise vertical shapes could not be obtained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig51" ref-type="fig">51</xref>a). A H/H + N ratio of 0.5 was used in an attempt to prevent this bowing but did not yield a highly precise pattern because of increases in the substrate temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig51" ref-type="fig">51</xref>b). It is apparent from such studies that ultra-high precision nano-scale etching requires the plasma conditions to be reoptimized as the etching pattern evolves. To achieve this, it will be necessary to create an autonomous plasma process in which the device itself identifies the optimal conditions while executing the etching process. Such technology is expected to lead to new types of semiconductor plasma processing.<fig id="Fig49"><label>Fig. 49</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Amount of bowing on sidewall of trench pattern as a function of substrate temperature (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2012</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig49_HTML.png" id="MO49"/></fig><fig id="Fig50"><label>Fig. 50</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Etching of organic film by H<sub>2</sub> plasma, <bold>b</bold> Etching of organic film by H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> plasma The sidewall protective layer consisting of carbon nitride film formed by N protects the etching reaction from H.

Especially during etching, the effect of ion irradiation on the substrate temperature cannot be ignored, because etching proceeds via the mutual reactions of fast ions and radicals. Even so, it has traditionally been difficult to accurately measure the substrate temperature in real time during plasma processes. Tsutsumi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2015a</xref>) developed an interferometer using an incoherent light source to allow in situ substrate temperature monitoring during plasma processing. This device was able to measure the temperature of a Si wafer at 50 ms intervals using an autocorrelation-type frequency-domain low-coherence interferometer with a precision of 0.04 °C. Figure <xref rid="Fig55" ref-type="fig">55</xref> presents the relationship between the etching shape and temperature based on the results of real-time measurements of the substrate temperature with an interferometer while maintaining the H/H + N ratio at 0.52 during the etching of organic low-k thin films (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2012</xref>). At low substrate temperatures, a tapered etching shape was obtained, whereas higher temperatures resulted in a bowed shape. It is apparent that obtaining a vertical shape (A–B = 0) with a pattern size variation on the order of 1 nm required the substrate temperature to be controlled within 1 °C. As noted, the present technology available for controlling radical ratios in real time is not sufficient to allow nano-scale etching with ultra-high precision, and so new methods are needed. As a means of addressing this problem, a technology has been developed that provides a constant substrate temperature by controlling the on/off state of the plasma source. In the autonomous etching system described above, the temperature data acquired using the interferometer are sent to a server in real time and these data are used to adjust external parameters associated with the etching system, such as valves and power supplies.

In a typical etching system, the wafer is held by an electrostatic chuck and cooled by refrigerant and/or He gas from a chiller. In addition to the ion irradiation, the temperature rise of the components around the wafer also contributes to heating of the wafer, such that the wafer temperature during etching changes in a complicated manner. However, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig56" ref-type="fig">56</xref>b, the duty ratio per discharge was automatically and gradually decreased, such that the wafer temperature was maintained at a constant value.

These trials likely represent the first-ever etching with the substrate temperature kept constant. The figure shows the film morphologies that were obtained as the wafer temperature was varied. As the temperature was increased, the trench width etched into the organic film became larger. This width was determined by the balance between the etching reaction and the effect of temperature on the formation of the protective film on the trench sidewalls.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1988</xref>) and Okazaki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1989</xref>) succeeded in generating a glow plasma under atmospheric pressure. This pioneering research led to the development of industrial applications for atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasmas, and also created new research trends in the field of plasma physics and chemistry (Kogelschatz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2003</xref>). The development of high-speed etching and surface treatment techniques would be highly beneficial with regard to the manufacturing of microscale mechanical elements such as micro-electromechanical systems and in the surface modification of roll-to-roll polymer sheets. Traditionally, low-pressure, high-density plasma processes have been used to treat these materials but do not provide sufficient throughput. In addition, more than half of the manufacturing process takes place in a reactive gas atmosphere in a vacuum. As a result, the associated equipment and facilities have become more complex and larger and the accompanying cost increases have become a serious problem. A non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma process has been proposed as a means of addressing these issues. The electron density in this plasma is approximately 10<sup>13</sup>–10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>, which is more than three orders of magnitude higher than those in conventional vacuum plasmas. In addition, the electron temperature is approximately 1 eV lower than those for standard systems, and because a vacuum is not required, the cost and processing time can be reduced.</p><p id="Par165">Using this plasma, ultrahigh density radicals and ions can be injected into the substrate surface. In addition, because it is a low-temperature plasma, the process can be designed based on the knowledge previously accumulated from conventional low-pressure plasma processes. In general, the density of radicals in atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasmas is more than three orders of magnitude higher than that in a conventional vacuum plasma, while the gas temperature ranges from around room temperature to a few thousand degrees C. The mean free paths of particles in atmospheric-pressure plasmas are on the micrometer scale and the ultra-dense radicals generated in these systems are instantly annihilated by particle collisions. Furthermore, atmospheric-pressure plasmas allow the introduction of solutions, and the resulting combination of wet and dry characteristics can provide radicals with unique physical chemistries, leading to new processing technologies.</p><p id="Par166">Atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasmas can be used for ultra-fast material processing, deposition and surface treatment and can also be applied for the purpose of killing pathogenic bacteria, inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells, healing of skin diseases and injured tissues, and regeneration of biological tissues. Thus, research regarding the medical applications of plasmas has become of interest worldwide. Plasmas are also being applied in agriculture and fisheries, such as to promote the growth of plants and fish, and may, therefore, represent one aspect of addressing a future food crisis. On this basis, atmospheric-pressure, low-temperature plasmas may result in the establishment of a new interdisciplinary field that integrates the science and engineering of plasmas with medicine, agriculture and fisheries, and molecular biology. It should be noted that these advances will require the development of techniques for monitoring and controlling radicals in such plasmas.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Radical controlled atmospheric-pressure plasmas for industrial applications</title><p id="Par167">Kono et al.

The extent of SiO<sub>2</sub> etching was found to depend on the NF<sub>3</sub> flow rate and the distance between the plasma and the substrate. Increasing the NF<sub>3</sub> flow rate increased the etching rate and rapid etching of approximately 14 μm/min was obtained at a distance of 5 mm. This etching rate was close to one order of magnitude greater than that obtainable with conventional low-pressure high-density plasmas. This etching process exhibited minimal Si etching and so provided a very high SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si selectivity ratio of more than 200. The etching mechanism was investigated using FTIR spectroscopy to examine particles in the plasma. Approximately 60% NF<sub>3</sub> dissociation was observed and a peak between 3800 and 4200 cm<sup>−1</sup> indicated the formation of HF. These results suggested that HF was produced by the reaction between H<sub>2</sub>O and fluorine radicals in the NF<sub>3</sub> plasma.</p><p id="Par168">Figure <xref rid="Fig58" ref-type="fig">58</xref> provides a diagram of this ultrafast and highly selective etching reaction processes using He, NF<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and He, NF<sub>3</sub> systems (Yamakawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2005a</xref>).

As discussed above, the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O caused a rapid decrease in the number of F and promoted the formation of HF. Controlling the densities of F, HF and H<sub>2</sub>O was found to be important with regard to obtaining a high selectivity ratio during high-speed etching. The data from this system indicated that, in the case of atmospheric-pressure plasmas, the mean free path is very small (less than 1 μm) and so many radicals react in the gas phase and are inactivated (Yamakawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2005a</xref>).</p><p id="Par173">Iwasaki et al.

A SiO<sub>2</sub> etching rate of 400 nm/min could be obtained with the addition of a small amount of oxygen gas, indicating that the etching of SiO<sub>2</sub> was promoted by chemical reactions in the atmospheric-pressure plasma even without high-energy ion bombardment. Furthermore, upon adding H<sub>2</sub>O, an ultrafast SiO<sub>2</sub> etching rate of more than 8 μm/min was obtained at 20 kHz. This SiO<sub>2</sub> etching in association with H<sub>2</sub>O addition was found to be highly dependent on the presence of HF. The behavior of fluorocarbon-based molecules and higher order radicals with and without the addition of water together with the characteristics of SiO<sub>2</sub> etching were investigated by Li<sup>+</sup> ion attachment mass spectrometry (IAMS). Figure <xref rid="Fig60" ref-type="fig">60</xref> provides the IAMS spectra of the gases discharged from the plasma source without and with added H<sub>2</sub>O (Iwasaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>). These experimental results suggest that SiO<sub>2</sub> etching with H<sub>2</sub>O addition was greatly affected by variations in the HF concentration. The results obtained using a CF<sub>4</sub> plasma also confirmed the validity of the HF etching model proposed by Yamakawa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2004</xref>). Certain gases could be discharged from the plasma source without any molecular fragmentation, including CF<sub>4</sub>Li<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>2</sub>OF<sub>4</sub>Li<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>3</sub>HF<sub>5</sub>Li<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>Li<sup>+</sup> and C<sub>3</sub>HF<sub>7</sub>Li<sup>+</sup>, while C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>Li<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>3</sub>HF<sub>7</sub>Li<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>Li<sup>+</sup> and C<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>9</sub>Li<sup>+</sup> could be used for calibration. These results demonstrated that the formation of both C<sub>3</sub>HF<sub>7</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub> was drastically reduced when H<sub>2</sub>O was added to the CF<sub>4</sub>. In addition, CF<sub>2</sub> and CF<sub>3</sub> generated in the plasma were found to be recombined by a three-body collision reaction to generate heavier species in the remote plasma region. Higher order radicals are well known as precursors to the formation of protective layers that reduce the etching rate for SiO<sub>2</sub>, and the generation of higher order radicals such as C<sub>3</sub>HF<sub>7</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub> was significantly suppressed by H<sub>2</sub>O addition such that the etching rate was improved. The proportion of stable COF<sub>2</sub>, which is thought to be generated by the reactions of lower molar mass radicals, such as CF<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub> and O, was also increased with the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O.<fig id="Fig59"><label>Fig. 59</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characteristics of the SiO<sub>2</sub> etch rate with H<sub>2</sub>O gas or with O<sub>2</sub> gas in the atmospheric-pressure pulsed plasma (Iwasaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig59_HTML.png" id="MO59"/></fig><fig id="Fig60"><label>Fig. 60</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mass spectrum of the gases exhausted from the plasma <bold>a</bold> without addition of H<sub>2</sub>O and <bold>b</bold> with addition of H<sub>2</sub>O to CF<sub>4</sub> (Iwasaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig60_HTML.png" id="MO60"/></fig></p><p id="Par174">Using the non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma excited by microwaves, Yamakawa et al.

Here, sample 1 was processed at a rate of 1 mm/s, while samples 2 and 3 were treated at 0.1 mm/s. Note also that samples 2 and 3 were exposed to the same treatment but the process was repeated five times in the case of sample 3. The thicknesses of the copper oxide layers (which consisted of CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O) decreased as the duration of exposure to the H radicals in the remote plasma was increased. CuO was evidently reduced to Cu<sub>2</sub>O when using a rate of 1 mm/s, while both CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O were further reduced at the treatment speed of 0.1 mm/s to the point that they were completely reacted. Under these experimental conditions, the effects of ions on the sample surface were considered to be negligible, because the sample was situated relatively far from the plasma. The increase in the amount of Cu<sub>2</sub>O observed in conjunction with a processing rate of 1 mm/s can be attributed to the reaction of CuO with Cu. Therefore, the increase in the amount of underlying Cu<sub>2</sub>O indicates that reduction occurred both at the CuO surface and at the CuO/Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>O/Cu interfaces due to the interdiffusion of H, CuO<sub>x</sub> ions and Cu ions. The effect of H exposure on the reduction of Cu oxides in these trials was qualitatively estimated. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig66" ref-type="fig">66</xref>, the H density was on the order of 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> and the H flux at the copper oxide surface was estimated to be 5 × 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>⋅s<sup>−1</sup>. Consequently, the rate of reduction of CuO at ambient temperature was determined to be approximately 4 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>⋅s<sup>−1</sup> based on changes in the CuO thickness and density. From these data, the ratio of the amount of CuO reduced to the H flux was calculated to be approximately 0.008. It is apparent that a large number of H is necessary for the reduction of copper oxides. These trials also indicate that a high-density atmospheric-pressure plasma employing a H<sub>2</sub>/Ar gas mixture can effectively reduce CuO.<fig id="Fig67"><label>Fig. 67</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Thicknesses of copper oxides after the H<sub>2</sub> /(H<sub>2</sub> + Ar) gas treatment (Inui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig67_HTML.png" id="MO67"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasmas for biological applications</title><p id="Par186">Atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasma technology has made it possible to irradiate liquids and living organisms with plasma and the cross-reaction field between plasmas and living organisms has attracted much attention.

The exposure of living organisms to plasma (direct irradiation) or injections of plasma-activated solutions into living organisms (indirect irradiation) have been found to produce unique phenomena, such as the selective destruction of cancer cells, non-invasive hemostasis, wound healing and immunotherapy. Furthermore, these techniques can effectively kill pathogenic bacteria, inactivate viruses, and promote plant growth and function. It is also known that the chemically active species generated in a plasma can have a significant effect on living tissues. Figure <xref rid="Fig68" ref-type="fig">68</xref> summarizes the chemical and biological reactions that occur when living organisms or liquids are exposed to a plasma. Because of the presence of liquid on the surfaces of living tissues, a chemical reaction field is generated and it is important to clarify and control the reactions between the plasma and liquid. There are a wide variety of radicals among the chemically active species produced by a plasma, which can be classified into short-lived radicals and medium-to-long-lived radicals. During direct irradiation, short-lived reactive species, electric fields, shock waves and radiation can interact with living organisms.<fig id="Fig68"><label>Fig. 68</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chemical and biological reactions that occur when living organisms or liquids are exposed to a plasma</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig68_HTML.png" id="MO68"/></fig></p><p id="Par187">In the case of indirect irradiation, the short-lived active species disappear due to reactions with other molecules, while the chemical and biological effects of the medium- and long-lived active species are maintained.

During the application of atmospheric-pressure and low-temperature plasmas to living systems, ROS, RNS and RONS can be obtained in conjunction with the use of gaseous helium or argon along with the addition of air or water.

This atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasma was applied to the irradiation of living organisms in the 1990s, because it represented a low-cost sterilization process. As an example, several studies have assessed the degradation of bacteria on plants, fruits and other foods using plasmas. In these processes, active oxidizing species such as OH, O<sub>2</sub>(1Δg) and O<sub>3</sub> together with UV light at wavelengths ranging between 200 and 400 nm emitted from excited nitrogen and nitric oxide molecules are considered to be the key factors providing a sterilization effect.</p><p id="Par191">Iseki et al.

Although Ar was used as the carrier gas, the spores were irradiated with ROS and UV light due to air entrainment. The active species that were effective in inactivating mold spores were investigated by irradiating the spores independently using an ozonizer. During these trials, the density of ozone was measured using UV absorption spectroscopy. The inactivation of a fungus was found to be significantly affected by the distance between the plasma and the fungus.

The effect of UV light was ascertained by irradiating the spores with a quartz glass plate on top of the specimen. This trial gave <italic>D</italic> values of 26.2 and 3.8 min with and without the plate, respectively. These results indicated the presence of an active species with a degree of inertness two orders of magnitude higher than that of ozone, and that oxygen radicals were an important ROS that contributed to the inactivation of mold. The mechanism by which P. digitatum spores were inactivated was studied by Iseki et al.

This apparatus generated only atomic oxygen (O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>)) and excited molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>D<sub>g</sub>)) by removing charged particles and light from an atmospheric-pressure plasma using a mixture of Ar and oxygen gases. The densities of these species were also determined using VUVAS to allow a quantitative analysis of their behavior. The densities of the O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) and O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>D<sub>g</sub>) (which were both considered to be highly reactive oxidation species) as obtained using VUVAS at different distances from the radical source are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig70" ref-type="fig">70</xref> (Hashizume et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>).

Using an argon gas plasma at atmospheric pressure, the lifetime of the O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) was approximately 0.5 ms and the inactivation rate of spores was on the order of 10<sup>–17</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. In contrast, the lifetime of the O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>D<sub>g</sub>) was more than several tens of ms and the spore inactivation rate was less than 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Quantitative evaluation of the inactivation rate of neutral oxygen species indicated showed that O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) played an important role. Because the O<sub>3</sub> concentration was determined to be below the VUVAS detection limit of approximately 2.5 × 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>, it was evident that O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>D<sub>g</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> played only a minor role.

In this mechanism, O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) react with the cell walls and membranes of the spores such that low doses (approximately 2.1 × 10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>) of these radicals significantly inhibit spore function without causing pronounced changes in the ultrafine morphology. Intracellular organelles are also oxidized and degraded and most spores are inactivated at a dose of approximately 1.0 × 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>. Finally, at an O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) fluence of 2.3 × 10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, intracellular organelles (including all membrane structures) are completely degraded at high O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) doses above 1.0 × 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>. Since the associated D value was 1.8 min, spore function could be inhibited without causing serious ultrastructural changes as oxygen radicals interacted with the cell membranes.<fig id="Fig71"><label>Fig. 71</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images of cross sections of P. digitatum spores: <bold>a</bold> control spore and <bold>b</bold> – <bold>f</bold> spores treated with oxygen radicals for 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min, respectively.

Such studies have led to the development of the field of semiconductor plasma processing. In the case of the interactions between radicals generated from plasmas and P. digitatum spores, as discussed in the previous section, it is clear that oxygen radicals contributed to the inactivation. The critical difference between the interactions of radicals with living tissues and with semiconductor materials is that a large number of various radicals will already exist inside living organisms to maintain homeostasis. These radicals will interact with the active species generated by the plasma. In general, free radicals in vivo act to maintain redox homeostasis between donors and acceptors of electrons in living cells. These redox mechanisms are essential to balancing the reduced and oxidized states of cells during metabolic activities. As an example, the respiration of oxygen generates a large number of free radicals for the maintenance of life. Living organisms require enormous amounts of oxygen, which is converted into ROS, such as O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, HO, ClO<sup>−</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> by enzymes. Among these, O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and HO are short-lived species that can react chemically with lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates in the body, resulting in functional disorders. In particular, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (which is frequently generated in living organisms) generates harmful OH via the Fenton reaction. The reactions between naturally occurring radicals in living tissues and the radicals delivered from a plasma have not yet been fully elucidated, and new theories are being created to assess the interactions of these radicals inside and outside of cells. It should be noted that there is also an antioxidant defense system in the body that efficiently decomposes ROS to limit metabolic dysfunction. Based on this, we can gain insights into the mechanism by which mold spores are killed by oxygen radicals as described in the previous section. As an example, quinone (Q), which comprises two carbonyl groups on a cyclic organic compound, is an electron transfer carrier. The reduced semiquinone radical (QH<sup>−</sup>) and the semiquinone anion (Q<sup>−</sup>) radical are protected from oxidative stress by transformation to oxidized Q, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig72" ref-type="fig">72</xref>.<fig id="Fig72"><label>Fig. 72</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chemical scheme of the reaction related to the quinone (Q) structure by the oxidation stress</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig72_HTML.png" id="MO72"/></fig></p><p id="Par195">Ishikawa et al.

During these trials a drop of a P. digitatum spore suspension was placed on a quartz plate and dried. After this, the plate was transferred to a quartz glass tube and set inside the ESR cavity, which was connected to a plasma discharge zone by a quartz tube. Gaseous oxygen was passed through this tube at a pressure of 15 Pa, while microwaves were supplied to generate a plasma discharge. ESR measurements were performed under this low pressure and showed the formation of gaseous O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and O.

As discussed, the antioxidant defense system in living tissues works to maintain life through the interactions of various enzymes and metals with ROS. Electrons, reactive species (ROS and RNS), radiation, electric fields and shock waves generated by a plasma may act on these circuits and induce various oxidative stresses on the homeostasis of the organism. These effects could promote existing or novel reactions in the body. ROS are involved in strengthening cell walls via the cross-linking and lignification of structural proteins, peroxidation of lipids, and activation and induction of the expression of genes related to intracellular signaling pathways. In particular, the interactions of ROS with lipids (LH) are a peroxidation process and proceeds via a chain reaction in association with the generation of LOO*. Interestingly, as will be discussed later, the sensitivity to these ROS and other species and the associated mechanisms can greatly differ between different types of cells.<fig id="Fig74"><label>Fig. 74</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical schematic of the generation and disappearance of reactive oxygen species in a living organism.

In fact, it has been suggested that it is possible to control radical homeostasis in the body by inducing radicals in vivo through irradiation at various wavelengths. Therefore, controlling in vivo reactions by locally injecting radicals from a plasma may enable tuning of the regeneration and death of various tissues and selective reactions that take advantage of the differences in sensitivity of cell types.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Measurements of RONS and radiation in atmospheric-pressure plasmas and their effects on medical treatments</title><p id="Par199">In the case of an atmospheric-pressure plasma using pure Ar, ambient air diffuses into the plasma such that many different gas phase RONS are generated. That is, gas phase molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen from the air are excited and dissociated/ionized. Since collisions occur frequently under atmospheric pressure, species such as atomic radicals and metastable molecules are generated by recombination and other processes in the gas phase, and various RONS and ozone are produced. Eventually, O, N, NO and OH as well high-energy particles in the VUV region emitted from the plasma irradiate materials located downstream region of the plasma. Takeda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2017</xref>) determined the spatio-temporal distribution of these species and of VUV radiation using VUVAS, LIF and UV spectrometry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig75" ref-type="fig">75</xref>). The results showed that the absolute density of O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) decreased as the distance from the gas slit increased, along with the generation of O<sub>3</sub> due to self-recombination. In contrast, the absolute density of N(<sup>4</sup>Sº) was almost constant up to a distance of approximately 10 mm and increased above 12 mm. The VUV emission intensity was also found to decrease with increasing distance from the plasma head. The relative density of NO increased with increasing distance up to 10 mm, after which it plateaued, while the OH density decreased significantly from the exit of the plasma head and could only be observed up to a distance of 5 mm. The proportions of the reactive species produced by the plasma varied as a function of distance from the main discharge region. This distance is a very important parameter, and control of the plasma jet reaction in the treatment of biological samples requires maintaining an optimal distance between the plasma and the biological body based on experimental data. Direct irradiation with these radicals and ions has been reported to have hemostatic and therapeutic effects on skin cancer in vivo. Furthermore, these species are also effective in promoting plant growth.<fig id="Fig75"><label>Fig. 75</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Relative densities of NO and OH, absolute densities of N (<sup>4</sup>S<sup>o</sup>) and O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub>) and VUV emission intensity at 174.3 nm due to N as a function of distance from the plasma head gas slit (Takeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2017</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig75_HTML.png" id="MO75"/></fig></p><p id="Par200">Hemostasis during surgical procedures has to date been achieved by heat using a radiofrequency coagulator, which has raised concerns about localized burns and post-operative damage. Ikehara et al.

Takeda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2019</xref>) systematically evaluated electrical parameters (voltage and current to the target), plasma parameters (gas temperature and electron density, determined by emission spectroscopy), O density in the gas phase, and OH in the liquid phase in the experimental conditions of hemostasis performed by Ikehara et al. Consequently, Miyamoto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2016</xref>) clarified the mechanism of erythrocyte coagulation by hemolysis, which is different from thrombus formation by plasma treatment. A series of histological and electron microscopic analyses and plasma current measurements revealed that erythrocyte coagulation is caused by the action of hemolytic proteins. In phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing human hemoglobin, aggregation-like clotting occurred 10 s after initial contact with the plasma flare. This suggests that hemolysis is an important step in the coagulation of red blood cells. Furthermore, reducing the current through a target contacting the plasma flare resulted in effective hemolysis and loss of red blood cells. These results indicate that, during plasma hemostasis, the injected current (that is, the number of charged particles) is more closely related to the efficiency of hemolysis than the interaction between radicals from the plasma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig76" ref-type="fig">76</xref>).<fig id="Fig76"><label>Fig. 76</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustration of plasma-induced blood coagulations.

Meanwhile, the plasma treatment has been considered to promote platelet aggregation and coagulation cascades to form whole-blood clots without hemolysis. These results indicate that clot formations with plasma treatments can be classified into two types, namely, classical (without hemolysis) and alternative (with hemolysis). It is noteworthy that increased plasma current correlated with hemolysis and the ability of serum proteins, such as albumin to aggregate (Miyamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2016</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig76_HTML.png" id="MO76"/></fig></p><p id="Par201">In an experiment using a melanoma model mouse, Mizuno et al.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2013</xref>) discovered that, by irradiating a cell culture media with plasma and injecting the activated media into cancer cells and tissues, cancer cells could be killed with higher selectivity than normal cells. This research indicated that cancer cells could be selectively destroyed not by the physical effects of the electric field and charged particles from the plasma, but by the chemicals produced by the interaction between the plasma and the liquid, since the plasma was not directly applied to the living tissue. Thus, by controlling the radicals generated in the plasma, it is possible to synthesize extracellular radicals and active species that induce various biological reactions in the liquid. The active liquid synthesized by plasma irradiation was found to not only selectively kill cancer cells but also to promote plant growth. These results were very unexpected and led to the creation of a new field of study based on indirect irradiation as opposed to the direct application of plasma to living organisms.

In addition, the activities of RAS–MAPK and PI3K–Akt signaling pathways, which are homeostatically activated as signaling mechanisms for survival and amplification, were decreased in brain tumors. These results suggested that PAM induces apoptosis by suppressing the survival and proliferation signaling network, which is an intracellular molecular mechanism.</p><p id="Par214">Comprehensive gene expression analyses by microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that PAM promotes apoptosis in cultured brain tumor cells in response to oxidative stress stimulation of GADD45a, GADD45b, c-JUN and ATF3 genes, which constitute a transcription factor referred to as the AP-1 complex. These genes are involved in the GADD45 signaling pathway that leads to apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par215">Adachi et al.

Their work found that PAM induces apoptosis by a spiral cascade involving the mitochondrial–nuclear network, and that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its ROSs disrupt the mitochondrial–nuclear network by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), reducing the expression ratio of Bcl2/Bax, activating PARP-1, releasing AIF and depleting NAD<sup>+</sup>. These changes are accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress. It was concluded that the accumulation of ADPR and extracellular/intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced in the above reactions activates TRPM2, causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the extracellular space and release from intracellular stores, resulting in cell death.</p><p id="Par216">Despite such prior work, the specific active species in PAM are still not well understood. In fact, approximately 30 different compounds have been identified in PAM, and the examination of the active species that are primarily responsible for the selective death of cancer cells is ongoing. It has been shown that plasma-activated Ringer's lactate solution (PAL), an intravenous infusion containing only four components, has selective anti-tumor and apoptosis-inducing effects on cell culture media containing many components that are similar to PAM (Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2016</xref>). PAL is a simple, biocompatible solution that is expected to assist in elucidating the associated reaction mechanisms together with the in vivo studies (Sato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par217">Recently, two groundbreaking research studies concerning PAL have been reported. Jiang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>) found that PAL specifically kills malignant mesothelial cells, and established the details of the intracellular molecular mechanism by metabolomic analysis. In the initial mechanism, malignant mesothelial cells initiate autophagy and attempt to adopt to PAL, but an increase in NO in the lysosomes leads to an explosive increase in intracellular lipid oxidation. This effect, in turn, results in a specific iron-dependent necrotic pathway known as ferroptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig81" ref-type="fig">81</xref>). Although the reaction mechanism is expected to be different depending on the type of cell, it has already been reported that the extent of intracellular oxidation associated with PAL is lower than that obtained with PAM, and that the intracellular mechanism is also very different (Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2019</xref>). The discovery that PAL induces the generation of NO radicals in living cells is of significant interest as this demonstrates the radical control process in vivo.<fig id="Fig81"><label>Fig. 81</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Role of NO in PAL-induced ferroptosis in MM cells. PAL provides MM cells with an immediate impact of exogenous NO, a component of PAL. The initial stimulation of NO activates transcription factor NF-κB in MM cells, upregulating the downstream iNOS as revealed by metabolome analysis. In return, this positive feedback loop leads to sustained accumulation of NO in lysosomes. Simultaneously, NO accumulation in lysosomes starts autophagic process, eventually resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) upon certain threshold according with increase in lysosomal lipid peroxidation. The whole process eventually leads to ferroptosis. <bold>b</bold> Molecular switch from autophagy to ferroptosis in MM cells. In the absence of PAL stress, mTOR binds to p-TFEB, which keeps the autophagy event in a physiological level. Under PAL exposure, MM cells, by responding to exogenous reactive species, start autophagic processes, initialized by translocation of TFEB into the nucleus and the subsequent upregulation of p62 transcription. During this early event, autophagy serves as a survival mechanism and the following p62-Keap1–Nrf2 axis-mediated antioxidant response would keep the balance of ROS for a period of time. However, sustained accumulation of NO-derived oxidants mediated lipid peroxidation, and lysosomal dysfunction eventually results in ferroptosis, when autophagic process is terminated. The molecular switching of cell fate from autophagy for survival to ferroptosis occurs when autophagic proteins, such as p62, are downregulated as a consequence of accumulated lipid peroxidation in lysosomes (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2021</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig81_HTML.png" id="MO81"/></fig></p><p id="Par218">In an additional study, Nakamura et al.

As an example, the rapid synthesis of nanographene using a plasma in alcohols has been reported (Hagino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>). In this work, the ultrafast production of highly crystalline nanographene was realized using an ethanol-based in-liquid nonequilibrium micro-hollow atmospheric-pressure plasma having an extremely high electron density. The synthesis rates for carbon materials were 0.61 mg/min when using ethanol in this process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig82" ref-type="fig">82</xref>), and the multilayer nanographene structures that were obtained had an interlayer spacing of 0.33 nm corresponding to that of the (002) planes in graphite. The G-, D-, D'- and 2D-band peaks in the Raman spectrum of the product also confirmed the formation of nanographene. In contrast, a rate of 1.72 mg/min was obtained using butanol but the quality of the product was degraded. The mechanism by which the gradual growth of six-membered ring structures occurred was determined by gas chromatographic analyses of a filtrate and the combination of this plasma with ethanol was found to produce 2,3-butanediol, phenylethylene, indene, naphthalene and biphenylene during the in-liquid plasma discharge. Six-membered ring structures were gradually formed via the elimination and dehydration reactions of organic radicals.<fig id="Fig82"><label>Fig. 82</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of experimental apparatus and <bold>b</bold> synthesis rate of carbon materials using an in-liquid plasma with butanol or ethanol (Hagino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_84_Fig82_HTML.png" id="MO82"/></fig></p><p id="Par221">This research assessed the effects of various alcohols and hydrocarbon solutions on the synthesis rate and nanographene crystallinity. As the number of carbons in the raw material increased, the synthesis speed also increased although the quality of the graphene was decreased (Ando et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>), as predicted by Hagino et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>). This effect resulted from the formation of various radicals as a consequence of the interactions between the plasma and the raw liquid, resulting in decomposition and/or polymerization reactions together with the formation of nanographene having six-membered rings. It should be noted that carbon-based materials could not be obtained using methanol as the liquid phase. The reactions in this liquid system were based on the generation of hydroxyl groups or O and CH<sub>2</sub>OH from the methanol, all of which promoted oxidation reactions. Eventually, these radical-induced oxidation reactions decomposed any unstable organic compounds and so did not contribute to the formation of six-membrane ring structures.</p><p id="Par222">The radical species appearing in various alcohol/water mixtures when using this atmospheric-pressure plasma were monitored using an ESR spin-trapping technique, employing 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzene sulfonate as the water-soluble trapping compound. Uchiyama et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2018</xref>) reported the associated reaction mechanism on the basis of these data. The major radical species were formed by H abstraction from alcohol molecules as a result of the OH produced from the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the case of the ethanol/water mixture, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH produced by H abstraction from ethanol and CH<sub>3</sub> radicals were detected. The latter resulted from the decomposition of unstable CH<sub>3</sub>•CHOH radicals to form CH<sub>3</sub> and formaldehyde (HCHO) via C–C bond fission, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig83" ref-type="fig">83</xref>. This generation of CH<sub>3</sub> was only observed in ethanol/water mixtures because of reactions between abundant OH and alcohol molecules and may have served as a precursor to the formation of six-membrane ring structures.

The complex processing characteristics obtained using plasmas in device manufacturing include the distortion of fine patterns due to electron shading effects, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) lag and microloading. These phenomena can cause differences in etching rates depending on the pattern dimensions, the extent of plasma-induced damage and the pattern edge roughness that transfers the resolution and molecular weight distribution of resist polymers in the lithography process to the material during etching. The transport of radicals during the formation of a HAR deep pore geometric pattern can be represented by Knudsen transport. In this model, thermally excited incoming radicals randomly enter the upper inlet of the HAR geometry and are transported to the bottom of the pore via Knudsen transport. The attachment of these radicals to the sidewalls determines the flux of radicals to the bottom of the HAR, and analyses of the bulk or surface diffusion of the adhering radicals should take into account the microscopic-scale solid surface reactions of the radicals. In particular, when ions are obliquely incident on the sidewalls, cross-reactions of ions and radicals can occur such that the attachment and surface reactions at both the sidewalls and the base of the pattern are affected by the density, energy and chemical reactivity of the ions. Therefore, the reactions at the sidewalls of the HAR geometry pores are very complex. The flux of radicals transported to the bottom will be higher if the attachment of radicals at the sidewalls is reduced.<fig id="Fig86"><label>Fig. 86</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Etching rates are influenced by transport of ions and neutrals inside HAR features.

Basic data regarding the reproducibility of radical reactions inside the HAR geometry is presently being accumulated. One etching method that deals with these issues related to complexity is atomic layer etching (ALE)/atomic layer deposition (ALD). As indicated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig87" ref-type="fig">87</xref> (Kanarik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>), in such processes, conformal atomic layers are deposited in a 3D manner and are then irradiated with ions or other directional particles. Etching does not progress after the atomic etching reaction layer has been consumed, and so layer-by-layer etching (that is, digital etching) is possible. In these systems, only the bottom surface of the HAR is irradiated with fast, high-energy ions and etching is performed sequentially in a time-varying manner due to the mutual reactions between radicals and ions. Naturally, the etching time is slower but this technique solves many of the problems of conventional etching and can produce highly accurate shapes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig88" ref-type="fig">88</xref>) (Ishikawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>).<fig id="Fig87"><label>Fig. 87</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of ALE <bold>a</bold> generic concept, <bold>b</bold> for the silicon case study, and <bold>c</bold> in comparison to ALD.

To control the radical-induced non-equilibrium physicochemical reaction fields of low-temperature plasmas, in situ observations and visualizations of the reaction fields are necessary. In the case of semiconductor manufacturing, the target size is shrinking toward 1 nm and so means of performing observations at the atomic level are needed. As an example, the interactions between radicals and materials have been observed using transmission electron microscope (TEM). Recently, 2D nanosheets have attracted attention as new materials for the fabrication of electronic and optical devices. Graphene, a typical sheet-like material, exhibits specific properties depending on the number of layers, and so controlling the number of layers is the key to exploiting the properties of this material, such as its bandgap, optical characteristics and carrier mobility. Plasma processes have been adapted for this purpose although, considering the potential damage caused by charged particles in the plasma, functionalization by layer-by-layer etching and surface modification using radical-controlled processes is necessary. To understand the radical etching of such materials, it is necessary to observe the process in situ and study the etching mechanism.</p><p id="Par230">In situ TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) have allowed physicochemical observations of the boundary reactions between gases and liquids.

In this image, the center shows the face of the graphene, while the right-hand side shows the edge of the sample, and a portion of the thick graphene is visible in the upper left.

EELS spectra were acquired from the dotted circular region of the TEM image and a plasmon loss peak was observed in the low-loss region, and decreased in intensity with increasing irradiation time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig90" ref-type="fig">90</xref>a).

As indicated in the figure, hydrogen radicals etched the organic film, while nitrogen radicals simultaneously nitrided the surface, resulting in the formation of a CN layer. Both etching and surface modification proceeded from the sidewalls of the pattern until the organic film on the sidewalls was thinned and eventually completely transformed into a CN layer.

As an example, during the atomic layer etching of polymeric materials using O, the oxidation of the polymer by these radicals must initially be self-organized. This means that the interactive reactions between the O and the polymer modify the surface such that it is saturated with O and that the underlying surface must not be volatilized. The surface of the modified layer must then be removed by a subsequent exposure to low-energy ions such that only the modified layer is removed on the atomic scale. Simulations of the interactions between O and polymer surfaces have been performed based on first principles to gain additional insights into this process.</p><p id="Par234">Fukunaga et al.

The plasma-induced radicals formed on a variety of conventional polymers were analyzed using ESR with the aid of systematic computer simulations. Diffusion-controlled matrix devices are currently among the most widely used DDSs, because the release rate can be determined by the pore size of the matrix structure.

For example, as reported by Coburn and Winters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1979</xref>), the reaction between a combination of XeF<sub>2</sub> and Ar ions on a Si surface increases the Si etching rate more dramatically than XeF<sub>2</sub> or Ar alone. This is because the kinetic energy of the Ar ions allows the radicals to contribute to the physicochemical reaction as a detonator. On the other hand, when an Al surface is irradiated with a combination of F<sub>2</sub> and Ar ions, the reaction between these ions causes the Al etching rate to be lower than that using F<sub>2</sub> or Ar ions alone. This suggests that the radical species act as a detonator to inhibit etching. It has also been found that irradiating a Si surface with both XeF<sub>2</sub> and electrons increases the etching rate compared to that using XeF<sub>2</sub> alone, suggesting that the radical reaction can be promoted by excitation by electrons.</p><p id="Par243">Moon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>) developed a combinatorial plasma process for obtaining a large amount of data in a single trial. They evaluated the contribution of the interaction between fluorocarbon radicals and VUV light, and between fluorocarbon radicals and ions, to the SiO<sub>2</sub> etching rate using fluorocarbon gas plasma. Their results showed that the use of VUV light is only a few percent more effective than ions in the etching process. In these reactions, the kinetic energy imparted by the ions to the solid surface plays a major role in the synergistic reaction with the radicals.</p><p id="Par244">Although the etching reaction is accelerated in proportion to the energy of the ions, the ion penetration depth is only a few nanometers, but the plasma-induced damage layer is much thicker. Minami et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2011</xref>) investigated the damage caused by Cl<sub>2</sub>/SiCl<sub>4</sub>/Ar plasma etching of GaN/InGaN single quantum well structures and found that whereas physical damage is restricted to within 2 nm from the surface, UV damage extends to depths of more than 60 nm, indicating that the synergistic effects of ions and light increase the damage. Surprisingly, it has also been reported that irradiation of Sb-doped Ge with Ar or CF<sub>4</sub> plasma broadens the depth distribution of defects associated with electron trapping by Sb, reaching depths of up to 3 µm (Kusumandari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2013</xref>). The depth effects caused by interaction of radicals with electrons, ions and light in such plasma processes, as well as the microscopic effects of the interaction of plasma with solids, are of great importance not only from a scientific point of view but also in the manufacture of semiconductor devices.</p><p id="Par245">On the other hand, the interaction of radicals with electrons, ions and light during plasma irradiation of liquids and living organisms is even more complex, and represents an entirely new scientific field. In these radical reactions, as described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, the most important concept is to identify the radicals that are effective in semiconductor and biological reactions from among the diverse range of radicals, and to categorize them using their substantial effects as indicators. For example, in semiconductor plasma processes, substantial effects are represented by Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ10" ref-type="disp-formula">2.10</xref>) and (<xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="disp-formula">2.11</xref>) as the loss probability of radical. In the field of plasma medicine, Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>) focused on RONS, which are known to have an effect on living organisms, and defined the equivalent total oxidation potential (ETOP) as the plasma dose, to provide insights into the effect of plasma on living organisms.</p><p id="Par246">In liquid and biological reactions caused by plasma irradiation, the effects can extend over ranges of several millimeters. On the other hand, radicals are generally not transported over long distances, as they instantly form new reactants or react with biological materials and are deactivated. The basic equation describing the behavior of radicals [Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">2.1</xref>)] involves a balance between creation and annihilation. Basically radical reactions do not extend to a few micrometres in liquid. In biological applications of plasma, a distinction needs to be made between radicals and RONS: the latter include radicals, such as O<sup>−</sup>, OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, eroxyl RO<sub>2</sub>, alkoxyl RO, CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, while others are H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, ROOH, ONOO<sup>−</sup>, ONOOH, HNO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ROONO and so on as non-radical species (Graves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). In liquids and living organisms, OH and other radicals generated from plasma recombine to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as non-radicals and disappear instantly, as shown in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ42" ref-type="disp-formula">9.4</xref>). However, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also affects the organism, for example by inducing oxidative stress. In other words, even if the radicals are deactivated, their effect continues through a chain reaction of RONS, and the reactive species generated may affect biological reactions at a distance. In addition, radicals such as NO are produced by enzymes in vivo and affect biological reactions. It is, therefore, very interesting to note that in vivo, quite unlike the mutual reaction between radicals and solids in semiconductors, a mechanism occurs in which the annihilation of radicals and the generation of RONS occurs continuously and causes long-range effects in organisms. It is hoped that these radical generation and deactivation schemes will be used in the future as a basis for a unified scientific understanding of semiconductor plasma processes and plasma bioprocesses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par247">Apart from dark matter and dark energy, the existence of which has yet to be identified, 99.9% of the universe is in a plasma state, and it is proposed that plasma processing will continue to be a technological driving force on Earth. Radicals play the most important role in plasma processing, and because radicals are electrically neutral, it has thus far been very difficult to gain insight into their behavior. However, with the ongoing accumulation of data concerning the gas phase and solid surface reactions of radicals based on spectroscopy, modeling of the reactions of various radical species in complex plasma processes has progressed. Even so, the reactions of radicals generated from plasmas with inorganic and organic solutions have produced many unexplained phenomena, and the study of these processes has developed into a new academic field. In particular, the behavior of short-lived radicals generated in solution as a consequence of the reactions of plasma-induced radicals has attracted attention in the field of electrochemistry. Elucidating the electrochemical effects of these radicals is expected to lead to the development of new material processes, systems for the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>, novel conversion and cleaning technologies, and new research into radical electrochemistry. During the redox reactions that occur in living organisms, radicals are constantly generated and annihilated, and studies of the reactions between gas and liquid phase plasma radicals, ions, radiation and cells comprise the field of plasma biotechnology that is expected to impact medical and agricultural research. The effects of plasma-induced radicals generated external to cells or organisms on the radical reactions that maintain life is also an unexplored avenue of study. It is evident that the control of radical behavior could lead to breakthroughs in the areas of plasmas, materials and devices, environmental remediation, and the pharmaceutical and biological sciences. Ultimately, such research is expected to produce new scientific theories, while the ongoing development of radical-controlled plasma processes will contribute to future technological progress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author thanks Professor Hiromasa Tanaka (Center for Low-temperature Plasma Sciences, Nagoya University) for his assistance.
