The scenarios consider different technology assumptions on the availability of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and end-use efficiencies featuring electrification under a wide range of carbon price trajectories, which start at 1–690 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030, increase at 4.5%/year, and level off in 2100. This scenario design allows close examination of energy, economic, and environmental implications of different levels of policy stringency and carbon budgets. While improving end-use efficiencies consistently decrease policy costs for a wide range of carbon budgets, the value of BECCS availability in terms of cost reduction is crucial only in a limited range toward lower budgets. Constraints on BECCS, including those indirectly imposed by the limited bioenergy supply, also tend to narrow the lower range of attainable budget levels, indicating technological and economic challenges, although they may have an impact on reducing the total budget including land-use emissions. Overall, the advanced end-use efficiency has a significant effect on the required level of policy stringency for a given climate goal, so that it can compensate for the biomass constraints.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BET-GLUE</kwd><kwd>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage</kwd><kwd>Advanced end-use

of advanced end-use technologies (AETs) in long-term climate mitigation by using an integrated assessment model (IAM), named BET (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>), as one of the specific studies conducted in the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum’s 33rd model comparison exercise (EMF-33, Bauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). The EMF-33 deals with various issues of large-scale global bioenergy deployment for achieving climate policy objectives, including assumptions on biomass feedstock supply and bioenergy technologies availability and interactions with land-use and food production sectors. BET is one of the 11 participant models and categorized into a multi-regional, inter-temporal general equilibrium model with a detailed energy system and an aggregated representation of the macroeconomy that follows the approach of optimal economic growth. Differently from other types of IAMs, this model explicitly handles energy service demand and end-use technologies in a global macroeconomic framework. This structure allows a systematic approach to examine trade-offs between advanced bioenergy technologies (ABTs) and end-use efficiencies from long-term scenarios across different dimensions of mitigation policies and technologies. The AET is defined here as modern end-use equipment that leads to a significant increase in energy efficiency.</p><p id="Par3">It has been widely recognized that efficiency and relevant electrification have a key role in reducing the use of energy and fostering large-scale decarbonization both in the short and in the long term (Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). This is confirmed by recent trends, which include a growing end-use electrification expansion and energy efficiency improvements (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>). These transitions have been explored by IAMs from a broad perspective (e.g., Kriegler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>; Krey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>; Sugiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>; Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>), as well as focusing on specific sectors (e.g., Kermeli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>; Guneralp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>; Edelenbosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>; Mittal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). More recently, a possibility of unprecedented energy efficiency improvements has been presented in achieving very ambitious climate policy goals (Grubler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">While energy efficiency improvements by advanced technologies are one of the most fundamental strategies for climate change mitigation, ABTs that produce low-carbon energy and enable negative net emissions (van Vuuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Edmonds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>), such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), have also been getting more attention for their crucial role in attaining ambitious mitigation goals (Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). Typically, past studies have dealt with these two strategies separately using an aggregate indicator; on the one hand, improvements in AETs have been analyzed in a way varying the overall improvements of final energy intensity, whereas on the other hand ABTs have been varied as part of a broader sensitivity regarding carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the two strategies are of the nature that should complement each other, and it is necessary to clarify what end-use energy efficiency improvements could contribute to energy sector emissions reductions in combination with large-scale bioenergy deployment.</p><p id="Par5">The present work is based on a previous study of ours (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>) that addressed the role of end-use technologies and found that electrification with AETs is a robust strategy for achieving stringent climate policy objectives with less economic impact. We will build off this work by evaluating the interlinkage between primary bioenergy and energy end-use within the EMF-33 framework. Our study is motivated by the need to understand general interlinkage between different technologies for expanding low-carbon energy supply and associated demand-side electrification while reducing the overall energy demand. While the current scope takes an important step forward, it is not exhaustive and future work should explore other critical aspects, such as variable renewables and electricity storage in the context of modern demand-side flexibility.</p><p id="Par6">To investigate key issues relevant to large-scale bioenergy deployment, the EMF-33 has designed a variety of scenario experiments into two phases: biomass supply and bioenergy demand. We use the latter demand scenarios, consisting of the combination of different levels of policy stringency for climate mitigation and different constraints on ABTs. Besides these, we have built a number of additional scenarios including the AET dimension over a wide range of policy stringency levels. Sections <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> and <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> describe the model and scenario experiments, Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> presents and discusses the results, and finally, Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">5</xref> provides concluding remarks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par7">BET includes energy supply, energy end-use, and macroeconomic modules. The model divides the world into 13 regions and solves the economic equilibrium problem by applying inter-temporal optimization methods by 10-year steps on the domain 2010–2230. Here, results are shown at the global level over the period 2010–2100. The model basically follows the MARKAL-MACRO formulation (Loulou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>) for the macroeconomic production function and the structure of the energy supply module from primary to final energy. The end-use module represents end-use technologies, that is, the conversion from final energy to energy services. Service demands are used as energy inputs to the production function and then endogenously determined. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the categories of energy services and the corresponding end-use technologies, which are substitutable within the same service category. The energy supply module includes mining of fossil fuels, fuel conversion, and power generation. The details including basic scenarios and model parameters, such as costs and efficiencies in the energy system, are described in the Electronic Supplemental Material (ESM) (sections 1–3, Figs. ESM.<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.5</xref> and Tables ESM.<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.12</xref>). The components of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases and the interaction between energy system and climate are not considered in the present study.

GLUE is also employed to quantify land-use CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through the calculation of the changes in carbon stocks in soil, above- and below-ground biomass, and woods for industrial use.</p><p id="Par9">GLUE provides potential supplies for 18 types of primary biomass, and BET aggregates them through an exogenous 5-step supply function into four categories: (1) energy crops, such as switchgrass in temperate latitudes and eucalyptus in the tropics (only second-generation crops are considered, excluding first generation), (2) fuelwood from forestry whole logs, (3) wet residues from food biomass including animal dung and human wastes, and (4) residues from food biomass in dry form and woody biomass discharged from industrial material recycling. The secondary energy converted from these feedstocks can be of four types: (1) 100% bio-electricity by conventional power generation, (2) biogas by high-temperature gasification or methane digestion, (3) liquid biofuel by fermentation, and (4) solid biomass.

The standard budgets are defined as 1600, 1000, and 400 GtCO<sub>2</sub> of 2011–2100 FFI emissions, referred to as high, low, and very low budgets, respectively; the latter two are supposed to be consistent with the 2 and 1.5 °C goals (i.e., the limit of the global-mean temperature increase relative to the preindustrial level). The budget constraint is implemented so that it allows overshooting until 2090, hits a specific limit at 2100, and keeps the budget not to exceed the limit later.

To ensure consistency with the EMF-33 protocol, the tax becomes effective in 2030, and the emissions in 2020 are constrained as in the budget scenarios. The initial tax in 2030 encompasses a wide range (1–690 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub>), followed by a trajectory with a common shape that is consistent with the CO<sub>2</sub> budget constraint. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and discussed in the next section, this tax trajectory is designed such that it increases at a fixed annual rate of 4.5% until 2070 and remains constant after a transition period of 30 years, in which the increase rate declines linearly to zero in 2100. The intervals of the initial tax levels are set to be small enough to appropriately interpolate resulting scenarios at a specific budget size to examine how the carbon prices are adjusted to comply with the budget when the ABT and/or AET are varied.

The bioenergy supply limit generally acts on the ABTs limitations in deep mitigation scenarios, and BECCS is effectively the only option for ABTs in the model. Thus, the constraints on the bioenergy supply and BECCS availability are both categorized into the same ABT dimension. There are two options for the AET dimension: activating (model default) and inactivating a set of high-efficiency end-use technologies, including industrial induction heaters, heat pump water heaters in industry and building sectors, hybrid trucks, and electric vehicles, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The price in each scenario increases exponentially before declining in 2100. The annual growth rate is approximately constant at about 4.5% regardless of the budget size.

The growth rate of 4.5% is close to the long-term interest rate defined as the sum of the social discount rate and the growth rate of reference GDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.3</xref>). The carbon prices discontinuously drop in 2100, which also results from the optimization where the budget constraint is imposed in 2100 and thereafter. Similar discontinuous drops were found in a stabilization scenario in terms of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Weyant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>). One implication is that a stringent budget constraint at an assumed target year greatly affects the budget overshooting, as discussed in Obersteiner et al.

In the full-technology series (B:Full/E:On), an increase in the tax needed to save 600 GtCO<sub>2</sub> approximately doubles from the high-to-low budget to the low-to-very low budget. A similar nonlinear tendency has been found in the diagnostic study by Kriegler et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). They have derived a convex-shaped marginal abatement cost curve from only two data points with different initial carbon taxes. The multiple data points in the present study build smooth curves, which enable a more detailed quantitative analysis. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the imposed tax scaling and the resulting cumulative emissions for a given set of technology constraints, we can discuss the results in the following in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> budgets for 2011–2100 cumulative emissions and carbon prices referred to as the tax values in 2030.</p><p id="Par25">Although the budget size can be reduced to those around the very low level (400 GtCO<sub>2</sub>) within the range of tax scaling considered here, the policy stringency becomes extreme in such deep mitigation. When the ABT constraint is imposed and becomes severe, the price increase becomes steeper, implying that severe ABT constraints render low CO<sub>2</sub> budgets unattainable from technological and economic concerns. This result is viewed as a horizontal shift of the price-budget curve, as found in Azar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>) and Luderer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). The series without the AET (E:Off) basically follow the corresponding series with the AET (E:On) but are altered so that the price consistently increases. Different from the ABT impact, the AET impact is viewed as a vertical shift of the curve. Thus, the ABT has implications for attainable low carbon scenarios while the AET makes policy instruments less stringent without regard to the ABT constraints.</p><p id="Par26">No BECCS series (B:None) can attain the high budget level, but not the low level. Since electricity with BECCS is the only option to realize negative emissions in BET, the quantity of available bioenergy that can be allocated to BECCS, or BECCS potential, primarily determines the extent of the budget reduction. Note, however, that whether the model finds a computational solution without negative emissions depends on how to implement the policy constraints. In fact, BET fails to produce solutions without BECCS when the high budget constraint is directly imposed (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> in Bauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>), instead of indirectly by pricing, due to the difficulties in seeking solutions under net-zero emissions throughout the model period beyond 2100. Although this difference is a model feasibility matter, it has an indication of technological and economic challenges.</p><p id="Par27">Here, to discuss different emission results for the same level of policy stringency, we focus on a tax level of 200 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030 as an economic cut-off value for the carbon tax, indicated by the horizontal dash-dotted line in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, for a diagnostic purpose. This tax level corresponds to 4–5% of the cumulative GDP loss, shown in the next subsection. Within this level, the budget size can be reduced to 670, 910, 1180, and 1560 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, in the full technology (B:Full), weakly constrained (B:Lim2), strongly constrained (B:Lim1), and no BECCS (B:None) series with the AET. In the corresponding series without the AET, it can be reduced to 830, 1080, 1350, and 1710 GtCO<sub>2</sub>. Namely, the range of the attainable budgets across the ABT dimension with the AET—890 GtCO<sub>2</sub>—is comparable with that without the AET—880 GtCO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the differences between the attainable budgets with and without the AET—150 to 170 GtCO<sub>2</sub>—are also comparable across the ABT dimension. These results indicate that the effect of the AET on the budget size does not much depend on the ABT constraints.</p><p id="Par28">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> illustrates increases in carbon price due to the lack of the AET and due to the ABT constraints. These additional prices, quantifying sensitivities to each of AET and ABT, indicate that the AET sensitivity is greater than the ABT sensitivity as far as the steepness of the price-budget curve is moderate. At the budget sizes corresponding to the tax level of 200 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030, the AET sensitivity, indicated by the markers in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, is still dominant over the ABT sensitivity in the weakly and strongly constrained ABT series, or comparable with that in the no BECCS series. Increased tax levels are 52, 64, and 63 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub> at those specific budget sizes in the weakly constrained, strongly constrained, and no BECCS series, respectively. These numbers correspond to about 30% savings in the carbon price from the use of the AETs.</p><p id="Par29">Note that the numbers described here actually depend on the selected AETs and the corresponding efficiency assumptions, and therefore the findings from our scenario exercise entail these uncertainties. It is nevertheless implied that there is room for compensating bioenergy restrictions to a considerable extent by further improving end-use efficiencies.</p><p id="Par30">Besides the selection of AETs and their efficiency estimates, demand-side solutions essentially involve different disciplines, as proposed in Creutzig et al.

In this broader context, the approach of the current study, dealing with demand-side contributions and interaction with supply sectors, should involve other relevant aspects, such as transition theory and behavioral science, as well as bottom-up assessments from technological studies. Integrated assessment modeling that incorporates these aspects would provide further insight into the role of AETs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Impact on energy, economy, and land-use emissions</title><p id="Par31">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrates the changes in primary energy supply in 2050 and 2100 in the full-technology series over the same range of the CO<sub>2</sub> budget as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and the comparisons between the different series at the high, low, and very low budgets (right panels). In the middle of this century, the total primary energy decreases in response to suppressed final energy (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.6</xref>) as the budget decreases, while the biomass supply is almost stable at about 80–90 EJ/year. By contrast, at the end of the century, the decrease in the total primary energy occurs up to the high budget level, and further budget reduction leads to a rapid increase in BECCS, which in turn results in a slight increase in total primary energy. Since climate change mitigation is closely connected to increase in electrification and the decarbonization of electricity including the deployment of BECCS, the total electricity generation is rather stable over the budget range while the transition in electricity generation mix are similar to those in the primary energy mix (Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.8</xref>).

Compared with other EMF-33 models, BET tends to reallocate bioenergy to BECCS rather than to expand the total bioenergy in 2050 and to use less fossil fuels with CCS throughout this century (Bauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). The strong dependency on BECCS is also associated with a constraint on the share of variable renewable energy by solar and wind, which is set to 30% in terms of electricity generation in each region (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.7</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">The lack of AETs affects the energy system in two ways: on the one hand, it causes an increase in energy supply because of more energy input to produce the same level of energy services, but on the other hand, its macroeconomic impact can bring a decrease in the level of energy services (Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.9</xref>). As demonstrated in the previous study (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>), this compensation basically results in a net increase in total final energy, and thereby in higher total primary energy use.</p><p id="Par34">However, such an impact of AETs quantitatively differs across time and between budgets. In 2050, the increase is negligible at the high budget size, while it is 3–6% at the other budget sizes and the baseline. (See attached numbers in percentage beside the bar charts in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.) The AET impact in the high budget scenario becomes significant in 2100; in particular, total primary energy increases by more than 10% in the full-technology series and is associated with a relatively large deployment of BECCS (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.10</xref>). This exceptional behavior is attributable to the model’s delayed response to moderate mitigation policies. The share of bioenergy in the increased total primary energy also differs across time and between budgets. (See percentage numbers in parentheses in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.) While changes in the share are negligible in 2050, it shows relatively large increases in 2100 in the cases without the ABT constraints, at the high budget in particular, and in the case without BECCS. These tendencies imply that the AET reduces total primary energy consumption, and thereby help saving bioenergy resources depending on timing and the level of policy stringency.</p><p id="Par35">The reduction of the CO<sub>2</sub> budget and associated large-scale BECCS deployment affects the global economy and land-use change CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

This tendency is qualitatively similar to that found in the previous study (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>). Basically, the sensitivity in the policy cost is consistent with that in the carbon taxes in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. One notes, however, that increases in the policy costs with the budget reduction in the series of ABT constraints are not so extreme as those in the carbon prices, which makes the AET sensitivity relatively large. These sensitivities are mostly the same as those examined over the second half of this century, except for the magnitude (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.11</xref>). The policy costs due to the budget reduction and their inter-series differences over the latter period are approximately twice as large as those over the whole period.</p><p id="Par37">In terms of land CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the difference between the full and the constrained ABT series is highlighted. While changes in the land-use sector, in particular forest areas, are in line with the pricing in energy sectors, the large-scale deployment of bioenergy to reduce fossil fuel use induced by carbon pricing in turn leads to an increase in land CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, in the full ABT series, the cumulative amount of land CO<sub>2</sub> emissions monotonically increases with the reduction of the FFI CO<sub>2</sub> budget and exceeds 400 GtCO<sub>2</sub> at the very low budget, which means that land emissions are comparable with FFI emissions. By contrast, in the weakly constrained series, it peaks at about 230 GtCO<sub>2</sub> at a level around the high budget and turns to decline beyond that although the FFI budget does not reach the very low level.</p><p id="Par38">These different tendencies can be attributed to the biomass supply limit imposed in the constrained series, where the model suppresses the most CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive biomass resource (fuelwood in the case of BET) more effectively with the reduction of FFI CO<sub>2</sub> budget (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.10</xref>). Without such limitation, a stringent mitigation policy may become less effective due to a larger land-use contribution to the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">ESM.12</xref>). Although the model’s behavior is subject to uncertainties on relevant factors of land CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the result implies that pricing may bring about leakage effects from the energy to the land-use sector, depending on the ABTs availability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="Par39">We have investigated the role of AETs by considering the interlinkage between primary bioenergy and energy end-use, mainly featured by BECCS and end-use electrification, respectively. Multiple series of scenarios have been created using BET-GLUE with different assumptions for the ABTs and AETs and with many different levels of policy stringency by pricing as well as by carbon budgets. The series of price scenarios have been designed to be consistent with budget scenarios that impose constraints on cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from FFI at the end of this century.</p><p id="Par40">Policy stringency for climate mitigation is nonlinearly related to the CO<sub>2</sub> budget so that the reduction of the budget by an additional increase in carbon prices diminishes as the level of carbon prices increases. Although this finding is not a novelty, multiple series of nonlinear price-budget curves built on many data points provide a basis for a quantitative comparison of the model’s sensitivities to the ABT and AET assumptions. The model results highlight contrasting differences between the ABT and AET sensitivities: the carbon price reaches an extreme value at larger budgets with the ABT constraints while it consistently increases with the lack of the AETs. Therefore, the ABT is most responsible for reducing the budget and has implications for technological and economic challenges of low carbon-budget scenarios. Although the role of the AET is secondary in reducing the budget, its effect on the carbon price does not much depend on the budget size and is dominant over the ABT’s effect as far as the nonlinearity of the price-budget relationship is moderate. Overall, the AET has a significant effect on the required level of policy stringency for a given climate goal, so that it can compensate for the biomass constraints.</p><p id="Par41">In response to pricing for climate mitigation, the model generally tends to use more bioenergy and allocate it to BECCS toward the end of this century. In this respect, constraints on the ABTs affect the amount of bioenergy and its BECCS allocation, and the AETs reduce the total primary energy, thereby saving bioenergy. These three factors—policy, ABTs, and AETs—interact in the process of inter-temporal optimization, resulting in some distinct impact on energy system and land-use sector despite similarities between policy stringency and resulting policy costs. The role of the AET in reducing the total primary energy quantitatively differs across time and between budgets, which basically reflects the model’s overshooting nature depending on the ABT constraints. Regarding the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, pricing may bring about leakage effects from the energy to the land-use sector, which also depends on the ABT constraints.</p><p id="Par42">These findings would be made clearer by sensitivity experiments on selected AETs and assumed efficiencies as well as on the variation of final energy intensity. The share of variable renewables, which affects the degree of ABT dependence and is limited to 30% in this study, should be explored considering electricity storage technologies and demand-side flexibility. Comparing multiple IAMs with the methodology presented in this study would lead to more robust findings. Although the budget constraints involve some unnatural aspects, carefully designed price constraints for each IAM can provide alternative scenarios that are more suitable for model comparisons. Other issues emerging in the present study, such as allowable overshooting and dependency on the assumed target year, are worth being addressed for a deeper understanding.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the steering committee and the members of EMF-33, in particular Nico Bauer, for leading the work in the demand phase of the study and for the constructive comments on this paper.
