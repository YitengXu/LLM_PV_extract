Fast track protocol is applied on all patients. Target discharge after one-night stay. The primary end point length of stay (LOS) in hospital. The secondary end points frequency of hospital contact, readmission and reintervention within 30 days after surgery.</p><p id="Par13"><bold>Results</bold>: Primary (n=475); banded bypass (BRYGB, 78.1%), sleeve gastrectomy (10.9%), gastric band (5.1%), non-banded RYGB (3.8%), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (1.9%), BPD (0.2%). Mean age (±SD) 44.7 ±11.2 years and BMI mean (±SD) 43.7± 6.1kg/m2. Revision procedures (n=72); gastric band to adjustable BRYGB (41.7%) and to non-adjustable BRYGB (40.3%), Mason to BRYGB (11.1%), one-anastmosis bypass to BRYGB (1.4%), Sleeve to BRYGB (2.8%), sleeve to SADI (1.4%), band to sleeve (1.4%).

However, certain bariatric surgery related complications, such as internal herniation or symptomatic chole(cysto)lithiasis, may occur during the course of the pregnancy and might result in severe maternal and fetal morbidity or even mortality.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>Methods</bold>: An overview of all cases in the past five years of bariatric complications during pregnancy in our medical centre, which is both a centre of excellence for bariatric surgery as well as the tertiary referral centre for high risk pregnancies. Description of several illustrative cases with up-to-date and relevant literature on the topic and video clips of a laparoscopic correction of an internal herniation in a pregnant patient.</p><p id="Par27"><bold>Results</bold>: Approximately twenty cases of either internal herniation or symptomatic chole(cysto)lithiasis during pregnancy in patients with a history of bariatric surgery presented at our centre in the last five years. Whereas ultrasonography might aid the diagnosis in case of gallstones, in internal herniation negative imaging, preferably MRI without contrast, does not exclude the diagnosis and diagnosis should mainly rely upon clinical assessment. A delay in diagnosis, unnecessary imaging studies and suboptimal timing of possible surgical intervention should be avoided to prevent serious maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.</p><p id="Par28"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: In case of a pregnant patient with abdominal complaints and a history of bariatric surgery, one should always consider the possibility of late complications of bariatric surgery, besides obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment by a specialized multidisciplinary team – consisting of bariatric surgeons, perinatologists and neonatologists – are of the utmost importance for the safety of both mother and child.</p><p id="Par29"><bold>O-003</bold></p><p id="Par30"><bold>Trocar site hernia in bariatric surgery- an underestimated problem.

The incidence of trocar site hernias in bariatric surgery has been reported between 0.5 and 3%. However, the best available evidence comes from trials retrospectively analysing prospective databases, thus including only patients who have been operated for or have been highly symptomatic due to the trocar site hernia after a laparoscopic bariatric procedure. We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the incidence of trocar site hernia after minimal-invasive, multiportal bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Medline, Current Contents, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Cinahl, ClinicalTrial.gov, WHO ICTRP and the Web of Science Core Collection Index were searched up until September 2017. Search strategies included proper combinations of the MeSH terms ‘laparoscopy’, ‘bariatric surgery’, ‘trocar/port’ and ‘hernia’. Search was not limited by publication type and there were no restrictions on language. The review was registered in PROSPERO (ID 85102) and was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines.</p><p id="Par37"><bold>Results:</bold> The primary research identified 1669 records. Pearling of the references revealed 83 additional records. 192 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 68 were finally included. 61 were retrospective analyses, 5 prospective cohort studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Hernia incidence range was 0-39.3%. 17 trials reported systematic closure of the fascia and 4 trials no closure. Data availability did not allow pooling in order to calculate relative risk. Two trials were identified which systematically examined all operated patients for trocar associated hernias using sonography and CT-scan. The reported incidence was 15.4 % and 39.3 % respectively. In those trials only trocars bigger than 10mm were systematically closed.</p><p id="Par38"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Trocar site hernia is clearly an underestimated complication of minimal-invasive bariatric surgery. High-quality trials are not available to allow a precise calculation of the incidence. Furthermore, risk factors for developing a trocar site hernia in bariatric surgery have not been systematically analysed yet. Prospective studies on this field are necessary.</p><p id="Par39"><bold>O-004</bold></p><p id="Par40"><bold>Tailored Laparoscopic OAGB as an anti-diabetic procedure in BMI (30-35</bold></p><p id="Par41"><underline>Ahmed Elsobky</underline></p><p id="Par42">General surgery department, Ain Shams Univerisity, Cairo, Egypt</p><p id="Par43">ahmedelsobky90@gmail.com</p><p id="Par44"><bold>Background:</bold> Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become an epidemic health problem with significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health care resources. The medical therapy for T2DM still leaves many patients exposed to the complications of this disease. The American Diabetes Association stated that Bariatric surgery may be considered for adults with BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes, especially if the diabetes or associated co morbidities are difficult to control with lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tailored lap One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) in T2DM patients with BMI 30–35 kg/m2.</p><p id="Par45"><bold>Methods:</bold> The data of 450 patients who underwent tailored Lap OAGB from December 2012 to December 2015 at our hospital were reviewed. Mean age was 47 years, mean preoperative BMI was 32.9 kg/m2, mean preoperative weight was 91.7 ± 20.3 kg, 58% were women.Preoperative data including glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, 2 h postprandial glucose, c-peptide (fasting and postprandial) and lipid profile were compared with data collected at 1, 3, and 6, 12, 24, 36 postoperative months.</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Results:</bold> All procedures were completed laparoscopically.fter 3 years of tailored lap OAGB, 78% of patients stopped treatment, 11% of patients shifted to oral hypoglycemic or reduced the dose of oral hypoglycemic and 11% reduced the insulin dose.Excessive weight loss occured in 8 patients(1.7%),5 of them managed conservatively and 3 cases required conversion of the procedure.</p><p id="Par47"><bold>Conclusion:</bold>The tailored lap MGB leads to resolution of T2DM in 78% of patients with BMI (30-35)kg/m2, with reasonable accepted excess weight loss. The best results are obtained in patients with few years of diabetes, without or with short term use of insulin treatment, high C-peptide levels and higher preoperative weight.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par49">1.

However, this bariatric procedure is still controversial; suspected to result in undernutrition and at potential risks of biliary reflux leading possibly to esophageal or gastric cancer. Reducing the size of the biliopancreatic limb in this surgery could be essential to maintain positive outcomes and prevent side effects.</p><p id="Par73"><bold>Methods:</bold> Wistar rats were operated on OAGB with a short (15cm OAGB-15, n=13) or a long (35cm OAGB-35, n=13) biliopancreatic limb or sham surgery (n=8). Body weight and food intake were monitored weekly over 30 weeks and rats underwent oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests after 10 and 28 weeks. Macronutrient absorption was determined by fecal analyses. After sacrifice, histology was performed on formalin-fixed esophagus and gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Statistical analyses used non-parametric ANOVA tests.</p><p id="Par74"><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with sham rats, OAGB-15 and OAGB-35 rats reduced their food intake but only during the first 4 weeks. Fecal losses of calories were greater after MGB-35 than after MGB-15 or sham surgery but malabsorption tend to decrease overtime. Consequently, OAGB-35 rats displayed a significant reduced weight over 30 weeks whereas OAGB-15 rats cached up sham weight after 12 weeks. All OAGB-operated rats displayed an improved glucose tolerance and better insulin sensitivity compared to sham rats, these effects were independent of rat weight and maintained after 28 weeks.</p><p id="Par75"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In rats, a long biliopancreatic limb led to a major nutrient malabsorption. However glucose homeostasis was similarly improved in OAGB-15 and OAGB-35 rats suggesting that shorting the biliopancreatic limb can improve metabolic parameters without major influence on weight. The impact of biliopancreatic limb length on esophageal or gastric lesion in the long term is currently under investigation and will also be presented.</p><p id="Par76"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> We thank Chelsey Chachoute and Nicholas Nguyen for their experimental help.

Besides its excellent long-term outcome, BPD-DS can lead to severe diarrhea and micronutrient deficiencies in the long-term based on the malabsorptive character of the procedure. Therefore, the risk for secondary hyperparathyroidism due to malabsorption needs to be determined in this population.</p><p id="Par86"><bold>Setting:</bold> University Hospital, Switzerland.</p><p id="Par87"><bold>Methods:</bold> Data from all 246 patients undergoing BPD-DS between January 2001 and December 2011 were prospectively collected. Life-long micronutrient supplementation consisted according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) guidelines of a multivitamin-mineral supplementation on a daily base covering 200% of the daily value. It contained 2’000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and 2’400 mg of calcium.</p><p id="Par88"><bold>Results:</bold> Of all 246 patients, 195 (79.3%) had at least 5 years of follow-up. The majority of the procedures were laparoscopic. Almost all patients (168/195; 86.2%) underwent a concomitant cholecystectomy. Mean age and BMI were 42.8±9.2 years and 48.3±9.1kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Average follow-up time after BPD-DS was 85.8±35.9 months. Of 195 patients, 102 (52.3%) showed laboratory signs of a secondary hyperparathyroidism during the follow-up. Although vitamin D levels improved with increased vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in 2007, the rate of secondary hyperparathyroidism increased.</p><p id="Par89"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after BPD-DS. These rates suggest current supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of long-term hyperparathyroidism.</p><p id="Par90"><bold>O-007</bold></p><p id="Par91"><bold>The impact of bariatric surgery on gut microbiota, diabetes remission and metabolic profile of morbidly obese patients: a comprehensive meta-analysis</bold></p><p id="Par92"><underline>Dimitrios Magouliotis</underline><sup>1, 2, a)</sup>, Vasiliki Tasiopoulou<sup>1, 2, b)</sup>, Eleni Sioka<sup>1, 2, c)</sup>, Christina Chatedaki<sup>3, 2, d)</sup>, Alexis Svokos<sup>4, e)</sup>, Konstantina Svokos<sup>5, f)</sup>, George Tzovaras<sup>1, 2, g)</sup>, Dimitris Zacharoulis<sup>1, 2, h)</sup></p><p id="Par93"><sup>1)</sup>Department of General Surgery, University Hospital of Larissa, Larissa, Greece; <sup>2)</sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece; <sup>3)</sup>Department of Microbiology, University Hospital of Larissa, Larissa, Greece; <sup>4)</sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Riverside Regional Medical Center, Newport News, VA, United States</p><p id="Par94"><sup>5)</sup>Department of Neurosurgery, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, United States</p><p id="Par95"><sup>a)</sup>dmagouliotis@gmail.com</p><p id="Par96"><sup>b)</sup>vasilikitasiopoulou@gmail.com</p><p id="Par97"><sup>c)</sup>konstantinasioka@gmail.com</p><p id="Par98"><sup>d)</sup>chatechristina@yahoo.gr</p><p id="Par99"><sup>e)</sup>alexis.svokos@gmail.com</p><p id="Par100"><sup>f)</sup>konstantina.svokos@gmail.com</p><p id="Par101"><sup>g)</sup>geotzovaras@gmail.com</p><p id="Par102"><sup>h)</sup>zachadim@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par103"><bold>Background:</bold> Obesity is associated with insulin resistance (IR), glucose intolerance and alterations in various metabolic factors.

All operations were totally stapled. 20 first gastro-jejunosotomy were performed end to side by circular stapler 21mm, while the rest by linear stapler 60mm. in both methods the intestinal stapler fenestrations were closed by transverse stapled lines.

We present our outcomes of up to 20 years follow-up after Swedish adjustable gastric banding (SAGB).</p><p id="Par154"><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review of patients receiving SAGB between 1997 and 2002 at a bariatric surgery center in Bern, Switzerland. Patients with a minimum of 15 years of follow-up in the same center were included. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, revision surgery, and weight trends were analyzed.</p><p id="Par155"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 387 patients with SAGB were identified, of them 294 patients completed at least 15 years (mean 16.9, range 15-20) of follow-up (76.0%). There were 240 (81.6%) females and 54 (18.4%) males. Mean pre-operative age (years) was 40 in females and 41 in males. Mean pre-operative BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was 43.2 in females and 43.3 in males. Pre-operatively, 18 (6.1%) of patients had diabetes, 61 (20.7%) had hypertension, and 23 (7.8%) had dyslipidemia. There were no deaths nor major complications (bleeding, infection, re-operation) within 30 days. Within 15-20 years after SAGB, 239 (81.2%) of patients underwent revisional surgeries (median 3, range 1-4) either due to band-related complications (4.8%) or severe esophageal dilation with or without sufficient weight loss (95.2%). 193 (55.4%) of patients were converted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 9 (6.8%) to biliopancreatic diversion, 11 (3.7%) to duodenal switch, and 10 (3.4%) to sleeve gastrectomy. 15 (5.1%) patients received repeat SAGB, 3 (1.0%) had SAGB removal only, and 24 (8.2%) had no further intervention. There were no deaths after revisional surgery. At 19 years after SAGB, mean % excess BMI loss was 65.0% for all patients, 63.4% in patients converted to RYGB, and 80.4% in patients without further intervention (Figure 1).</p><p id="Par156"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Few patients have optimal outcomes after SAGB and predictive selection criteria are lacking. The vast majority of SAGB surgeries fail even with close structured follow-up. Conversions to other procedures can be done safely.</p><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figa_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig><p id="Par157"><bold>O-012</bold></p><p id="Par158"><bold>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?

Therefore, patients with insulin dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DMi) have increased risk for hypoglycemia. A standardized insulin reduction protocol, aiming to maintain blood glucose level (BGL) between 5 and 15 mmol/l, was developed and evaluated on safety and efficacy. At the day of surgery (D0), daily insulin dose reduced by 75% and long acting nighttime insulin was replaced by glimepiride, atministered at 20.00h. After discharge, the second after surgery (D2), glucose control was monitored by phone, until final consultation after three monts (M3).</p><p id="Par250"><bold>Methods:</bold> From D0 until M3, BGL outside the range of 5 to 15 mmol/l were analyzed. Also, the postoperative change in anti-diabetics and T2DM regulation was evaluated.</p><p id="Par251"><bold>Results:</bold> 154 patients were included. At D0, D2 and the first week after discharge 2%, 4% and 7% of all BGL-measurements were &lt;5 mmol/l, and 13%, 3% and 2% were &gt;15 mmol/l. Three patients had hypoglycemia (&lt;3.5 mmol/l) during admission and thirteen at home; none needed treatment. Mean preoperative insulin dose was 130±80 IU/day and decreased to 37±1.9 IU/day on D0. Insulin was discontinued permanently in 8% of the patients at D0, in 18% at discharge and in 82% during follow-up. At M3, insulin treated patients used 30±4.2 IU/day. 28% and 46% of the patients still used SU-derivate and metformin, respectively. Fasting BGL and HbA1c had decreased significantly, respectively from 11.3±0.29 to 8.4±0.24 mmol/l and from 70±1.4 to 54±1.0 mmol/l (P&lt;0.01). Largest reduction in anti-diabetics and improvement in glycemic control were observed in patients with lowest preoperative insulin doses.</p><p id="Par252"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Immediate insulin dose reduction of 75% with rapid response monitoring is safe and effective in the large majoriy of patients with T2DMi undergoing RYGB surgery.

Furthermore, people with BMI 30-35kg/m<sup>2</sup> with poor glycaemic control could also be assessed for bariatric surgery.<sup>1</sup> These guidelines were then further endorsed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Diabetes Surgery Summit.<sup>2</sup> However, the impact of these guidelines upon real-world clinical practice in the UK are unclear. Thus, we examined referral demographics and surgical procedure undertaken.</p><p id="Par261"><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective observational study of patients with obesity and T2D undergoing primary bariatric surgery (2008-2016) in a UK tertiary bariatric centre.

The proportion of T2D patients decreased over time (32.4%, 25.9%, 24.6%; p=0.008). No change in mean age or gender occurred but BMI significantly reduced with each cohort (B=-2.2, 95% CI [-2.9]-[-1.4], p&lt;0.001). A non-significant increase in the proportion of T2D patients with BMI&lt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was also seen (3.5%, 7.4%, 10.0%; p=0.07). HbA1c at referral remained unchanged (mean 7.6±1.4%) but the duration of T2D increased (mean 4.4yrs, 5.4yrs, 6.0yrs; B=0.8, 95% CI 0.2-1.5, p=0.008).

A comparative observational study of bariatric procedures was performed to investigate the time at which patients achieve glycemic control within the first 30 postoperative days following sleeve gastrectomy (SG), mini-gastric bypass (MGB), and diverted sleeve gastrectomy with ileal transposition (DSIT).</p><p id="Par298">Methods: Included patients had a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m<sup>2;</sup> T2DM for ≥3 years, HbA<sub>1C</sub> &gt;7% for ≥3 months, and no significant weight change (&gt;3%) within the prior 3 months. Surgical procedures performed were SG (n=49), MGB (n=93), and DSIT (n=109). The primary endpoint was the day within the first postoperative month on which mean fasting capillary glucose levels reached &lt;126 mg/dL.

Methods: A retrospective electronic medical record (EMR) data extraction was performed on 588 patients receiving bariatric surgery at a large tertiary academic medical center within Appalachia between 2013-2017. Data extracted from patient EMR.. Results: The average preoperative weight of patients was 299.2±62.8 pounds (n=585) with a BMI of 48.3±8.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=584); the preoperative EBW was 144.5±53.4 pounds (n=585). Subjects with one year follow-up (n=250) had an average reduction in weight, BMI, and EBW of 95.3 pounds, 14.8 kg/m2, and 93.6 pounds, respectively. Traditionally surgical success at one year is measured with a 50% EBWL or greater. %EBWL from baseline to one year follow up was 70.0±29.5% (n=250). Matched pairs t-test analyses from pre to one-year postsurgical identified significant decreases in weight, BMI, and EBW (all <italic>p’s</italic> &lt;0.0001). Baseline labs included blood glucose of 119.0±45.6 mg/dL, HbA1C of 6.1±1.1%, total cholesterol of 184.5±38.3 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 178.2±92.1 mg/dL. One-year postsurgical follow-up of labs included an average blood glucose decrease of 20.5 mg/dL, HbA1C of 0.4%, total cholesterol of 12.4 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 86.1 mg/dL. Correlational analyses revealed presurgical blood glucose was negatively associated with %EBWL (<italic>p</italic>=0.003). After controlling for surgery type, negative association was still found in RYGB (<italic>p</italic>=0.002). Conclusions: These findings suggest that patients completing surgery within an Appalachian region have successful surgical outcomes, as indicated by significant reductions in BMI, %EBW, and %EBWL. These reductions are comparable to and exceed national definitions of surgical success. Findings will inform both future prospective studies, along with specific interventions that are tailored to address the unique needs of this population.</p><p id="Par314"><bold>O-023</bold></p><p id="Par315"><bold>Revisional surgery - Change of frequency and type revisional surgery during last 3 decades</bold></p><p id="Par316"><underline>Rudolf Weiner</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Sonja Chiappetta<sup>1, b)</sup>, Sylvia Weiner<sup>2, c)</sup></p><p id="Par317"><sup>1)</sup>Obesity Surgery, Sana Klinikum Offenbach, Offenbach, Germany; <sup>2)</sup>Obesity Surgery, Nordwest Hospital, Frankfurt a.M., Germany</p><p id="Par318"><sup>a)</sup>profweiner@gmail.com</p><p id="Par319"><sup>b)</sup>sonja.chiappetta@gmail.com</p><p id="Par320"><sup>c)</sup>sylvia.weiner@gmx.de</p><p id="Par321">Background: Obesity surgery is not causal tretament of the disease.

Alongside with the gastroesophageal reflux, the regain of weight or inadequate weight loss- especially in patients with a BMI grater than 60kg/m2- are considered to be the two most frequent long term problems. The Single Anastomosis Duodenal Ileal bypass is a surgical approach with promising long term results.</p><p id="Par409"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold>: In our clinic, the SADI- S procedure is, since August 2013, the established operation after weight regain or inadequate weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy. The hand sutured duodenoileal anastomosis is performed 250cm oral of the ileoceacal valve. In cases of dilatation of the Sleeve a Re- Sleeve resection or an inverting longitudinal suture is simultaneously performed. Patients experiencing GERD Symptoms due to a hiatal hernia are also treated with a posterior hiatoplasty. Patients were allowed to take fluids orally directly after the operation.</p><p id="Par410"><bold>Results</bold>: 32 patients underwent a SADI-S operation. The time of the initial procedure was 8 to 48 months prior to the SADI- S operation. Simultaneously, the following procedures were performed: re-Sleeve (n=8), gastroplication (n=12), hiatoplasty (n=12), cholecystectomy (n=7). Duodenal stump leakage was in no case observed, whereas in one case a reanastomosis due to duodenalileal insufficiency was necessary. The mean hospital stay was 4 days. In the long term, all patients showed satisfactory weight loss (BMI drop 6-15 kg/m2). The GERD symptoms were reduced and in most no further PPI medication was needed. Excessive diarrhoea or flatulence were not observed.</p><p id="Par411"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: The SADI- S operation is an effective procedure for the treatment of inadequate weight loss after a sleeve gastrectomy. An additional reduction of the sleeve volume can also be performed. In case of gastroesophageal reflux a hiatoplasty can also provide a relief of the symptoms. A long term follow up is necessary.</p><p id="Par412"><bold>Acknowledgement</bold>: M. de la Cruz, A. Knapp, R. Riege, J.C.

The Appalachian population has limited food access that may contribute to the prevalence of obesity and potentially mitigate treatments of obesity.</p><p id="Par477"><bold>Objective</bold>: This research aimed to identify food access within a cohort of metabolic surgery patients in an Appalachian area, specifically West Virginia.</p><p id="Par478"><bold>Methods</bold>: A retrospective data extraction was performed on 588 patients receiving bariatric surgery between 2013-2017. Variables collected included preoperative weight, demographics, and geographical location information. Patient geographical location for West Virginia residents (n=394) was gained from EMR demographics and entered into WV FOODLINK Food Accessibility Map. WV FOODLINK identified four variables regarding food access: (1) quantity of retailers, (2) quality of retailers, (3) income, and (4) vehicle access. Patients were given a food access ranking score (FARS) between 0 (low food access) and 4 (high food access).</p><p id="Par479"><bold>Results</bold>: Patients overall were predominately Caucasian (92.1%), female (79.7%), with an average age of 45.6±11.2 years, and the majority received Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (71.6%). The average Food Access Score (FARS) for subjects was 1.66<underline>+</underline>0.73. The highest proportion of patients were located within FARS between 0 to 2 (72.6%). Those with low food access (0-2 FARS) were largely Caucasian, female, married, from outside of the closest urban area, had a preoperative average weight of 280.6<underline>+</underline>49.2 pounds, and an initial excess body weight (EBW) of 135.0<underline>+</underline>46.1 pounds. At baseline, however, weight in pounds was not significantly related to FARS (<italic>p</italic>=0.6526). At one-year postoperative follow-up, and weight change across that year, FARS was not significantly related (<italic>p</italic>=0.4168 and <italic>p</italic>=0.4675).</p><p id="Par480"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: The majority of West Virginians have lower food access; thus, understanding food accessibility in this population and its relationship to weight and related outcomes will inform bariatric nutritional care pre- and post-surgery. Additional work is needed to examine specific dietary behaviors and characteristics of individuals across all sectors of food access ranking.</p><p id="Par481"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> Funding from West Virginia University Experimental Station – Hatch WVA00689</p><p id="Par482"><bold>O-032</bold></p><p id="Par483"><bold>Initial experience of endoscopic radiofrequency waves delivery to the lower oesophageal sphincter (Stretta procedure) on symptomatic Gastroesophageal reflux disease post sleeve gastrectomy</bold></p><p id="Par484"><underline>Nesreen Khidir</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Moataz Bashah<sup>b)</sup></p><p id="Par485">Bariatric and Metabolic surgery, Hamad Medical corporation, Doha, Qatar</p><p id="Par486"><sup>a)</sup>dr_sora4@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par487"><sup>b)</sup>mbashah@hamad.qa</p><p id="Par488"><bold>Introduction</bold>: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is major side effect occurs de novo (8.6%) or intensifies (21%) after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (1).

Also in obese subjects the procedure is effective combined with a classic sleeve gastrectomy both for weight loss and T2DM control. Here we evaluated the benefit of SJA as a revisional procedure in 4 patients who had underwent sleeve gastrectomy 4 years ago but returned with either weight regain and/or recurrence of T2DM.</p><p id="Par503"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The mean BMI of the patients were 34±4.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All patients underwent standart sleeve gastrectomy with 38F buji in the same institution. The mean f/u period was 24± 6 months and the %EWL after the primary surgery was 38±4.8% after the first procedure. Two patients came with diabetes recurrence. They were back to oral antidiabetic OAD drugs. All patients underwent a revisional SJA procedure and the mean f/u period was 8± 2.4 months.</p><p id="Par504"><bold>Results:</bold> The patients achieved a %EWL of 22±5.2% and two patients quited the OAD. There was no major complications only a transient hypoalbunemia in one patients which was treated conservatively.

One patient experienced excess flatulance and undigestion which was resolved after 6 months.</p><p id="Par505"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although being accepted as still experimental SJA is an safe and effective procedure for controlling T2DM in low-bmi and morbid obese patients. Recent use of it as a revisional procedure is promosing and a safe and easy alternative in setting of failed sleeve gastrectomy as a complementary revisional procedure. Further randomized studies will justify this role in the near future.</p><p id="Par506"><bold>O-034</bold></p><p id="Par507"><bold>Comparative study of Medical Versus Surgical Weight Loss in Elderly: Cardiometabolic and Nutritional Changes At one Year Follow Up</bold></p><p id="Par508"><underline>Moamena El-Matbouly</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Nesreen Khidir<sup>b)</sup>, Moataz Bashah<sup>c)</sup>, Wahiba Elhag<sup>d)</sup></p><p id="Par509">Bariatric and metabolic Divison- General Surgery Department, Hamad Medical Corporation, doha, Qatar</p><p id="Par510"><sup>a)</sup>momenaelmatbouly@gmail.com</p><p id="Par511"><sup>b)</sup>dr_sora4@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par512"><sup>c)</sup>mbashah@hamad.qa</p><p id="Par513"><sup>d)</sup>welhag1@hamad.qa</p><p id="Par514"><bold>Introduction</bold>: Bariatric surgery (BS) is effective in obese elderly.

Transient elastography (TE) has shown reliable performance for the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, but was not independently validated in patients with morbid obesity. The aim of this study was to determine TE’s accuracy in comparison to liver biopsy obtained from patients undergoing bariatric-metabolic surgery.</p><p id="Par558"><bold>Methods</bold>: 173 consecutive patients scheduled for bariatric-metabolic surgery between 07/2014 and 11/2017 who underwent preoperative TE (XL-probe) and intraoperative liver biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. The ability of TE including controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) to detect significant and advanced fibrosis and steatosis was compared to liver histology using area under receiver operative characteristics curves (AUC). TE was performed during preoperative evaluation for assessment of either in a primary care or in an out-patient hospital setting. Liver histology was graded according to SAF score.</p><p id="Par559">Of 173 patients (64.7% female, median age [IQR]:42.0y [33.5; 50.5], median BMI [IQR]: 44.1kg/m² [41.3; 47.7]), 60.7% (n=105) presented with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 27.2% with (n=47) non-alcoholic fatty liver, and 12.1% (n=21) with a normal liver according to histology. The degree of fibrosis was F0-1 in 78.0% (n=135), whereas F2, F3 or F4 was diagnosed in 13.3% (n=23), 5.8% (n=10), and 2.9% (n=5) of patients, respectively. TE delivered reliable results in 86.1%. The AUC of TE for significant fibrosis (≥F2) and advanced fibrosis (≥F3) was 0.692 and 0.659, respectively. CAP was available in 145 of 173 patients.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is successful at achieving long-term and maintained weight loss in patients across all age groups, including children and adolescents. Anecdotal clinical observation and evidence in rodents suggests that LSG induces a shift in preference of sugary foods. However, it is not known whether this shift is due to a change in the threshold for gustatory detection of sucrose, or whether LSG induces behavioural change without affecting the gustatory threshold for sugar.</p><p id="Par572"><bold>Aims:</bold> To determine whether adolescents who undergo LSG experience a change in their threshold for detecting sweet taste.</p><p id="Par573"><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied the sucrose detection threshold of fourteen obese adolescents (age 15.3 ± 0.5 years, rage: 12-18) who underwent LSG two weeks before surgery and at 12 and 52 postoperativeweeks. Matched non-surgical subjects were tested on two occasions 12 weeks apart to correct for any learning process in study subjects. Eight blocks containing seven standardized sucrose concentrations were used, with the eighth block containing pure water. Seven sucrose concentrations were used, and were tested in eight blocks with each block consisting of a random seven sucrose and seven water stimuli.

At 12 months, subjects were randomised to receive saline or octreotide to block gut hormone responses in a crossover design.</p><p id="Par605"><bold>Results</bold>: In healthy volunteers, calorie intake and food preferences remained stable. In RYGB subjects calorie intake decreased by 47% vs baseline (1949±257 to 1039±101kcal, p=0.02). Percentage total carbohydrates preference was 49.1±5.2% pre and 34.2±2.9% 1 year after RYGB, p=0.05; of which sugars were 22.4±3.7% pre and 13.5±2.4% 1 year after, p=0.87; other carbohydrates were 26.7±3.5% pre and 20.7±2.2% 1 year after, p=0.10; fat was 38.3±5.2% pre and 50.4±3.1% 1 year after, p=0.49 and protein was 11.8±0.5% pre and 14.6±1.8% 1 year after, p=0.23.</p><p id="Par606">Octreotide had no effect on calorie intake in either group.

Yet, SADI-S effect on glycemic homeostasis is still unclear and comparison between SADI-S and standard bariatric procedure in terms of weight loss and resolution of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has never been reported. The aim of this study was to develop a reproducible animal model of SADI-S in order to compare weight loss and T2D resolutions after SADI-S to Roux-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) results. 80 Winstar male rats were submitted to a 3-months hight-fat diet promoting obesity. T2D was induced with a 35 mg/Kg intra-peritoneal injection of Steptozocine. Animals were divided in four groups: SADI-S, RYGB, Sham and Pairfed (caloric restriction diet). During a 30 days follow-up, weight, glycemia and indirected calorimetry were daily evaluated. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), Insuline Tolerance Test (ITT) and Intraperitoneal Pyruvate Tolerance Test (IpPTT) were performed pre- and postoperatively. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was completed pre- and post-operatively, to evaluate fat and lean mass. Based on these results, SADI-S was demonstrated as being superior in regard to weight-loss and glycemic control when compared to Sham and Pairfed groups (p</p><p id="Par636"><bold>O-044</bold></p><p id="Par637"><bold>Monocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood are suitable for non-invasive diagnosis of NASH in patients with obesity</bold></p><p id="Par638"><underline>Katharina Staufer</underline><sup>1, 2, a)</sup>, Katharina Scheuba<sup>1, 2, b)</sup>, Florian Winkler<sup>1, 2, c)</sup>, Magdalena Eilenberg<sup>1, 2, d)</sup>, Felix B.

The present study investigated inflammatory-induced changes in monocyte-subpopulations for the non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD, as well as the differentiation of NASH and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL).</p><p id="Par649"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with NAFLD scheduled for bariatric-metabolic surgery between 07/2015 and 05/2017, as well as healthy controls were consecutively included. The expression profile of monocyte surface markers for the differentiation of classical (CL; CD14++ CD16-), non-classical (NC; CD14+ CD16++) and intermediate monocytes (IM; CD14++ CD16+) were investigated by flow cytometry in EDTA whole blood. According to intra-operative liver biopsy patients were stratified into NAFL and NASH and disease activity was graded based on NAFLD-activity score (NAS).</p><p id="Par650"><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 80 patients (m:f=34:46, median BMI: 43,8) und 27 healthy controls (m:f=15:12, median BMI: 25,0) were included. Seventy-nine percent of patients suffered from NASH, 21% presented with NAFL.</p><p id="Par651">The median absolute concentration of monocyte subpopulations was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in healthy controls. In contrast, the relative number of monocyte subpopulations showed a significant rise of IM, as well as a significant decrease in CL in patients with NAFLD, whereas NC were equal in both groups.</p><p id="Par652">Patients with NASH had significantly higher absolute IM/ml, as well as a significantly lower CL/IM ratio than patients with NAFL or healthy controls.</p><p id="Par653">The absolute IM concentration was the most suitable diagnostic marker for NAFLD (AUC 0.861; cut-off&gt;18.7; sensitivity 71%; specificity 89%). The CL/IM ratio was the most suitable marker for the presence of NASH (AUC 0.706; cut-off&lt;20.1; sensitivity 71%; specificity 72%).</p><p id="Par654"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Monocyte subpopulations are suited for the non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH. The inflammatory process within NASH seems to be reflected by a strong activation of monocytes which can be non-invasively and therefore repeatedly monitored in peripheral blood.</p><p id="Par655"><bold>O-045</bold></p><p id="Par656"><bold>Preoperative education and informed consent in young adults undergoing bariatric surgery: patients’ perspectives on current practice</bold></p><p id="Par657"><underline>Charlotte Dohmen</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Daniëlle Bonouvrie<sup>b)</sup>, Martine Uittenbogaart<sup>c)</sup>, Arjan Luijten<sup>d)</sup>, Francois van Dielen<sup>e)</sup>, Wouter Leclercq<sup>f)</sup></p><p id="Par658">Bariatric surgery, Máxima Medical Centre, Veldhoven, Netherlands</p><p id="Par659"><sup>a)</sup>c.dohmen@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl</p><p id="Par660"><sup>b)</sup>danielle.bonouvrie@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par661"><sup>c)</sup>m.uittenbogaart@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par662"><sup>d)</sup>a.luijten@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par663"><sup>e)</sup>f.vandielen@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par664"><sup>f)</sup>w.leclercq@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par665"><bold>Introduction</bold>: Information about the quality of the perceived education and informed consent process in bariatric surgery, especially in young adults is lacking. As part of the surgical informed consent process, preoperative education informs patients about their bariatric procedure, the perioperative risks, the results and the lifestyle adjustments needed after bariatric surgery. Afterwards, patients should be able to make an informed decision to undergo their surgical procedure. Aim of this study was to evaluate the preoperative education and informed consent process in young adults, aged 18-25 years, undergoing bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par666"><bold>Methods</bold><bold><italic>:</italic></bold> 23 of the 55 young adults who underwent bariatric surgery between 2012 and 2017 at our centre were interviewed using a semi-structured interview. This interview included three sections: education of the specific informed consent domains; perioperative expectations and experiences; personal (un)certainties to undergo bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par667"><bold>Preliminary results:</bold> 23 patients were interviewed. Mean age at surgery was 23.1 ± 1.6 years and mean BMI at surgery was 42.2 ± 5.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup><bold>.</bold> All consent domains were remembered. However, 95% of the patients could not mention one or more complications. Primary success outcome for patients was not confined to weight loss, but gaining self-confidence, being able to buy clothes in a regular shop and raised fertility chances were considered more important. 37,5% of the patients had troubles dealing with their new self-image. 25% of the patients regrets the decision for the bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par668"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The preoperative education and informed consent process is an essential step in bariatric surgery.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors, accounting for &lt;1% of all neoplasms of the alimentary tract and are most commonly located in the stomach. The reported incidence of GISTs during bariatric surgery is around 0.8%.</p><p id="Par675"><bold>Aim:</bold>To analyze the incidence of GISTs in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and to verify whether an operation performed according to the bariatric protocol is oncologically radical.</p><p id="Par676"><bold>Material and methods:</bold>A single-center retrospective study of 542 morbidly obese patients, who underwent bariatric procedures between January 2002 and October 2017 in the University Hospital Leipzig Germany, with no upper gastrointestinal tract neoplasms found during preoperative diagnostic examinations. Incidental intraoperative findings of GISTs were recorded including tumor size and localization, mitotic index and immunohistochemical analysis.</p><p id="Par677"><bold>Results:</bold> Six (1,1%) patients were found to have incidental GIST. There were five (84%) women; mean age 54.6 (range 27–65), mean BMI 54,1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 49-71). None of them had symptoms that served as orientation for preoperative diagnosis. Four GISTs were located in stomach vs two in small bowl; four were found during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y-gastric bypasses (LRYGBs) vs. two during laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomies (LSGs). No change on the initial surgical plan or aborting the procedure took place. All tumors were of low/very low risk of malignancy, with &lt;5 mitoses/50 fields, less than 1,5 cm in diameter, and disease-free surgical margins. Cluster of differentiation CD117/CD34 were positive in 84% of the cases. None of the patients required adjuvant therapy after the surgery.</p><p id="Par678"><bold>Conclusions:</bold>The incidence of unsuspected GIST in our series was higher to what has been already reported. The degree of tumor malignancy was low and resection as part of the bariatric procedure was the definitive treatment. In case of incidental GISTs during bariatric surgery, tumor resection with negative margins may be considered as complete oncological treatment if there is very low/low risk stratification of GIST’s recurrence.</p><p id="Par679"><bold>O-047</bold></p><p id="Par680"><bold>Obesity as a determinant of post-operative outcome in patients following colorectal cancer surgery: a population based study (2009-2016).</bold></p><p id="Par681"><underline>Youri Poelemeijer</underline><sup>1, 2, a)</sup>, Niki Lijftogt<sup>1, b)</sup>, Robin Detering<sup>3, c)</sup>, Marta Fiocco<sup>4, d)</sup>, Rob Tollenaar<sup>1, 2, e)</sup>, Michel Wouters<sup>5, 2, f)</sup></p><p id="Par682"><sup>1)</sup>Surgery Department, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; <sup>2)</sup>Scientific Bureau, Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing, Leiden, Netherlands; <sup>3)</sup>Surgery Department, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands; <sup>4)</sup>Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics Department, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; <sup>5)</sup>Surgery Department, Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p id="Par683"><sup>a)</sup>Y.Q.M.Poelemeijer@lumc.nl</p><p id="Par684"><sup>b)</sup>n.lijftogt@gmail.com</p><p id="Par685"><sup>c)</sup>R.Detering@amc.nl</p><p id="Par686"><sup>d)</sup>M.Fiocco@lumc.nl</p><p id="Par687"><sup>e)</sup>R.A.E.M.Tollenaar@lumc.nl</p><p id="Par688"><sup>f)</sup>M.Wouters@nki.nl</p><p id="Par689"><bold>Background</bold><italic>:</italic> Obesity is a worldwide spreading disease and therefore one of the most concerning problems in healthcare outcome and costs nowadays.

We evaluated nutritional deficiencies according to standard and pregnancy-specific norms.</p><p id="Par709"><bold>Results:</bold> There were 123 pregnancies during the study period: 77 after RYGB and 46 after SG. Weight loss was higher after RYGB than after SG (45.6±12.4 vs. 39.5±13.7 kg, p=0.02), but mean body mass index before pregnancy (30.5±5.0 vs. 31.6±6.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and weight gain during pregnancy (8.4±6.7 vs. 9.5±8.1 kg) were similar. Mean birth weight (BW) was not significantly different (3026±677 vs. 3171±719 g). Mean BW Z-score (adjusted for sex and term) and incidence of small for gestational age (BW Z-score &lt; 10th percentile) were also similar (24 vs 19% after RYGB and SG, respectively). Mean number of nutritional deficiencies during the second trimester was similar after both procedures (2.2±1.5 vs. 2.1±1.2 with specific norms). However, serum and urinary calcium were significantly lower and parathyroid hormone was significantly higher after RYGB. In the whole cohort, urinary urea (R=0.307, p=0.02) and urinary calcium (R=0.399, p=0.002), reflecting protein and calcium intake and absorption, were positively correlated to BW, in contrast to serum iron parameters (including transferrin saturation, serum iron and ferritin) that were negatively associated with BW Z-score.</p><p id="Par710"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Fetal growth restriction occurs after both SG and RYGB. Calcium and protein intake positively influences fetal growth after BS.

Depending on the operative technique the construction creates a biliary blind loop of various length. We analyzed patients who became symptomatic by this blind segment of the small bowel.</p><p id="Par719"><bold>Method</bold>: A retrospective analysis of all patients who became symptomatic due to bacterial overgrowth in the blind biliary loop was performed. Symptoms were defined as long lasting diarrhea, overproduction of bowel gases with extreme bad smell, meteorism, postprandial pain in the left upper abdomen, hypoalbuminemia and edema. There was in general a combination of symptoms. In the last 3 years we analyzed the kind of bacterial contamination taken from the resected segment.</p><p id="Par720"><bold>Results</bold>: Of 3853 patients who received a Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in our institution 12 patients (0.3 %) developed symptoms as mentioned above. All patients were treated by laparoscopic resection of the blind loop. Bacterial analysis from the resected segment was performed in most cases. In 81 patients, who needed a revisional operation after gastric bypass for other reasons we also resected long biliary blind loops. None of these patients demonstrated symptoms like the symptomatic ones. After resection of the blind segment all symptomatic patients recovered from their symptoms. An antibiotic treatment after resection was never initiated.</p><p id="Par721"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Bacterial overgrowth is common in a biliary blind loop as we saw in asymptomatic patients. Compared to symptomatic patients we could not identify special germs which might explain the symptoms. Over all a blind loop syndrome is a rare condition, which can successfully be treated by resection of the blind loop.</p><p id="Par722"><bold>O-050</bold></p><p id="Par723"><bold>Transitory jejuno-gastric intussesception as a potential cause of epigastric pain and dyspepsia after the gastric bypass surgery</bold></p><p id="Par724"><underline>Yaroslav Isaev</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Christine Stier<sup>2, b)</sup>, Sonya Chiappetta<sup>3, c)</sup>, Rudolf Weiner<sup>3, d)</sup></p><p id="Par725"><sup>1)</sup>General surgery, Helios Klinikum, Erfurt, Germany; <sup>2)</sup>Uniklinik Würzburg, Endocrinology, Endoscopy, Würzburg, Germany; <sup>3)</sup>Bariatric surgery cemter, Sana Klinikum Offenbach, Offenbach, Germany</p><p id="Par726"><sup>a)</sup>doctorisaev@gmail.com</p><p id="Par727"><sup>b)</sup>dr.med.christine.stier@sana.de</p><p id="Par728"><sup>c)</sup>Sonja.Chiappetta@sana.de</p><p id="Par729"><sup>d)</sup>profweiner@gmail.com</p><p id="Par730"><bold>Inroduction</bold>: In the bariatric surgery intussusception is still not a well-known postoperative complication. Since the first publication of Bozzi (1914), around two hundred cases of jejuno-gastric intussuseption have been reported, most of them – with the development of surgical complications.</p><p id="Par731"><bold>Methods and results:</bold> We report about 12 cases of the transitory jejuno-gastric intussesception as a potential cause of epigastric pain and dyspepsia without an anatomic correlate after the gastric bypass (RNYGB, MGB, SADI-S) surgery for the first time. 8 patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNYGB), 3 – mini gastric bypass (MGB) and one – SADI-S. The postoperative time ranged from 1 month to 9 years. Just in 2 cases the transient intussusception was the incidental finding in the asymptomatic patients. In 10 cases the patients complained epigastric pain, reflux or nausea and vomiting. In none of this cases surgery was performed.</p><p id="Par732"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Thanks to the correlation of the sonographic findings with the macroscopic changes of the distal stomach we have assumed that transitory invagination can affect the microcirculation of the intestinal (gastric) wall, whereby the endoscopic findings often correspond to the clinical picture. Till present time it was believed that jejuno-gastric invagination is a rare condition that can lead to dangerous complications. Our dates necessitate to doubt it and to assume that the real frequency of the intussusceptions in fact is much higher. Obviously dangerous complications like ileus and necrosis of the intestine occur very rare. Nevertheless the endoscopic findings show that even transient intussusception can lead to macroscopic changes and can be considered as a possible cause of abdominal pain and dyspepsia. Of course it’s not clear, how far such conditions influence the quality of life of the patients and whether the surgical techniques should be changed, but these dates bring us to look at the problem from the different point of view and can be a basis for the further investigation and possible reconsideration of a present tactic.</p><p id="Par733"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par734">1.

In SG patients however, a large portion of patients show insufficient weight loss or weight regain after a few years. Studies concerning the effectiveness of revisional procedures after SG are scarce and comparisons are lacking. This study analyzes the Single Anastomosis Duodenoileal Bypass (SADI) and the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) following SG.</p><p id="Par786"><bold>Methods:</bold> From 2010 to 2017, 162 patients received revisional laparoscopic surgery after SG. A SADI was performed in 61 patients and 101 patients were converted to a RYGB. Patients submitted to revisional SADI were operated to improve weight-loss. Revisional RYGB patients were operated to improve weight loss (n=61) or because of a complicated SG (e.a. stenosis or severe reflux). For this study, only RYGB patients operated to improve weight loss were included.</p><p id="Par787"><bold>Preliminary results</bold>: Mean age prior to SG was 41.45 (±11.28) years, mean weight was 154.89 (±30,31) kg and mean BMI was 54.14 (±10.32). On average, patients submitted to revisional SADI were operated after 3.69 (±2.40) years and revisional RYGB after 2.58 (±1.40) years. Short-term complications (&lt;30 days) occurred in 6.4% of SADI patients and 0% in the RYGB group. For long-term complications (&gt;30 days), these percentages were 11.1% and 14.3% respectively. No intra- or postoperative mortality was observed. At the second operation, mean weight and BMI was 129.53 (±21.83) and 45.44 (±6.99) for the SADI group and 123.63 (±23.34) and 42.87 (±6.77) for the RYGB group. After adjustment for baseline weight, the difference in percentage total body weight loss (%TBWL) for SADI compared to RYGB at 6, 12 and 24 months was 6.7%, 12.6% and 15.6% in favor of SADI patients (all p-values &lt;0,001).</p><p id="Par788"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> More short-term complications were observed following revisional SADI when compared to RYGB, while long-term complications rates were similar. Weight loss after SADI following SG is significantly better when compared to RYGB.</p><p id="Par789"><bold>O-054</bold></p><p id="Par790"><bold>Conversion of Both Versions of Vertical Banded Gastroplasty to Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, Analysis of Short-term Outcomes</bold></p><p id="Par791"><underline>Talal Khewater</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Nathalie Yercovich<sup>b)</sup>, Edouard Grymonprez<sup>c)</sup>, Isabelle Debergh<sup>d)</sup>, Bruno Dillemans<sup>e)</sup></p><p id="Par792">Obesity Center, Department of Surgery, AZ Sint-Jan Brugge-Oostende AV, Campus Sint- Jan, Ruddershove 10, 8000, Bruges, Belgium</p><p id="Par793"><sup>a)</sup>dr_tka@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par794"><sup>b)</sup>natuyerco2010@gmail.com</p><p id="Par795"><sup>c)</sup>grymonprez.e@gmail.com</p><p id="Par796"><sup>d)</sup>Isabelle.debergh@azsintjan.be</p><p id="Par797"><sup>e)</sup>Bruno.Dillemans@azsintjan.be</p><p id="Par798"><bold>Background:</bold> Conversional bariatric surgery has relatively high rates of complications. We aimed to analyze our single-center experience with patients requiring conversional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) following a failed primary open or laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty (OVBG or LVBG, respectively).</p><p id="Par799"><bold>Methods:</bold> The records of patients who underwent laparoscopic RYGB as a conversional procedure after VBG between November 2004 and December 2016 were reviewed. Characteristics, body mass index (BMI), operation time, intraoperative problems, length of hospitalization, and early (&lt;30 days) morbidity and mortality were analyzed. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or frequency.</p><p id="Par800"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 305 patients (81.97% females) who underwent conversional RYGB were included. For the LVBG group (209 patients), OVBG group (96 patients), respectively, BMI was 34.48±6.39 and 37.97±6.46 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), the operation time was 93.59±29.66 and 118.31±37.75 minutes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), hospitalization duration was 3.00±1.14 and 3.22±1.16 days (<italic>p</italic>=0.08), the early complication rate was 6.70% and 9.38% (<italic>p</italic>=0.41), and the reoperation rate was 2.39% and 2.08% <italic>(p</italic>=0.87). There were no major intraoperative problems. Two patients with OVBG were converted to open RYGB (2.08%). There was no mortality.</p><p id="Par801"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The conversion of OVBG and LVBG to laparoscopic RYGB is technically feasible and provides comparably low early morbidity rates and length of hospitalization. However, compared to LVBG, conversional laparoscopic RYGB following OVBG is technically more challenging and time consuming, with a slightly higher risk of conversion to open surgery. We support the use of such conversional bariatric surgery in specialized, high-volume bariatric centers.</p><p id="Par802"><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par803">World Health Organization (2016) Obesity and overweight: Fact sheet 311.

Vertical Gastric Plication (VGP) has been recently performed as a weight loss procedure in France. Despite its relative short-term safety and efficacy, long-term results of VGP are still controversial. The goal of this study was to assess the indications and outcome of revision for weight regain in patients with VGP.</p><p id="Par879"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were prospectively included in a database, with regular assessment of both results, and complications, respectively. Weight regain or insufficient weight loss were initially treated conservatively in all patients after a through clinical, biological, endoscopic and radiologic assessment. If conservative treatment was unsuccessful or in case of anatomical anomaly, surgical revision was indicated.</p><p id="Par880"><bold>Results:</bold> Between February 2010 and September 2017, 300 patients had VGP. Of these, 60 were lost to follow-up. The rate of patients with excess weight loss (EWL) &gt; 50% was only 50 %. The remaining 120 patients had either inadequate weight loss (66 patients) or weight regain (54 patients) and eventually required revisional surgery. Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) was performed in 72 patients (60 %). Sleeve Gatrectomy (SG) was performed in 48 patients (40 %). Median interval from VGP to revision was 29 months (range, 18-61). Mean operative time was 168 min (range, 100–228). Median length of stay was 3 days (range, 2–5). Major complications occurred in 6 patients (5 %) including 3 leaks fistula and one intra-abdominal abscess, all after SG.</p><p id="Par881"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> VGP is associated to high rates of weight regain or inadequate weight loss.

Although some patients get back on track by additional counseling, revisional surgery is often necessary. Despite the growing number of patients with insufficient weight loss (IWL) or weight regain (WR), there is no standardized approach. This retrospective study analyzes the banded RYGB (B-GB) and the distal RYGB (D-GB) in patients with IWL or WR after RYGB.</p><p id="Par888"><bold>Methods:</bold> Between January 1st, 2013 and December 31st, 2016 patients who underwent revisional surgery because of IWL, defined as a percentage excess weight loss (EWL) &lt; 50%, or WR, defined as an increase in weight after initially successful weight loss (EWL &gt; 50%), were included. RYGB was converted to a B-GB using a non-adjustable silicone MiniMizer ring or to a D-GB with a 100cm common channel and 300cm alimentary limb. %EWL one year after revisional surgery, starting from the initial RYGB surgery, and complications were collected and analyzed.</p><p id="Par889"><bold>Results:</bold> B-GB was performed in 20 patients and 30 patient were converted to a D-GB. %EWL improved in both groups, from 28% at revision to 43% in the B-GB group and from 24% to 55% in the D-GB group. In both groups patients with WR performed better compared to patients with IWL, 62% versus 10% in the B-GB group and 62% versus 40% in the D-GB group. In four (20%) patients the MiniMizer ring was removed during the first year because of dysfagia. In the D-GB group 15 (50%) patients developed nutritional deficiencies requiring supplementation and five (17%) patients developed protein caloric malnutrition compared to 25% and no patients in the B-GB group respectively.</p><p id="Par890"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In patients with WR conversion to B-GB and D-GB resulted in similar weight loss. Banding may be preferred because of less morbidity and nutritional complications.

Currently, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in France. Despite its safety and efficacy, long-term complications of LSG are not rare including weight regain, insufficient weight loss, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and twisting or stenosis. The goal of this study was to analyze the pattern and short-term results of surgical revision in patients with LSG.</p><p id="Par899"><bold>Methods</bold>: Revisional surgery, regardless of its motivation, was always a multidisciplinary decision after thorough clinical, biological, endoscopic, and radiological assessment. Patients who had revisional surgery were retrospectively identified and subsequently divided in 4 subgroups according to preoperative body mass index (BMI) (&lt; or &gt; 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and the presence or not of GERD. The minimal follow up period was 12 months.</p><p id="Par900"><bold>Results:</bold> Between December 2004 and September 2015, 1000 patients had LSG. 114 patients were lost to follow-up (11.4 %). The rate of excess weight loss (EWL) &gt; 50% was 68%. Out of 886 patients, 94 had a revisional surgery (10.6%) for inadequate weight loss, GERD, or stenosis, respectively. The performed procedures included Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (60%), re-Sleeve (18%), Duodenal Switch (DS) (12%), Single Anatomosis Duodeno-Ileal Shunt (6 %), and Sero-myotomy (4%). Median interval from the initial surgery to conversion was 29 months (18-81). Median operating room time was 170 min (range, 100–290). Median length of stay was 72 hours (range, 48 – 120). Mortality was nil. Overall complication rate was 8% (8/94). The follow-up rate at 12 months was at 96 %. Satisfaction index at 12 month was 88%.</p><p id="Par901"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Revisional options after LSG are safe and lead rarely to complications. Nowadays, LSG could be considered as the first step of a potentially multi-step bariatric pathway. Longer follow-up will be needed to establish the correct algorithm of choice of the surgical option for post LSG revision.</p><p id="Par902"><bold>O-059</bold></p><p id="Par903"><bold>Outcome and risks of surgical reintervention for weight regain after RYGB</bold></p><p id="Par904"><underline>Daniel Moritz Felsenreich</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Magdalena Eilenberg<sup>1, b)</sup>, Julia Jedamzik<sup>1, c)</sup>, Ronald Kefurt<sup>1, d)</sup>, Michael Arnoldner<sup>2, e)</sup>, Christoph Bichler<sup>1, f)</sup>, Felix Langer<sup>1, g)</sup>, Gerhard Prager<sup>1, h)</sup></p><p id="Par905"><sup>1)</sup>Department of General Surgery, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria</p><p id="Par906"><sup>2)</sup>Department of Radiology, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria</p><p id="Par907"><sup>a)</sup>moritz.felsenreich@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par908"><sup>b)</sup>magdalena.eilenberg@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par909"><sup>c)</sup>julia.jedamzik@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par910"><sup>d)</sup>ronald.kefurt@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par911"><sup>e)</sup>michael.arnoldner@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par912"><sup>f)</sup>christoph.bichler@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par913"><sup>g)</sup>felix.langer@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par914"><sup>h)</sup>gerhard.prager@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par915"><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Weight regain occurs after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a significant number of patients. As dietary counseling is successful in only few of them, surgical reinterventions, performed as common limb reduction (CLR), pouch banding (PB), pouch remodeling (PR) and as a combination of these procedures might be more successful. PR was defined as pouch resizing, rebuilding of the anastomosis or resection of the blind limb.</p><p id="Par916">The aim of this analysis is to assess outcomes and the risks of these interventions.</p><p id="Par917"><bold>Methods:</bold> In a total number of 65 patients, surgical reinterventions for weight regain after RYGB were common limb reduction (n=22), pouch banding (n=35), and pouch remodeling (n=8). Within these main groups, some patients had an additional procedure: 11 common limb reduction patients had PB, another 3 had PR and 26 of the pouch banding patients additionally had PR.</p><p id="Par918"><bold>Results:</bold> In a total of 6 patients (27%) in the CLR group, severe malnutrition led to revisional surgery to increase alimentary and common limb length. 6 PB patients (17%) had to have their pouch band removed due to stenosis and vomiting.

This is due to the absence of prospective studies using objective assessment measures of GERD such as pH monitoring. Our study aims at assessing GERD one year post-LSG procedure for obesity.</p><p id="Par944"><bold>Materials and methods</bold>: Twelve asymptomatic obese patients were studied prospectively by using 24h MIIpH pre- and 12 months post- LSG.</p><p id="Par945"><bold>Results</bold>: 83.33% of patients’ one year post-LSG suffered from GERD (either newly onset or worsening of already existing). Mean DeMeester score one year post- LSG was 47, almost 2.5 times higher than the preoperative score (p=0.072).

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a widely accepted stand-alone bariatric operation [2,3]. Data on elderly patients undergoing LSG are scarce, with very few data on patients older than 65 years-old [4-6]. We therefore aimed to demonstrate that LSG is safe and effective in morbidly obese patients over 65 years-old.</p><p id="Par965"><bold>Methods:</bold> Prospectively collected data from all consecutive patients undergoing single-incision LSG in our department until May 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. For weight loss and comorbidity evaluation, only patients with at least 1-year follow-up were included in our analysis. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the French version of Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire.</p><p id="Par966"><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-four patients over 65 years-old (range: 65-75 years) underwent single-incision LSG in our department. Median weight was 119 kg, median BMI 43 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Median duration of surgery was 86.5 minutes. Two patients (3.7%) suffered a gastric staple-line leak; the first was successfully treated using a purely endoscopic approach; the second was treated by relaparoscopy and subsequent endoscopic internal drainage. Mortality was null. Median length of hospital stay was 5 days. Six, 12 and 24 months after LSG, median BMI had decreased significantly to 35, 32.9 and 30.7 kg/m2, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001), with a mean EWL of 76.3% at 2 years. Type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea and arthralgia showed statistically significant remission at one year. Six out of 8 SF-36 scale scores of QoL assessment improved significantly.</p><p id="Par967"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that LSG is safe and effective for patients older than 65 years-old, resulting in significant weight loss, comorbidities remission and QoL improvement. Morbidly obese patients over 65 years-old should not automatically be denied LSG. A careful patient selection after an adequate risk versus benefit evaluation by an expert multidisciplinary team is essential.</p><p id="Par968"><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par969">Gagner M, Deitel M, Erickson AL, Crosby RD (2013) Survey on laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at the Fourth International Consensus Summit on Sleeve Gastrectomy.

Staple-line leak is the most feared complication of SG, with an incidence of 1-7% [2-4]. Sarcopenic obesity combines the risks of obesity and depleted lean mass leading possibly to an inferior surgical outcome [5]. Muscle quantification by abdominal CT-scan is an accurate technique for detecting sarcopenic patients [5]. We aimed to evaluate the existence of a link between radiologically determined sarcopenic obesity and staple-line leak risk after SG.</p><p id="Par992"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis of a single-center prospective database was performed in consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic SG as primary procedure. Total psoas muscles area (TPA) and total visible muscles area (TMA) were measured on axial slice at the third lumbar spine vertebra level on CT-scan performed one month before surgery. Skeletal muscular mass indexes were defined as ratio between muscular areas over square of height. Sarcopenia was defined as lowest tertile of skeletal muscular mass indexes (using TPA or TMA) in each gender. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the main independent preoperative risk factors for staple-line leak.</p><p id="Par993"><bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 234 patients underwent laparoscopic SG. Twenty-nine superobese patients were excluded from the study. Median BMI was 40.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [34.2-49.6]. Nine patients (4.4%) presented a gastric leak; in 4 cases relaparoscopy was required (to evacuate and drain an abscess) with subsequent endoscopic drainage, while exclusive endoscopic management was sufficient in 5 cases. The sex-specific cut-offs for skeletal muscular mass index according to TPA were 8.2 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> for men and 6.08 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> for women; patients below these values were classified as having sarcopenia. After multivariate analysis, preoperative weight (OR=1,043) and sarcopenia (TPA) (OR=5,204) were independent predictive factors for gastric leak.</p><p id="Par994"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present series suggests that CT-scan determined sarcopenic obesity is associated with increased risk of gastric leak after SG. This preoperatively radiological examination would be a useful clinical tool to tailor patient management according to gastric leak risk.</p><p id="Par995"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par996">[1] Deitel M, Gagner M, Erickson AL, Crosby RD.

Changes of BMI, serum glucose, arterial hypertension, syndrome of sleep apnea and fatty liver disease have been evaluated preoperatively and 1, 3, 6 and 12 month postoperatively as well as postoperative problems according to different surgical techniques applied.</p><p id="Par1012"><bold>Results:</bold> 57 patients(52.3%) who underwent a standard laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy procedure (group 1) lost 39.5±11.5 kg mean during first 6 months.

We hereby present the experience accumulated at our institution over a nine-year period.</p><p id="Par1036"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patient data were collected by retrospectively accessing electronic recordings and prospectively evaluating postoperative progress at scheduled follow-up intervals. Patients were allocated to 2 groups, depending on the extent of the gastric sleeve (Group 1: &lt;2cm from pylorus, &lt;1cm from the angle of His; Group 2: &gt;4cm from pylorus, &gt;1 cm from His). We studied the effect of LSG on excess BMI loss (%EBMIL); type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); morbidity and mortality; and new-onset symptomatic GERD.</p><p id="Par1037"><bold>Results:</bold> From January 2009 to December 2017, 696 obese patients (68.5% females; mean age 39.7 years, range 17-69) were submitted to LSG in our center. Group 1 consists of 502 patients (72%), whereas the rest were allocated to group 2. Fifty patients (7.2%) underwent three-port LSG (vs. 5-port for the rest). No reoperations were documented in the cases not lost to follow-up. Mean pre-operative BMI was 49.2 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 40-74.2). Mean 1-year %EBMIL was 81.8% vs. 62.7% for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Overall mortality was 0.14%. Overall complication rates between Groups 1 and 2 were 2.4% vs. 3.1% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), respectively (leaks: 1.2% vs. 0%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; major hemorrhage: 0% vs. 0.6%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; pulmonary embolism: 0.2% vs. 0.6%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). At 5-year follow-up, 93% of patients with T2DM in Group 1 vs. 87% in Group 2 (<italic>p</italic>=0.15) needed less or no anti-diabetic medications as compared to their pre-operative status. GERD was clinically significant in 17 patients.</p><p id="Par1038"><bold>Conclusion</bold> – The implementation of LSG in one of the country’s largest healthcare facilities proved to be safe and efficacious in its purpose as a sustainable restrictive weight-loss procedure. Technical variations had an impact on both bariatric effect and complications. Long-term amelioration of T2DM was comparable to that documented internationally, whereas symptomatic GERD was a rare but non-negligible, inherent side effect of the method.</p><p id="Par1039"><bold>O-068</bold></p><p id="Par1040"><bold>The endoscopic-vacuum assisted closure-technique in the treatment of staple line leaks after sleeve gastrectomy.</bold></p><p id="Par1041"><underline>Vasiliki Christogianni</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Panagiotis Bemponis<sup>b)</sup>, Martin Buesing<sup>c)</sup>, Radostina Dukovska<sup>d)</sup></p><p id="Par1042">General and Visceral Surgery, Vest Klinikum- Knappschaft Hospital Recklinghausen, Recklinghausen, Germany</p><p id="Par1043"><sup>a)</sup>bchristogianni@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par1044"><sup>b)</sup>bebonis@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1045"><sup>c)</sup>chirurgie@klinikum-vest.de</p><p id="Par1046"><sup>d)</sup>ineto@abv.bg</p><p id="Par1047"><bold>Introduction</bold>: A Staple line leak after a sleeve gastrectomy is a common complication. Although there are many endoscopical und surgical approaches on this matter, the endoscopic-vacuum assisted closure-technique has only been used in some cases.</p><p id="Par1048"><bold>Material and</bold> methods: The study group included 21 patients with early postoperative (up to 10 days) proximal staple line leaks after a sleeve gastrectomy. The diagnosis was made either after a CT scan with oral contrast or after a relaparoscopy. The time of the first EndoVAC placement, the interval of changes, frequency and duration, adjuvant measures and specific complications of the treatment were evaluated</p><p id="Par1049"><bold>Results</bold>: EndoVAC therapy was initiated in all cases after a previous relaparoscopy (2-10 p.o. day), lavage and drainage of the abdominal cavity. Re-endoscopy and EndoVAC changes were performed every 2-7 days. The average duration of EndoVAC therapy was 22 days (4-47 days), requiring 2-10 changes. Specific complications of the treatment were identified in 4 cases as a result of early dislocation of the EndoVAC system. Additionally, the EndoVAC system was satisfactorily tolerated by the patients and fluids (water, tea) were given orally after the second placement. The EndoVAC therapy was successfully completed in 18 cases, in 3 cases a persistent fistula was treated with a double pigtail drainage. In the long term, no stenoses were observed. In one case a recurrent abscess was treated surgically 1 year later.</p><p id="Par1050"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The proximal staple line leakage after a sleeve gastrectomy requires a rapid approach. Our treatment strategy consists of an early relaparoscopy, lavage and drainage, followed by the initiation of an EndoVAC therapy in the following days. In addition, antibiotics and intensive care unit admission are almost always necessary. The duration of therapy depends on the endoscopic evaluation of the abscess cavity and the improvement of the clinical status. In the treatment of proximal staple line leaks after sleeve gastrectomy, EndoVAC therapy has proven to be very effective.</p><p id="Par1051"><bold>Acknowledgement</bold></p><p id="Par1052">M.

The POSE procedure employs a peroral incisionless operating platform (USGI Medical, San Clemente, Calif) to place transmural tissue anchor plications that reduce accommodation of the gastric fundus. Additional plications are placed in the distal gastric body to delay gastric emptying. The Milepost study compared safety, satiety, and weight loss outcomes of subjects undergoing the POSE procedure plus diet and exercise to those following diet and exercise alone at one year post randomization [1]. After one year, the control subjects were offered the POSE procedure (Crossover Pose Group) and followed for an additional 12 months.</p><p id="Par1061"><bold>Methods</bold>: A non-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 3 EU countries.

The LRYGB is not reversible and its major limitation is the difficult exploration of the gastric remnant and duodenum. The reversible gastric bypass with fundectomy and exploration of the gastric remnant was introduced in attempt to overcome this limitation. To date, its outcomes are debated and still unclear. The purposes of this study were to describe a novel technique of gastric bypass with fundectomy and to analyze its outcomes</p><p id="Par1074"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> This is a multicenter prospective study. From January 2008 to December 2015 a series of morbidly obese patients underwent the laparoscopic gastric bypass with fundectomy and gastric remnant exploration (LRYGBfse). Outcomes in term of weight loss, BMI decrease, %EWL improvement, and comorbid resolution were analyzed during follow-up.</p><p id="Par1075"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 653 patients were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed. The preoperative mean body weight and mean BMI were 133.4 ± 28.6 kg and 48.2 ± 7.8 kg/m2, respectively. No major intraoperative complications were reported. The mean postoperative in-hospital length of stay was 4 days (range 2-10), and the mean ICU length of stay was 1 day (range 1-2). Postoperative overall morbidity and mortality rates were 0.7% and 0% respectively. Overall, 229 patients completed the 5-years follow-up. Mean BMI and Excess Weight Loss (EWL%) were significantly lower compared to baseline (p &lt;0.05). Comorbid improvement or resolution was recorded in most of the patients. Banding removal was necessary in one patient 62 months after the index operation.</p><p id="Par1076"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The reversible gastric bypass with fundectomy and gastric remnant exploration is feasible and effective with durable results at 5-years follow-up. Outcomes in term of weight loss, overall complications, and comorbid resolution seems comparable to the standard LRYGB. Endoscopic evaluation of the gastric remnant with an easy access to the main duodenal papilla are unquestionable advantages.</p><p id="Par1077"><bold>O-071</bold></p><p id="Par1078"><bold>Elipse® Swallowable Intragastric Balloon + Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD): A Novel Strategy to Optimize Weight-Loss and Minimize Side Effects</bold></p><p id="Par1079"><underline>Roberta Ienca</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Cristiano Giardiello<sup>2, b)</sup>, Rita Schiano<sup>2, c)</sup>, Ilaria Ernesti<sup>1, d)</sup></p><p id="Par1080"><sup>1)</sup>Department of Experimental Medicine, Medical Pathophysiology, food science and endocrinology section, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy; <sup>2)</sup>Emergency and Metabolic surgery dept, Pineta Grande Hospital, Caserta, Italy</p><p id="Par1081"><sup>a)</sup>roberta.ienca@libero.it</p><p id="Par1082"><sup>b)</sup>cristiano.giardiello@pinetagrande.it</p><p id="Par1083"><sup>c)</sup>rita_schiano@libero.it</p><p id="Par1084"><sup>d)</sup>ilariaernesti@libero.it</p><p id="Par1085"><bold>Background:</bold> Eighty percent of weight loss from intragastric balloons occurs in the first half of balloon residence. Addition of VLCKD may further augment weight loss. The timing of adding VLCKD to maximize weight loss and minimize side effects, is unknown.</p><p id="Par1086"><bold>Aims:</bold> To investigate the optimal timing of VLCKD addition to Elipse Balloon therapy.</p><p id="Par1087"><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, randomized study was conducted in 24 obese individuals(8M/16F) receiving Elipse®, a new swallowable intragastric balloon. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group A started VLCKD at Elipse placement (4 months of VLCKD) while Group B started VLCKD three months after Elipse® placement (1 month of VLCKD); A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used monthly to evaluate satiety and side effects following placement.</p><p id="Par1088"><bold>Results:</bold> Group A mean starting weight and BMI were 108.2±19.7kg and 36.4±6.1kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively. In Group B these were 109.7 ± 20.9kg, and 38.6 ± 6.7kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively. After 16 weeks, in Group A mean weight loss was 12.8±3.1kg, mean %EWL was 35.2% and mean BMI reduction was 4.1±1.4kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In Group B, these were 5.2 ± 2,6kg, 42% and 5.3±1.1kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively. VAS revealed that the satiety grade at the end of each month of therapy was comparable between Group A and Group B. No serious adverse events were noted, although 3 pts in group A reported muscle cramps caused by inadequate intake of electrolytes.</p><p id="Par1089"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Elipse balloon alone, without the addition of VLCKD can sustain satiety. VLCKD does not appear to enhance the efficacy of Elipse if added in the first three months as Elipse efficacy may already be maximized then.

Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) is one of the most frequently performed bariatric procedures. There is a growing concern about the relationship between SG and GERD. This study aims to assess the effectiveness, on morbid obese patients, of the combined SG and Rossetti anti-reflux fundoplication (R-Sleeve) for the treatment of GERD in obese patients before and after bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par1096"><bold>Methods</bold>: From February 2016 to November 2017, 179 obese patients (134 female; 45 male) underwent R-Sleeve procedure, performed by 4 different expert bariatric surgeons.</p><p id="Par1097"><bold>Results</bold>: Mean age: 42.8±10.1 years. Mean BMI: 42.5±6.2 kg/m2 (range: 30-63). Patient were suffering from GERD before surgery: 124/179 (69.5%). Mean operative time: 49±19 minutes. No intraoperative complications or conversion were reported. Incidence of medical complications: 6/172 (3.4%); surgical complications: 14/172 (7.8%); gastric fistula: 9/179 (5.0%). The fistula has always arisen in fundoplication. Rate of reoperation: 11/172 (6.1%). A good sense of repletion without episodes of vomiting, nausea or dysphagia was reported at 12 months follow up from 95% of patients. 18 months after surgery, more than 95% of patients do not suffer from reflux symptoms and do not take PPI. Excess BMI loss percent (EBMIL%) at follow-up were comparable with SG.</p><p id="Par1098"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: R-Sleeve is well tolerated, feasible and safe procedure in obese patients with good postoperative weight loss results. We recorded an almost complete resolution of clinical signs of GERD after SG to 18 months after surgery. Genesis of the fistula is attributable to an incorrect manipulation of the stomach. This complication, different to the classic fistula after LSG, can be ascribed to an improvement of the technique and its complete standardization. Moreover, the postoperative course also in case of surgical complication was, after reoperation, comparable if not better than the postoperative SG course complicated by gastric fistula. Two monocentric prospective studies are underway to validate this technique.</p><fig id="Figx" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figx_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO24"/></fig><fig id="Figy" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figy_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO25"/></fig><p id="Par1099"><bold>O-073</bold></p><p id="Par1100"><bold>Magenstrasse and Mill procedure with Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication as an alternative option for bariatric patients with gastroesophageal reflux or hiatal hernia.</bold></p><p id="Par1101"><underline>Bernard MAJERUS</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Jean-Paul HAXHE<sup>b)</sup>, Erik KOVACS</p><p id="Par1102">Service de Chirurgie Viscérale, Clinique Saint-Pierre, Ottignies-Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium</p><p id="Par1103"><sup>a)</sup>bernard.majerus@cspo.be</p><p id="Par1104"><sup>b)</sup>jean-paul.haxhe@cspo.be</p><p id="Par1105">Surgery is the best option for morbidly obese patients not responding to conservative treatments. Esophagitis and hiatal hernias are frequent among obese population. Patients with morbid obesity and esophagitis and/or large hiatal hernia are best treated with gastric bypass associated with crural repair. However, some patients present contra-indications to the gastric bypass or do not accept this procedure. Sleeve gastrectomy is generally considered as contra-indicated in obese patients with esophagitis or large hiatal hernia because of the risk of worsening of gastro-esophageal reflux. The addition of a crural repair to the sleeve has been advocated in presence of a hiatal hernia, but effectiveness remains subject to debate. When gastric bypass is contra-indicated or not accepted by the patient, the addition of a Nissen-Rossetti anti-reflux procedure to the Magenstrasse and Mill intervention (MMNR), as described by Fedenko and Evdoshenko in 2007, seems interesting. From November 2015, we propose this intervention to selected patients, after multidisciplinary assessment and informed consent. MMNR is feasible and safe on a short to mid-term. Patients’ tolerance is good. Weight loss could be less important than with sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass. Efficiency evaluation on GERD/HH (and other comorbidities) is promising but longer follow-up is required.</p><p id="Par1106"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1107">Fedenko V, Evdoshenko V.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic and robotic mini-gastric bypass (MGB) in resolution of morbid obesity and concomitant systemic diseases. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of robotic surgery with respect to conventional laparoscopic approach.</p><p id="Par1115"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Two hundred-thirty-five patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic MGB in our center between January 2014 to 2017 were included in the study. Patients were grouped in to robotic (RMGB) and laparoscopic MGB (LMGB) groups. Patient demographic data, laboratory tests, metabolic parameters and resolution of the systemic diseases were investigated.</p><p id="Par1116"><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of the RMGB and LMGB groups were 35.3<underline>+</underline>12.4 and 37.6<underline>+</underline>9.9 years, respectively (p&gt;0.05).In both groups 76% of the patients were female and the two groups were similar in terms of preoperative BMI, body weight and distribution of the systemic diseases (p&gt;0.05). When each group was evaluated according to the preoperative values MGB procedure resulted in significant weight loss, reduction in BMI and resolution of the concomitant diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia and etc. (p&lt;0.05). However, the postoperative 1<sup>st</sup> year results of LMGB were superior to RMGB in terms of weight loss, resolution of diabetes related parameters and the lipid profile of the patients (p&lt;0.05). Although complication rate of RMGB was higher than LMGB it did not reach statistical significance (p&gt;0.05).</p><p id="Par1117"><bold>Discussion and conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, MGB is an effective treatment modality for morbid obesity and related systemic diseases. Robotic approach in bariatric surgery is in the diffusion phase of popularization of technologic innovation. Learning curve may be one reason why robotic surgery results may be inferior to laparoscopic approach. We use the Da Vinci S system which is designed for the urologic applications and may be not suitable for more complex general surgical procedures. Multi-institutional large volume data are needed to confirm the results of the study.</p><p id="Par1118"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1119">Prevention and management of the global epidemic of obesity.

However, data on the long term effect of DJBL treatment is missing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effect of the duodenal jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) on weight loss and glycemic control.</p><p id="Par1141"><bold>Methods:</bold> From 2010 to 2012, twenty-nine patients were treated with the DJBL at Maastricht University Medical Center and Zuyderland Medical Center Heerlen, as part of multicenter randomized controlled trial. Prior to implantation and after removal of the DJBL, all patients underwent standardized physical examination and blood sampling (HbA1c, C-peptide, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides). Included patients underwent standardized physical examination and blood sampling as previously performed during the initial study.</p><p id="Par1142"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of the twenty-nine patients fifteen patients were eligible for follow-up with a median duration of 49 months. Five patients had successfully received additional bariatric surgery and were not included in the primary analysis in this long-term evaluation of the DJBL. Four years after explantation of the DJBL median body weight in these ten patients was 95.2 kg (IQR 91.7-115.2) compared to 102.0 kg at baseline (IQR 95.0-124.4), corresponding with a median BMI of 32.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR 30.7-33.7) compared to 32.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at baseline (IQR 31.9-34.0).

The most common cause of monogenic obesity is a mutation in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (<italic>MC4R</italic>), which is part of the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Mutations in this pathway can lead to an imbalance in energy homeostasis and therefore obesity. Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques can be used for determination of underlying genetic variations. Even so, with more knowledge on obesity associated genes and their possible influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery, it could be possible to further personalize treatment.</p><p id="Par1152"><bold>Methods:</bold> A custom NGS-assay aimed at enrichment of 255 known obesity genes or putative obesity candidate genes was developed. Analysis of 52 obesity associated genes was performed as a diagnostic gene panel-test by the genome diagnostics laboratory of the UMC Utrecht. Patient inclusion criteria were: redo-surgery for insufficient weight loss, BMI &gt; 50kg/m<sup>2</sup> or childhood age of onset of obesity. Genomic DNA of 1014 patients was sequenced at &gt; 100X median coverage, yielding a 15X horizontal gene panel coverage of &gt;95%.</p><p id="Par1153"><bold>Results:</bold> Multiple known pathogenic mutations and genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) were identified. Nine patients showed a mutation in <italic>MC4R</italic>; six of these patients underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery. After two years, mean %Total Body Weight Loss (%TBWL) of 26.6 (±12.9) was achieved, compared to %TBWL of 32.6 (± 9.9) (p=0.421) in 102 patients without mutations on the gene panel matched for age and BMI.</p><p id="Par1154"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Follow-up of the patients with a <italic>MC4R</italic> mutation is necessary to assess the long term effect of bariatric procedures. In parallel, analysis of all identified pathogenic mutations and VUS of the 52 obesity associated genes with their effect on weight loss will be performed. Analysis of the 203 (candidate) obesity associated genes could uncover novel genetic causes of obesity. Results from these studies can potentially be used to develop personalized treatment options in patients with morbidly obesity.</p><p id="Par1155"><bold>O-077</bold></p><p id="Par1156"><bold>Appetite, Glycemia, and Entero-Insular Hormone Responses Differ Between Oral, Gastric-Remnant, and Duodenal Administration of a Mixed Meal Test After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass</bold></p><p id="Par1157"><underline>Daniel Gero</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Robert E.

Significantly higher insulin response was observed after oral route [1,2], which can be attributed to the early exposure of intestinal L-cells to undigested food (hindgut theory) or to the lack of stimulation of an un-identified duodenal anti-incretin pathway (foregut theory). Given that the intestinal hormonal response to nutrients is caloric-rate dependent, we hypostatized that the meal administration by gastrostomy might be biased by the intact pyloric function regulating gastric emptying. Therefore, we examined the appetite and metabolic responses after RYGB by three feeding routes, with an additional duodenostomy (Figure 1).</p><p id="Par1165"><bold>Methods:</bold> A standard liquid MT was administered orally, into the gastric remnant, or intraduodenally 6 months after RYGB in 1 patient, 2-times per each route. Changes in plasma glucose, insulin, GLP-1, GIP, PYY, and appetite were measured pre- and up to 120 minutes postprandially.</p><p id="Par1166"><bold>Results (Figure 2):</bold> Postprandial GLP-1 and PYY responses were similar, whereas glucose, insulin, and GIP levels differed markedly after oral <italic>vs</italic>. intraduodenal feeding. Intraduodenal feeding prompted an intermediate appetite response (i.e., between oral and intragastric). For postprandial glucose, insulin, and GIP levels, the intraduodenal route was more similar to the intragastric than oral route (30-min insulinema: gastric≈60pmol/l, duodenal≈250pmol/l, oral≈1615pmol/l). Intragastric administration did not evoke changes in appetite, glucose, or insulin; however, it slightly increased GLP-1 and PYY, and moderately increased GIP.</p><p id="Par1167"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study is the first to compare metabolic responses to MT administered by three different routes after RYGB. Findings indicate that appetite and metabolic responses depend on the route by which nutrients enter the gastrointestinal tract and that the remnant gastric emptying rate interferes with outcomes. Hence, intraduodenal meal administration should be used in future studies to circumvent this bias.</p><p id="Par1168"><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par1169">Pournaras DJ, Aasheim ET, Bueter M, Ahmed AR, Welbourn R, Olbers T, le Roux CW.

Levels of serum hepcidin (the inflammatory-induced iron regulatory peptide), the erythroid iron deficiency markers (soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR1) and Zn- PPIX), the gene expression of duodenal iron carriers (DMT1 and ferroportin) and of hepcidin in adipose tissue, and the inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, orosomucoïde) were measured. For all patients, iron supplementation was stopped 3 weeks before E1.</p><p id="Par1198"><bold>Results</bold>: Despite normal iron balance, sTfR1 and Zn-PPIX were significantly decreased at E2 compared to E1, suggestive of recovery from erythroid iron deficiency as confirmed by increased MCV and decreased reticulocytes values. Interestingly, the level of serum hepcidin was enhanced despite significant decrease of inflammatory markers suggestive of increased iron availability from absorptive cells. Indeed, increased DMT1-mRNA expression was significantly correlated with decreased body weight. Increased serum hepcidin was <bold>independent from local fat tissues production, which remained unchanged</bold>. Finally, serum levels of B12 vitamin and folate were increased, which could additionally improve the efficiency of erythropoiesis.</p><p id="Par1199"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: This study shed a new light in effective iron recovery pathways after sleeve gastrectomy involving: 1- suppression of inflammation, 2-improvement of iron absorption, 3- iron supply and efficiency of erythropoiesis, and finally beneficial control of iron homeostasis by hepcidin. Thus, recommendations of iron supplementation of patients after sleeve surgery may not be systematically necessary.</p><p id="Par1200"><bold>O-080</bold></p><p id="Par1201"><bold>Sleeve gastrectomy: Does the procedure impact gut hormones or the induced weight loss does</bold></p><p id="Par1202"><underline>Panagiotis Patrikakos</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Stylianos Kapiris<sup>2, b)</sup>, Despoina Perrea<sup>3, c)</sup>, Theodoros Mauromatis<sup>2, d)</sup></p><p id="Par1203"><sup>1)</sup>Surgery, General Hospital Patra, Patra, Greece; <sup>2)</sup>3rd Surgical Department, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece; <sup>3)</sup>Division of Experimental Surgery, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par1204"><sup>a)</sup>ppatrikakos@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1205"><sup>b)</sup>stkapiris@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par1206"><sup>c)</sup>dperrea@med.uoa.gr</p><p id="Par1207"><sup>d)</sup>thmauro@yahoo.gr</p><p id="Par1208"><bold>Introduction</bold>: Sleeve gastrectomy is a well defined and established procedure in the arsenal of bariatric choices. There have been proposed many mechanisms of action as far as it concerns the mechanisms of weight loss and many studies investigate the long term metabolic outcome. With this study we prospectively investigated appetite and gut hormone changes in response to LSG in adiposity-matched non-diabetic patients.</p><p id="Par1209"><bold>Patients and methods</bold>: Ten morbidly obese patients programmed for LSG were chosen with an average BMI of 45Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The patients were submitted in a series of blood sampling before and after a standard meal before the LSG and the same protocol was applied 3 years later. Ghrelin, leptin ,insulin, glucose, GLP1 and blood lipids were measured.</p><p id="Par1210"><bold>Results</bold>: There were documented changes in des-acyl ghrelin which was reduced after LSG but acyl Ghrelin was not affected. GLP1 patterns had borderline changes in post prandial fluctuation. Glucose and insulin metabolism showed an improved profile in comparison with the pre LSG fluctuation. Blood lipid profile did not change with the exception of triglycerides values which were lower.</p><p id="Par1211"><bold>Discussion</bold>: LSG is an adequate procedure in terms of weight loss and induces beneficial metabolic changes as far as it concerns better glycaemic control at least in patients with pro-diabetes. But the mechanism of action seems to have stronger link to food restriction leading to weight loss than the LSG induced hormone changes.</p><p id="Par1212"><bold>O-081</bold></p><p id="Par1213"><bold>Taste sensitivity to dietary fat before and after bariatric surgery: A cross-sectional study of oleic acid taste detection thresholds with correlation to GLP-1 profiles</bold></p><p id="Par1214"><underline>Janine Makaronidis</underline><sup>1, 2, 3, a)</sup>, Cormac Magee<sup>1, 2, b)</sup>, Giulia Argentesi<sup>1, 2, 3, c)</sup>, Friedrich Jassil<sup>1, d)</sup>, Jenny Jones<sup>1, e)</sup>, Andrea Pucci<sup>2, 1, f)</sup>, Andrew Jenkinson<sup>2)</sup>, Majid Hashemi<sup>2)</sup>, Mohamed Elkalaawy<sup>2)</sup>, Marco Adamo<sup>2)</sup>, Rachel Batterham<sup>1, 2, 3, g)</sup></p><p id="Par1215"><sup>1)</sup>Centre for Obesity Research, Division of Medicine, University College London, London, United Kingdom; <sup>2)</sup>University College London Hospital (UCLH) Bariatric Centre for Weight Management and Metabolic Surgery, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom; <sup>3)</sup>UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research, London, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par1216"><sup>a)</sup>makaronidis.janine@doctors.org.uk</p><p id="Par1217"><sup>b)</sup>cormac.magee@nhs.net</p><p id="Par1218"><sup>c)</sup>g.argentesi@nhs.net</p><p id="Par1219"><sup>d)</sup>friedrich.jassil.13@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="Par1220"><sup>e)</sup>jjones_dsl@yahoo.co.uk</p><p id="Par1221"><sup>f)</sup>a.pucci@nhs.net</p><p id="Par1222"><sup>g)</sup>r.batterham@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="Par1223"><bold>Background and Aims</bold>: Taste changes and reduced preference for dietary fat are thought to be key contributors to the altered eating behavior seen following bariatric surgery and to contribute to sustained weight loss. Meal-stimulated levels of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), rise following bariatric surgery. GLP-1 has potent appetite suppressing effects and is believed to be a mediator for post-bariatric surgery weight loss. Furthermore, GLP-1 has been implicated in modifying taste. We hypothesised a link between post-surgery GLP-1 changes and reduced dietary fat preference and investigated taste sensitivity to oleic acid in the fasted and fed state, perceived hedonic value of varying fat-contents in a liquid meal and GLP-1 levels in plasma and saliva in people with obesity awaiting bariatric surgery and post-surgery.</p><p id="Par1224"><bold>Methods:</bold> 9 pre-surgery and 9 post-surgery individuals from a Bariatric Surgical Centre were recruited to a cross-sectional study. Taste detection thresholds for oleic acid were assessed fasted and following a 478kcal meal, using a forced choice methodology. The hedonic value of varying fat content in a meal was assessed. Serial plasma and saliva samples were collected and GLP-1 levels measured.</p><p id="Par1225"><bold>Results</bold>: Fasted taste detection thresholds for oleic acid were similar in the two groups (4.3 vs. 5.1mM, p=0.617). Post-meal oleic acid detection thresholds were higher in the pre-surgery group (4.3 vs. 9.1mM p=0.028) but did not change in the post-surgery group (5.1 vs. 6.6mM, p=0.541). Post-surgery meal fat-content negatively correlated with hedonic value (Spearman r=-1), no correlation was observed pre-surgery. Plasma GLP-1 levels increased post-meal with a higher meal-stimulated peak in the post-surgery group (p&lt;0.0001), whereas salivary GLP-1 levels were unchanged by the meal. However, tasting oleic acid lead to an increase in salivary GLP-1 levels in the fasted state in both groups.</p><p id="Par1226"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our findings suggest a potential link between post-bariatric surgery changes in taste toward fatty acids, food preference away from fat-rich foods and salivary GLP-1 levels.</p><p id="Par1227"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1228">1.

The number of morbidly obese pediatric and adolescent patients is progressively increasing [1]. In the past two decades, bariatric surgery has become an increasingly popular form for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, data on adolescent patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are scarce in the literature, focusing mainly on patients over 18 years-old [2-4]. We therefore aimed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of LSG on weight loss and comorbidities resolution in morbidly obese patients strictly under 18 years-old.</p><p id="Par1268"><bold>Methods:</bold> Prospectively collected data from 1474 consecutive patients undergoing single-incision LSG in our department were retrospectively analyzed. Adolescent candidates for bariatric surgery were referred by a tertiary care center for pediatric obesity. For weight loss and comorbidity evaluation, only patients with at least 1-year follow-up were included in our analysis.</p><p id="Par1269"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 77 adolescent patients underwent single-incision LSG. Median age of the cohort was 17 years (range: 15-18 years). Median weight was 119.5 kg (range: 86-227 kg), with median BMI of 42.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range: 31.5-74.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Median duration of surgery was 68.5 minutes. One major complication was recorded: a patient developed severe pneumonia that necessitated ventilatory support and intravenous antibiotics with a hospital stay of 12 days. Mortality was null. Median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Mean excess weight loss was 50.7%, 62.2%, 77.7% and 79% at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after LSG, respectively. Improvement of type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea and a statistically significant remission for arthralgia were noted 1 year after surgery.</p><p id="Par1270"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> LSG can be safely performed in the under 18 years-old, with good results regarding weight loss and comorbidities remission. A careful patient selection by an expert multidisciplinary team is essential. To our knowledge, this is the largest report of patients strictly younger than 18 years-old undergoing LSG for the treatment of morbid obesity.</p><p id="Par1271"><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par1272">Cunningham SA, Kramer MR, Narayan KM (2014) Incidence of childhood obesity in the United States.

Sensitivity analyses assess the robustness of the results.</p><p id="Par1314"><bold>Results:</bold> The initial analysis resulted in mean costs for RYGB, AGB and SG of £3,872, £1,916 and £3,769 respectively. Increasing seniority of staff involved in the procedures increased mean costs for all procedures by approximately £200. Reducing the list prices of consumables by 20% reduced mean costs of RYGB, AGB and SG to £3,354 (-13%), £1,687 (-12%) and £3,195 (-15%) respectively. Procedures at publicly-funded hospitals were generally more expensive due to longer procedural times when trainees were operating. Compared to costs estimates for either RYGB or AGB reported in the literature (mean £9,288) our estimates are substantially lower. Differences may be explained by the use of disparate timeframes in which costs were measured and limited application of micro-costing in existing studies.</p><p id="Par1315"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Detailed costs of the three procedures will allow for precise setting of payments, appropriate budgeting by providers and support comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses that will assess the additional costs of care, re-operations and life-long support received by bariatric patients.</p><p id="Par1316"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This study is funded by The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) programme (project number 09/127/53) for which Richard Welbourn, Nicolas Carter, James Byrne, Chris A.

The increase in obesity cases[3] has led to an increase in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG)[4], with a successful weight loss and remission or improvement of comorbidities[5]. However, its impact on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are yet to be determined. As CRF is an indicator of health and life expectancy[6,7], the objective of this study was to determine the impact of weight loss, after SG, on CRF.</p><p id="Par1326"><bold>Methods:</bold> 24 women with obesity, mean age of 36 years old and BMI of 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were evaluated preoperatively to a SG and then after a one and three months postoperative. Patients performed a submaximal cardiopulmonary test on a cyclo-ergometer Monark 915 E to obtain peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak). During the test, gas exchange was measured using a Cortex Metalyzer 3B and heart rate was monitored. A gradual protocol was used, cycling at 60 rpm, starting at 0.5 Watts/kg of body weight with gradual increase of 20 Watts/2 min until the stopping criteria. Weight loss was expressed as % Excess Weight Loss (%EWL). ANOVA was used to detect statistical significance for changes in CRF and the Spearman correlation coefficient (Rho) for the association between the variables. Data was analysed using SPSS 21.0 software.</p><p id="Par1327"><bold>Results:</bold> The absolute VO<sub>2</sub>peak decreased after the first (p&lt;0.001) and third month (p=0.001) of the SG compared to preoperative evaluation. The %EWL obtained at the first post-surgical month was inversely correlated with the change in absolute VO<sub>2</sub>peak (Rho=-0.636, p=0.001). In the same way, the %EWL at the third month was inversely correlated with the change in absolute VO<sub>2</sub>peak (Rho=-0.490, p=0.015).</p><p id="Par1328"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> After SG, greater weight loss is associated with a greater reduction in VO<sub>2</sub> peak, suggesting the need to implement physical training programs both before and after SG.</p><p id="Par1329"><bold>References</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par1330">Mandviwala T, Khalid U, Deswal A.

Measurement was performed using dual frequency body composition meter. The treatment was performed for 1510 healthy females for 3months. Body weight (63.6 kg ± 10.2 → 57.3 kg ± 9.0) Body fat mass (23.8 kg ± 7.1 → 18.6 kg ± 6.4) body muscle mass (37.5 kg ± 4.1 → 36.5 kg ± 3.9) .The basal metabolic rate per kg of body weight (19.2 kal ± 1.8 → 20.2 kcal ± 1) showed a significant decrease. Between body fat percentage and visceral fat level with respect to the amount of BMI at the start had high correlation. Furthermore, analysis was performed in 5 groups according to the rate of body weight change after the end of the measurement. As a result, a correlation was found between the basal metabolic rate and the muscle mass at the beginning, and the weight loss rate depends on the initial basal metabolism It was confirmed that the higher the basal metabolic rate at the start, the greater the weight loss rate. Weight loss effects were observed in "non-obese people and healthy adult subjects by" auricle acupuncture stimulation by particles ". In addition, it was considered that the setting point of the satiety center including leptin sensitivity was reset by stimulation of the auricular acupuncture as well as improving the constitution by the change of the dietary life for 3 months because rebound was not confirmed.</p><p id="Par1354"><bold>References:</bold> ● Yeh ML, Chu NF, Hsu MY, Hsu CC, Chung YC:Acupoint Stimulation on Weight Reduction for Obesity: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Study.

Since no causal therapy exists, symptomatic approaches with glycemic control, renin-angiotensin inhibition and blood pressure control are applied. Early diagnosis of DN is pivotal to prevent progression, but none of the established biomarkers reliably measure impaired kidney function in DN, especially at its early stages. This study evaluates the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on kidney function using serum uromodulin (sUMOD) in diabetic patients with a high risk for DN.</p><p id="Par1369"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Fifteen obese patients with T2DM, fifteen without T2DM as well as sixteen non-severely obese patients (BMI 25-35 kg/m²) undergoing RYGB were enrolled. The control group consisted of 190 healthy subjects without diabetes. Change of sUMOD in obese patients with and without T2DM and in non-severely obese patients before and after metabolic surgery was compared with creatinine and cystatin C. Healthy subjects were used as a reference.</p><p id="Par1370"><bold>Results:</bold> sUMOD levels in non-severely obese diabetic patients were 140.6±80.8 ng/ml preoperatively. After RYGB, sUMOD levels in non-severely obese, in obese patients with T2DM and without T2DM significantly increased within six months (p=&lt;0.05). In comparison to sUMOD levels of the control group, baseline levels of diabetic patients were significantly lower (p=&lt;0.05). The levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the MDRD-formula significantly improved postoperatively within 6 months with mean eGFR levels &gt;89 ml/min/1,73m² (p=&lt;0.05). Also serum creatinine levels in diabetic patients improved significantly 6 months after RYGB (p=&lt;0.05). Mean urinary albumin-creatinine ratio was halfed postoperatively.</p><p id="Par1371"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> sUMOD significantly increased in non-severely obese and obese patients with T2DM undergoing RYGB, indicating a profound recovery of kidney function. The sUMOD levels in these groups were comparable to levels of healthy subjects, whereas conventional markers were in the normal range. Furthermore, sUMOD may discover impaired kidney function earlier and provide a more precise estimate of function compared to traditionally used parameters of kidney function.</p><p id="Par1372"><bold>O-091</bold></p><p id="Par1373"><bold>Histopathology Findings in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy</bold></p><p id="Par1374"><underline>Angelo Iossa</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Ammiel Martinez Canil<sup>b)</sup>, Daniela Caporilli<sup>c)</sup>, Francesco De Angelis<sup>d)</sup>, Gianfranco Silecchia<sup>e)</sup></p><p id="Par1375">Department of medico-surgical sciences and biotechnologies, University of Rome "Sapienza", Division of General surgery and bariatric centre of excellence, Latina, Italy</p><p id="Par1376"><sup>a)</sup>angelo.iossa@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1377"><sup>b)</sup>ammielmartinezcanil@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1378"><sup>c)</sup>daniela.caporilli@uniroma1.it</p><p id="Par1379"><sup>d)</sup>francescodeangelis7@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1380"><sup>e)</sup>gianfranco.silecchia@uniroma1.it</p><p id="Par1381"><bold>Background</bold>: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has gained popularity in the last 10 years for its good results in weight loss and comorbidity control. However, guidelines on the pathological examination of the specimen are lacking. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the usefulness of the routine specimen examination when presurgery endoscopy (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, UGIE) and multiple gastric biopsies are part of the preoperative work-up.</p><p id="Par1382"><bold>Methods</bold>: A retrospective review of records of the patients submitted to LSG between January 2012 and August 2017 was carried out. Sex, age, histopathology findings in the presurgery endoscopy biopsies and surgical specimen, and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection were analyzed.</p><p id="Par1383"><bold>Results</bold>: A total of 925 patients entered the study group (mean age = 44.1 years, Females = 80.3%, BMI = 44.58 kg/m2). The most common histopathology pattern in the endoscopy biopsies and in the surgical specimens was inactive chronic gastritis (64.4 and 55.6%, respectively). Helicobacter pylori infection was 24.6 and 2.48%, respectively. Ninety-nine percent (n 796) of patients with non-significant endoscopy biopsy findings showed the same patterns in specimen analysis. Only three patients (0.3%) who had intestinal presurgery metaplasia were positive in the specimen analysis, and two cases of gastric stromal neoplasms (gastrointestinal stromal tumor and gastric leiomyoma) were found intraoperatively.</p><p id="Par1384"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Most of the findings are non-significant and can be predicted if UGIE plus multiple biopsies is routinely included in the bariatric work-up with significant cost reduction.

It is even more prevalent in this group than in normal population (1). Educational programs often don’t have the desired effect, so that bariatric surgery could become a part of the treatment of this population. There are only few studies investigating effects of bariatric surgery in patients with ID (2).</p><p id="Par1395"><bold>Methods</bold>: Retrospective review was performed on all patients with ID that underwent bariatric surgery in the University Hospital of Tübingen in the last 5 years. Informed consent was possible to give for all patients.</p><p id="Par1396">We examined BMI and EWL over the course of time. To measure possible deficiencies and even as a dimension to estimate compliance we screened lab results for ferritin, vitamin B12 and folic acid exemplarily after 1 and 2 years.</p><p id="Par1397"><bold>Results</bold>: We identified 12 patients (6 male, 6 female) with diagnosed iID. Mean BMI dropped within the first 6 and 12 months from preoperatively 53.3 ± 10.5 kg/m² to 41.0 ± 12.8 kg/m² and 33.3 ± 10.7 kg/m². Mean EWL reached within the first 6 and 12 months 52.9±17.1% and 58.0±17.9% respectively. 1 year after surgery mean ferritin was 15,7 ± 9,6μg/dl, Vitamin B12 was 27,7 ± 5,5 ng/dl and folic acid was 752,5 ± 273,8 ng/dl. 2 years after surgery mean ferritin was 6,9 ± 7,4 μg/dl, Vitamin B12 was 37 ± 10,6 ng/dl and folic acid was 450,7 ± 67,7 ng/dl. There were no statistical differences between these results and those of patients without ID.</p><p id="Par1398"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Our data are promising. We could show that people with intellectual disabilities benefit from bariatric surgery. Weight loss is adequate in this population and does not differ significantly from other weight loss surgery patients.

This risk is further increased after bariatric surgery. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been investigated in patients after orthopedic surgery. Data regarding the use of DOACs after bariatric surgery is still limited to the early postsurgical period. Whether long-term anatomical and physiological adaptions influence drug pharmacology is currently not known.</p><p id="Par1410"><bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of weight loss and type of bariatric surgery on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of rivaroxaban.</p><p id="Par1411"><bold>Setting:</bold> University Hospital.</p><p id="Par1412"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this single-centre study, bariatric patients received single oral doses of rivaroxaban (10 mg) six to eight months after Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB). PK and PD parameters were compared with values obtained before bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par1413"><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 6 RYGB patients and 6 SG patients were included.

AP which is frequently needed after massive weight loss may be successfully combined with other surgery both intraabdominal and plastic. AP is a good opportunity to improve result of primary bariatric operation by mean of additional metabolic procedure. In some selected cases AP can be successfully done together with main bariatric operation.</p><p id="Par1425"><bold>O-095</bold></p><p id="Par1426"><bold>The Effects of Protein-Riched Diet, Performed Before Bariatric Surgery, On Losing Weight, Clinical Results And Liver Volume Reduction</bold></p><p id="Par1427"><underline>N.

The first 100-consecutive patients were assigned to the control-group and the later 100-consecutive patients to the intervention-group and were asked to watch an online-lecture of 15-minutes 1-2-weeks prior to the surgery-date. All participants completed a BS nutrition-knowledge questionnaire and the state-trait anxiety-inventory (STAI) questionnaire at the bariatric-committee and once again at the pre-surgery clinic.

This must be kept in mind even after a bariatric operation. A continuous medical guidance and supervision of operated patients is mandatory. But the attendance of aftercare consultations rapidly decreases worldwide after the operation. We analyzed the frequency of visits over a five year period.</p><p id="Par1486"><bold>Method</bold>: A cohort of 385 patients operated in 2011 was followed up to the end of 2016. Patients contacts with the Outpatient Clinic were taken from the patients file. Each patient received at each visit a new date for the next control. There was no recall system.</p><p id="Par1487"><bold>Results</bold>: The rate of patients coming to the Outpatient center was 95% after 1 year, 85% after 2 years, 50% after 3 years, 42% after 4 years, 27% after 5 years and 18% after 6 years. The range of visits per person per year was 1-27 contacts a year. The attending patients contacted the center 5961 times. Mean attendance frequency of visits per person/year was nearly constant over the time showing 4 visits per year. We further analyzed whether there was a difference between German patients and patients with migration background ( 27% ) concerning the attendance of aftercare. There was no difference for the first 4 years, after that time Non-German patients were seen less often.</p><p id="Par1488"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: For many reasons patients who got a bariatric operation omit to attend the follow-up visits soon after the operation. Although patients preoperatively sign an agreement to attend life-long aftercare after the operation we have to state that they do not follow this repeated instruction. This is a worldwide phenomenon. New tools seem to be necessary to keep patients under surveillance.</p><p id="Par1489"><bold>O-099</bold></p><p id="Par1490"><bold>Interpersonal characters among bariatric candidates compared to control group</bold></p><p id="Par1491"><underline>Inbal Globus</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Anat Brunstein-Klomek<sup>2, b)</sup>, Yael Latzer<sup>3, c)</sup></p><p id="Par1492"><sup>1)</sup>Public Health, Haifa University, Haifa, Israel; <sup>2)</sup>School of Psychology, Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzliya, Israel; <sup>3)</sup>Faculty of social Welfare and Health Sciences, Haifa University, Haifa, Israel</p><p id="Par1493"><sup>a)</sup>inbal.balog@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1494"><sup>b)</sup>bkanat@idc.ac.il</p><p id="Par1495"><sup>c)</sup>latzery@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1496"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Studies have found that patients with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) have difficulties in their interpersonal relationship. There is limited research examining interpersonal relationships among bariatric patients. Interpersonal characters refer to a variety of abilities, including assertiveness, the capacity to initiate a conversation, the ability for emotional regulation and more. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in interpersonal characters between bariatric candidates and a control group including individuals with normal weight, overweight and obese.</p><p id="Par1497"><bold>Methods:</bold> A hundred and sixty six adult bariatric candidates in Israel (Mean BMI = 40.7 sd = 5.1) (mean age= 43.2; sd = 11.3) participated in the study. They were compared to 82 controls who were divided into three groups: normal weight (N= 41) (Mean BMI = 22.1 sd = 1.8) (Mean age = 41.4; sd = 9.1), Overweight (N= 27) (Mean BMI = 26.9; sd = 1.4) (Mean age = 41.8; sd = 8.03) and obese (N= 14) (Mean BMI = 34.05; sd = 4.05) (Mean age = 52.7; sd = 9.8). All participants completed surveys addressing demographic, eating disorders (EDE-Q), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS) and interpersonal characters(SAS-SR, IIP).</p><p id="Par1498"><bold>Results:</bold> Bariatric candidates had significantly more difficulties in “primary relationship” (intimate relationships) and were higher in being “too caring” (the tendency to put other people's needs before your own).

Weight concern levels were also found to be significantly higher amongst bariatric candidates compared to all three of the sub control groups.</p><p id="Par1499"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings are in line with previous studies which found difficulties with intimate relationships and nurturance among BED patients.

Bariatric surgery is a well-established treatment modality, which leads to weight and comorbidity loss over the course of time. Nevertheless, in a significant number of patients the changes in the gastrointestinal tract result in relevant micronutrient deficiencies. One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) is an excellent procedure to reduce weight and comorbidities, but has yet to be evaluated for its impact on micronutrient deficiencies.</p><p id="Par1528"><bold>Methods.</bold> A prospectively fed database including all patients undergoing OAGB between 11/2012 and 12/2014 was retrospectively analysed. A regular follow up was carried out preoperatively as well as 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months and yearly thereafter. Systemic levels of parathyroid hormone, vitamins (A, D, E, B12), folic acid, magnesium, calcium, iron, albumin and ferritin were retrieved and correlated with clinical parameters (excess weight loss, length of limb, sex, age).</p><p id="Par1529"><bold>Results.</bold> A total number of 149 patients were evaluated (female/male:109/40). In general, OAGB led to an average %Excess weight loss (%EWL) of 81% (+/-25,6%) and a median body mass index (BMI) decrease from 45.5 kg/m2 to 29.3kg/m2. Preoperative deficiencies were seen in 25-Hydroxy-vitamin D (95%), folic acid (39%), ferritin (6%), iron (16%), vitamin A (4%) and B12 (2%); no deficiencies were found in calcium, magnesium, vitamin E or albumin. In patients with long (&gt;200cm) biliopancreatic limb a significantly lower 25-OH-vitamin D level was seen 12 months postoperatively when compared to shorter limb (≤200cm; p=0.0462). Regarding %EWL after 12 months, significantly lower serum protein levels (p=0.01) were found in patients with high (≥80%) %EWL when compared to low (&lt;80%) %EWL.</p><p id="Par1530"><bold>Conclusion.</bold> OAGB is an easily feasible procedure to achieve weight loss and a reduction of comorbidities. It’s a combination of both a restrictive and a malabsorptive component leading to a reduced intake and absorption of essential micronutrients and vitamins. Therefore, a thorough pre- and postoperative screening for micronutrient deficiencies has to be carried out in order to prevent long-term complications.</p><p id="Par1531"><bold>O-102</bold></p><p id="Par1532"><bold>Metabolic Surgeons self-assessing sexual health issues in disease management of morbid obese patients at the Austrian Congress of Surgeons, June 2017</bold></p><p id="Par1533"><underline>Lucia Ucsnik</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Felix Langer<sup>1)</sup>, Andrea Kottmel<sup>2)</sup>, Thomas Dorner<sup>3)</sup>, Johannes Bitzer<sup>4)</sup>, Bela Teleky<sup>1)</sup>, Gerhard Prager<sup>1)</sup></p><p id="Par1534"><sup>1)</sup>Dpt of Surgery, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria; <sup>2)</sup>Private Practice for Gynecology and Sexual Medicine, Vienna, Austria; <sup>3)</sup>Center for Public Health, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria; <sup>4)</sup>Private Practice for Gynecology, Basel, Switzerland</p><p id="Par1535"><sup>a)</sup>lucia.ucsnik@meduniwien.ac.at</p><p id="Par1536"><bold>Introduction</bold>: Bariatric Surgery does have an impact on sexual health, fertility, contraception and reproduction. Thus this issue needs to be integrated in disease-management of morbid obese patients.</p><p id="Par1537"><bold>Material</bold>: The integration of sexual health issues in medical routine was self-assessed by surgeons during 2 bariatric sessions at the Annual Austrian Congress for Surgeons, June 2017, via 3-parted survey on the morbid obeses patients treated, the offer for treatment, surgeon’s professional profile.</p><p id="Par1538"><bold>Results</bold>: 11 of 34 surgeons participated in the survey (return-rate 31,42%), 55% working at university, 36% in public hospital. 73 % of them asked up to 20% of the patients about sexual problems, 18% not at all, only 9% of the doctors 80-100% of the patients. 63% of the surgeons were asked by up to 20% of the patients on sexual dysfunction, 36,6% of the doctors weren't asked at all. The surgeons suggested the following reasons for non-addressing the topic by the patients: topics more relevant (8), lack of time (7), language-barrier (3), embarrassing topic (2), shame (1). Medical situations for bringing up the topic by the doctors were assessed: concrete diagnoses (55%), prevention (36%), andro-/menopause (36%), 27% before/after surgery. Neither public nor university hospitals had established sexual-medicine appointments. 55% of the doctors refer to gynaecologists/urologists, 36% to andrologists, 27% to psychosomatic specialists, each 18% to internal medicine (cardiology, endocrinology). No surgeon participating in this survey had further training nor expertise in the field of sexual medicine.</p><p id="Par1539"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: 80% of the morbid obese patients were not asked at all about their sexual health by metabolic surgons. Only 9% of the surgeons brought up the topic of "sexuality and intimacy" in 81-100% of the patients treated. Thus there's a need for raising awareness of the importance and relevance of sexual health in morbid obese patients. In surgeons, too, there's a need for special medical training in sexual medicine in order to treat morbid obese patients state-of-the art according to the WHO-concept of health.</p><p id="Par1540"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1541">Brotto L<sup>1</sup>, Atallah S<sup>2</sup>, Johnson-Agbakwu C<sup>3</sup>, Rosenbaum T<sup>4</sup>, Abdo C<sup>5</sup>, Byers ES<sup>6</sup>, Graham C<sup>7</sup>, Nobre P<sup>8</sup>, Wylie K<sup>9</sup>, “Psychological and Interpersonal Dimensions of Sexual Function and Dysfunction”, J SexMed. 2016 Apr;13(4):538-71. doi: 10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.01.019.

Thus, O3FA are essential components of immunonutrition (IMN). A previous study of our group demonstrated that the preoperative administration of IMN was associated with a greater preoperative weight loss, and lower postoperative pain and acute-phase reactants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the isolate effect of O3FA on these parameters in patients undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).</p><p id="Par1575"><bold>Material and methods</bold>: We performed a prospective randomized study of patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: those ones receiving hyperproteic supplements 14 days before surgery (Control group: CG) and those ones receiving hyperproteic supplements enriched with O3FA. Preoperative weight loss and postoperative pain and acute-phase reactants were assessed.</p><p id="Par1576"><bold>Results</bold>: 42 patients were included, 21 in each group.

The supplemental sources, tolerable upper intake level and potential adverse effects of excess intake should be considerate. Protein intake should reach 60 g/day and up to 1.5 g/kg ideal body weight while higher protein intake is associated to lower lean body mass loss post-operatively. Patients should be advised to incorporate moderate aerobic physical activity and strength training 2 to 3 times per week, with most benefit being derived from weight-bearing and muscle loading exercise.

The 1-year P1NP/βCTX ratio did not correlate with BMI or ΔBMI, but inversely correlated with age (R=-0.23, P=0.014) and with hsCRP (R=-0.26, P=0.009), even after adjustment of age, sex, BMI and lifestyle; and linearly correlated with albumin (R=0.2, P=0.037) (Table 1). At baseline none of these correlations were detectable. Both P1NP and βCTX correlated with BMI at baseline (R=0.23, P=0.014 and R=0.25, P=0.007, respectively), but not at 1-year. At 1-year, P1NP and βCTX individually correlated with PTH levels (R= 0.22, P= 0.02, R=0.23, P= 0.015), and P1NP also correlated with Ca2+ levels (R= 0.16, P= 0.009), and inversely with hsCRP (R= -0.2, P= 0.045) and trigliceridemia (R= -0.29, P= 0.002).

In rare cases, hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia occurs. The mechanisms behind these responses are incompletely understood, but a role for beta cell activity (BCA) and beta cell mass (BCM) is hypothesized. Studying the role of BCM in changed glycaemic control after RYGB <italic>in vivo</italic> is possible using Exendin-4, a stable analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1, that specifically accumulates in the beta cells. <sup>68</sup>Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT can be used to quantify BCM.</p><p id="Par1632"><bold>Methods:</bold> BCA and BCM were compared between patients with different responses in glycaemic control after RYGB. Five patients with complete remission of T2D (responders), five patients without complete remission of T2D (non-responders) and five patients with hypoglycaemia after RYGB were included. BCA was measured by an arginine stimulation test. Total pancreatic uptake of <sup>68</sup>Ga-exendin-4 was determined by quantitative analysis of PET/CT scans as measure for BCM.</p><p id="Par1633"><bold>Results:</bold> Patient characteristics and weight loss were comparable between the groups. BCA was significantly lower in non-responders compared to responders; the arginine stimulated acute C-peptide response was 0.4±0.2 and 0.9±0.3 nmol/l, respectively (p=0.02). Pancreatic <sup>68</sup>Ga-exendin-4 uptake was 26% lower in non-responders (83±58 kBq) compared to responders (111±55 kBq), although not statistically significant (p=0.088). BCA and BCM did not correlate (linear, Pearson R=0.30, p=0.40). In hypoglycaemia patients, BCM was significantly higher than in responders (191±63 kBq, p=0.032).</p><p id="Par1634"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The data of this study suggest that BCM is higher in T2D patients with complete remission compared to non-responders after RYGB. BCA did not correlate with BCM. Furthermore, patients with hypoglycaemia have a higher BCM than T2D responders. In conclusion, BCM may play important role in patient's response to RYGB. Furthermore, <sup>68</sup>Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT is a feasible technique to measure BCM <italic>in vivo</italic> and may be applied to find underlying mechanisms in T2D and post-RYGB hypoglycemia.</p><p id="Par1635"><bold>O-108</bold></p><p id="Par1636"><bold>Features of oral glucose tolerance test in patients with and without late dumping after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: it’s all about speed.</bold></p><p id="Par1637"><underline>Ilke Marien</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Eveline Dirinck<sup>1, b)</sup>, Guy Hubens<sup>2, c)</sup>, Luc Van Gaal<sup>1, d)</sup></p><p id="Par1638"><sup>1)</sup>Endocrinology, diabetology and metabolic diseases, University Hospital of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium</p><p id="Par1639"><sup>2)</sup>Abdominal Surgery, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium</p><p id="Par1640"><sup>a)</sup>ilke.marien@uza.be</p><p id="Par1641"><sup>b)</sup>eveline.dirinck@uza.be</p><p id="Par1642"><sup>c)</sup>guy.hubens@uza.be</p><p id="Par1643"><sup>d)</sup>luc.vangaal@uza.be</p><p id="Par1644"><bold>Background</bold> Hypoglycemia is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB).

Most often dumping can be avoided with dietary changes. Severe dumping syndrome is characterized by multiple daily episodes with significant impact on quality-of-life. As dumping correlates with rapid pouch emptying through a dilated gastrojejunostomy, the aim of this study was to assess endoluminal revision of the anastomosis regarding feasibility, safety and outcome.</p><p id="Par1665"><bold>Methods:</bold> From January 2016 to November 2017 we reviewed the electronic records of all patients with dumping syndrome undergoing endoluminal revision of the gastrojejunostomy with the Apollo Overstitch system (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Texas, USA). Demographic details, procedure details and outcome variables were recorded.</p><p id="Par1666"><bold>Results:</bold> There were 21 patients (M:F=6:15) treated with endoluminal revision for either dumping syndrome (n=13) or dumping syndrome and weight-regain (n=8). The median procedure time was 17 minutes (R 8-41), with a median number of 1 suture (range 1-3). There were no complications recorded within 30 days (no bleeding, no re-intervention, no infection, no dilation). All patients had treatment response, with 66.6% having resolved and 33.3% having improved symptoms. Recurrence of symptoms occurred in 6 (46.1%) of 13 patients treated for dumping only, of them 5 patients required a second Apollo intervention while 1 patient underwent laparoscopic pouch revision with placement of a silastic ring, with subsequent treatment response.</p><p id="Par1667"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Endoluminal revision of the dilated gastrojejunostomy is a highly effective treatment for dumping syndrome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Due to its endoluminal approach it is a very feasible and safe procedure, and effective for immediate symptom resolution in nearly all patients. In some patients repeat narrowing of the anastomosis is necessary for maintenance of symptom resolution.</p><p id="Par1668"><bold>O-110</bold></p><p id="Par1669"><bold>Impact of implementation of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program in in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A prospective randomized clinical trial</bold></p><p id="Par1670"><underline>Jaime Ruiz-Tovar</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Carolina Llavero, Cesar Levano, Juan Gonzalez, Alejandro Garcia, Carlos Ferrigni, Montiel Jimenez-Fuertes, Manuel Duran, Damian Garcia-Olmo</p><p id="Par1671">Surgery, HOSPITAL REY JUAN CARLOS, Madrid, Spain</p><p id="Par1672"><sup>a)</sup>jruiztovar@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1673"><bold>Objectives</bold>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative pain after implementation of an ERAS protocol in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass(RYGB) and compare it with the application of a standard care protocol.</p><p id="Par1674">Summary background data:The essence of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) programs is the multimodal approach and many authors have demonstrated safety and feasibility in fast track bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par1675"><bold>Methods</bold>: A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing RYGB was performed.

The aim of the present study was to analyze 10-year weight loss and metabolic results of RYGBP in a large cohort of consecutive patients in relation to patient age at surgery.</p><p id="Par1702"><bold>Patients and methods</bold>: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained common bariatric database in two reference bariatric centers. Comparisons regarding total weight loss (%TWL), excess BMI loss (%EBMIL), serum glucose and lipid values were made using ANOVA between patients aged 39 years or less (Group A), 40 to 54 (Group B), and 55 or more (Group C).</p><p id="Par1703"><bold>Results</bold>: A total of 822 patients operated between 1999 and 2007 were included, 621 females and 201 males. Groups A, B, and C include 398, 337, and 87 patients respectively. Follow-up at 10 years was 75,5 %. Comorbidities were more common and length of stay longer in Group C. Group A had the highest %TWL and %EBMIL throughout the study period, but the difference was significant only until Year 6. There was no significant difference in %TWL or %EBMIL at any time point between groups B and C. As a result, BMI did not differ between groups after 10 years. 10-year lipid values did not differ between groups, but mean glycemia remained significantly higher at 10 years in Group C.</p><p id="Par1704"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Results of RYGBP are better during the first 5-6 post-operative years in younger patients, but the differences fade away after 10 years. Lipid profile improvement was similar throughout age groups, whereas glycemic control remained better in younger patients.

Banding the gastric pouch and different pouch sizes are used and investigated to improve weight loss after surgery. Following simple physical laws, banding the pouch and creating a longer gastric pouch may affect pouch dilatation and passage and therefore improve results. We present results from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the effect on weight loss of a banded RYGB (B-GB) and an extended pouch RYGB (EP-GB) was compared to a standard RYGB (S-GB).</p><p id="Par1711"><bold>Methods:</bold> In both studies the modified RYGB (B-GB and EP-GB) was compared with a S-GB. In each study a total of 130 patients were randomized into two groups. Subsequently, weight loss, morbidity, reduction of comorbidities, nutritional status, reflux and quality of life were measured during a follow-up of 2 years. The B-GB was created using a non-adjustable MiniMizer silicone ring and in the EP-GB a 15 cm long pouch was formed.</p><p id="Par1712"><bold>Results:</bold> In the 'Banded' study mean EWL after 24 months was 88% in the B-GB group versus 80% in the S-GB group (<italic>p</italic>=0.212) and in the 'Pouch' study, mean EWL was 77% in the EP-GB group versus 73% in the S-GB group (<italic>p</italic>=0.437).

Body mass can be immediately decreased by rapid weight loss via bariatric surgery (BS) and has been found to be associated with improved cognitive function. However, cognitive benefit after BS is not equally exhibited across patients and decline of cognitive function and increase in body weight are reported as well. Due to the relatively short length of follow-up and small numbers of BS recipients described in literature, it is not revealed till now how BS may impact underlying degenerative processes in cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p id="Par1745"><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aim to determine the longitudinal effect of BS on different measures of cognition, brain function and structure investigated with neuropsychological tests and (functional) MRI parameters.

Currently, the best perioperative management of patients without known OSA remains unclear. Although routine OSA screening of bariatric surgical patients has been advocated, sleep studies are costly and time consuming. We hypothesized that bariatric patients can be safely monitored on the surgical ward by continuous postoperative pulse oximetry without preoperative screening for OSA.</p><p id="Par1754"><bold>Methods</bold>: All patients who underwent bariatric surgery between November 2011 and September 2017 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patient files were reviewed for gender, diagnosis of OSA, usage of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), diabetes mellitus (DM) and perioperative details. Postoperatively, continuous pulse oximetry was administered on the surgical ward. Patients with less than two saturation measurements were excluded. Postoperative desaturations of &lt;90% and &lt;92% were defined clinically significant and were further assessed.</p><p id="Par1755"><bold>Results</bold>: 5703 patients were reviewed, of which 5282 met the inclusion criteria. 4197 (79.5%) were female. 684 patients (12.9%) had a preoperative OSA diagnosis. 1326 (25.1%) patients had DM, of which 290 (22%) had both OSA and DM. A desaturation &lt;90% occurred in 4% of patients with OSA and in 2% of patients without diagnosed OSA (p&lt;0.005), a desaturation &lt;92% occurred in 10% and 4% (p&lt;0.005), respectively<italic>.</italic> Complication rates were 10% and 7% (p&lt;0.005). No patients were admitted to the medium or intensive care unit for OSA. In the group of diagnosed OSA patients, CPAP usage showed no significant difference in desaturations or complications. Additionally, patients with DM had significantly higher rates of desaturations and complications compared to patients without DM.</p><p id="Par1756"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: In this cohort of &gt;5000 bariatric patients, postoperative admission to the medium care or intensive care unit was not required in patients with or without diagnosed OSA. These findings suggest that continuous postoperative pulse oximetry without preoperative OSA screening is a safe perioperative management strategy for obese patients who undergo bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par1757"><bold>O-117</bold></p><p id="Par1758"><bold>Self-efficacy in weight management, patient satisfaction and lifestyle habits after standard gastric bypass</bold></p><p id="Par1759">Harilaos Pappis<sup>1, a)</sup>, Iraklis Perysinakis<sup>1, b)</sup>, Dimitra Kotsakou<sup>2, c)</sup>, <underline>Alexia Katsarou</underline><sup>1, d)</sup></p><p id="Par1760"><sup>1)</sup>Third Surgical Department, HYGEIA Hospital, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par1761"><sup>2)</sup>Anaesthesia Department, HYGEIA Hospital, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par1762"><sup>a)</sup>harry.pappis@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1763"><sup>b)</sup>iraklisper@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1764"><sup>c)</sup>dkotsakou@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1765"><sup>d)</sup>katsaroualexia@gmail.com</p><p id="Par1766"><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate self-efficacy in weight management, patient satisfaction and lifestyle habits after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).</p><p id="Par1767"><bold>Methods:</bold> Bariatric patients that underwent LRYGB in a single Surgical Department were included in this study.

Factors that may pose a risk for weight regain include a history of weight cycling, disinhibited eating, binge eating, more hunger, eating in response to negative emotions and stress, and more passive reactions to problems.” 1</p><p id="Par1777">The interdisciplinary team can help post-op patients remain engaged in following through with those behaviors.

However in the obese patient, ultrasonography has a low accuracy for the guidance of the infiltration.</p><p id="Par1839"><bold>Patients and Methods</bold>: A prospective randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) accounts for more than one third of metabolic operations in the world, with high and sustained excess weight loss percentages in most publications.</p><p id="Par1860">As data accumulated in the literature, concerns about several medical and surgical complications were raised. Among medical complications, most common complications are vitamin and nutritional deficiencies, early dumping 'syndrome', and postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PHH) - Nesidioblastosis. PHH is a condition characterized by hypoglycemic symptoms occurring 1–3 hours after a meal, accompanied by low plasma glucose values, typically preceded by a high rise in both glucose and insulin concentrations[iii].</p><p id="Par1861">The incidence of PHH is unknown, and probably underdiagnosed as many patients are asymptomatic. Recurrent hypoglycemia is known to cause dementia, reduce quality of life, and increase all-cause mortality. Moreover, an increased rate of accidental deaths among patients who have undergone RYGB has been reported, and it is speculated that it could be the result of severe hypoglycemia[iv].</p><p id="Par1862">The goal for any treatment of PHH after RYGB is to moderate postprandial excursions in plasma glucose, reduce insulin secretion, and ultimately reduce hypoglycemia. Therapeutic options can be divided to medical and surgical. Medications that help control PHH are scarce, and patients are most commonly encouraged to follow dietary modifications. In cases of refractory patients, surgical treatment options include partial or total pancreatectomy, or a reversal procedure of RYGB accompanied with gastric pouch restriction[v].</p><p id="Par1863">A 27 year old morbid obese female underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 2013.Two years post surgery she developed severe hypoglycemic episodes which included tremor, palpitations and syncope episodes.

It is happened because the bariatric surgery is the very effective means to sustain weight loss. However, some published follow-up studies report an increased rate of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) after a LSG. How to prevent the gastro-esophageal reflux, after LSG, is an important question at the moment.</p><p id="Par1878"><bold>Method</bold>: We developed and applied the new surgical technique of LSG with three-chamber gastric sleeve as a method of preventing GERD after surgery.</p><p id="Par1879">The surgery was performed in a standard split-leg French position using 5 laparoscopic ports. Patients were in chair- position. A special 32-French calibrating bougie with the balloon on the end was passed through the stomach before creating the three-chamber gastric sleeve. The sleeve was made with a linear laparoscopic stapler. The calibration tube is designed to form three gastric chambers of different length and volume. The most important step of this technique is the formation of a long (up to 7 cm) upper post-esophageal gastric chamber of a minimal volume (20 ml). The calibrating bougie was then pulled proximally and the distal balloon was inflated to a larger volume at each subsequent stage. Second chamber should be 10 cm long and 50 ml in the volume. The third pre-pylorus chamber was formed by a length of 5 cm and a volume of 60 ml.</p><p id="Par1880"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The main mechanism of antireflux effect was possible because of the narrowness of the post-esophageal gastric chamber with its weak peristaltic activity and food evacuation due to peristaltic activity of the esophagus. This method showed a positive dynamics in our patients with GERD symptoms one year after LSG and therefore should be studied in the future.</p><p id="Par1881"><bold>V-003</bold></p><p id="Par1882"><bold>Early Small Bowel Obstruction after Bariatric Surgery: Stratefy For Successful Laparoscopic Management</bold></p><p id="Par1883"><underline>Charalampos Markakis</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Ravi Aggarwal, Kai Tai Derek Yeung, Ahmed Ahmed</p><p id="Par1884">Bariatric Surgery, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par1885"><sup>a)</sup>harismarkakis@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par1886"><bold>Aims</bold>: The purpose of this video is to present our experience with patients presenting with early bowel obstruction after bariatric surgery.

Bariatric surgeons must proceed with extensive and meticulous adhesiolysis and free-up the stomach from any attachments to the liver, posteriorly to the pancreas, mesocolon, and omentum. It is imperative for the stomach to return to the original anatomy in order to prevent tension forces due to adhesions while stapling the stomach. Stapling the antrum near the incisura twisting effects are created, while changing stapling angles. Adhesions and attachments especially of the omentum to the antrum can increase twisting forces that lead to gastric outlet stenosis or obstruction and subsequent leak.</p><p id="Par1917"><bold>Conclusions</bold><bold><italic>:</italic></bold> Stomach twisting is quite frequent especially while stapling the stomach antrum after redo LSG.

In 2014 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNY) was performed due to 15kg weight regain (pre-RNY: 80kg, lowest weight post-RNY:70kg).</p><p id="Par1927"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> In 2017 she has presented with nausea, vomiting and severe reflux inspite receiving high dose PPI (Pantoprazole po tds). Gastroscopy showed sliding hiatus hernia and incompetent cardia, Z-line at 34cm. CT-scan has confirmed assymetric wall thickening of the herniated pouch. With upper GI series supradiaphragmatic narrowing was visualized. Her case has been discussed at BARIALINK Academy and besides Hill’s procedure, cardiopexy with ligamentum teres hepatis was suggested as alternative surgical solution.</p><p id="Par1928"><bold>Result</bold><italic>:</italic> Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed where large sliding hiatus hernia was found with intrathoracally migrated gastric pouch. First cruroplasty was made. The ligamentum teres hepatis was too short to be used for cardiopexy, therefore the long remnant sleeve stomach with intact vascularization was brought from medial to lateral from behind the pouch and has been used for "fundoplication" as per Toupet (270 degree). From left lateral edge of the esophagus 4 interrupted 2/0 Ethibond stitches and from medial side 3 stitches were used to form the Toupet cuff. This proximal medial cuff was also fixed to the left crus with one suture. 36Fr orogastric tube was passing freely without resistance. The early postoperative period went without complications. 6 weeks postoperatively she was able to eat and drink, her reflux symptoms resolved completely, currently not using any PPI and returned to her everyday activity.</p><p id="Par1929"><bold>Conclusion</bold><italic>:</italic> Surgical treatment of complications from revisional surgeries is a challenging task, where using non-conventional methods has place. Our unique procedure hasn’t been described before. The short-term outcome is excellent as the surgery resulted complete resolution of her symptoms. Longer follow-up and further studies needed to verify the clinical efficacy of the procedure.</p><p id="Par1930"><bold>References</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1931">Hill LD, Chapman KW, Morgan EH.

Late complications of bariatric operations may vary between different operation types, and some patients develop severe complications. Stenosis of the Gastroenterostomy is a rare ad serious complication, which results in substantial morbidity. Selected patients are treated by reversal of gastric bypass to the original gastrointestinal anatomy, a complex operation that was previously thought to be non-feasible. We present a video of a patient with previous RYGB who underwent reversal operation.</p><p id="Par2007"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 65-year-old obese female underwent LRYGB, 3 years prior to her admission to our department. During the postoperative period, the patient suffered from postprandial vomiting, excessive weight loss and nutritional deficiencies. Upper endoscopy revealed a normal appearing esophagus, severe stenosis at the gastroenterostomy (GEA) with a marginal ulcer. After a prolonged conservative treatment had failed, the patient underwent multiple endoscopic dilatations. When diagnosed with an intractable marginal ulcer, the patient was offered to undergo an operative revision. The benefits and risks of a reversal operation were discussed with the patient who decided to proceed with a reversal.</p><p id="Par2008"><bold>Results:</bold> The video illustrates the operative planning and pitfalls of LRYGB reversal. The operation was conducted using a 5-port technique. After adhesiolysis the roux limb was measured (one meter), and the feasibility of reversal was assessed. The roux limb with the GEA and the bypassed stomach was resected en-block. The gastro-gastric anastomosis was fashioned using a linear stapler, and fully closed with a V-Loc™ continuous suture.</p><p id="Par2009"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Laparoscopic reversal of LRYGB is technically difficult and carries greater complication rates, and as for our case report was shown to be feasible.</p><p id="Par2010"><bold>V-012</bold></p><p id="Par2011"><bold>Failed Sleeve Gastrectomy: 3 Surgical Proposals</bold></p><p id="Par2012">Maria Natoudi<sup>1, a)</sup>, Eleftherios Mantonakis<sup>1, b)</sup>, Gavriella-Zoi Vrakopoulou<sup>2)</sup>, Charidimos Theodoropoulos<sup>2)</sup>, Georgia Doulami<sup>2)</sup>, George Zografos<sup>2)</sup>, Emmanouil Leandros<sup>2)</sup>, <underline>Konstantinos Albanopoulos</underline><sup>2, c)</sup></p><p id="Par2013"><sup>1)</sup>2nd Department of Surgery, Henry Dunant Hospital Center, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par2014"><sup>2)</sup>Laparoendoscopic Unit - 1st Propaedeutic Department of Surgery, “Hippocration” General Hospital – University of Athens, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par2015"><sup>a)</sup>marnatoyd@yahoo.gr</p><p id="Par2016"><sup>b)</sup>lefman@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2017"><sup>c)</sup>albanopoulos_kostis@yahoo.gr</p><p id="Par2018">Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has emerged as an increasingly popular operation for morbid obesity in the last 15 years. Its simplicity, safety and efficacy for weight loss and resolve of related comorbidities have been reported to be comparable to other bariatric operations. Despite the unquestionable advantages of sleeve gastrectomy, weight regain has been reported from 5.7% at 2 years to as high as 75.6% at 6 years. Possible mechanisms of weight regain include inadequate initial sleeve size or sleeve dilation, increased in ghrelin levels and poor dietary compliance or follow-up. We present 3 alternative surgical proposals for weight regain after sleeve gastrectomy: re-sleeve, conversion to one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and conversion to OAGB with simultaneous re-sleeve of the gastric pouch. We present video footage from these relatively complex re-interventions, in an attempt to highlight the indications, difficulties, advantages and disadvantages of each surgical approach.</p><p id="Par2019"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2020">Weight Regain Following Sleeve Gastrectomy-a Systematic Review.

Objectives: To evaluate the role of laparoscopic RYGBP in the treatment of a previous, failed open VBG. Methods: we present the video of a laparoscopic conversion from previous open, adjustable banded vertical gastroplasty. Patient was operated in other center in 1997 at a BMI of 55.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and arrived a minimum of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In 2017 she presented for weight regain and reflux disease (BMI 41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), requesting further attention. Intraoperative difficulties, adhesiolisys, band removal, unexpected situations are presented. Results: Conversion to laparoscopic RYGBP was safe and efficient, with no need for open surgery conversion, and further weight loss recorded. Postoperative prolonged respiratory problems registered, successfully treated conservatively. An important improvement of the patients’ symptoms and satisfaction was achieved 6 months postoperatively, with suspension of medical therapy, at a BMI of 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Conclusions: Conversion of open VBG to RYGB is feasible and safe and can be performed with an acceptable complication rates, especially in experienced bariatric centers. It gives excellent weight loss results and relief of outlet obstruction.</p><p id="Par2050"><bold>V-016</bold></p><p id="Par2051"><bold>Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass. Stapler Malfunction. How to Deal with</bold></p><p id="Par2052">Harilaos Konstantinidis<sup>a)</sup>, <underline>Christos Charisis</underline><sup>b)</sup></p><p id="Par2053">Robotic General and Oncologic Surgical Department, Interbalkan Medical Centre, Thessaloniki, Greece</p><p id="Par2054"><sup>a)</sup>hakosurg@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2055"><sup>b)</sup>christoscharisis1984@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2056"><bold>Aims</bold>: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure requires the performance of a gastro-enteric anastomosis between the alimentary Roux limb and the proximal gastric stump. The exposure conditions are significantly limitated by the obese patients body structure, therefore, staplers are preferably used for this anastomosis. Nevertheless, stapler malfunction is possible to occur, which will require modification of the surgical technique. Our aim is to present our experience in the management of such cases and to demonstrate our technique for the safe completion of the operation without conversion to open procedures.</p><p id="Par2057"><bold>Methods</bold>: We present video abstracts from a procedure of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, in which the circular stapler sutured, but failed to cut efficiently the tissue. As a result, the anastomosis was impermeable, which was confirmed radiologically 12 hours after the operation. On the next day the patient was re-operated laparoscopically, with resection of the proximal stump and hand sewn purse string suture, as well as manual insertion of the orvil to the esophagus, and redo of the anastomosis.</p><p id="Par2058"><bold>Results</bold>: The second procedure was completed laparoscopically, with confirmed restoration of the anastomotic function and integrity. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, with discharge on the scheduled postoperative day.</p><p id="Par2059"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Stapler malfunction is a rare but very difficult situation to deal with in morbid obesity procedures and very often leads to open conversion. Nevertheless, it is possible, by experienced teams and by following proper strategies to overcome these obstacles and safely complete the treatment without sacrificing the benefits from a minimally invasive approach.</p><p id="Par2060"><bold>V-017</bold></p><p id="Par2061"><bold>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with long biliopancreatic limp (200cm), without division of the mesentery</bold></p><p id="Par2062"><underline>Theofilos Amanatidis</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Charalampos Lampropoulos, George Papadopoulos<sup>b)</sup>, George Skroubis<sup>c)</sup></p><p id="Par2063">Morbid Obesity Unit, Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece</p><p id="Par2064"><sup>a)</sup>kontos_lo@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par2065"><sup>b)</sup>tzi.papadopoulos@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2066"><sup>c)</sup>skroubis@med.upatras.gr</p><p id="Par2067"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with long biliopancreatic limp (200cm), is a variant of the “standard” Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure. The increase of the length of the biliopancreatic limp, aims to more effective maintenance of weight loss, due to longer proximal jejunum that is bypassed</p><p id="Par2068"><bold>Purpose:</bold> The presentation of the technique, in the form of a video.</p><p id="Par2069"><bold>Description of procedure:</bold> After the creation of pneumoperitoneum, 5 trocars are placed. A vertical gastric pouch is created (~20 ml), with the use of endoscopic linear cutter. Measuring from the Treitz ligament, 200cm of proximal jejunum are counted. Without division of the small intestine, a side to side gastrojejunal anastomosis is created using a linear cutter. Subsequently the small intestine is divided, immediately centrally from the gastrojejunal anastomosis, without division of its mesentery. The integrity of the anastomosis is checked with an air leak test. The continuation of the gastrointestinal tract is restored, with side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis, at 100 cm from the gastrojejunal anastomosis with the use of linear cutter.</p><p id="Par2070"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Gastric bypass, with long biliopancreatic limp is a feasible and safe procedure. The elongation of biliopancreatic limp aims to better and sustainable weight loss. The avoidance of mesenteric division makes the procedure technically easier, while it also reduce potential sites of internal hernias.</p><p id="Par2071"><bold>V-018</bold></p><p id="Par2072"><bold>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric By-pass for Morbid Obesity.

Laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass (LOAGB) has emerged as a simpler and faster alternative procedure, since it entails one instead of two anastomoses, with weight loss and resolve of related comorbidities comparable to LRYGB. Despite the overall favorable results, inadequate weight loss, weight regain, malabsorption and diarrhea still plague the LRYGB as well as its counterpart, the LOAGB. When conservative treatment fails, revisional surgery is proposed to these patients. These operations entail efferent limb elongation with or without gastric pouch re-sleeve, in cases of inadequate weight loss or weight regain, and efferent limb shortening, in cases of severe malabsorption, diarrhea or excessive weight loss. We present video footage from two cases, the first concerning a female patient presenting with severe diarrhea and hypoalbuminemia following LOAGB and the second of a female patient with inadequate weight loss following LOAGB. Both patients were treated mainly with interventions in the efferent limb, since this is our primary choice when the expectations following a LOAGB are not met.</p><p id="Par2145"><bold>V-024</bold></p><p id="Par2146"><bold>Retrogastric Approach for Sleeve Gastrectomy through Three Ports</bold></p><p id="Par2147"><underline>Marina Molinete</underline><sup>1, 2, a)</sup>, Ramon Vilallonga<sup>2)</sup>, Laura Martí<sup>3)</sup>, Muriel Pablo<sup>4)</sup>, Blanca De Urrutia<sup>5)</sup>, José Manuel Fort<sup>2)</sup>, Enric Caubet<sup>2)</sup>, Jose Maria Balibrea<sup>2)</sup>, Oscar González<sup>2)</sup>, Andrea Ciudin<sup>2)</sup>, Manuel Armengol<sup>2)</sup></p><p id="Par2148"><sup>1)</sup>Endocrine, bariatric and metabolic unit., Hospital d'Igualada, Igualada, Spain</p><p id="Par2149"><sup>2)</sup>Endocrine, bariatric and metabolic unit., Universitary Hospital Vall herbon, Barcelona, Spain, Barcelona, Spain</p><p id="Par2150"><sup>3)</sup>Endocrine, bariatric and metabolic unit., Hospital Universitario Donostia, Donostia, Spain</p><p id="Par2151"><sup>4)</sup>Endocrine, bariatric and metabolic unit., Hospital Arnau de Vilanova, Lleida, Spain</p><p id="Par2152"><sup>5)</sup>Endocrine, bariatric and metabolic unit., Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Pontevedra, Spain</p><p id="Par2153"><sup>a)</sup>marina_molinete03@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par2154">Nowadays laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy(SG) it’s a surgical technique with increasing application in bariatric surgery.

For the retrogastric approach of the fundus, a minimal opening of the greater curvature is made to access the lesser sac.

Placement of 5 trocars. Mobilization of the gastric fundus and of the left crus of the diaphragm with removal of periphrenic fat, gastrocolic division with the use of energy source beginning 4cm medially to the pylorus towards the cardiophrenic angle, followed by further mobilization of the stomach by dividing the posterior ligaments. We then proceed to sleeve gastrectomy with linear stapler with the use of 36 Fr bougie beginning 4cm from the pylorus and ending 1 cm from the angle of His. The staple line is then reinforced with continuous suture. Placement of drains.</p><p id="Par2206"><bold>Results</bold>: Surgical time was 106 minutes. No major intraoperative events were encountered.</p><p id="Par2207"><bold>Discussion</bold>: Full stomach mobilization allows for more comfortable and safe execution of sleeve gastrectomy with adequate control during all stages of the procedure.

Together with hormonal modification, several changes in taste and habits occurs after the procedure including the potentially modification in alcohol consumption[1-2]. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the frequency and the amount of alcohol use before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) using a modified version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) at 1-year follow-up and to evaluate eventual relationship between different age and sex.</p><p id="Par2231"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold>142 patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated before and 1 year after the SG with a modified AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification test) test. The exclusion criteria were: past history of alcohol abuse, presence of psychopathology or cognitive impairments, diabetes mellitus type II decompensated, or previous gastrointestinal, liver and pancreatic resective surgery. A subgroup analysis was made between male and female and between &lt; and &gt; 40 years old.</p><p id="Par2232"><bold>Results:</bold> The AUDIT median total score decreased from 2,70 (range 1-18) before surgery to 1,38 (range 1-7) 1 year after SG, indicating a marked reduction in alcohol use. The most con-sumed alcoholic drink was beer 36.6% (n=52) while after surgery the consumption of beer decreased considerably (21.1%/n=30). The frequency of alcohol use also decreased: at baseline 45% of patients consumed alcoholic drinks “from 2 to 4 times per month”, instead 26% and 39.4%, consumed alcohol “never” and “less than once a month” respectively. After surgery, nobody consumed 6 alcoholic drinks. No differences were found between the subgroups in terms of alcohol consumption and social behavior.</p><p id="Par2233"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The alcohol preference is modified and decreased 1 y after SG and this could be related to the strict nutritional follow-up and to the hormonal changes. Studies with largest population and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm our data.</p><p id="Par2234"><bold>References</bold>:</p><p id="Par2235">1. Van Vuuren MAJStrodl E, White KM, Lockie PD.

Following the IFSO criteria, patients only with an age between 18 and 65 years old are eligible. The increasing incidence of childhood obesity is requesting amplification of the current criteria. Especially when obesity during this stage of age is accompanied by related comorbidities, reduction in life expectancy, and decreased social functioning. Conservative treatments show little to no effect on weight at the long term. The positive effects of bariatric surgery in adults could therefore also be beneficial for younger obese patients. Before changing the current age criteria, it is important to determine the outcomes of bariatric surgery in our youngest patients.</p><p id="Par2264"><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to obtain three year follow up, all preoperative and perioperative data from patients aged 18-25 years and 35-55 years, operated between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively collected. Follow-up data were gathered prospectively by collecting (laboratory) measurements and questionnaires.</p><p id="Par2265"><bold>Results:</bold> 115 young adults (mean age 22.5) were matched to 115 adult patients (mean age 42.6), matched for BMI and time of surgery. 72% of the young adults and 75% of the adults underwent a gastric bypass (GB). Three years after GB, mean %Total Body Weight Loss was 33.8 (±8.8 ) and 30 (7.7 ) ( p&lt;0.011) respectively. Preoperatively, four patients (3.4%) in the young adult group had oral drug-dependent diabetes mellitus, with 100% remission after 1 year, compared to six (5.2%) in the adult group with 83% remission after 1 year. Quality of life(SF-36) was not significantly different between the two age groups.</p><p id="Par2266"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Bariatric surgery is a safe and effective treatment of obesity in our youngest patient group.</p><p id="Par2267">Results are comparable to age groups in which bariatric surgery is most often performed.

They were divided into two groups according to their metabolic health status (existence of either hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidemia) into metabolically unhealthy (MUO) and healthy (MHO) obese patients. Mean age was 36.7±12.6 years for MHO and 37.3±13 years for MUO while average BMI was 47.5±8.6 and 48.7±9.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in MHO and MUO groups, respectively. During the operation, serum samples as well as visceral adipose tissue samples (from a site near the fundus of the stomach) were collected. TWEAK and TRAIL were measured by custom dual-antibody Luminex assays.</p><p id="Par2285"><bold>Results:</bold> Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia in the MUO group were 81%, 45% and 27%, respectively. Both TRAIL and TWEAK levels in adipose tissue were higher in the MUO group (p=0.037 and p=0.043, respectively). As it concerns serum, this difference was not significant in the case of TRAIL (p&gt;0.05), while it was more prominent in the case of TWEAK (p=0.016). Linear regression analysis did not show any independent correlation between comorbidities and TRAIL, while there was an association between hypertension and hyperlipidemia and TWEAK (p=0.003 and p=0.004, respectively).</p><p id="Par2286"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that TRAIL and TWEAK are correlated with metabolic health of obese patients suggesting a deteriorated inflammatory status in those who are unhealthy. These findings are important since, as proposed by the current guidelines, BMI is not the only indicator for eligibility for bariatric surgery, but the presence of comorbidities is also taken into consideration. Further studies are required in order to investigate the whole spectrum of underlying mechanisms involved in the comorbidities of obese patients.</p><p id="Par2287"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2288"><italic>Alfadda AA, Masood A, Al-Naami MY, Chaurand P, Benabdelkamel H.

Patients were 48 females and 9 males. Mean age was 43 (ranging from 18 to 63) with a mean BMI of 54 (ranging from 40 to 80).</p><p id="Par2332"><bold>Methods:</bold> Ultrasound examination was performed before surgery and liver biopsies – during it. Morphological examination of liver biopsies was scored according to Brunt et al., the activity of NAFLD – according to Knodell et al. The second biopsy was obtained 26-30 months after BPD in 10 cases during reoperation due to hernia. There were 10 patients with paired liver biopsies. Ultrasound liver examination was also repeated.</p><p id="Par2333"><bold>Results:</bold> Excess weight percent loss was 40-73% and excess BMI percent loss – 45-82%. The results depend on the basal BMI. Ultrasound liver examination before surgery showed the first stage of steatosis in 37% of patients, the second – in 38% and the third – 25%. Morbid obesity was characterized by having stestosis, fibrosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in all cases. Our statistical analyses revealed that before surgery the severity of steatosis and NAFLD has significant positive correlation with BMI.</p><p id="Par2334">After 26-30 months ultrasound liver examination showed the improvement of steatosis: 50% of patients didn’t have it and other decreased it to grade 1. In all 10 paired biopsies the degree of steatosis, lobular necrosis, ballooning degeneration significantly decreased. Mononuclear infiltrates in the portal tracts increased from 1,2± 0,6 to 2,8± 0,7. The difference was significant (p=0,01). Fibrosis has only the tendency to increase.</p><p id="Par2335"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The reduction of BMI after BPD significantly improved steatosis, lobular necrosis, ballooning degeneration but mononuclear infiltrates were increased. Further investigations should be designed to confirm the influence of major weight loss on liver conditions.</p><p id="Par2336"><bold>P-009</bold></p><p id="Par2337"><bold>Steatohepatitis in obese Slovenian morbidly obese patients: stratification of risk factors force the need for obesity surgery interventions</bold></p><p id="Par2338"><underline>Tadeja Pintar</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Gregor Kunst<sup>b)</sup>, Tanja Carli<sup>c)</sup></p><p id="Par2339">Clinical department of abdominal surgery, UMC Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia</p><p id="Par2340"><sup>a)</sup>tadeja.pintar@kclj.si</p><p id="Par2341"><sup>b)</sup>gregor.kunst@kclj.si</p><p id="Par2342"><sup>c)</sup>tanja.carli@kclj.si</p><p id="Par2343"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Obesity related NAFLD represents a wide range of histologically proven liver pathologies, triggered by unclear pathognomonic mechanisms.

Selection criteria included BMI, confirmed DT2 and DIAREM values as age, HbA1c, noninsulin drug use, Insulin use and co-morbidity as hypertension, arthritis and sleep apnoea. Two main types of surgical procedures were performed laparoscopically: gastric RNY bypass and mini-gastric bypass. Total 74 patients were operated on from 2011 till June 2016, 21 women and 53 men, aged from 21 to 62 years old. RYN gastric bypass was performed in 70 cases and mini-gastric bypass in 4 cases. 14 patients had an intra-gastric balloon placement before surgery due to BMI from 58 to 61. Follow up of the patients was from 6 months to 5 years after surgery. There was no postoperative mortality. Median postoperative stay was 4 days. Only one 50 years old patient developed stricture of gastro-jejunal anastomosis, managed endoscopically with two dilatations. Total remission of Diabetes was observed in 61 patients with DIAREM score of 1 to 4 points from 3 to 14 months after surgery. Another 9 patients with DIAREM from 4 to 7 points had significant improvement in HbA1c and used only one antiglycemic drug plus diet 1 to 2 years after surgery. The rest 3 patients, who had DIAREM score between 6 and 9 points, had improvement of blood sugar levels and HbA1c, but were still on one antiglycemic drugs without Insulin more than 3 years after surgery. The results showed greater weight loss in the patients with mini-gastric by pass, median 8 to 12 kg more than RNY bypass patients, but both procedures were safe and reliable for surgical management of Diabetes type 2.</p><p id="Par2370"><bold>References</bold>:</p><p id="Par2371">1.

Most of bariatric surgeons perform the upper GI Endoscopy for all obese patients before surgery. At now, several assessments for evaluation of presence of this organism is available such as direct biopsies or findings of evidences of microorganism like RUT. Due to high prevalence of H pylori infection in several regions of world the necessity of guidelines for eradication of this organism have important epidemiologic and cost- effective results in bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par2430"><bold>Methods:</bold> Sleeve gastrectomy was performed for 284 patients by a single surgeon in two centers between 2013 and 2016. Upper GI Endoscopy was performed for all of them but preoperative biopsies was taken from several parts of stomach and RUT examination for some of them was done.

The rate of major complication such as bleeding, leakages and stenosis was equal in two groups. There was no any difference in hospital stay between two groups. We reported differences in presence of acid reflux, duration of PPI consumption and related rehospitalization but the differences was not statistically significant (p-value &gt; 0.5).</p><p id="Par2432"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There was not any significant difference in major complication and clinical outcome.

Rovira i Virgili University, Reus, Spain</p><p id="Par2445"><bold>Objectives:</bold> In the actuality, Laparoscopic (LSG) Sleeve gastrectomy is the most bariatric surgical technique performed due to the good results obtained. Its complications are the appearance of leaks, bleeding or stenosis (0.5-5%) but also other less frequent that can lead to a bad evolution of the patient such as angulation or volvulation in its greatest degree.</p><p id="Par2446"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of a 55-year-old male with a BMI of 37 kg/m2, 2DM, chronic liver disease and hypothyroidism. Initially proposed to perform a gastric bypass, a LSG is finally performed due to a giant hepatomegaly and its underlying liver disease. It presents a good immediate postoperative period, and is discharged without incident at 72 hours. After 3 months, he consulted for repeated postprandial vomiting; diagnosed endoscopically of substenosis, an endoscopic dilation was performed with symptomatic resolution of the symptoms. One year after the intervention he presented a similar clinic. A new endoscopy and dilatation were performed and due to the non-remission of symptom, a surgical revision was decided. During the intervention, an important adhesion syndrome was observed at the level of the body and gastric antrum with two adherent nodules of steatonecrosis that condition an axial angulation of the sleeve. Adhesiolysis and removal of the nodules was performed laparoscopically with deangulation and verification of the stapling line by intraoperative fibrogastroscopy.</p><p id="Par2447"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient started a progressive oral intake at 24 hours, with good tolerance, being discharged after 3 days. He follows periodic controls, being asymptomatic 5 months after the intervention.</p><p id="Par2448"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The angulation/volvulation of the LSG is a rare complication but it must be taken into account in clinical cases of obstructive nature after surgery; it may involve a surgical revision or even a conversion to gastric bypass if it is not resolved.

However there is no consensus which size of each component is optimal for best weight loss. We studied two different lengths of the cartridge of linear stapled gastro-jejunostomies.</p><p id="Par2486"><bold>Methods:</bold> In our institution gastric bypass is performed in a completely standardized fashion. Pouch volume contains around 15 ml, alimentary limb 135 cm, biliary limb 80 cm in BMI 40 – 60. Over a long time we used a 45 mm blue cartridge and a running suture to create a lateral side-to-side anastomosis to the pouch. Since 2012 we used a 30 mm instead of a 45 mm blue cartridge. Nothing else of the standard was changed.</p><p id="Par2487"><bold>Results:</bold> 100 consecutive patients of each group were followed over a period of 36 months ( 24 to 63 months) in regard of weight loss. The individual percentage of excess weight loss and the proportion of patients with successful weight loss ( &gt; 50% of EWL) were more prominent in the group who received a 30 mm staple but did not reach a significant difference. In regard to therapeutic failures rates there was a significant higher rate with less than 25% EWL (p = 0.01) for the 45 mm cartridge anastomosis. Postop weight-regain exceeding the preoperative weight was only observed in the 45 mm cartridge group.</p><p id="Par2488"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Linear stapled gastro-jejunostomy by 30 mm cartridge goes along with a better weight loss than using a 45 mm cartridge without reaching a significant difference.

Nevertheless no consensus exist which method is superior for the gastrojejunostomy. We wanted to analyse our own data comparing three different ways to performe the gastrojejunostomy in the context of complications (leak and strictures) as well as operative time, hospital and icu stay and BMI 6 month postoperative.</p><p id="Par2497"><bold>Methods:</bold> We include retrospective data from 78 LRYGB patients operated between december 2008 and october 2015. We included operations in consecutive way. We studied operative time, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay and postoperative complications. Between 2008 and 2011 we performed circular stapling (CS), followed by linear stapling (LS) between 2011 and may 2014. Form may 2014 till now we use linear stapling and close the stapler defect with stratafix absorbable bidrectional monofilament barbed suture (LSS).</p><p id="Par2498"><bold>Results:</bold> Preoperatively the groups were comparable (BMI 44kg/m<sup>2</sup> for CS, 47 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for LS and 46 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for LSS with stratafix; age 49,5 years, 44,8 years, 47,3 years). Changing the operation procedure form CS and LS to LSS operative time (353 minutes, 129 minutes and 90 minutes) (Figure 1) and hospital stay reduced (from 10 days to 8 and then 5 days) as well as ICU stay (Figure 2). The rate of reoperations was 5% in CS, 10% in LS and 3% in LSS.</p><p id="Par2499">There were no anastomitic leakages or anastomotic stenosis in the LSS group and no mortality was observed in any group.

With increasing life expectancy a surgical approach of the elderly obese patients can be justified taking into consideration the low morbidity rate and the effectiveness in the treatment of obesity and its related comorbidities.</p><p id="Par2515"><bold>Material und Methods:</bold> The study included patients older than 65 years who underwent a surgical treatment of obesity in our clinic between the years 2009 to 2016. In all patients a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed. Patients who underwent a revisional procedure were not included.</p><p id="Par2516"><bold>Results:</bold> The patients analysed were between the ages of 65 to 75 with a mean age of 68,76y. The BMI varied from 34,72 to 77,03 with an average BMI of 46,48 kg/m2. From the 42 patients 30 showed for follow up. 1 patient died direct postoperatively and in another patient a relaparoscopy due to postoperative- haemorrhage was necessary. The same patient showed a prolongated hospitalisation with a persistent septicaemia and cardiac complications. In the long term, 2 patients underwent a redo procedure due to inadequate weight loss (mini gastric bypasss) and 2 patients showed persistent dysphagia- with a need of endoscopic dilatation in one of them. One patient suffered from GERD symptoms due to a hiatal hernia and a hiatoplastic with hemifundoplication was performed. In a period of time from 1 to 3 years a mean BMI drop of 12,928 kg/m2 was observed. Most of the patients were “very satisfied” with the weight loss in the follow up.</p><p id="Par2517"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The morbidity and mortality of sleeve gastrectomy in patients older than 65 years is slightly higher than younger individuals. On the other hand, the effectiveness of a bariatric procedure with satisfied weight control is well established. Taking into consideration the ageing of the population und the safety of the laparoscopic bariatric procedures, a sleeve gastrectomy in the elderly can be recommended.</p><p id="Par2518"><bold>P-023</bold></p><p id="Par2519"><bold>Impact of Diabetes on Weight loss in Bariatric Surgery</bold></p><p id="Par2520"><underline>Fàtima Sabench</underline>, Alicia Molina, Marga Vives, Marta París, Esther Raga, Elisabeth Homs, Èlia Bartra, Pilar Martínez, Carla Morales, Antonio Sánchez, Daniel Del Castillo</p><p id="Par2521">Surgery, University Hospital of Sant Joan.

Our objective is to analyze the weight evolution of morbidly obese patients undergoing different techniques (Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy-LSG and Roux-en-Y Gastrojejunal Bypass-RYGBP), according to different indicators of weight loss. Also, we analyze whether the presence or absence of Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2) influences on the weight loss in all of them.</p><p id="Par2523"><bold>Material And Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study that selects a sample of 551 patients operated by the Bariatric Surgery team of our center since 2013. The patients are followed up for 3 years. The patients are divided into 4 groups depending on the surgical technique performed (LSG and RYGBP), and the presence or absence of type 2 DM. The anthropometric parameters are collected for the determination of the following indicators: BMI, Percentage of excess BMI lost (PEBMIL,%), Total weight loss (TWL,%), Excess weight lost (EWL,%).

On laboratory tests a mild elevated lactat level (2.3mmol/l) could be seen. Computed tomography showed typical target lesions on two distal segments of the common channel, suggestive for antegrade ileoileal intussusceptions with signs of obstruction.</p><p id="Par2540">We performed emergency re-laparoscopy. Preoperatively 20mg Butylscopalamin was administrated. Intraoperatively we noted active small intestine motility but no intussusceptions could be seen any more.</p><p id="Par2541">Postoperatively the patient suffered from persisting mild abdominal cramps, which vanished completely under antispasmodic medication (Butylscopalamin). The lactat level turned to be normal and on an ultrasound control on the 5<sup>th</sup> day no signs of intussusception could be seen any more.</p><p id="Par2542"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Small bowel intussusception is a rare, but probably underreported, long-term complication after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In literature the incidence lies between 0.07 and 0.15%. In our case the intussusceptions occur in the common channel, which is not reported in the literature so far.</p><p id="Par2543">The etiology is still unclear, but different potential leading-points are discussed such as motility disorders, thinner mesentery and some more.</p><p id="Par2544">Although intussusception may resolve spontaneously, treatment is usually surgical. Resection of the small bowel segment is often necessary as the intussusception is most frequently seen to be recurrent. However in some cases conservative treatment with administration of spasmolytic drugs may be a first option, but continuous active clinical surveillance is crucial for not missing small bowel necrosis.</p><p id="Par2545"><bold>P-025</bold></p><p id="Par2546"><bold>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients Over 60: Outcomes of Mid &amp; Long Term Follow-Up</bold></p><p id="Par2547"><underline>Omer Sadeh</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Dvir Froylich<sup>1, b)</sup>, Naama Kafri<sup>1, c)</sup>, Hagar Mizrahi<sup>2, d)</sup>, Nisim Geron<sup>2, e)</sup>, David Hazzan<sup>1, f)</sup></p><p id="Par2548"><sup>1)</sup>Surgery B, Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel; <sup>2)</sup>Surgery, The Bruch Padeh Medical Center Poriya, Poriya, Israel</p><p id="Par2549"><sup>a)</sup>omersadeh@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2550"><sup>b)</sup>dvirfr7@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2551"><sup>c)</sup>naamka1@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2552"><sup>d)</sup>Hmizrahi@poria.health.gov.il</p><p id="Par2553"><sup>e)</sup>n_geron@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par2554"><sup>f)</sup>hazzan2david@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par2555"><bold>Background:</bold> The rise in life expectancy presents health systems with a growing challenge in the form of elderly obesity. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for obesity with reduction of excess body weight and improvement in related co-morbidities. However, only recently surgeons began performing these operations on elderly patients on a larger scale, making data regarding middle and long term outcomes scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients aged≥60 years.</p><p id="Par2556"><bold>Methods:</bold> Between 2008 and 2014, 55 patients aged 60 years or over who underwent LSG in one of 3 medical centers, and had documented surveillance for a minimum of 24 months were included in this study.

Limited data exist regarding esophageal motility disorders after these procedures.</p><p id="Par2590"><bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of this study is to present a systematic review of the literature, in order to highlight the incidence of such a rare complication, and thus its role to differentialdiagnosis algorithm and targeted treatment.</p><p id="Par2591"><bold>Data Sources:</bold> A literature review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines performed in December 2017 revealed 40 articles of interest. Search terms included achalasia or pseudoachalasia after sleeve gastrectomy, or after gastric bypass.</p><p id="Par2592"><bold>Study Selection:</bold> We included only studies in English or German language and published material with available data in print or on the web in full text. The time of publication was not considered as a restriction for our study.</p><p id="Par2593"><bold>Main Outcome Measures:</bold> The articles described cases diagnosed with postoperative achalasia or pseudoachalasia after Sleeve Gastrectomy or Gastric Bypass, treated with Laparoscopic or Robotic Heller Myotomy (LHM or RHM), or Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM), and/ or Gastric Bypass revision, and/ or conversion to RYGB through laparoscopic or open procedure were evaluated.</p><p id="Par2594"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 395 publications. After duplicates and irrelevant articles have been excluded, 40 publications remained for full text evaluation. Finally, 12 articles were included to this systematic review, revealing 22 cases.</p><p id="Par2595"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Data on esophageal motility disorders after bariatric surgery have been limited in the literature to date. However, our results reveal an increasing tendency of case reports, related to postoperative achalasia, especially after RYGB. Moreover, our results suggest that achalasia can be effectively treated with surgical interventions. Heller Myotomy is still the procedure of choice, while POEM seems to be safe and effective, as well. Raising awareness that achalasia can occur after bariatric surgery is essential for the differentialdiagnosis and targeted treatment of these patients.</p><p id="Par2596"><bold>References</bold>:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par2597"><bold>Chapman</bold> R, Rotundo A, Carter N, George J, Jenkinson A, Adamo M., Laparoscopic Heller’s myotomy for achalasia after gastric bypass: A case report, Int J Surg Case Rep. 2013;4(4):396-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.01.014.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2598"><bold>Ravi</bold> K, Sweetser S, Katzka DA., Pseudoachalasia secondary to bariatric surgery, Dis Esophagus. 2016 Nov;29(8):992-995. doi: 10.1111/dote.12422.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2599"><bold>Ran B.

We aim to present our experience concerning laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity, with a more minimal invasive approach, using three ports- trocars.</p><p id="Par2614"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is traditionally performed using 5 to 7 abdominal trocars. By reducing the number of trocars, parietal trauma, pain and hernia risks can be minimized.</p><p id="Par2615"><bold>Objectives:</bold> We present our 3,5-year experience concerning LSG for morbid obesity using three trocars, with emphasis on a simple suture-based trocar-free liver retractor.</p><p id="Par2616"><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analyzed 50 patients who underwent LSG for morbid obesity, from May 2014 to December 2017. Three trocars are typically used: one 10-mm periumbilical optical trocar and two 12-mm trocars on the midclavicular lines. A suture is percutaneously inserted and fixed to the right crus of the diaphragm. Careful traction lifts the left hepatic lobe offering better surgical field and access to the gastroesophageal junction. A gauze is used to protect liver parenchyma from possible injury. Furthermore, sectioning and stapling of the stomach is performed before the gastroepiploic division, reducing the need of another left sided trocar.</p><p id="Par2617"><bold>Results:</bold> All the patients had an uncomplicated recovery. No liver injury or wound problem was mentioned.</p><p id="Par2618"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The placement of a suture at the right crus of the diaphragm can reduce the number of trocars, leading to less postoperative pain, risk of hernia and better cosmetic outcome without compromising the safety of the operation or the rate of postoperative complications.</p><p id="Par2619"><bold>P-029</bold></p><p id="Par2620"><bold>Bariatric surgery improves quality of life and maintains nutritional status of older obese patients</bold></p><p id="Par2621"><underline>Elie CHOUILLARD</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Antoine YOUNAN<sup>a)</sup></p><p id="Par2622">Minimally Invasive Surgery Department, Metabolic Surgery Unit, PARIS WEST MEDICAL CENTER, POISSY, France</p><p id="Par2623"><sup>a)</sup>chouillard@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par2624"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Bariatric surgery is being safely performed in older patients. Quality of life and aggravation of sarcopenic obesity, however, have never been assessed in this subgroup of patients. This retrospective study aims to evaluate quality of life of older obese patients after surgery and to compare variations of their nutritional parameters to those of younger patients.</p><p id="Par2625"><bold>Methods And Procedures:</bold> 158 patients older than 60 years (Group 1) were matched 1:2 with 316 patients younger than 40 years (Group 2) for comparison of nutritional parameters. A modified Impact of Weight on Quality Of Life (IWQOL) questionnaire was filled by all included patients, at the one-year check-up.</p><p id="Par2626"><bold>Results</bold>: The preoperative serum albumin and prealbumin levels were comparable between the two groups. Albumin values regained preoperative levels at six months in both groups intergroup comparison showed no significant difference. The serum prealbumin levels reached back the preoperative values at 12 and 6 months in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Values were significantly lower in Group 1 comparatively to Group 2 at three and six months (0.18 versus 0.19; p=0.04 and 0.20 versus 0.21; p=0.03, respectively) but not at one year. 139 patients (87.3%) gave a total of 3720 answers in the modified IWQOL.

The most commonly feared complication is staple line dehiscence. A lot of methods have been suggested in order to reinforce the staple line, in an attempt to prevent leakage. The aim of this study is to present our experience with the use of fibrin glue as an adjunct to staple line reinforcement.</p><p id="Par2636"><bold>Objectives:</bold> We compare the rate of gastric leaks in LSG with and without application of fibrin glue.</p><p id="Par2637"><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients in our centre were operated by the same surgeon. It is standard practice in LSG to reinforce the staple line with absorbable running suture and suture the omentum over the staple line. Between September and December, 2012, in twenty-four patients that underwent LSG, fibrin glue was applied as an additional measure to staple line reinforcement following the standard placement of an absorbable running suture.</p><p id="Par2638"><bold>Results:</bold> Four postoperative leaks occurred after the use of fibrin glue. Two of these patients were treated conservatively, whereas the other two needed reoperation. The leak rate during the period of fibrin glue usage was statistically and clinically more significant than the general leak percentage of our centre without the use of fibrin glue (16.6% vs. 1.2%, OR 13.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001).Related literature is analysed and discussed.</p><p id="Par2639"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of fibrin glue led to significantly increased morbidity in our series and was subsequently abandoned as an adjunct to staple line reinforcement in LSG.</p><p id="Par2640"><bold>P-031</bold></p><p id="Par2641"><bold>Laparoscopic One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass/Mini Gastric Bypass: Mid-term Results</bold></p><p id="Par2642">Georgios Papadopoulos<sup>a)</sup>, Charalampos Lampropoulos, Theofilos Amanatidis, <underline>George Skroubis</underline></p><p id="Par2643">Morbid Obesity Unit, Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece</p><p id="Par2644"><sup>a)</sup>kreon84@gmail.com</p><p id="Par2645"><bold>Purpose</bold>: The laparoscopic one anastomosis/mini gastric bypass is considered a safe and effective bariatric surgical procedure.

The mean age was 37.3 ± 11.5 years, while the preoperative mean body mass index (BMI) was 47.4 ± 5.7 kg / m². Follow-up compliance rates were: at 1st year 80.4%, at 2nd year 89.1%, and at 3rd year 49.4%. Excess weight loss results (EWL %) were: at 1st year 78.1%, at 2nd year 81.7% and at 3rd year 75.1%. Postoperative complications were: 3 leakages from the gastric pouch (1.2%), 2 postoperative bleedings (0.8%) (conservative treatment), and 1 reflux esophagitis (0.4%) (conservative treatment). Two patients (0.8%) who experienced protein malnutrition (albumin &lt;3g/dl), treated successfully with dietary counseling and oral protein supplements. Anemia (Hb: men &lt;13.5g / dl, females &lt;12.5g / dl) was presented to 30% of the patients at the 1st postoperative year, to 42% at 2nd year, and to 40% at 3rd year, whereas B<sub>12</sub> deficiency was presented to 7.7% of the cohort at the 1st postoperative year, to 13% at the 2nd year and to 12.5% at the 3rd year, successfully corrected with standard supplements.</p><p id="Par2648"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: The laparoscopic one anastomosis/mini gastric bypass offers excellent mid-term weight loss results, with no significant short-term and overall morbidity.

It was decided to undergo a vertical gastrectomy for morbid obesity prior to the repair of incisional hernia.</p><p id="Par2660">In this case, with patient in French position, we proceed with the placement of 5 working trocars distant from infraumbilical eventration and creation of pneumoperitoneum with Veress needle in left hypochondrium.</p><p id="Par2661">We release the greater curvature of the stomach, from the middle to the top with ultrasonic bipolar. A minimal opening of the greater curvature is made to in the retrogastric space. All the short vessels of the fundus are identified, in tension and exposed in vertical position, and its complete section is performed until the left pillar. A 40F tube is inserted into the pylorus and stomach was resected with linear mechanical endostapler. An extra 6<sup>th</sup> trocar was neede to undergo the first stapling.

The resection of the stomach began approximately 2cm proximal to the pylorus. A 32-Fr bougie was used to guide the gastric division. Relative Weight Loss (RWL) was defined as the annual percentage change in body weight [1- (Weight in <italic>n</italic> year / Weight in <italic>n-1</italic> year)]. Weight regain was expressed as a percentage of the maximum % Excess Weight Loss (EWL) and was calculated using the relationship between % EWL in the seventh postoperative year and maximum %EWL [1 - (%EWL in the seventh postoperative time / maximum %EWL)].</p><p id="Par2675"><bold>Results:</bold> All patients achieved successful initial weight loss (%EWL&gt; 50% in the first post-operative year).

It may be caused due to several factors, such as aneurysm, malignancies or surgical procedures [1-3]. Outflow obstruction leads to dilatation of the esophagus. Manometric findings consist of hypertensive Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) and failed or simultaneous contractions. Secondary achalasia may also present after bariatric surgery [4]. Treatment of pseudoachalasia should be etiologic.</p><p id="Par2704"><bold>Case Presentation:</bold> We present a rare case of spontaneously resolved pseudoachalasia in a 57-year-old female patient. The patient referred to our department for morbid obesity and underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. On the second postoperative day, while starting on liquid diet, she complained of sudden onset of dysphagia. Barium swallow test was conclusive for esophageal dilatation and incomplete bolus clearance. She underwent High Resolution Manometry (HRM) that revealed achalasia with vigorous contractions [figure]. After two endoscopic dilatations, the patient continued complaining of saliva regurgitations and inability to swallow. However, while on conservative treatment with intravenous fluid for four weeks, the symptoms eliminated and the patient was discharged.</p><p id="Par2705"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Bariatric surgery may result in secondary motility disorder of the esophagus. In the case of dysphagia after bariatric surgery evaluation of the clinical, manometric and radiographic findings should always be completed before deciding the optimal treatment option [5]. Conservative treatment is mandatory prior to endoscopic techniques. Whether this incidence is underestimated remains to be seen in future studies.</p><p id="Par2706"><bold>References</bold>:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par2707">Jia Y, McCallum RW.

Early detection and treatment of a staple line leak or an abdominal abscess are very important. Early biomarkers that can discern the patients at risk for a septic complication before its clinical or radiologic manifestation would be invaluable.</p><p id="Par2721"><bold>Objective:</bold> To elicit abnormal elevation of CRP in the early postoperative period after LSG in patients that eventually developed a septic complication.</p><p id="Par2722"><bold>Method:</bold> This is a cohort study. Ten patients that developed a septic complication (leak, abscess) after LSG were matched with 20 controls in terms of BMI, sex, age, comorbidities. The control group had an uneventful postoperative course. All operations were performed by the same surgeon. CRP was measured on the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day and the two groups were compared.</p><p id="Par2723"><bold>Results:</bold> Mean CRP in the control group was 6.8 mg/dl, while in the septic group 12.5 mg/dl. An independent t-test showed weak but evident statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.03).</p><p id="Par2724"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The group that eventually developed a leak or an abscess had significantly higher CRP in the early postoperative period. Most importantly, the septic complication manifested itself days or weeks later. This means that an exceedingly high CRP in the early postoperative period can be a prognostic factor for septic complications.</p><p id="Par2725"><bold>P-037</bold></p><p id="Par2726"><bold>Gastric leak after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy</bold></p><p id="Par2727"><underline>Sylvia Krivan</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Paran Kiritharamohan<sup>b)</sup>, Egeman Tezcan<sup>c)</sup>, Douglas Whitelaw<sup>d)</sup>, Periyathambi Jambulingam<sup>e)</sup>, Vigyan Jain<sup>f)</sup></p><p id="Par2728">UGI/Bariatrics, General Surgery, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Luton, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par2729"><sup>a)</sup>navirk@hotmail.com</p><p id="Par2730"><sup>b)</sup>paran.kiritharamohan@ldh.nhs.uk</p><p id="Par2731"><sup>c)</sup>egeman.tezcan@ldh.nhs.uk</p><p id="Par2732"><sup>d)</sup>douglas.whitelaw@ldh.nhs.uk</p><p id="Par2733"><sup>e)</sup>periyathambi.jambulingam@ldh.nhs.uk</p><p id="Par2734"><sup>f)</sup>vigyan.jain@ldh.nhs.uk</p><p id="Par2735"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy(LSG) is one of the most popular restrictive bariatric operations in surgical treatment of morbid obesity, indicated as a standalone procedure or as the first step prior to duodenal switch. The most serious complication, although infrequent(1-4.3%), remains leak from the staple line and can increase morbidity and hospital stay.</p><p id="Par2736"><bold>Patients and Methods:</bold> From January 2008 to January 2015, 334 patients with morbid obesity underwent LSG at our institute. Data were analyzed retrospectively and collected for all patients who presented with a gastric leak, including demographics, details of comorbidities, clinical presentation of leak (type I, type II), time of onset (early, intermediate, late), as well as investigations involved and management of each complication.</p><p id="Par2737"><bold>Results:</bold> From 334 patients over a period of 7years, 8patients presented with gastric leak after LSG (2.4%). 7 were female and one patient was male. Preoperative comorbidities included hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia, asthma, sleep apnoea and osteoarthritis. Age ranged from 36 to 64years old and BMI from 39.7 to 79.1. Two patients developed early leak diagnosed with a computer tomography abdomen-pelvis(CT AP) with oral contrast, two intermediate leak diagnosed with barium swallow and four late leak investigated with CT, swallow or oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy(OGD). All of them required re-operation; seven underwent wash-out, insertion of T-tube and drainage, whereas one required laparoscopy and primary repair with sutures. Prolonged hospital stay was between 2 to 15 weeks and all of them were eventually discharged symptom free. There were no conversions to Roux-n-Y gastric bypass or deaths.</p><p id="Par2738"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Gastric leaks can be challenging and management is usually interventional, depending on the time of diagnosis as well as the size of the defect. A CT AP as well as barium swallow and OGD are powerful tools for diagnosis of this complication and should be considered when clinical suspicion is raised. Reoperation with laparoscopic wash out, insertion of a T-tube and drainage is still the most favorable approach.</p><p id="Par2739"><bold>References</bold>:</p><p id="Par2740">Management of gastric leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity: A tertiary care experience and design of a management algorithm.

All operations performed by laparoscopic approach and followed for 24 months by their weight loss, peri operative and late complications. Their mean age was 38±12 years, original BMI 42±5 ,and 75% were females. The operation performed by creating a circular window through the gastric body which enable to divide the stomach longitudinally along 32 fr. Tube to two gastric pouches. The alimentary gastric pouch is along the lesser curve meet the other gastric pouch near the pylorus and a band situated eight cm from the gastro esophageal junction.</p><p id="Par2769"><bold>Results</bold>: Peri operative complications include intraperitoneal bleeding five (3.8%) patients, two patients (1.5%) had suture line leakage.

We hereby present the experience accumulated at our institution over a nine-year period.</p><p id="Par2834"><bold>Methods</bold>: Patient data were collected by retrospectively accessing their electronic recordings and by prospectively evaluating their progress at scheduled follow-up intervals. A standard two-row technique was implemented for plicating the greater curvature of the stomach. We studied the effect of LGCP on excess BMI loss (%EBMIL); co-morbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea; musculoskeletal pain; dyslipidemia); morbidity and mortality; and patient satisfaction.</p><p id="Par2835"><bold>Results</bold>: From January 2009 to December 2017, 367 patients (89.6% females, mean age 37.6 years) with mean BMI of 39.7 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 35-51) were submitted to LGCP in our center. One-year mean %EBMIL was 81.6%. Overall mortality was 0%. Total complication rate was 2.2% (leaks: 1.36%; major hemorrhage: 1.1%;pulmonary embolism: 0.3%). One-year co-morbidity improvement was as follow: T2DM 91.7%; HTN 54.5%; OSA 81.5%, musculoskeletal pain 80.7%, dyslipidemia 100%.Seventy-two percent of patients reported an improved quality of life following LGCP, based on the Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life Questionnaire II scoring key. There were 2 conversions (1 re-plication 5 years later, 1 LSG 6 years post-index operation).</p><p id="Par2836"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LGCP is a safe and efficacious restrictive bariatric procedure for obese patients with moderately elevated BMI. Weight-loss and amelioration of co-morbidities was comparable to that of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), according to our series. Equally comparable was the leak rate, despite the notion that LGCP bears a substantially lower incidence of leak given that there is no cutting line. Nevertheless, in contradistinction to LSG, all cases of leak were amenable to conservative treatment. Overall, patients were satisfied with the bariatric results of the method.</p><p id="Par2837"><bold>P-045</bold></p><p id="Par2838"><bold>10-years´ experience with sleeve gastrectomy in a mainly super-obese patient group: rather modest results</bold></p><p id="Par2839"><underline>Karl Rheinwalt</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Marcia Viviane Rückbeil<sup>2, b)</sup>, Tom Florian Ulmer<sup>3, c)</sup>, Sebastian Kolec<sup>1, d)</sup>, Martin Hemmerich<sup>1, e)</sup>, Andreas Plamper<sup>1, f)</sup></p><p id="Par2840"><sup>1)</sup>Bariatric, Metabolic and Plastic Surgery, St. Franziskus Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany</p><p id="Par2841"><sup>2)</sup>Institute for Medical Statistics, University Clinics Aachen, Aachen, Germany</p><p id="Par2842"><sup>3)</sup>General, Visceral and Transplant Surgery, University Clinics Aachen, Aachen, Germany</p><p id="Par2843"><sup>a)</sup>karlpeter.rheinwalt@cellitinnen.de</p><p id="Par2844"><sup>b)</sup>m.rueckbeil@ukaachen.de</p><p id="Par2845"><sup>c)</sup>fulmer@ukaachen.de</p><p id="Par2846"><sup>d)</sup>sebastian.kolec@cellitinnen.de</p><p id="Par2847"><sup>e)</sup>martin.hemmerich@cellitinnen.de</p><p id="Par2848"><sup>f)</sup>andreas.plamper@cellitinnen.de</p><p id="Par2849"><bold>Background / introduction</bold>: Sleeve gastrectomy has become the most popular bariatric operation worldwide although the rarely available long-term results are rather discouraging.</p><p id="Par2850"><bold>Objectives</bold>: Evaluation of 10 years experience with sleeve gastrectomy as a primary bariatric procedure.</p><p id="Par2851"><bold>Methods</bold>: Prospectively collected data were evaluated from all primary sleeve gastrectomies which had been performed from 8 / 2007 to 3 / 2017 in our center.</p><p id="Par2852"><bold>Results</bold>: 150 patients (93 F, 57 M) with age 43.32 years (18-64), weight 160.1kg (99.0-260.0) and BMI 54.26 kg/sqm (35.12-79.36) had an average operation time of 99.85 minutes (40-210). 30d-mortality was 0.67% (1).

Several reports show successful application of SILS to various types of bariatric surgery. Oftentimes, this requires a skilled and experienced scopist to perform the procedure. To overcome the technical difficulties of single-incision Roux-en Y gastric bypass, a manual scope holder was used instead of an assistant scopist, greatly stabilizing the field of view. This allows the surgery to be performed at any time without being influenced by the need of a highly experienced scopist.

All patients underwent laparoscopic band-separated gastric bypass with the use of a hand -sewn anastomosis without using staplers. The stomach was divided into large and small parts (pouch). For stomach separation an adjustable band was used. The front wall of the stomach below the band was displaced in the upward direction through the ring band, increasing the size of the anterior portion of the stomach pouch so that a gastroenteroanastomosis could be created at this point. A jejunal loop was created about 200 cm from the ligament of Treitz and anastomosed to the gastric pouch.In the first group was performed a single gastroenteroanastomosis. In the second group two anastomoses were performed: gastroenteroanastomosis and enteroenteroanastomosis between afferent and efferent limb. Between the two anastomoses on the biliopancreatic limb, a block was created using a non-absorbable ligature.</p><p id="Par2886"><bold>Results:</bold> Follow up was 18 months.

However, the bariatric surgeon is faced with two major challenges directly related to the erosive properties of the band: technical difficulties in removing the band and dissecting the stomach; and increased incidence of post-operative leaks.</p><p id="Par2947"><bold>Material and Methods</bold>: We retrospectively analyzed our cohort of 696 obese patients who underwent LSG.</p><p id="Par2948"><bold>Results</bold>: Over a 9-year period 39 patients among them (26 women) underwent simultaneous LAGB removal and LSG, with average age 38 (18-49). Mean BMI before conversion was 48Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Pre-operatively, all patients underwent endoscopy and barium swallow to rule out perforation, erosion or severe band slippage, which constitute contraindications to simultaneous AGB removal and LSG in our institution. AGB removal increased the operative time of LSG by a mean of 53 min (range 10-90 min). Two cases of post-operative leak (5.1%) were documented and treated conservatively, while no conversion to open surgery was required in any case. Mean weight loss in the first year was 83.3% of the excess weight.</p><p id="Par2949"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Simultaneous laparoscopic gastric band removal and sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity seems to be safe and efficient in carefully selected cases. The reduction of the total number of operations by one counterbalances the prolongation in operative time. The leak rate was significantly greater than the mean leak rate of our cohort (1.2%), underlying the predisposition to leak due to AGB.</p><p id="Par2950"><bold>References</bold>:</p><p id="Par2951">1.

To avoid this deleterious effect, it is advisable to train the patients to improve CRF after the surgery. However, until now there is no information regarding the presurgical predictors associated with the CRF one year after sleeve gastrectomy (SG)<sup>1-5</sup>.</p><p id="Par3039"><bold>Methods</bold>: Twelve female patients (38.6 ± 11.8 years old, BMI 35.3 ± 3.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were evaluated about their physical fitness before and one year after SG. CRF was assessed with an incremental test in cycle-ergometer (workload increasing 15W/2min) until stopping criteria (RER&gt;1.1, PRE&gt;8/10) and breath by breath expired gas analysis (Cortex Metalizer3B). Inspiratory muscle strength was assessed with Powerbreath K5 (Powerbreath), and height and weight were measured with a scale (Detecto). Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS 22.0 software, paired comparison was conducted with Wilcoxon test and for correlation Spearman’s test was applied. P value&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p><p id="Par3040"><bold>Results</bold>: The preoperatory CRF of patients was VO<sub>2</sub> peak of 1.82 ± 0.27 L/min. One year after the surgery VO<sub>2</sub> peak was 1.44 ± 0.26 L/min (p=0.002), BMI was 25.1 ± 1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>p</italic>=0.002). Preoperatory assessment of height (1.59 ± 0.04 m) and inspiratory muscle strength (84.7 ± 18.1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) had strong predictive power over CRF one year after the surgery with Spearman Rho of 0.749 (<italic>p</italic>=0.005) and 0.725 (<italic>p</italic>=0.008) respectively.</p><p id="Par3041"><bold>Discussion</bold>: Even there is no doubt about the effectivity of SG upon the weight management in obese patients, there is no consensus regarding the physical training that should be the best approach for those patients. Preoperatory assessment of VO<sub>2</sub> peak, height and inspiratory muscle strength could be used to create a personalized training program for patients with a predicted low CRF one year after the surgery.</p><p id="Par3042"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Preoperatory assessment of height and inspiratory muscle strength showed to be good predictors for CRF one year after SG.</p><p id="Par3043"><bold>References</bold>:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par3044">Coen, P.

The reasons for the high percentage of this type of surgery are low rate of complications, the avoidance of foreign material, the maintenance of normal gastro-intestinal continuity, the absence of malabsorption, the ability to convert to multiple other operations and offers positive metabolic changes. The objective of bariatric surgery is to reduce the intake of calories by anatomical modifications of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Eating habits must be changed after surgery to ensure the successful results of the procedure.</p><p id="Par3059">Our study is based on the operative results of weight reduction after 3 years of follow up according to the alimentary habits before the operation.</p><p id="Par3060">The study include 300 patients that underwent LSG, they were divided in four groups according with their preoperative eating habits.</p><p id="Par3061">The ratio of males to females was 1:2, and the average age was 41.65years old. The average baseline BMI was 42.02 kg/m2. We classified before surgery in Binge group 14%, Snack Group 50%, Sweet eaters 35.66%, volume eaters 76.66%. Patients have more than one type of eating pattern in 43%.</p><p id="Par3062">The mean BMI achieved after 3 years was 29.84. With no significate differences according to each eating habit at the beginning. After three years we found a significant reduction of the volume group.</p><p id="Par3063">What most attracts attention are the changes that patients show from one type of pathological food habit to another and not the correction of eating habits. Our results demonstrated a significant effect for gender (women lose significantly more body weight ), age (young patients lose more body weight than older patients) and physical activity (Active people lose more weight).</p><p id="Par3064">Our study supports the concept that eating habits do not influence the weight loss after LSG and that continuous and close multidisciplinary support is necessary and essential to prolong the success of the operation.</p><p id="Par3065"><bold>References</bold>:</p><p id="Par3066">1- Kitzinger HB, Karle B.

However, long-term benefits of these interventions remain small. Bariatric surgery is only allowed in research settings. Referral for surgery can only occur via pediatricians or general practitioners (GPs) after failed combined lifestyle interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Dutch GPs consider bariatric surgery as possible end-stage treatment modality in morbidly obese children and adolescents.</p><p id="Par3102"><bold>Methods</bold>: An online survey was designed to test the attitude of GPs towards bariatric surgery in children and adolescents. Invitations for this anonymous survey were sent to the GPs enlisted in the local registries of Medical Center A and Medical Center B.</p><p id="Par3103"><bold>Results:</bold> Among 534 invited GPs, 184 (34.5%) completed the survey. 175 GPs estimated that combined lifestyle interventions are only effective in less than 50% of the morbidly obese children in their practice. Although 123 respondents believe bariatric surgery can be effective in morbidly obese children, only 98 would consider referring for surgery. Most mentioned reasons for a reluctant attitude towards surgery were ‘uncertainty about long-term complications’ (71.7%) and ‘uncertainty about long-term efficacy’ (64.7%).</p><p id="Par3104"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Childhood bariatric surgery remains controversial among GPs.

It is important to gain more insight into the resumption of work and changes in the observed obstacles after bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par3110"><bold>Methods:</bold> A cross-section study based on online questionnaires of 717 postoperative patients and 17 surgeons.</p><p id="Par3111"><bold>Results:</bold> The average duration until full resumption of work after a bariatric procedure is 51 days. This is 23 days longer than is to be expected based on medical recovery. Several factors influence this outcome: type of intervention, complications, co-morbid disorders, operating result and time of reporting sick. Nature of work, age and gender do not affect the duration of absence. Of the 403 patients who worked preoperatively, 369 participant resumed their work, of which 131 partially. 399 (of 403)Patients perceived obstructions due to overweight in daily life before and after the procedure. 87.7% (n = 350) of the patients noticed an improvement in their impediments after the procedure. 0.8% (n = 3) experienced a deterioration and 11.5% (n = 46) indicates that there is no difference. A large percentage shows an improvement in the preoperative impairments. And there is a significant relationship with the achieved weight loss.</p><p id="Par3112"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery show a significant reduction of obstacles in daily life and work.

The interactions among them were investigated through STRING v10 (Szklarczyk et al., 2015), a database of known and predicted, physical and indirect associations among genes/proteins. In this study, a high confidence interaction score of 0.7-0.97 was used.</p><p id="Par3125"><bold>Results</bold>: The intermediate nodes were also predicted, showing that KISS1 and KISS1R are connected directly to ghrelin receptor (GHSR) and cholecystokinin (CCK) and indirectly, via gonadotropin releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1), to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) of the stress-induced obesidome. The new advanced interactome involves 42 nodes of gene- gene products of known and/or predicted interactions.</p><p id="Par3126"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Interactions networks may contribute to understand the kisspeptin pathway for the integral regulation of energy balance and obesity pathogenesis.

The only long-term effective treatment for morbid obesity is surgery. To optimize perioperative management in bariatric surgery, the Enhanced Recovery After Bariatric Surgery pathway (ERABS) has been developed, which starts at the first visit to the outpatient clinic and continues until full recovery after surgery. ERABS can be enhanced by optimization of the preoperative and postoperative phase, which is called the Fast Track protocol and aims to create a care path that is as safe, efficient and patient-friendly as possible. Continuous evaluation and optimization of ERABS and the Fast Track Protocol is important and can result in more procedures per day and better outcomes. Over the years we have made several alterations to our hospital’s protocol, including, amongst other things, an extra dietary educational session before discharge and ambulation under the guidance of a physical therapist. Here, we present the impact of these alterations, placed in the context of current literature. Data was prospectively collected from patients undergoing bariatric surgery between January 2016 and September 2017 under the newest ERABS protocol. Patients were compared to matched (age, BMI, medical history, procedure) controls who underwent bariatric surgery between January 2014 and December 2015 under the earlier protocol, for rates of complications, revisits to the emergency ward or outpatient clinic, and readmissions within 30 days postoperatively. Our results show that these additional steps made to optimize the fast track protocol, result in improved perioperative patient experience and fewer unplanned hospital visits.</p><p id="Par3145"><bold>P-063</bold></p><p id="Par3146"><bold>The predictive value of pre-existing psychological and social-environmental factors for weight regain after bariatric surgery</bold></p><p id="Par3147"><underline>Danielle Bonouvrie</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Martine Uittenbogaart<sup>1, b)</sup>, Arijan Luijten<sup>1, c)</sup>, Francois Van Dielen<sup>1, d)</sup>, Wouter Leclercq<sup>1, e)</sup>, Charlotte Lieverse<sup>2, f)</sup>, Noor Schuilwerve<sup>2, g)</sup></p><p id="Par3148"><sup>1)</sup>Bariatric Surgery, Maxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, Netherlands</p><p id="Par3149"><sup>2)</sup>Psychological, Maxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, Netherlands</p><p id="Par3150"><sup>a)</sup>danielle.bonouvrie@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3151"><sup>b)</sup>m.uittenbogaart@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3152"><sup>c)</sup>a.luijten@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3153"><sup>d)</sup>F.vandielen@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3154"><sup>e)</sup>w.leclercq@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3155"><sup>f)</sup>charlotte.lieverse@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3156"><sup>g)</sup>noor.schuilwerve@mmc.nl</p><p id="Par3157"><bold>Introduction</bold>: One major concern of bariatric surgery is weight regain, which is observed in up to 50% of the patients. Causes mentioned are surgical related and non-surgical related (including psychological, socio-environmental and biological). Psychological disorders, of which somatization is the most common, are observed in about 50% of the patients. Understanding the association between pre-existing non-surgical factors and weight regain is important to enable better patient selection. Aim of this study was to determine whether non-surgical factors, especially somatization, are associated with subsequent weight regain.</p><p id="Par3158"><bold>Methods</bold>: 111 patients were retrospectively included in this study. Data were obtained from medical health records and the electronic patient register of patients referred for bariatric surgery between January 2012 and October 2013. Psychological factors were assessed using the SCL-90 as part of pre-surgical screening.</p><p id="Par3159"><bold>Results</bold>: At two years follow-up, 13.5% of the patients showed weight regain with a mean regain of 8%. Higher levels of somatization were independently predictive of less weight regain. There was no statistically significant association between weight regain and other non-surgical factors.</p><p id="Par3160"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Successful maintenance of weight loss following bariatric surgery appears to occur more often in patients who rapport more somatic complaints at baseline. There was no other significant association between non-surgical factors and weight regain. These findings suggest that focusing on physical symptoms does not contribute to patient selection to ensure better outcome. Prospective large studies are needed to confirm this finding and evaluate intervention that target somatic symptom perception following bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par3161"><bold>P-064</bold></p><p id="Par3162"><bold>Long term results after standard gastric bypass regarding nutritional status</bold></p><p id="Par3163">Harilaos Pappis<sup>1, a)</sup>, Iraklis Perysinakis<sup>1, b)</sup>, Dimitra Kotsakou<sup>2, c)</sup>, <underline>Alexia Katsarou</underline><sup>1, d)</sup></p><p id="Par3164"><sup>1)</sup>Third Surgical Department, HYGEIA Hospital, Athens, Greece; <sup>2)</sup>Anaesthesia Department, HYGEIA Hospital, Athens, Greece</p><p id="Par3165"><sup>a)</sup>harry.pappis@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3166"><sup>b)</sup>iraklisper@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3167"><sup>c)</sup>dkotsakou@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3168"><sup>d)</sup>katsaroualexia@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3169"><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and diabetes mellitus (DM) after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).</p><p id="Par3170"><bold>Methods:</bold> Bariatric patients that underwent LRYGB in a single Surgical Department were included in this study. Pre-existing nutritional deficiencies were corrected preoperatively. Postoperative nutritional supplementation and dietary support were recommended to all participants for at least two years according to published guidelines. Patients were followed-up for five years with phone interviews and biochemical nutritional screening. The impact of surgery on DM was also recorded.</p><p id="Par3171"><bold>Results:</bold> Between 2007 and 2012, 114 patients were recruited to undergo LRYGB. Mean age of participants was 53 years and 81% of them were postmenopausal women. Among them, 92 (80%) complied with the follow-up protocol. Preoperative BMI was 44.7± 6.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> whereas mean BMI one and five years postoperatively was 27.3±5.2 and 28.6±6.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively. The majority of patients (65 out of 92) complied with nutritional supplementation. Most patients (74%) did not undertake the appropriate visits to the dietitian, whereas only 32% of patients declared having moderately improved their dietary habits. Regarding nutritional deficiencies, 32% of patients developed asymptomatic anemia, 16% developed Vitamin D deficiency and 9% presented elevated PTH levels, irrespectively of nutritional supplementation compliance. Protein levels remained normal in all patients. Decrease in B12 and folic acid levels developed in 33% of patients not taking nutritional supplementation (9 out of 27). Preoperatively 37 patients had diabetes mellitus and were under medication. Euglycemic response was observed in the majority of diabetic patients. Interestingly, DM resolved in 21 out of 37 patients.</p><p id="Par3172"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LRYGB may cause mild anemia and calcium dyshomeostasis (to a lesser extent) in Greek postmenopausal women but not protein deficiency. Preserving B12 and folic acid levels appears to depend on nutritional supplementation compliance. DM resolves in most patients. Although these deficiencies are easily corrected, preventive nutritional supplementation postoperatively must be emphasized. Furthermore, compliance with dietary advice and follow-up visits may improve the outcome.</p><p id="Par3173"><bold>P-065</bold></p><p id="Par3174"><bold>Using mHealth for weight loss: A systematic review of evidence</bold></p><p id="Par3175"><underline>Katerina Dounavi</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Olga Tsoumani<sup>2, b)</sup></p><p id="Par3176"><sup>1)</sup>School of Social Sciences, Education and Social Work, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom; <sup>2)</sup>Department of Marketing &amp; Organization Studies/Behavioural Engineering Group, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium</p><p id="Par3177"><sup>a)</sup>k.dounavi@qub.ac.uk</p><p id="Par3178"><sup>b)</sup>olga.tsoumani@kuleuven.be</p><p id="Par3179">Weight management, encompassing both weight loss and the long-term maintenance of weight-loss changes, requires the modification of dietary and physical activity habits.

The control group consisted of 60 non-obese women (mean BMI of 22.2 ± 1.9kg/m²; mean age of 36.4 ± 10.7 years). The FSFI assesses sexual function across 6 domains: sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction and sexual pain; higher scores indicating better sexual function.

This approach can prevent nutritional deficiencies and other medical complications that could occur due to an altered digestive system and can also minimize weight regain. Currently, there are no strict guidelines as to the frequency or content of medical follow-ups after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).</p><p id="Par3242">In our bariatric surgery center we have been performing medical follow-ups at one, three, six and 12 months after LSG, and yearly afterwards. These visits include a comprehensive discussion about symptoms, a complete clinical examination, blood tests and other measurements (Figure 1 describes this protocol). We provide nutritional counselling at each of these visits, tailored by the test results. Whereas the 3, 6, and 12 month after surgery visits are recommended by most guidelines, we also included the one-month after surgery visit to detect and correct promptly any nutritional problems, mainly related to dehydration or improper protein intake. As the number of patients followed in our center increases and resources are limited, we debated whether there is a need for a complete check-up one month after LSG.</p><p id="Par3243">We investigated 120 patients (38 men) that have been folllowed in the previous year in our center. Their average age was 42.2+/-11 years and average body mass index prior to surgery was 45.8+/-7.4 kg/m2. At one month after surgery we did not encounter renal or hepatic ambormalities. There was a significant decrease in hemoglobin and total protein level, but not in albumin level, and these differences were consistent with those found at 3, 6, 12 months after surgery. Only uric acid level had a significant increase at one month, which was then reversed. These data are presented in Figure 2.</p><p id="Par3244">One month after LSG performing biological tests could be redundant, but the nutritional councelling is certainly useful and we will need further research to see whether this visit could be omitted without decreasing efficiency of treatment.</p><fig id="Figbm" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figbm_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO55"/></fig><fig id="Figbn" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figbn_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO56"/></fig><p id="Par3245"><bold>P-071</bold></p><p id="Par3246"><bold>Role of the gastric balloon for the treatment of morbid obesity</bold></p><p id="Par3247"><underline>Mohammad Alkilani</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Giuseppe Musolino, Cecille Lenard</p><p id="Par3248">Surgery, S.

Treatment includes a 48-hour fast and an anti-emetic therapy for 48 hours. The balloon can remain in place for a period of 4 months but it is possible to extend the period to 6 months.

It is associated with adverse effects on almost all the organ systems and can dramatically decrease the life expectancy and the quality of life. Bariatric surgery is currently the gold standard treatment for severe and morbid obesity allowing improvement of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In Bulgaria this treatment method is just making its first steps. Our team was the first in the country to develop and apply a multidisciplinary program for bariatric surgery for the Bulgarian Public Health System (BPHS).</p><p id="Par3264"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Between September 2016 and November 2017 fifty patients were included in our multidisciplinary program for bariatric surgery. After weekly consultations and proper preoperative examinations carried out respectively by surgeons, dietitians, psychiatrists, endocrinologists, cardiologists and pulmonologist the patients were selected for surgery. Ten patients (six females and four males) underwent laparoscopic bariatric procedure. Seven Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, two sleeve gastrectomies and one mini (omega) gastric bypass were performed. The mean age was of 44,3 +/- 12,2 and the mean preoperative BMI was of 48,8 +/- 6,4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The studied variables included hospital stay, intraoperative complications, early and late postoperative complications, mortality. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and metabolic marker data were abstracted at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.</p><p id="Par3265"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean hospital stay was 4,1 +/- 0,8 days. No intraoperative and early postoperative complications were registered. Perioperative and postoperative mortality was 0. One year after the operation the first patient develop an internal hernia treated uneventfully. The %EWL at 3 and 6 months was 40,5% and 53,9%. All metabolic markers showed improvement.</p><p id="Par3266"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Bariatric surgery allows substantial short-term reduction in weight and amelioration in metabolic markers. The adoption of a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach led to proper patient selection and to significant improvements in the complications rate and in the postoperative outcomes. It is reproducible and potentially beneficial within the context of the BPHS.</p><p id="Par3267"><bold>P-073</bold></p><p id="Par3268"><bold>Effect on vitamin B12 on neuropathy in pernicious anemia treated with folic acid supplementation: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par3269">Hendrika Smelt<sup>1)</sup>, <underline>Sjaak Pouwels</underline><sup>2)</sup>, Mohammed Said<sup>1)</sup>, Johannes Smulders<sup>1)</sup></p><p id="Par3270"><sup>1)</sup>Surgery, Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, Netherlands</p><p id="Par3271"><sup>2)</sup>Surgery, Franciscus Gasthuis &amp; Vlietland, Rotterdam/Schiedam, Netherlands</p><p id="Par3272">The rising rates of bariatric surgery (BS) are accompanied by neurologic complications related to nutrient deficiencies. One of the risk factors for neurologic complications in BS patients is less vitamin and mineral supplementation. Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these disorders are necessary parts of lifelong care after BS. Particularly important for optimal functioning of the nervous system are thiamine, pyridoxine, niacin, cobalamin, vitamin E, copper, and possibly folic acid (1). In this case report we report on a patient with anemia and a lot of deficiencies in blood results after BS who developed psychiatric-neurological symptoms due to folic acid supplementation in an untreated cobalamin deficiency.

Anthropometrics (weight, height, BMI), number of visits, and diabetic status were recorded. Subjects were divided by the median number of visits (7.0) into a frequent (FA) and infrequent attendance (IFA) group, and their respective weight loss at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months was expressed as ΔBMI%. The percentage of patients achieving the clinically relevant weight loss goals of 5% and 10% was assessed.</p><p id="Par3281"><bold>Results:</bold> Initial BMI was higher in the FA group (40.0±8.1 vs 37.3±7.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean±SD, p=0.04).

Differences remained significant after adjustment for initial BMI. The 5% weight loss goal was achieved by a higher percentage of FA patients (89.3% vs 63.6%, p&lt;0.001), as was the 10% goal (57.1% vs 33.3%, p=0.004).</p><p id="Par3282">In multivariable linear regression analysis, FA status was associated with a higher ΔBMI% at 12 months (standardized β-coefficient: 0.252, p=0.002), whilst diabetes was a negative predictor of ΔΒΜΙ% (standardized β-coefficient: -0.156, p=0.05), independently of baseline BMI and other possible confounders. In multivariable binary regression analysis, frequent attendance was associated with higher probability of 10% weight loss (OR: 2.61 [1.30-5.22], p=0.007), and diabetes with a lower one (OR: 0.29 [0.10-0.89], p=0.03).</p><p id="Par3283"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> An increased frequency of clinic attendance is associated with better outcomes in obese patients following a lifestyle weight loss intervention.

Nevertheless, there is сontroversy remains regarding biliary reflux after mini-gastric bypass/one-anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB). The aim of this study was to analyze biliary reflux and its potential long-term consequences on esofagogastric mucosae in OAGB operated patients.</p><p id="Par3294"><bold>Methods:</bold> Immediate and long-term outcomes (up to 30 months, mean 12 month) in a cohort of 70 patients undergoing surgery between 2014 and 2017 were analyzed. Patients were divided into two clinical groups, depending on the technique of gastroenteroanastomosis. A standard five-port laparoscopic technique was used. The first group included 32 patients who underwent MGB in a modified way in our clinic with the making of hand-sewn gastroenteroanastomosis. 38 patients were used the traditional technique with the making of anastomosis with using a linear stapler with a 45 mm blue cartridge. Then, mean 12 months after MGB, all patients was filled out a reflux symptom questionnaire (GerdQ). A gastroscopy with biopsies was done for all patients with a bile-reflux positive symptoms.</p><p id="Par3295"><bold>Results:</bold> The number of patients who underwent surgery were 70 (mean body mass index 46 kg/m2). Mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12 months was 74.3%. Comorbidity resolution, determined by medication use, showed a reduction in diabetes (71.8% to 15.6%), hypertension (37.2% to 21.4%) and hypercholesterolaemia (40.4% to 13.4%). The absence of enterogastric biliary reflux was observed in 81.2% of patients in the study group, the absence of an ulcer of the gastroenteroanastomosis was observed in 97% of the study group, respectively. There was one death unrelated to surgery.</p><p id="Par3296"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Modified MGBP appears to be a safe and effective operation for the morbidly obese. It is durable, with good weight loss at up to 12 months post-surgery.

DiaRem’s predictability of long-term-DR was moderate-high for RYGB and SG (AUROC: 0.81/0.78; 0.85/0.82 at 2/5y, respectively), and lower for GB (AUROC: 0.78/0.73). The lowest score range that includes at least 80% of persons exhibiting DR (sensitivity&gt;0.8) exhibited positive predictive values (PPV) of 81.3%/73.2%; SG: 82.1%/71.0% GB: 70.4%/64.3% at 2/5y, respectively. Yet, persons who did not achieve DR were distributed bi-modally across the score range. Ad-DiaRem trended to improve the predictive capacity, exhibiting non-significant increased AUROC only for RYGB (0.85/0.85), but improved PPV for the three procedures RYGB: 86.4%/78.2%; SG: 85.1%/76.2% GB: 72.2%/66.3% at 2t/5y postoperatively, respectively.

Risk factors are considered to be diabetes mellitus, BMI &gt; 40kg/m2, thombophilia, deep vein thrombosis, smoking and oral contraceptives. The optimal duration of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is not yet established.</p><p id="Par3393"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> The study group included patients undergoing a sleeve gastrectomy from 2013 to 2016 in which a PMVT was verified with a ct scan. All patients received a low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis. The time of occurring of symptoms, the clinical status, the need of a re-operation, the site of the thrombosis and the risk factors were analysed.</p><p id="Par3394"><bold>Results:</bold> A PMVT was diagnosed in 7 patients (3 female, 4 male). Directly after the operation no complications were observed and all patients were mobile. Unspecified abdominal pain was the main symptom which lead to a re-hospitalisation, 3-6 weeks later to a sleeve operation. In 4 patients the PMVT was localised in the portal vein, 2 patients showed an isolated thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein and in one patient a combination of splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis was observed. All patients were treated with i.v. heparin under ptt-monitoring. In 2 patients a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with no signs of hemorrhagic infraction of the intestinal wall. The majority of patients showed an improvement in clinical status after 2-3 days. One patient died as a result of PMVT. Possible risk factors (contraceptives, coagulopathy, or prior thrombosis) could not be recognised.</p><p id="Par3395"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PMVT is a rare complication after sleeve gastrectomy. Usually the thrombosis is incomplete and can be treated with i.v. heparin. In case of persistent abdominal pain a diagnostic laparoscopy should be performed. In our group the symptoms occurred after a period of 3 weeks as the LMH prophylaxis was completed, which lead to an actual extension of the LMH treatment to 4 weeks.</p><p id="Par3396"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold></p><p id="Par3397">M.

We present a one to two step surgical approach for the treatment of GERD after a sleeve gastrectomy.</p><p id="Par3408"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The data was collected from our data base of more than 3000 sleeve operations. The initial operation consisted of a repair of the hiatal hernia with a modified gastroplication/ anterior hemifundoplication (117 Patients). In 4 patients with a hiatal hernia grater than 6 cm we used a mesh augmentation. 4 Patients underwent direct a roux y bypass operation. In one case, in which an extreme dilatation of the sleeve was observed, a re-sleeve was performed.</p><p id="Par3409"><bold>Results:</bold> The average time of the antireflux operation after the sleeve gastrectomy was 35 months. The mean initial BMI was 48,9 and at the time of the second operation 34,1kg/m2, the average age 40,7y. In 93% of the patients the reflux could be verified before the second operation with endoscopy or radiology. During the operation we could identified a HH in all patients. Major complications were not observed although in one patient due to adhesions an open RNY Bypass was performed. After an average hospital stay of 2,5 days all patients were released. The symptoms of GERD were effectively treated in 75% of the patients with reducing or ending the need of PPI medication. 24 Patients with excessive GERD underwent a Bypass operation after 1 Year ( Roux- Y oder SADI- S). In all patients moderate weight loss was observed ( BMI drop 1,6 to 2,5 kg/m2 after 6 to12 months).</p><p id="Par3410"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The laparoscopic hiatoplasty with a modified gastroplication is an effective and safe alternative procedure to the RNY Bypass for the treatment of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy. Furthermore there is always the option of bypass operation in case of persistent GERD Symptoms.</p><p id="Par3411"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold></p><p id="Par3412">C.J. Halter, A. Knapp, R.

This systematic review specifically focuses on the influence of HP infection on clinical symptoms, complications and abnormal endoscopic findings in post-bariatric patients.</p><p id="Par3438"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A systematic search on the influence of HP infection on postoperative complications in bariatric surgery was conducted. The methodological quality of the included studies was rated using the Newcastle Ottawa Rating scale. The agreement between the reviewers was assessed with Cohen’s kappa.</p><p id="Par3439"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-one studies were included with a methodological quality ranging from poor to good. The agreement between the reviewers, assessed with the Cohen’s kappa, was 0.69. Overall tendency in the included studies was that HP infection was associated with an increased risk for developing marginal ulcers and postoperative complications. A meta-analysis on the incidence of marginal ulcers and overall postoperative complications was conducted and showed respectively an Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.508 [0.031-8.346] and 2.863 [0.262–31.268]. Due to significant heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses were performed.</p><p id="Par3440"><bold>Limitations:</bold> A few limitations need to be discussed. Among the included studies there is lack of adequate methodology and statistical analysis that impairs the possibility of good comparison. Also, the combination of different HP testing methods and/or the lack of confirmation test after eradication therapy in many studies is a limitation.</p><p id="Par3441"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HP infection is frequently seen entity in patients prior to and after bariatric and metabolic surgery. We assessed whether according to current literature there is an increased risk for developing postoperative complications after surgery in case of HP presence. Our meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity among the included studies, but an increased risk for developing postoperative complications in patients with a HP infection. After sensitivity analysis a decreased risk was found. This meta-analysis shows that a methodologically good study should be performed to clarify the role of HP in bariatric patients and the question whether HP should be eradicated preoperatively</p><p id="Par3442"><bold>References:</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par3443">Kelly JJ, Perugini RA, Wang QL, Czerniach DR, Flahive J, Cohen PA.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is widely performed in obese individuals. Although it is considered to be a simple technique, 0.7-5.3% is the rate reported for gastric leak [1]. Staple-line gastric leak is the most severe complication of the procedure and is common mainly in the upper portion of the gastric remnant. Leak is most frequently an early complication after surgery and is classified according to Csendes et al system based on the time of presentation after surgery [2]. On the other hand, late leak is infrequently reported [3-4].</p><p id="Par3497"><bold>Case Series Presentation:</bold> We present four rare cases of gastric leak 6, 14, 16 and 19 months after LSG in four obese patients who referred to our hospital. Although, all patients were treated and discharged uneventfully, they presented with abdominal pain and/or fever during their long-term follow-up period. Ultrasound of the abdomen, barium swallow studies, computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopies were obtained for each patient. Two of the patients underwent endoscopic treatment. Eventually, all of them had to undergo surgery due to deterioration of clinical condition. The patients have been discharged and are being followed-up in an outpatient basis.</p><p id="Par3498"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> While LSG is gaining popularity due to the increasing rates of obesity worldwide, its technical considerations and possible complications are becoming more clearly understood. Among all possible complications, late leak from the staple-line of the stomach is an extremely rare condition. Current literature lacks an official consensus on treatment of leak post LSG [5]. The presentation of this case-series aims to outline the mandatory role of the physician during the follow-up period of patients surgically treated for obesity as such complications may prove to be underestimated if not life-threatening.</p><p id="Par3499"><bold>References:</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par3500">Organisation for Economic and Cooperation Development.

In these patients, anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) can be a possible cause of the abdominal pain. ACNES is caused by the entrapment of the intercostal nerves between the aponeurosis and the rectus abdominis muscle and causes neuropathic abdominal wall pain.</p><p id="Par3517"><bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of this study was to describe the patient characteristics, diagnostics and incidence of ACNES in patients with a gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in their medical history. We also aimed to present the results of the several therapeutic options.</p><p id="Par3518"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective observational cohort study was performed on patients with the diagnosis ACNES and a medical history of gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, who were treated between 2015 and 2017 in our clinic.</p><p id="Par3519"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 34 patients were evaluated (94% women, mean age 45 years). 22 out of 34 (65%) patients had a medical history of a gastric bypass and 12 out of 34 (35%) a sleeve gastrectomy. The incidence of this diagnosis after bariatric surgery is estimated around 2-5%. In the majority of cases the pain was located in the left upper abdominal wall. The mean interval between the bariatric surgery and treatment for ACNES was 30 months. The mean maximum weight loss in these patients was 43 Kg. Lidocaine injection as treatment was possible in 32% of the patients and 68% underwent a surgical local neurectomy. The success rate of the surgical neurectomy in this group was 92%.</p><p id="Par3520"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: ACNES is a common late complication after bariatric surgery and could be a cause of unexplained abdominal pain. Local neurectomy is an effective treatment for this diagnosis.</p><p id="Par3521"><bold>References:</bold><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par3522">JB Carnett. <italic>The Treatment of Intercostal Neuralgia of the Abdominal Wall</italic>.

Post-LSG leaks are usually evident in the short-term postoperative period, presenting either as fever or as elevated drain amylase. According to Csendes, late leaks are defined as those presenting &gt;10 days post-operatively. Very late leaks (presenting &gt;1 month postoperatively) are rare, and the pertinent literature is scarce, to the point that the existence of this entity is doubted by many authors.</p><p id="Par3535"><bold>Material and Method</bold>: We present two cases of late leak following LSG. The first was a 35-year-old male who presented five months postoperatively, complaining of excruciating abdominal pain after binge eating, followed by low grade fever. The diagnosis was made by means of CT scanning and confirmed by upper GI series. The second was a 45-year-old male who had been operated elsewhere 9 years ago and had vague symptoms beginning almost immediately postoperatively, complaining of recent deterioration of abdominal pain before presenting to our department. Serial CT scans were non-conclusive, and diagnosis was eventually made by use of dynamic Sonovue<sup>®</sup> and upper GI series.</p><p id="Par3536"><bold>Results</bold>: Percutaneous drainage and one month of conservative treatment in the first patient was successful in controlling the symptoms, without healing of the fistula. Endoscopic treatment was tried in both patients, but failed due to the size of the leak. Laparoscopic internal drainage of the leak was initially attempted without success and conversion to total gastrectomy ensued. The second patient was initially treated with laparoscopic dissection and primary closure of the leak. Postoperative upper GI series showed recurrence of the leak, consequently total gastrectomy was also performed. Further postoperative course was uneventful for both and the bariatric effect was maintained.</p><p id="Par3537"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Late leaks are sporadic events post-LSG, but bear tremendous sequelae on pathophysiology and gastric anatomy. A high index of suspicion must be attained in any patient who has undergone bariatric operation, regardless of the time elapsed since the index operation.</p><p id="Par3538"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par3539">1.

This rare complication is currently being encountered more frequently with the increase in the rates of laparoscopic bariatric surgery procedures being performed worldwide.</p><p id="Par3547"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis was performed on all bariatric procedures performed in our center between July 2012 &amp; September 2017 to identify cases complicated by portomesenteric venous thrombosis. The cases were compared in terms of operative details, patient presentation, diagnosis, patient risk factors for developing thrombosis, demographics and thrombophilia analysis &amp; subsequent treatment and prognosis.</p><p id="Par3548"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 957 bariatric procedures were performed between July 2012 &amp; September 2017. Portomesenteric venous thrombosis complicated 3 of these cases (0.31%). Two of these cases had underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy while the third had underwent a gastric band removal and a conversion to a single anastomosis gastric bypass. Amongst these patients, 2 were female while 1 was male with an average BMI 38.9 kg/m2. Only one of these patients was a smoker while none of them tested positive for thrombophilias. The diagnosis of portomesenteric venous thrombosis was confirmed with a contrast CT of the abdomen as all patients were re-admitted between 4-20 days post operatively after being discharged on postoperative day 2. All three cases were managed with systemic anticoagulants and none underwent invasive procedures or were re-explored surgically. All were subsequently discharged in good condition.</p><p id="Par3549"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Portomesenteric venous thrombosis is an uncommon yet potentially fatal complication of bariatric surgery. A high index of suspicion, early diagnosis and subsequent adequate management is required. Based on this case series and the potential risk of portomesenteric venous thrombosis, we altered our clinical practice to include a 1 week course of low molecular weight heparin to be administered to all patients after discharge.</p><p id="Par3550"><bold>References:</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par3551">Angrisani L, Santonicola A, Iovino P et al.

Excellent long term results both in weight control and treatment of co-morbidities and low rate of complications are proven by large amount of publications. One of major complications of LRYGB is leakage from gastro-jejunostomy or gastric pouch with incidence between 0.1% and 8.3% in reported series. Most patients are treated conservatively with good results. Chronic fistulae rarely observed after LRYGB. Fistolojejunostomy described as possible treatment after sleeve gastrectomy but at the best of our knowledge not as a treatment of chronic fistula after gastric bypass.</p><p id="Par3594">We present a case of 59 year old male patient with morbid obesity ( BMI of 42.3) and severe metabolic syndrome. 40 years ago the patient had a laparotomy due to perforated duodenal ulcer. After comprehensive preoperative evaluation he was scheduled for LRYGB. On laparoscopy multiple adhesiones were found. After release of adhesions gastric pouch was created and gastrojejunostomy was done by linear stapler with negative leak test. On third postoperative day large amount of saliva- like fluid has been drained and a leak was diagnosed. On CT scan retrogastric collection was found and a pig-tail catheter was inserted. Large amount of discharge has been observed during next month. On upper GI series small leakage of contrast media was revealed with normal gastrojejunal anastomosis and without distal obstruction. An attempt to close a fistula by injection of bioglue failed –pigtail drain located in gastric pouch has been detected on gastroscopy without visible anastomosis between gastric pouch and jejunum. The patient was operated by open approach, pgtail drain was removed and after re-shaping of a pouch a new gastrojejunostomy by circular stapler was created. Post-operative course was uneventful and the patien continues his follow-up in bariatric clinic.</p><p id="Par3595"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par3596">1.

Gastric remnant creates difficulties for diagnostics in post-surgical period, considered as potentially dangerous area. 21 cases of malignant neoplasms after bariatric procedures have been officially registered since 1991. 12 cases were observed after Gastric bypass. Predictors of malignant neoplasms: polyps, GIST, H.pylori, ulcers, metaplasia, ectopic pancreas, gastric vascular ectasia, Menetrier’s disease. In case of detection of these changes, another type of procedures should be chosen or regular planned follow-up of gastric remnant has to be carried out. Ulcer disease in gastric remnant is quite rare complication. Out of 3,000 post-surgical patients, who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 8 (0.3%) was diagnosed with bleedings from the ulcers of gastric remnant and duodenum. Endoscopic diagnostics is significantly impaired. Double-balloon enteroscopy was described in 2001. Successful visualization is possible in 85%. However, this method cannot be used in case of prolonged bleeding. Diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy with intraoperative endoscopy through gastrotomy remains the most reliable method in case of prolonged bleeding. The surgical tactic depends on specific clinical case and remains at the discretion of surgeon. Dilation of gastric remnant is very rare complication after bypass surgeries and usually is a result of biliopancreatic loop obstruction. Incidence rate of this complication is 0.3%-0.6%. In this case, it is possible to detect enlarged remnant in X-ray and CT. Laparotomy or laparoscopy must be carried out immediately for decompression and elimination of possible causes of dilation. In 1999 gastro-gastric fistula was described in 49% of patients due to formation of so called stapled septum, without stomach dissection. Even with current approaches and technologies, rate of this complication is 3-6%. The treatment is only surgical, but endoscopic closure of fistulae could be achieved. The frequency of occurrence of choledocholithiasis after Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass is 0.4%. Methods of treatment are open or laparoscopic transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or open revision of common bile duct, endoscopic papillosphincterotomy and lithoextraction is also possible.</p><p id="Par3607"><bold>P-091</bold></p><p id="Par3608"><bold>Validation of the Nexfin® non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring validated against Riva-Rocci/Korotkoff in a bariatric patient population</bold></p><p id="Par3609"><underline>Sjaak Pouwels</underline><sup>1, a)</sup>, Bianca Lascaris<sup>2)</sup>, Simon Nienhuijs<sup>3)</sup>, Arthur Bouwman<sup>2)</sup>, Marc Buise<sup>2)</sup></p><p id="Par3610"><sup>1)</sup>Surgery, Franciscus Gasthuis &amp; Vlietland, Rotterdam/Schiedam, Netherlands; <sup>2)</sup>Anesthesiology, Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, Netherlands; <sup>3)</sup>Surgery, Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, Netherlands</p><p id="Par3611"><sup>a)</sup>sjaakpwls@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3612"><bold>Background</bold> The present study aimed to validate the Nexfin<sup>®</sup> monitor and to assess the accuracy compared to classical sphyganomanometry (Riva-Rocci/Korotkoff (RRK)) blood pressure (BP) measurements in patients with obesity scheduled for bariatric surgery.</p><p id="Par3613"><bold>Methods</bold> The validation process was done according to the protocols developed by the European Society of Hypertension from 2010.

However, a number of late post-surgical complications, such as peptic ulcers of the gastroenteroanastomosis, require further research and determination of treatment tactics. The patient 40 years old, male, weight 210 kg, BMI 54.1. On 25.10.2016, laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass was performed. In postoperative period, the patient was repeatedly treated in in-patient departments of the city concerning the ulcers of anastomosis. The patient did not follow the recommendations regarding nutrition and drug therapy, drank alcohol, did not abstain from smoking. Test for H.Pilory was positive. Eradication therapy was carried out. In December 2017, the patient was readmitted to hospital with clinic of gastrointestinal bleeding. Giant circular ulcer of gastroenteroanastomosis with signs of prolonged bleeding was detected, endoscopic hemostasis was carried out. There was recurrence of bleeding in 16 hours,the patient was operated. Laparoscopic resection of anastomosis was carried out, with reconstruction to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Due to partial penetration of ulcer to the gastric remnant and GIST in anamnesis, as well as for removal of gastrin-producing zone, the patient underwent removal of gastric remnant. The patient was discharged on day 7. Incidence rate of peptic ulcers of anastomosis in patients after gastric bypass ranges from 1 to 16% (5-6% on average) according to various data. Exact mechanism of ulcers formation in such patients is unknown, however in literature an important role is given to usage of NSAIDs, alcohol intake, smoking and failure to comply with the recommendations concerning administration of proton-pump inhibitors. Peptic ulcers resistant to conservative therapy are connected with large size of “pouch” or presence of gastro-gastric fistula. Patients with ulcers of gastroenteroanastomosis resistant to conservative therapy for 6 months, need a repeated surgery. Usually surgery includes resection and reconstruction of gastroenteroanastomosis, with partial or complete resection of gastric remnant. Significance of antrectomy for removal of gastrin-producing zone is disputable and also remains at the discretion of surgeon.</p><p id="Par3691"><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figbs_HTML.gif"/><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/11695_2018_3200_Figbt_HTML.gif"/></p><p id="Par3692"><bold>P-098</bold></p><p id="Par3693"><bold>Correlation between leptin and ghrelin expression in adipose visceral tissue and clinical-biological features in malignant obesity</bold></p><p id="Par3694"><underline>Gabriel Verdes</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Caius Lazar<sup>b)</sup>, Fulger Lazar<sup>c)</sup>, Ciprian Duta<sup>d)</sup></p><p id="Par3695">Surgical Clinic 2, UMF Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania</p><p id="Par3696"><sup>a)</sup>gabriel.verdes@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3697"><sup>b)</sup>caiuslazar@yahooc.om</p><p id="Par3698"><sup>c)</sup>fulgerlazar@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par3699"><sup>d)</sup>ciprian_duta@yahoo.com</p><p id="Par3700">Morbid obesity is a metabolic disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue (≥40%). This disorder is commonly associated with cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism and some types of cancer. The most common metabolic signals associated with the disease are leptin, ghrelin, with antagonic effects. Our study aimed at highlighting leptin and ghrelin expression levels, as well as establishing correlations between them and clinical-biological parameters in obese patients. The biological material was taken intraoperatively from the visceral adipose tissue. Expression of genes of interest was performed after total RNA extraction and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and amplification with TaqMan specific primers. The results of the study showed significant differences in the expression of leptin mRNA between obese patients and the control group as well as the gender of the subjects. Ghrelin levels correlated positively with obesity, but not with gender. There were no significant correlations between the expression of the genes of interest and the parameters studied (age, body mass index – BMI, cholesterol, triglycerides, glycemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism and hypertension). The results of the study suggest that the evaluation of leptin levels can be used clinically in assessing the metabolic status of the patient with malignant obesity.</p><p id="Par3701"><bold>References</bold>:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par3702">Kopelman PG.

Characterize an Appalachian bariatric and metabolic surgery population seeking care within a large, academic tertiary medical center. A retrospective electronic medical record (EMR) data extraction performed on 588 patients who underwent bariatric and metabolic surgery at an academic medical center in West Virginia between 2013-2017. Researchers extracted demographics, health and family medical history, dietary habits, psychological questionnaire scores, and anthropometric data from EMRs. Data were then entered into a HIPAA compliant survey database. The sample was predominately female (79.8%), Caucasian (92.1%), mostly West Virginia residents (79.9%), with commercial insurance (n=163). Nearly 37% received a high school diploma or less, over 60% were married, and over 70% received Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Average preoperative weight of patients was 299.2±62.8 pounds (n=585) with a BMI of 48.3±8.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=584); preoperative EBW was 144.5±53.4 pounds (n=585). Common medical comorbidities in this population included prediabetes (n=207, 35.2%), Type 2 diabetes (n=188, 32%), sleep apnea (n=242, 41.2%), high blood pressure (n=326, 55.4%), high cholesterol (n=222, 37.8%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (n=170, 28.9%), clinical depression (n=267, 45.4%), and diagnosed clinical anxiety or panic disorder (n=169, 28.7%). Validated psychological questionnaires identified the following: average Beck Depression Inventory scores were 10.1<underline>+</underline>8.6, and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were 6.1<underline>+</underline>6.6, falling within minimal range. Average scores on a measure of binge eating, Gormally Binge Eating scale (11.8<underline>+</underline>7.7), normal limits, along with scores on Audit-C (0.7<underline>+</underline>0.9), an alcohol screening measure. Dietary behaviors prevalent in this population included highest percentages of eating in front of the TV, rarely skipping meals, eating 2-3 times per day, a meal duration between 5-15 minutes (i.e., rapid eating), and eating in response to emotions 2-4 times per week. The current descriptive data underscore the importance of identifying factors that are salient and unique to an Appalachian population in order to improve and inform future lifestyle interventions.</p><p id="Par3791"><bold>P-102</bold></p><p id="Par3792"><bold>Propositions Assessed by the Chamber of Members of Bariatric Surgery Between 2003 to 2017</bold></p><p id="Par3793"><underline>Linconl Agudo Oliveira Benito</underline><sup>a)</sup>, Margô Gomes de Oliveira Karnikowski<sup>b)</sup>, Izabel Cristina Rodrigues da Silva<sup>c)</sup>, Lucas Pereira Machado<sup>d)</sup>, Miguel Ângelo Montagner<sup>e)</sup>, Maria Inêz Montagner<sup>f)</sup>, Valéria Cristina da Silva Aguiar<sup>g)</sup></p><p id="Par3794">Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences and Technologies, University of Brasília (UnB), Brasília, Distrito Federal (D.F.), Brazil</p><p id="Par3795"><sup>a)</sup>linconlbenito@yahoo.com.br</p><p id="Par3796"><sup>b)</sup>margoo1@unb.br</p><p id="Par3797"><sup>c)</sup>belbiomedicaa@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3798"><sup>d)</sup>lucasmachado@yahoo.com.br</p><p id="Par3799"><sup>e)</sup>Montagner12@yahoo.com.br</p><p id="Par3800"><sup>f)</sup>Inezmontagner13@gmail.com</p><p id="Par3801"><sup>g)</sup>Valeriadasilvaaguiar45@gmail.com.br</p><p id="Par3802">Proposals are based on all matters subject to the deliberation of the Chamber of Deputies (CD), constituting a proposed amendment to the 1988 Federal Constitution (CF), draft, amendment, indication, request, appeal, And control.

In order to acquire the necessary subsidies for the construction of this research, they were acquired through consultations carried out with the portals of twenty-seven (27) Brazilian Regional Courts, being the same (TJAC, TJAL, TJAP, TJAM, TJBA, TJCE, TJDFT, TJES, TJGO, TJMA, TJMT, TJMS, TJMG, TJPA, TJPB, TJPR, TJPE, PJPI, TJRJ, TJRN, TJRS, TJRO, TJRR, TJSC, TJSP, TJSE, TJTO). The study identified the universe of 3.446 lawsuits judged, averaging 137.8, median of 45 and standard deviation of 285.6. The highest preponderance was identified in the Southeast region (SE), which registered 51.20% (n=1.765) and the lowest preponderance was observed in the North (N) region with 0.55% (n=19). The state of São Paulo (SP) registered a greater preponderance with 38.90% (n=1340) and the state of Tocantins (TO) the lowest with 0.02% (n=1) process. By means of the present study it was possible to verify the existence of processes judged related to CB in the historical and geographical clipping analyzed.</p><p id="Par3818"><bold>References</bold>:</p><p id="Par3819">López-Fontana, G.
