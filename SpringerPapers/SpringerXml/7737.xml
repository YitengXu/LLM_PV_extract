The technique has been widely adopted to form semiconducting thin films for optoelectronic applications for which the defect density should be minimized to promote carrier transport and thus device performance. Highly crystalline semiconducting films including silicon, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide, and two-dimensional materials have been successfully grown via epitaxial growth to be used in solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and memory devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, conventional epitaxy requires a compatible single crystalline substrate, and the growth process is performed in extremely controlled environments such as ultra-high vacuum and temperature. Often, the grown materials should be transferred from the templating substrate onto a desired substrate for device fabrication by delicate lift-off processes. These limit not only the price competitiveness and scalability, but also versatility of the process for various materials and devices.</p><p id="Par4">For instance, the epitaxial growth of metal halide perovskite thin films for used in devices has not yet been achievable because of (i) the absence of compatible substrates to template the growth of the perovskite film, and (ii) the difficulty of inducing controlled nucleation and growth at the surface of a templating substrate. For the former, typical transparent oxide substrates and other charge transporting bottom contact layers used for devices cannot direct the growth of the perovskite film. Single crystalline chunks of halide perovskites and epitaxially grown thin films on single crystal substrate have been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but thickness-controlled layer transfer of the grown materials onto a desired substrate has not been successful. For the latter, inherently fast reaction kinetics during the typical solution process causes numerous nuclei to form in the bulk solution, resulting in the growth of randomly oriented fine grains with a high density of defects. In light of these limitations, huge research efforts have been devoted to control the nucleation and growth kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, but accurate control over the kinetics in solution medium is still challenging.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, strategies to incorporate layered perovskites into 3D perovskites have been extensively studied. Owing to their enhanced stability relative to 3D perovskites and favorable band alignment, layered perovskites effectively passivate the grain boundaries and surface of 3D perovskites, resulting in enhanced performance and stability of the perovskite solar cells and LEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We present here a route to induce kinetic-controlled epitaxial crystal growth of formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) perovskite thin films by using layered perovskite templates. The local epitaxial growth of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite crystal was observed during its solid-state phase transformation from the hexagonal non-perovskite FAPbI<sub>3</sub> when it is heterostructured with layered perovskite, whereby the growth kinetics was dependent on strain energy originating from the hetero-interface. Our first-principles calculations revealed a mechanism to engineer the conversion energy barrier between the cubic and hexagonal phases by a synergistic effect between strain and entropy. The slow heteroepitaxy enabled the growth of tenfold enlarged FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite crystals with a reduced defect density and strong preferred orientation. This nano-heteroepitaxy (NHE) is applicable to various substrates used for devices. The proof-of-concept solar cell and LED devices based on NHEâFAPbI<sub>3</sub> showed efficiencies and stabilities superior to those of devices fabricated without NHE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phase conversion kinetics</title><p id="Par6">FAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystallizes as its equilibrium hexagonal non-perovskite phase (yellow color, Î´-phase) at room temperature, and is transformed into its cubic perovskite polymorph (black color, Î±-phase) upon annealing at 150âÂ°C through a soild-state phase conversion process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In polycrystalline films, grain boundaries are at a higher energy state due to the additional contribution of surface (or interfacial) energy. Consequently, the grain boundaries act as heterogeneous nucleation sites where phase transition is first triggered. We introduced a hetero-interface at the grain boundaries by incorporating small amounts of layered perovskites into the precursor solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We varied both the amount and type of the layered perovskite to observe the effects of the hetero-interface (hereafter we define, control: bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, 1P: FAPbI<sub>3</sub> with 1.67âmol% of PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>, 3P: FAPbI<sub>3</sub> with 3.33âmol% of PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>, and 3F: FAPbI<sub>3</sub> with 3.33âmol% of FPEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>). We expected the hetero-interface area to increase in the order controlâ&lt;â1Pâ&lt;â3Pâ&lt;â3F (please refer to Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figs.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for discussion on the differences between PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> and FPEA<sub>4</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>).</p><p id="Par7">The layered perovskite/FAPbI<sub>3</sub> hetero-structured films were formed by spin-coating the precursor solutions, and the photographs of the films as a function of annealing time are presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. As-spun films were semitransparent yellowish irrespective of the added layered perovskite, indicating the formation of the hexagonal Î´-phase. Upon annealing at 150âÂ°C, the color of the control film rapidly converted to black within a minute, whereas the color change was retarded with incorporation of the layered perovskites; 1P, 3P, and 3F took approximately 2, 6, and 8âmin, respectively. The slower color change is indicative of a slower phase conversion process. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the phase conversion process was monitored by in situ grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement of the corresponding films at 150âÂ°C (under helium atmosphere on silicon substrates). Before heating at 150âÂ°C, all films showed a characteristic scattering peak around <italic>q</italic>â=â0.842âÃ<sup>â1</sup>, corresponding to the (010) orientation peak of the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase. As the films were annealed at 150âÂ°C, the peak disappeared with simultaneous occurrence of a new peak around <italic>q</italic>â=â0.996âÃ<sup>â1</sup>, attributed to the (001) orientation peak of the Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase. The Î´(010) peak of the control film almost abruptly disappeared after heating for 1âmin with simultaneous appearance of the Î±(001) peak, and afterwards the Î±(001) peak maintained its initial shape and intensity. On the contrary, the Î´(010) peak of the films with layered perovskites was retained for longer during the heat treatment and gradually converted to the Î±(001) peak, indicating slower phase conversion with the layered perovskites. To analyze the phase conversion kinetics, we plotted isothermal transformation diagrams as in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The relative peak intensity (integrated area under the peaks) of Î±(001) to Î´(010) was calculated from the in situ GIWAXS patterns as a function of annealing time (upper panel in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). A delayed phase transformation with incorporation of theÂ layered perovskites from control, to 1P, to 3P, and to 3F can be clearly seen. To quantitatively estimate the transformation kinetics, we fitted the phase conversion profiles using the simplified JohnsonâMehlâAvrami equation which describes the relationship between the fraction of transformed phase and the elapsed time (please refer to Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for details). The extracted k values (Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) are seen to decrease from the control, 1P, 3P, to 3F films, suggesting that the nucleation and/or growth rates of the cubic phase were significantly retarded by the incorporation of the layered perovskites. We also confirmed that the phase transformation kinetics followed the same tendency for films on SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates depending on the film composition by measuring the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films with different heating times (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and the lower panel in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In addition to the different kinetics, the GIWAXS peak shapes also evolved differently for the films with layered perovskites as compared to the control film. The portion of the Î´(010) peak with relatively lower <italic>q</italic> (higher <italic>d</italic> spacing, yellow arrows in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) disappeared faster, whereas the portion of the Î±(001) peak with relatively higher <italic>q</italic> (lower <italic>d</italic> spacing, black arrows in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) emerged faster. This feature became more pronounced as the phase conversion process retarded further, which implies the presence of strained phases and a consequent change in energetics and kinetics of the phase conversion process. We speculated that the introduction of the hetero-interface between the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and layered perovskites was probably associated with the observed strain and was responsible for retarding the phase conversion process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Phase conversion kinetics of formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) perovskite with a hetero-interface at the grain boundaries.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Photographs of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films on SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated ITO substrates with different annealing times at 150âÂ°C.

Upon heating the sample, nuclei of the cubic phase (bright spots indicated by arrows) formed simultaneously at both the bulk and boundaries of the grain (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, the bulk nuclei were redissolved within a few minutes (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), which is probably due to the relatively higher free energy barrier for stable nucleation. On the contrary, the grain boundary nucleus was stable and slowly grew towards the grain interior (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). As the growth proceeded, we observed that the distinct grain boundary present before the phase conversion gradually became less distinguishable, and thus we speculated that the adjacent grains possibly merged during the phase transition (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In addition, the layered perovskites at the grain boundary region grew and reoriented/diffused during the phase conversion process (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4aâd</xref>). As a result, we observed aggregated layered perovskites along with blurred grain boundaries of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film from the cross-sectional TEM images of the sample after the phase conversion process (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4e, f</xref>). We further noticed that the lattice of the as-formed Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> seemed to have aligned with the aggregated layered perovskites (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4g, h</xref>). <italic>Note</italic>: Since the in-situ measurement was carried out under vacuum on a sample with thicknessâ&lt;50ânm, the resulting microscopic morphology (grain size and layered perovskite distribution) may be different from that processed under ambient conditions. High-resolution TEM images of the 3F film were further analyzed to investigate the microstructure of the hetero-interface between FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and the layered perovskite (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2eâj</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). From the scanning TEM (STEM) images in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>, b, we identified the layered perovskite at the grain boundaries and surface of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> grains before and after the heat-treatment with its characteristic interplanar spacing of around 7.25âÃ corresponding to the (002) plane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> shows the magnified interface region between the layered perovskite and the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase before the phase conversion process. From fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the image in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, we found that the (002) plane of the layered perovskite is aligned with the (010) plane of the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase. The measured interplanar distance of the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> (7.25âÃ) at the interface deviated from that measured from their bulk counterparts; 7.11âÃ for (010) of Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6aâc</xref>. The larger interplanar spacing of the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> indicates the presence of tensile strain at the interface with the layered perovskite. From the TEM images and corresponding FFT analysis after the phase conversion process (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i, j</xref>), a semi-coherent interface between the layered perovskite and the Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> was observed. Despite of the semi-coherent interface, the (111) plane of the grown Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> orientationally aligned with the (002) plane of the layered perovskite, which implies that heteroepitaxial growth of the Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals occurred during the phase conversion process. The measured interplanar spacing of 3.61âÃ for the (111) plane of the Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> at the interface region was slightly smaller than that measured from its bulk counterpart (3.65â3.71âÃ, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6aâf</xref>), which implies the existence of compressive strain applied to the interfacial Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase. From this observation, we assumed that the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase (with its larger interplanar spacing) being converted to Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> (with its smaller interplanar spacing) at the initial stage of the phase conversion (as shown in the in situ GIWAXS measurements in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> with layered perovskite) was probably the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> at the interface with the layered perovskite. This indicates that the phase transition initiates at the hetero-interface, and the formed nuclei might grow towards the bulk of the grain.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</title><p><bold>a</bold>â<bold>d</bold> In situ TEM images of the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film annealed at the phase conversion temperature for different times.

We initially postulated that two factors may have contributed to the change in phase conversion energetics: (i) strain itself which can be directly responsible for increasing the phase conversion nucleation barrier as is well-known from conventional nucleation theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and (ii) change in entropy induced by the presence of strain, which was previously reported to be a crucial factor affecting the energetics of FAPbI<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The phase conversion energetics without strain is presented in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>. Firstly, to investigate the effect of strain, the energy barriers (Î<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>) between the cubic and hexagonal phases with the lattice constants fixed to the given interlayer spacings are calculated as in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>. Solid lines indicate the energy barriers with strain applied to the transition states, whereas the dotted lines are the barriers with relaxed (unstrained) transition states (interlayer spacings of only the hexagonal and cubic phases are constrained to the given interlayer spacings). Overall, the energy barrier increases when strain is applied to the transition state as expected from classical nucleation theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As the interlayer spacing decreases toward the 2D spacing, the compressive strain increases the cubic to hexagonal transformation barrier height by ~0.15âeV in comparison to the value for the fully relaxed lattice (blue arrows in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref> and second panel in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>), which will be beneficial for the thermodynamic stability of the cubic phase at <italic>T</italic>â&lt;â<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> (<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> is the critical temperature for phase conversion), correlating with previous experimental observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the case of the phase transition from the hexagonal to cubic phase (Î´âââÎ±), strain seems to less affect the Î<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> value. However, we found that the contribution of entropy becomes more dominant. The activated rotation of the FA molecule at elevated temperatures contributes to the entropy of the system, which is known to be more significant in isotropic cubic structures and thus stabilizes the cubic phase over the hexagonal phase at a finite temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

On the other hand, the rotational entropy becomes a key contributor in stabilizing the strained hexagonal phase. Under the tensile strain, the interlayer spacing of the hexagonal phase increases significantly, and the activated isotropic rotation of the FA<sup>+</sup> cation also becomes accessible for the hexagonal phase. We confirmed a more than 50% decrease in the rotational barrier induced by the tensile strain, while the rotational barrier for the compressed cubic phase is not much affected (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Consequently, the tensile strain applied to the hexagonal phase effectively increases the stability of the hexagonal phase at a finite temperature and contributes to slowing down the phase transformation process to the cubic phase (red arrow in the last panel in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Effect of the nano heteroepitaxy on film quality</title><p id="Par10">The effect of the NHE on film quality was investigated by comparing the XRD patterns of the films before and after the phase conversion process. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, all the as-fabricated films showed characteristic peaks originating from the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase with no significant difference in peak intensity, indicating that the added layered perovskites do not significantly alter the crystallization process of the hexagonal phase from the precursor solutions. On the contrary, the XRD patterns of the films after the phase conversion process were considerably different depending on the composition (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The intensity of the (001) and (002) peaks originating from the Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phaseÂ were systematically enhanced (controlâ&lt;â1Pâ&lt;â3Pâ&lt;â3F) as the phase conversion became slower, which is also obvious in the high-resolution XRD patterns in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>.

The crystallite size and lattice strain of the Î´-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films were further extracted from the full XRD patterns by using the WilliamsonâHall method (Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>, Supplementary TablesÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

The results are summarized in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>. The calculated strain of the films before phase conversion was closely correlated with the phase conversion kinetics, which confirms that the strain energy and resulting entropy change associated with the hetero-interface were likely responsible for the retarded phase conversion kinetics. The crystallite sizes before phase conversion were comparable irrespective of composition. Notably, the crystallite sizes were significantly enlarged as the phase conversion became slower (from 43.5 to 160.4ânm for control, from 43.7 to 417.9ânm for 1P, from 40.6 to 520.8ânm for 3P, and from 65.4 to 675.0ânm for 3F). Based on the observations, we propose the following mechanism for the NHE (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). (i) The added layered perovskite crystallizes at the grain boundaries with high surface energy, which would have otherwise triggered the initial nuclei formation. (ii) The strain and resulting entropy change induced by the hetero-interface retards the phase transition and local epitaxial growth proceeds from the interface. (iii) Owing to active reconstruction processes involving breakage and reformation of bonds during the phase transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, merger of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> grains and layered perovskite sheets can be thermally activated. (iv) Due to preferential orientation of the aggregated layered perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> grains also orient with respect to the substrate. Our first-principles surface energy calculations support the suggested mechanism, where the surface energies of the Î´(010) and Î±(111) facets are relatively higher than those of other facets (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>), which might be the origin of the preferential alignment of the layered perovskites at the crystal facets.</p><p id="Par12">Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films are presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>.

The films with layered perovskites showed enhanced absorptions over the whole wavelength region as compared to the control film, which is probably due to the higher phase purity as observed in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The peak PL intensity of 0.16âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> for the control film was significantly enhanced with NHE to 3.46âÃâ10<sup>6</sup>, 4.49âÃâ10<sup>6</sup>, and 5.34âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> for the 1P, 3P, and 3F films, respectively.

All films showed two decay regimes: a relatively faster initial decay (<italic>Ï</italic><sub>1</sub> ~3âns), followed by a much slower decay (<italic>Ï</italic><sub>2</sub>âÂ»â10âns). The faster decay component is generally assigned to charge carrier trapping caused by deep trap states originating from structural defects, whereas the slower decay is attributed to bimolecular radiative recombination of the free carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the fast decay proportion (A<sub>1</sub>) decreased from 39.1% for the control film to 38.2%, 27.8%, and 13.4% for the 1P, 3P, and 3F films, respectively. The decreased proportion of the faster decay implies reduced structural defects that constitute trap states, which is in line with the enlarged crystallite sizes. The reduced defect density with NHE was also confirmed from space charge limited current measurements of the films (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>), where the trap filling voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>TFL</sub>) gradually decreased from 0.618 to 0.445 to 0.415 to 0.332âV for the control, 1P, 3P, and 3F, respectively. Correspondingly, the estimated defect density of the films was significantly decreased from 1.08âÃâ10<sup>16</sup>âcm<sup>â3</sup> for the control film to 5.80âÃâ10<sup>15</sup>âcm<sup>â3</sup> for the 3F film.

From the absorption and ultraviolet (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, we found that FPEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> forms a more ideal type I band alignment with larger energy offsets of the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum with respect to that of Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, in comparison to the case with PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> (Supplementary Figs.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>).

Consequently, the average PL lifetime (<italic>Ï</italic><sub>avg</sub>) of the control film was significantly elongated from 20.6 to 750.8âns for 1P, 1090.7âns for 3P, and 1613.6âns for 3F.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Proof-of-concept devices</title><p id="Par13">This NHE approach to grow a high-quality Î±-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films was not limited by substrate choice.

It should be noted that our devices are altogether MA-free (including no MACl for crystallization control), Cs-free, Rb-free, and Br-free in the perovskite composition, which is beneficial to retain the inherently low bandgap of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and operational stability of the devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

The device based on the control film showed a short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>) of 23.69âmA/cm<sup>2</sup>, open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) of 1.040âV, and fill factor (FF) of 0.649, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.99%.

The measured PCE is competitive relative to previously reported devices based on MA-free, or MA- and Br-free perovskite compositions (Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The improved <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> was correlated with the improved external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device, where the integrated <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>s were calculated to be 21.55 and 24.07âmA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the control and NHE devices, respectively. The steady-state PCEs of the control and NHE devices were measured to be 15.12% and 20.87%, respectively (inset of Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The higher shunt resistance and lower series resistance of the device with 3F film calculated from the dark current measurement were correlated with the improvement in FF, whereas the lower ideality factor and saturation current were indicative of reduced non-radiative charge carrier recombination (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which contributed to the improved <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The LED with the NHE film as the emitting layer (EML) also demonstrated largely improved electroluminescent characteristics compared to the control device (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>). The normalized electroluminescence spectra of the devices based on the control and NHE films were almost identical (inset of Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), whereas the NHE device showed much greater radiance over the whole operating voltage range. The maximum radiance of the device substantially increased from ~70.78âWâsr<sup>â1</sup>âm<sup>â2</sup> for the control device to ~187.7âWâsr<sup>â1</sup>âm<sup>â2</sup> by using the NHE EML (165.2% improvement). The lower current density of the 3F device than that of the control is due to more effective charge blocking within the NHE EML, enabled by the grain boundary layered perovskite formation. (Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>). Consequently, the NHE LED device had a largely improved EQE, reaching ~8.28% at a low operating voltage (2.2âV), which is more than seven-fold enhanced compared to that of the control device (~1.11% at 2.4âV). The considerable performance enhancements for both the solar cell and LED devices can be mainly attributed to enhanced crystallinity and thus lower defect density of the perovskite films, resultingÂ in the suppressed non-radiative recombination of the charge carriers. This mightÂ promote effective charge carrier collection and enhanced radiative recombination in the solar cells and LEDs, respectively. Also, the grain boundary layered perovskites forming a type-I band alignment would additionally help to repulse the photo-generated or injected charge carriers from the defective grain boundaries, which will be helpful for the performance of both solar cells and LEDs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Proof-of-concept devices.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Device structure schematics and corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the solar cell device based on the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film with nano heteroepitaxy (NHE, with 3.33âmol% FPEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>). <bold>b</bold> Current densityâvoltage (<italic>J</italic>â<italic>V</italic>) and <bold>c</bold> external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of solar cell devices based on a bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film (control) and a FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film with NHE.

The stability of the solar cells was tested under 1 sun illumination (no UV filter) at open-circuit condition, where a more accelerated degradation is expected compared to the case of biasing the device at its actual maximum power point due to the stronger built-in potential and increased charge carrier recombination in the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Rapid initial decays in the SSPCEs of 20.3% and 8.6% were observed for the control and NHE devices, respectively. After the initial decay, a slower decay with an almost linear profile followed. After 650âh of continuous illumination, the SSPCE of the control device degraded to 63.4% of its initial value, while the NHE device retained 84.2% of its initial SSPCE. The T80 lifetimes (time at which the SSPCE degrades to 80% of its initial value) of the devices were then estimated with the assumption that the linear degradation profile is maintained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The T80 lifetime for the control device was estimated to be 733.4âh, and was significantly enhanced by 178% to 2040.4âh for the device based on the NHE film.

The layered perovskite-templated epitaxial crystal growth was induced during the solid-state phase transformation of hexagonal FAPbI<sub>3</sub> into its cubic perovskite polymorph. The phase conversion kinetics was retarded by the induced strain at the hetero-interface between the layered perovskites and FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. Our first-principles calculations revealed that the hexagonal-to-cubic conversion energy barrier was controlled by a synergistic effect between the induced strain and entropy. The kinetic-controlled NHE facilitated the growth of 10-fold enlarged FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite crystals with a reduced defect density and strong preferred orientation. Resultingly, our proof-of-concept solar cell and LED devices showed efficiencies and stabilities superior to the controls.
