These applications require advanced color imaging systems to possess a number of attributes such as high resolution, large FoV, compact design, light-weight and low energy consumption, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Conventional imaging systems based on CCD/CMOS image sensors suffer from relatively low FoV, bulkiness, high complexity, and power consumption issues, especially with mechanically tunable optics. Recently, spherical bionic eyes with curved image sensor retinas have triggered enormous research interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This type of devices possess several appealing features such as simplified lens design, low image aberration, wide FoV, and appearance similar to that of the biological eyes rendering them suitable for humanoid robots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the existing spherical bionic eyes with curved retinas typically only have fixed lens and can only acquire mono color images. Fixed lenses cannot image objects with varying distances. On the other hand, conventional color imaging function of CCD/CMOS image sensors are achieved by using color filter arrays, which add complexity to the device fabrication and cause optical loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Typical absorptive organic dye filters suffer from poor UV and high-temperature stabilities, and plasmonic color filters suffer from low transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. And it is even more challenging to fabricate color filter arrays on hemispherical geometry where most traditional microelectronic fabrication methods are not applicable.</p><p id="Par4">Herein, we demonstrate a novel bionic eye design that possesses adaptive optics and a hemispherical nanowire array retina with filter-free color imaging and neuromorphic preprocessing abilities. The primary optical sensing function of the artificial retina is realized by using a hemispherical all-inorganic CsPbI<sub>3</sub> nanowire array that can produce photocurrent without external bias leading to a self-powered working mode. Intriguingly, an electrolyte-assisted color-dependent bidirectional synaptic photo-response is discovered in a well-engineered hybrid nanostructure. Inspired by the vertical alignment of a color-sensitive cone cell and following neurons, the device structure vertically integrates a SnO<sub>2</sub>/NiO double-shell nanotube filled with ionic liquid in the core on top of a CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/NiO core-shell nanowire. It is found that the positive surrounding gate effect of NiO due to photo hole injection can be partially or fully balanced by electrolyte under shorter (blue) or longer (green and red) wavelength illuminations, respectively. Thus, the device can yield either positive or negative photocurrent under shorter or longer wavelength illumination, respectively. The carriers can be accumulated in SnO<sub>2</sub>/NiO structure, giving rise to the bidirectional synaptic photo-response. This color-sensitive bidirectional photo-response instills a unique filter-free color imaging function to the retina. The synaptic behavior-based neuromorphic preprocessing ability, along with the self-powered feature, effectively reduce the energy consumption of the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, the color selectivity of each pixel can be tuned by a small external bias to detect more accurate color information. We demonstrate that the device can reconstruct color images with high fidelity for convolutional neural network (CNN) classifications. In addition, our bionic eye integrates adaptive optics in the device, by integrating an artificial crystalline lens and an electronic iris based on liquid crystals. The artificial crystalline lens can switch focal length to detect objects from different distances, and the electronic iris can control the amount of light reaching the retina which enhances the dynamic range. Both of the optical components can be easily tuned by the electric field, which are fast, compact, and much more energy efficient compared to the conventional mechanically controlled optics reported hitherto. (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> compares our system with some commercial zoom lenses.) The combination of all these unique features makes the bionic eye structurally and functionally equivalent to its biological counterpart.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of the bionic eye</title><p id="Par5">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> schematically shows the human retina and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> shows the detailed structure of an individual cone cell unit. As suggested, dense photoreceptors arrays, rod and cone cells, are vertically aligned in the hemispherical retina. When an optical stimulus reaches these cells through the cornea and crystalline lens, it is absorbed by these cells to generate neuro-electric pulses. The pulses are subsequently transferred to retina’s neural network for preprocessing, where features such as color, brightness, and speed of the moving object are extracted and encoded. The information is then sent to the visual cortex for processing. Under the photoreceptors, the pigment cells can absorb the transmitted light to avoid the blurring from reflection at the bottom. The unique opto-electric conversion and the sensing-computation integration make our retina an efficient data acquisition system that is much more advanced than the current CCD/CMOS image sensors. However, the structure of the eyes can still be further optimized. The inverted structure of retina, which means the signal preprocessing neurons are at the anterior of the photoreceptors, leading to light loss and blind spot issues. And each cone cell is only sensitive to one color, limiting its resolution. Inspired by the functionalities and delicate design of the human retina, we developed a unique hybrid nanostructure to mimic the structure and function of retina, as schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The nanowire retina fabrication process is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. In this device structure, a high-density (&gt;10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>) hemispherical CsPbI<sub>3</sub> nanowire array (material characterization results are shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) is used to mimic photoreceptors since CsPbI<sub>3</sub> has a relatively narrow band gap (~1.8 eV) sensitive to the whole visible band. Heterojunctions with metal oxides are designed to modulate the energy bands and enable synaptic bidirectional photo-response behavior, which will be further discussed later in the manuscript. The Pb electrode at bottom can also absorb the remaining light to reduce aberration. The schematic of the hemispherical nanowire array is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. Nanowires are assembled in a hemispherical porous aluminum membrane (PAM), which can structurally support the nanowire array and isolate the adjacent nanowires to avoid cross-talking. Note that the length of the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> nanowire is crucial in determining the photodetection performance. For a ~1 μm long NW, under shorter wavelength (e.g., blue light, 0 V bias) illuminations, the carriers are mostly generated on the top of the nanowire and yield positive photocurrent. On the contrary, the device generates negative photocurrent under longer wavelength (green and red light, 0 V bias) illuminations. As such, the device exhibits self-powered neuromorphic color imaging function with a hemispherical geometry.

Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref> shows the self-powered photocurrent under red, green, and blue light pulses for the same light intensity (11 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>). The device yields a positive current under blue light, and a negative current under red/green light. Besides, the current amplitude under green light is higher than that under red light. This effect enables an intriguing filter-free color recognition functionality. Namely, blue light can be distinguished by current polarity, and red and green light can be distinguished by current amplitude. Apart from the bidirectional photo-response, the device also possesses artificial synaptic plasticity. While the device is exposed to or hidden from illumination, photocurrent gradually elevates and decays, respectively. This behavior shows similarity to the modulation of the strengthening and weakening of the neuronal connections in the human brain. Under two consecutive optical pulses, the response to the second pulse is significantly higher than that to the first pulse, which hints at an artificial paired-pulse facilitation. To further investigate the bidirectional synaptic photo-response, we have characterized the optical potentiation and natural depression of the device.

Optoelectronic surrounding gate effect can efficiently tune the photo-response behavior of nanowire structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In general, holes accumulated in NiO can provide a positive surrounding gate effect to the nanowire. Under shorter and longer wavelengths, the positive charges in NiO can be either fully or partially balanced by the drifting TFSI<sup>-</sup> ions from the ionic liquid, such that the positive gate effect will be fully or partially suppressed. The difference in the surrounding gate effect results in a reversed photocurrent polarity. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> shows the schematics of one-unit cell of the hybrid structure and its energy band diagram under shorter and longer wavelength illumination. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref> depicts two carrier transporting paths discussed as follows. Path 1 represents the path for hole transportation along the radial direction of the nanowire following which the holes are injected into NiO and move through NiO shell to reach NiO/SnO<sub>2</sub>/Au interface. As the mobility of NiO is relatively low and there is no external bias, the holes may accumulate in the NiO around the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> nanowire leading to a surrounding gate effect. Path 2 represents the axial direction of carrier transport which involves both electrons and holes. Intriguingly, we found that the direction of transport of electrons and holes can be reversed, depending on the magnitude of the aforementioned surrounding gating effect. Specifically, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>, blue light has a much shorter penetration depth than that green and red light. Thus, under 405 nm illumination, most carriers are generated on the top surface of the nanowire, near SnO<sub>2</sub>/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> interface. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c1</xref> shows schematically the overall carrier transportation under blue light. In path 1, even though holes can be injected to the NiO shell, as they are produced near the SnO<sub>2</sub>/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> interface, there is no significant amount of holes surrounding the nanowire. The positive charges in NiO can be readily balanced by the negative TFSI<sup>-</sup> ions in the ionic liquid and thus, the surrounding gate effect to CsPbI3 nanowire is minimal. In the meantime, part of holes can recombine with external electrons emanating from the Au top electrode to generate a positive synaptic photocurrent (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c2</xref>). The accumulation and release of holes result in a gradual change in photocurrent. In path 2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c3</xref>), as there is a small barrier at CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/SnO<sub>2</sub> interface, electrons tend to flow to the bottom Pb electrode. This scenario results in a positive photocurrent. Conversely, under longer wavelength illumination, both electrons and holes are generated deep in the nanowire owing to the larger penetration depth, so that holes injected into NiO shell can wrap around the CsPbI3 nanowires leading to a positive surrounding gate effect, as schematically shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d1, 2</xref>. In this case, TFSI<sup>-</sup> ions can only partially balance the positive charges in NiO shell near SnO<sub>2</sub>/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> interface. At the NiO/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> interface, when a hole injection steady state is reached, the two valance bands are close to a flat band condition. As the nanowire is relatively short, the positive surrounding gate shifts down the energy bands in CsPbI<sub>3</sub> with respect to Pb, leading to the formation of a Schottky barrier for electron at CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/Pb interface, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d3</xref>. As such, electrons tend to migrate to CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/SnO<sub>2</sub> interface and they are collected by SnO<sub>2</sub> then transported to Au electrode. And holes tend to move to CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/Pb interface to recombine with electrons. This process generates a negative photocurrent measured in the external circuit, as shown in Supplementary figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d3</xref>. As there is a Schottky barrier at the SnO<sub>2</sub>/Au interface, electrons can accumulate in SnO<sub>2</sub> layer and leads to negative synaptic plasticity. Green light with higher photon energy compared to red light, can generate carriers that are more likely to form external current and thus the photocurrent amplitude under green light is higher than that under red light. Moreover, the holes in NiO need to overcome a higher barrier to recombine with external electrons and therefore the device under blue light shows slower photocurrent change and more photocurrent states in potentiation-depression characteristics. We also performed COMSOL simulation of light absorption, electric potential, and density of carriers to study the device working mechanism. The results (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) firmly support the above discussion. Specifically, light absorption simulation shows red light and green light have longer penetration depth as compared to blue light (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b1–b3</xref>). Holes accumulated in NiO provide a positive surrounding gate that raise the potential of CsPbI<sub>3</sub>, and lead to the bidirectional photo-response (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5c1–d3</xref>). And the relatively higher density of carriers in CsPbI<sub>3</sub> NW supports that red and green light can generate carriers deeper within the nanowire compared to that of blue light (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5e1–f3</xref>). The length of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> nanowire and the incorporation of ionic liquid are both important for realizing bidirectional synaptic photo-response. Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> show two control devices with longer (~2 μm) CsPbI<sub>3</sub> nanowire, and without ionic liquid, respectively. With longer perovskite nanowire, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, the positive surrounding gate effect can hardly reach the CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/Pb interface and create an electron Schottky barrier as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d3</xref>. Thus, the device only generates positive photocurrent under different color illumination. Also, without the mobile ions in the ionic liquid which suppress the positive surrounding gate of NiO (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), the device can only generate a negative photocurrent.</p><p id="Par8">Apart from novel bidirectional photo-response behavior, the device also shows good weak light sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a, b</xref> shows the self-powered photocurrent under illuminations with varying light intensity. The device is sensitive to red, green, and blue light down to 400, 107, and 8.59 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. And the highest detectable light intensity is &gt;40 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Although the operational speed is limited by relative slow recovery process under blue light, we can use an electronic iris to control the optical stimuli that allow the device to achieve higher frame rate.

For example, image classification is the basis of computer vision, and it requires efficient color imaging hardware. However, in a single-step measurement, red and green color with different light intensities can hardly be separated. To reach a better color recognition standard, we developed a full-color imaging process based on three-step measurement. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows our color pattern reconstruction and image classification system. To further improve the color distinction ability of the bionic eye, we tuned the color selectivity by applying small external voltages. For example, small positive bias (&lt;0.5 V, Pb with respect to Au) can enhance positive photocurrent under blue light. Thus, the photocurrent under 0.5 V bias is mainly dominated by blue light positive photocurrent. On the other hand, when a small negative bias (&gt;−0.3 V, Pb with respect to CsPbI<sub>3</sub>) is applied, the Schottky barrier for hole transportation at CsPbI<sub>3</sub>/Pb interface will be reduced. Then carriers generated by red light with more photons in the same light intensity can flow to external circuit more easily and generate relatively stronger negative photocurrent than green and blue light. Therefore, combining the photo-response of three biasing conditions, namely, negative, zero and positive bias, Red, Green and Blue information can be extracted, and the device can reconstruct color patterns with high fidelity. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> presents the color pattern reconstruction simulation of Cifar 10 dataset based on the single pixel response. For each figure in the dataset, we simulate the bionic eye imaging based on −0.3 V, 0 V, and 0.5 V biased artificial retina, and collect three photocurrent maps, respectively. (Photocurrent density under different wavelength illumination and certain external biases are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>.) Then the three photocurrent maps are normalized to three 8 digits’ grayscale patterns, which are directly sent to R, G, and B channels, respectively, to form the reconstructed images. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows examples of original dataset and that reconstructed by the artificial retina, along with the reconstruction of a mono-color image sensor as comparison. Although the color is slightly different from the original dataset, there is enough color information for the following image classification using CNN. Note that biological visual perception-inspired CNN is a promising architecture for artificial intelligent (AI) applications such as visual recognition and image classification. Among typical CNNs, residual network (ResNet)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> is an efficient framework to build a deeper CNN for more complicated AI tasks. Here, we build a typical ResNet 18 architecture with 17 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) to demonstrate image classification.

Note that akin to a human eye, the nanowire array retina has photoreceptors with a polar distribution, that is, the photoreceptor density decreases from the fovea to the edge, facilitating excellent balance between pixel number and visual range.

The deposition rate was ~1 nm/s.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Magnetic field aligned Ni wire electrode arrays fabrication</title><p id="Par21">The back contact electrodes of the bionic retina are Ni microwires with 0.1 mm diameter and 2 cm length. A small amount of silver paste was attached to the top of a Ni microwire to improve its electrical contact with the retina. The wires were assembled on the hemispherical retina via a controlled magnetic field. The magnetic field is generated by a spherical permanent magnet and aligned by an iron ball beneath the hemispherical retina. With the magnetic field vertical to the hemispherical surface, Ni wires can vertically stand on the backside of the retina. A fixed red laser was used for marking the electrode position to put on the Ni wire. With a rotating stage, 36 microwire electrodes are assembled along one line of latitude with 10° interval, starting from the 20° latitude. With a lifting platform, 252 electrodes are assembled from 20° to 80° latitude on the hemispherical retina. Together with only one microwire standing at the north pole, there are 253 Ni microwire electrodes in total. After microwire assembling, they were fixed by dropping and curing ultra-violet (UV) epoxy on the array.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Spherical bionic eye assembling</title><p id="Par22">200 nm ITO was coated on a transparent concave glass as the front common electrode. The hemispherical retina with fixed Ni wire array was packaged on the spacer after injecting ionic liquid in between. The ITO front electrode was sealed on the retina with cured UV epoxy at the circular edge. The Ni wire electrodes were connected to a PCB board interface through longer copper wires, assisted by a small amount of carbon paste. The whole Ni wire/Cu electrode assembly was wrapped by a plastic tube to avoid contact with other electrode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Image sensing and synaptic measurement</title><p id="Par23">The single-color light pulse was generated by lasers. And optical patterns were generated by a projector. The photocurrent was measured by Keithley 2450 source meter unit (SMU). The bionic eye was connected to the SMU through 2 Ni box multiplexer units (PXI2530B, National instruments) which are installed inside of a chassis (PXI1031, National instruments).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Electronic iris fabrication</title><p id="Par24">A tunable LC iris is fabricated with both variable aperture and efficiency from 0.5 mm to 10 mm in five steps and analog efficiency, respectively. A patterned ITO and another common ITO are placed on the two sides of the LC. The gap between the ring electrode is 50 μm which is small enough when in the near field of the eyes. The LC molecule is aligned vertically in the same direction (88°). When the electric field is applied at different rings on the patterned side, the LC will show spatial rotation and analog efficiency. The LC molecule is a negative liquid crystal and will be perpendicular to the direction of the electric field. Maximum transmittance is achieved when the retardation of the liquid crystal is at half-wave condition. The transmittance is zero when the voltage is smaller than the threshold voltage. With a gradually increasing electric field, the LC molecule will lie down and show transmittance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Artificial crystalline lens fabrication</title><p id="Par25">The PB lens is fabricated by coating one glass substrate with SD1 (sulfuric azo-dye) after UV ozone exposure, followed by baking for solvent evaporation. As a photo-rewriteable alignment material, the PB pattern is mapped onto the substrate by interference. Specifically, the alignment pattern is written based on the interference of the blue light (λ = 450 nm) in transmitted mode utilizing Michelson interferometer. Then, assemble the two substrates by blowing spacers. The thickness of the cell is maintained at 3 µm by the glass spacers. Lastly, it is filled with LC, utilizing the capillary phenomenon.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank R. Ho, Y. Zhang, and A. H. K.
