However, developing low-cost, high efficient and stable photocatalysts remains the major challenge. Here we report a composite photocatalyst consisting of FeP nanoparticles and CdS nanocrystals (FeP/CdS) for photogenerating H<sub>2</sub> in aqueous lactic acid solution under visible light irradiation. Experimental results demonstrate that the photocatalyst is highly active with a H<sub>2</sub>-evolution rate of 202000 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> for the first 5 h (106000 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> under natural solar irradiation), which is the best H<sub>2</sub> evolution activity, even 3-fold higher than the control <italic>in situ</italic> photo-deposited Pt/CdS system and the corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of over 35% at 520 nm. More important, we found that the system exhibited excellent stability and remained effective after more than 100 h in optimal conditions under visible light irradiation. A wide-ranging analysis verified that FeP effectively separates the photoexcited charge from CdS and showed that the dual active sites in FeP enhance the activity of FeP/CdS photocatalysts.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19846.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep19846" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep19846</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The production of chemical fuels using sunlight is an attractive and sustainable solution to global energy and environmental problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Since the 1970s, splitting water using solar energy has received much attention as a possible means for converting solar energy to chemical energy by creating clean and renewable hydrogen fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) production using semiconductor photocatalysts is one of the most promising strategies for light-driven proton reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, most semiconductors cannot produce H<sub>2</sub> without a co-catalyst, even in the presence of sacrificial electron donor. This is attributed to the quick recombination of electron and hole pairs while migrating to the surface and the surface reaction being too slow to efficiently consume these charges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Generally, to prevent the recombination of electron and hole pairs, co-catalysts (such as metals and especially noble metals) are used to serve as electron sinks and provide effective proton-reduction reaction sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Platinum (Pt) is the most widely used co-catalyst for the photocatalytic production of H<sub>2</sub> from water because of its high activity and stability under the often harsh operational conditions. However, noble metals like Pt are expensive and scarce. It is therefore useful to develop high efficiency, low-cost, noble-metal-free co-catalysts to further facilitate the development of H<sub>2</sub> photogeneration. Several new earth-abundant metal compounds have emerged and can be good candidates for co-catalysts, including MoS<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, NiS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, NiS<sub>x</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, CuS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and other related materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, these co-catalysts also have the drawback of instability during the photocatalytic reaction. Very recently, metal phosphides, such as Ni<sub>2</sub>P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, CoP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, CuP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, MoP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and FeP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> have been found to have the high electrochemical catalysis activity and good stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid or alkali solutions. Transition metal phosphides, which involve the alloying of metals and phosphorus (P), have demonstrated high activity for the HER and hydrodesulfurization reactions because of their ability to reversibly bind hydrogen. However, the photocatalytic activity of these metal phosphides as the co-catalyst for H<sub>2</sub> production has not yet been fully explored. We recently reported that a colloidal metal phosphide (Ni<sub>2</sub>P or Co<sub>2</sub>P) catalyst combined with colloidal CdS nanorod photosensitizers displayed good photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> evolution activity in an aqueous lactic acid solution, revealing the co-catalyst potential of metal phosphides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Iron-based alternatives are especially attractive because Fe is the most abundant transition metal and its price is typically at least two orders of magnitude less than that of other highly abundant and catalytically relevant metals, including Ni and Co<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Iron phosphide (FeP) nanoparticles (NPs) as co-catalysts deposited on TiO<sub>2</sub> have been shown to be exceptionally active for sustained H<sub>2</sub> production in either acidic or neutral-pH aqueous solutions under UV light irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, highly active photocatalysts composed of high-quality, iron-based nanoparticulate materials under visible light irradiation are among the most desired because of their low cost, abundance and ease of processing.</p><p>Herein we performed a noble-metal-free system of visible-light driven H<sub>2</sub> production with the best activity and significant longevity. The system includes the semiconductor CdS and a FeP composite photocatalyst that together exhibit high activity and good photochemical stability under artificial and natural irradiation. The essence of the thermodynamic relationship between CdS and FeP is elucidated and the mechanism of effective charge separation based on the band alignment in such system is also studied in depth. This information will be useful for providing insight for the design and preparation of efficient semiconductor-based photocatalysts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of FeP samples</title><p>FeP nanoparticles were prepared by chemical conversion from Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles precursor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figs S1–S3</xref>) via the low-temperature phosphidation reaction under Ar atmosphere.

The well-resolved lattice fringes with distances of 1.8 and 3.22 Å correspond to the (103) and (101) planes for FeP and CdS, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed no clear FeP peaks after loading 5 wt% and 10 wt% FeP on the CdS (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). This lack of peaks may be attributed to effective dispersion and a lack of crystallization of FeP, which together may have led to a relatively low diffraction intensity of the FeP on the CdS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples of pure CdS and those when loaded with different amounts of FeP co-catalyst. Pure CdS absorbed visible light with wavelengths around 557 nm and a corresponding band gap of 2.2 eV. CdS samples gradually increased their visible light absorption as the amount of FeP co-catalysts increased.

However, bare CdS is unstable during the photocatalytic reaction because of photocorrosion, where S<sup>2−</sup> in CdS is oxidized by photogenerated holes accompanied with the elution of Cd<sup>2+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, which restricts its usefulness. To overcome this drawback, co-catalysts were generally loaded onto CdS to promote the rapid surface transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes from CdS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Herein, in a typical experiment, we performed H<sub>2</sub> evolution upon irradiation of a lactic acid solution (10% v/v, pH 2.0) containing the 5 wt% FeP/CdS photocatalysts (5 mg). The system continued to produce H<sub>2</sub> at a constant rate for over 50 h (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), later the hydrogen evolution will become gently and there is still hydrogen evolution after 100 h irradiation. A control experiment with no FeP yielded no substantial H<sub>2</sub> production (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Cycle tests also demonstrated that the FeP/CdS composite photocatalysts had good stability after four cycles of photocatalysis under visible light irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5</xref>). This longevity may be attributed to the effective separation of photoexcited electrons and holes on CdS photocatalysts, decreasing the amount of photocorrosion. The decreasing rate of HER after 50 h of irradiation may be attributed to increasingly bare CdS photo-corrosion caused by the detachment of CdS and FeP. XRD analysis of 5 wt% FeP/CdS before and after photocatalysis for 100 h demonstrated that the crystallization of CdS clearly decreased after long periods of photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S6</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocatalytical activity comparison.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photocatalytic activity of H<sub>2</sub> evolution over time from 5 wt% FeP under visible light irradiation at pH 2.0 solution.

The 5 wt% FeP/CdS photocatalysts exhibited the highest activity among the catalysts, with a rate that was more than 17 times greater than the rate for the physical mixture of 5 wt% FeP and CdS. This indicates that the intimate contact between FeP and CdS was crucial for the inter-electron transfer between the two components. Without FeP, CdS alone exhibited a very low H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate, more than 67 times less than that of the 5 wt% FeP/CdS photocatalyst. Without photosensitizer CdS, FeP alone did not exhibit any photocatalytic activity. The 5 wt% Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CdS exhibited activity levels that were slightly less than those for pure CdS, demonstrating that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is not a co-catalyst for H<sub>2</sub> evolution in this CdS system. The control experiments results suggest that the strong and repeated grinding action effectively combined the materials and ensured the formation of a solid–solid interface between the FeP nanoparticles and the CdS support, contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic activity observed.</p><p>It was worth noting that the photocatalytic activity of the FeP/CdS system strongly depended on the pH of the lactic acid solution that acted as the proton source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S8</xref>). Therefore, we adjusted the pH value of solution using HCl and NaOH prior to irradiation to ensure the same concentration of protons from the lactic acid. The maximal H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate was achieved at pH 2.0 although significant amounts of H<sub>2</sub> were also obtained at both lower and higher pH values, similar to results observed in other systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. This pH-dependency is related to the concentration of various ions at the catalyst surface, the dissociation equilibrium of lactic acid (HL ↔ H<sup>+</sup> + L<sup>−</sup>) and the stability of CdS among other factors. For example, at higher pH values the unfavourable protonation of the reduced FeP will decrease the H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Conversely, at lower pH values the dissociation equilibrium is suppressed, decreasing the ability of lactic acid to function as a sacrificial electron donor and the stability of CdS is decreased.</p><p>In order to further verify the activity of FeP/CdS photocatalysts, we also performed the photocatalytic hydrogen under irradiation by direct sunlight (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Here, a dramatic bubble was clearly generated when the quartz tube containing the catalysts and reactive solution was irradiated (as shown in the insert Figures). The robust photocatalytic activity of FeP/CdS photocatalyst was further demonstrated by a H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate of 106000 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> at midday on the first day of testing. In the natural sun irradiation movie in the air condition demonstrates also the continuous and robust hydrogen bubbles were generated using the composites catalysts (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">supporting Movie 2</xref>), which also shows the stability of catalysts under aerobic conditions.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocatalytic activity under Sun light irradiation.</p><p>Time courses of visible sola-light (glass filter) irradiation in laboratory using 5 wt% FeP/CdS photocatalyst (1 mg) at pH 2.0 in 10 mL H<sub>2</sub>O solution containing lactic acid (1 mL, 10% v/v).

The calculation model for the heterojunction metal-semiconductor structure of CdS (101)/FeP (103) is shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> with the calculated energy band diagram illustrated in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>. In the case of an isolated surface model (where FeP and CdS were not in contact with each other), the work functions of the metal FeP (103) and CdS (101) surfaces were 6.454 and 5.386 eV, respectively. Thus, when the heterojunction was formed by intense grinding, the contact of FeP and CdS creates an inherent electric field at the interface. This causes the energy band edges of CdS to be shifted downwards while the Fermi energy of FeP is shifted upwards (also known as band bending). After the heterojunction system reached equilibrium, the unified work function was observed to be 5.231 eV with the CB energy levels of CdS approximately equal to 3.57 eV, close to the experimental measurement of 3.49 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, the presence of the band bending can significantly depress the electron-hole pair recombination rate, consequently can promote more electrons to transfer out of the space-charge region at the interface to flow from the CdS layer to the FeP layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Also, the presence of the Schottky barrier means that the flow of electrons requires a larger amount of energy, which allows the photogenerated electron–hole pairs to be spatially separated by the FeP/CdS interface. Eventually, the oxidation reaction may occur on the CdS (101) surface with the separated holes, while the reduction reaction may occur on the FeP (103) surface with the separated electrons. In this way FeP loading can suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, acting as an electron-acceptor in the composite photocatalyst system. Based on this theory, it is clear that H<sub>2</sub> production by photocatalytic water splitting is possible, confirming the experimental observations above.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of photocatalysis by FeP/CdS composites.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The illustration of combination between metal FeP (P: lavender, Fe: purple) and semiconductor CdS (S: yellow, Cd: dull yellow).

All of the photocatalysts displayed the exhibited prompt andreproducible photocurrent, whereas without FeP, CdS generated a very low photoresponse. This indicates that loading FeP onto CdS can improve the charge transport from CdS to FeP, with the charge then passed onto the working electrode surface. The 5 wt% FeP loaded onto CdS exhibited the highest photocurrent density of all tested FeP photocatalysts, which is consistent with the photocatalytic activity results and again verifies that the 5 wt% FeP sample was the optimal content for photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production.

It should be mentioned that not all long-lived charge carriers at the surface of FeP can contribute to the course of the photocatalytic reaction, because the active sites on surface of FeP will decide the surface reactions. Fortunately, much more active sites on the surface of FeP because of the binary alloy capability will further increase the hydrogen evolution reaction. Work focusing on the electrochemical H<sub>2</sub> generation by transition metal phosphides has demonstrated that both the metal centre (Fe) and the pendant base (P) are active sites for H<sub>2</sub> production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

This is similar to the situation observed with the [FeFe] or [NiFe] hydrogenase where the active sites feature pendant bases proximate to their metal centres.

For example, a number of electrochemical analyses confirmed that both the metal centre (Fe) and the pendant base (P) are active sites for H<sub>2</sub> generation. The FeP nanoparticles also combined the merits of both metallic nanoparticles and metal complexes while simultaneously avoiding the decomposition associated with molecular catalysts, which together enabled highly efficient and robust photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub>-production. However, another band gap theory that illustrates how FeP functions as a semiconductor remained outstanding catalytic activity. In order to further study the properties, we also calculated the band structure of FeP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10</xref>). In the band structure of FeP, one can see that the highest occupied states and the lowest unoccupied states are contacted together near the k-point of G/S and the k-line of U-R, implying the zero band gap (i.e. presents conducting feature) along these wave vector directions. On the other hand, on the k-lines of Z-T and T-Y, there is an obvious band gap (about 1 eV), indicating that the semiconducting feature. This calculated result shown the anisotropy property for electronic structure of FeP, resulting in the semiconducting feature. Furthermore, in the partial density of states of FeP, one can see that Fe-3d states continuously fill the energy region near the E<sub>F</sub> level, which is the origin of the conducting feature of FeP; while above/below the E<sub>F</sub> level, there are hybridized states between Fe-3d states and P-3p states, which is the origin of the semi-conducting feature of FeP. Therefore, we combined the experimental analysis and DFT calculations both from the alloy and the semiconductor to demonstrate the mechanism that explains how using FeP as a co-catalyst enhanced the H<sub>2</sub> generation activity of CdS.</p><p>In summary, a low-cost yet highly efficient and stable semiconductor FeP/CdS photocatalytic system was successfully established using lactic acid as the electron donor.
