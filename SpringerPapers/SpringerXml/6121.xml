In addition, the TiO<sub>2</sub> overcoating not only increased the luminous transmittance of VO<sub>2</sub> based on an antireflection effect, but also modified the intrinsic colour of VO<sub>2</sub> films from yellow to light blue. The TiO<sub>2</sub> also enhanced the chemical stability of VO<sub>2</sub> against oxidation.

It is estimated that buildings are responsible for more than 40% of primary energy use in most countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, primarily for space heating and cooling for indoor comfort. Energy-efficient wall or window coatings are considered to be the first step for reducing heat transfer between the indoor and outside environments. Energy efficient commercial products have already been developed, such as the Low-E window that possesses a low emissivity to achieve high thermal reflectivity of infrared light. Although the Low-E window has been widely used in the building industry, one of its disadvantages is that it cannot change its optical properties in response to environmental temperature changes or different human needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Based on the metal-to-semiconductor phase transition (MST, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) smart windows can exhibit automatic solar/heat control in response to environmental temperatures without the use of any external switching device, in comparison with other chromogenic windows, such as electrochromic or gasochromic and it has recently attracted considerable attention. VO<sub>2</sub> undergoes a reversible MST at ~68Â°C, that is accompanied by a structural phase transition from monoclinic (P2<sub>1</sub>/c, M1 phase) to tetragonal (P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm, R phase) symmetry with an abrupt change in optical properties from transmitting to highly reflecting particularly in the infrared spectral region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thermochromic coatings have recently been developed using physical or chemical vapour deposition (e.g., sputtering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or CVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>), polymer-assisted deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and flexible foils by soft chemical methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and some prototype products have also been produced by our research group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The crystallographic structure of VO<sub>2</sub>(M1) and VO<sub>2</sub>(R).</p><p>After metal-to-semiconductor transition (MST), linear and equal-distant (2.880Ã) V-V chains along C<sub>R</sub> axis in tetragonal R phase become distorted with alternative distances at 3.132 Ã and 2.662 Ã with unit cell doubled in monoclinic M phase. Such a structural transition was accompanied with a small volumetric change of 0.044%.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2013_Article_BFsrep01370_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Furthermore, environmental pollution as a by-product of rapid industrial development is another serious problem in addition to the energy shortage. Air quality is worsening in large cities and consequently, for example, the windows/walls of buildings are becoming dirtier more easily and require more frequent, labour-intensive cleanings that require extra organic detergents which cause secondary contamination. It is known that photocatalysts are effective for the degradation of organic dirt compared to the use of detergents. Among the various types of photocatalysts, titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is the most suitable material because of its excellent photocatalytic degradation ability for organic pollutants and photo-induced hydrophilicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>From the above background discussion, it is hypothesised that a composite material with a combination of VO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> would present both energy-efficiency and environmental protection properties. This proposed composite is a thrilling concept and of great value for applications in functional films/coatings. In fact, a multilayer structure of TiO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>/glass deposited using PVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (magnetron sputtering) and a VO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>(anatase) composite film deposited using APCVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> have been proposed for smart window applications; however, the above deposition processes are either expensive or hardly demonstrate photocatalytic performance.</p><p>A series of studies by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> have demonstrated that a nanopowder-based solution coating process may likely be a superior alternative to the PVD or CVD methods because of some advantages including simple coating systems, flexibility for substrate selection, ease for large-scale production and low-cost. Note that such functional plastic foils are considerably more suitable for windows on vehicles and old buildings; the latter represents a very large market. Because of the polymorphism of VO<sub>2</sub> and the metastable valence of vanadium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, controlling the synthesis of VO<sub>2</sub> mono-dispersed particles with a pure crystalline phase and a uniform morphology has long been a challenge. The majority of the developed methods can only produce either B/A metastable phases or M1/R phases with non-uniform morphologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Fortunately, there have recently been exciting breakthroughs in the synthesis of VO<sub>2</sub> mono-dispersed single phase nanopowders by the hydrothermal method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These technologies make it possible to achieve flexible foils.</p><p>The high chemical stability, the modified colour of VO<sub>2</sub> film and a narrow hysteresis are three key requirements for VO<sub>2</sub> thermochromic coatings. However, VO<sub>2</sub> is gradually oxidised into toxic V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in wet ambient atmospheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which leads to a considerable deterioration of its thermochromic properties. Enhancing the chemical stability of VO<sub>2</sub> against oxidation is urgently required. VO<sub>2</sub> films with grain size below 600ânm usually hold a yellowish colour, which originates from visible absorption specially in the ~300â400ânm region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Reducing the yellow colour or changing to more acceptable colours favours applications for VO<sub>2</sub>. Hysteresis problem is rarely considered in powder-based films at present, however in principle, 20~26Â°C is considered to be a favorable temperature range for human comfort, so hysteresis higher than ~6Â°C will be inappropriate for real applications. However, films prepared using powders in reported studies commonly exhibited a very wide hysteresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. For smart coatings deposited by PVD, it has been reported that a TiO<sub>2</sub> layer coated on a VO<sub>2</sub> film enhanced the luminous transmittance through an anti-reflecting (AR) effect, which may also likely protect the VO<sub>2</sub> film against oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>Similarly in the case of nanopowders, core/shell nanotechnology is an available and facile method to obtain multifunctional VO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> powders. Some pioneering works using VO<sub>2</sub> as a core for the formation of core-shell composites have been reported. Jin, P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Gao, Y. F. et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> prepared VO<sub>2</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub> core-shell nanoparticles and Gao successfully made them into flexible foils with excellent solar energy modulation abilities and highly enhanced chemical stability. Although TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibits advantages over SiO<sub>2</sub> because of its photocatalytic properties, there are no reports on the production of high performance VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> composite nanopowders with both thermochromic and photocatalytic properties and a high chemical stability.</p><p>In this paper, we report for the first time synthesis of novel VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> core/shell nanoparticles using the consecutive hydrothermal synthesis of VO<sub>2</sub>, the sol-gel to prepare the titania precursor coating and a strictly controlled vacuum-annealing for crystallising the titania shell (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> core/shell nanoparticles exhibit multiple functions: thermochromism from the VO<sub>2</sub> core for solar energy modulation, photocatalytic properties from the TiO<sub>2</sub> shell for environmental purification and highly enhanced chemical stability of VO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, it was observed that a TiO<sub>2</sub> layer with a proper thickness can increase the visible transmittance of the coating using VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and modify the yellow colour to a more pleasant blue one. Meanwhile, the coated VO<sub>2</sub> showed a narrower hysteresis. The above technique breakthroughs will play a role in obtaining materials with integrated energy-savings and environmental protection functions for building applications.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustration of coating and annealing procedures.</p><p>By sol-gel reaction at 80Â°C with reflux condenser for 2âh, TBOT was hydrolysed and precipitated onto the surface of VO<sub>2</sub> nanorods and then collected by filtration.

In our process, homogeneous precipitation was largely diminished (the filtrate solution did not exhibit the Tyndall effect) by adopting the above mentioned lower concentration of reagents and the slow addition method to avoid a large degree of supersaturation. Therefore, titania species will preferentially precipitate onto the surface of the core VO<sub>2</sub> rods to form shell coatings.</p><p>To obtain a crystalline coating, the annealing procedure was carefully investigated because of the ease of oxidation of VO<sub>2</sub> in air or oxygen-rich atmospheres at relatively high temperatures (~&gt;350Â°C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The results from TG-DTA measurements (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) indicate that samples N1 and N2 initially experienced a considerable mass loss until 300~350Â°C that resulted from the oxidation of organic -OR (R  =  (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), which was followed by an abrupt weight gain caused by the oxidation of VO<sub>2</sub>. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transition from the amorphous titania gel precursor to anatase commonly begins at approximately ~350Â°C and a higher temperature, such as ~400Â°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, favours an increase in crystallinity. Oxygen is essential for the removal of organic species (-OR) in amorphous titania shells, but an excessive amount of O<sub>2</sub> leads to the oxidation of VO<sub>2</sub>. The two critical synthesis parameters, annealing temperature (T) and air pressure (P), should be carefully controlled to crystallise titania without oxidising VO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To determine the appropriate annealing parameters, the annealing performance of VO<sub>2</sub> powders was investigated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). At temperatures greater than 500Â°C, pure VO<sub>2</sub> can be oxidised into high-valence vanadium oxides (e.g., V<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) at a rather high pressure (~30 torr, an oxygen-rich atmosphere) or change into amorphous or partially reduced states under oxygen-deficient conditions (~48 mtorr). Similar results have been reported in the study of the synthesis of a VO<sub>2</sub> film by reduction from V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, in which a temperature and pressure-dependent dynamic equilibrium <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2013_Article_BFsrep01370_IEq1_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula> between V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and its reduced derivatives was revealed. This redox behaviour is a result of the multi-valence nature of the V-O system and a rather narrow solubility range of oxygen in the VO<sub>2</sub> lattice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This result implies that an appropriate oxidative atmosphere (with a certain proportion of oxygen at an air pressure of 48âmtorr~3âtorr) with a proper temperature (400Â°C ~450Â°C) are preferable for obtaining the crystallisation of titania while keeping the VO<sub>2</sub> core intact.</p><p>Based on the above discussion, the four composite samples were annealed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Fig. S3</xref>) and the optimised temperature and air pressure were ~400Â°C and ~3âtorr, respectively. All samples under discussion in the following sections of this paper were treated using this same protocol. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> presents the XRD patterns of samples N1âN4 before and after annealing. In the VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>x</sub> (amorphous gel) samples before annealing (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4-a</xref>), only peaks belonging to VO<sub>2</sub> (JCPDF card No. 82-0661) were detected, which indicates that the gel coatings in all samples are amorphous or poorly crystallised. After annealing, the amorphous gel coatings were crystallised into anatase (JCPDF card No. 21-1272) without changes of the VO<sub>2</sub> crystalline phase. However, the peaks that correspond to titanium oxides were not clearly detected for sample N1 because of a limited thickness, which will be discussed in the following.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XRD patterns for pure VO<sub>2</sub> and composite samples (N1 to N4) before (a) and after (b) annealing.</p><p>Before annealing, only VO<sub>2</sub> can be detected, indicating the shell was amorphous or poorly crystallized.

Thick coatings (100~200ânm for N3 and N4) contain a considerable amount of apparent cracks that result from the relaxation of thermal stress, which can hardly be observed in the thinner coatings (N1 and N2). By increasing the loading amount of VO<sub>2</sub> (m/g), the mean coating thickness (d/nm) become stably reduced from ~200ânm (0.03âg VO<sub>2</sub>, sample N4) to ~20ânm (0.2âg VO<sub>2</sub>, sample N1) with a nearly inverse proportional d-m relationship (refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Fig. S4</xref>); this relationship is made possible because the precipitation rate was maintained constant by decreasing the homogeneous precipitation. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> presents the TEM and EDS results for the N1 (VO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (~20ânm)) and N2 (VO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (~70ânm)) core/shell particles, respectively.

For point R3, the crystals are isolated with a rather small (~a few nanometres) size.

In our work, the transition temperature (Tc, extreme values in heating and cooling cycles) and hysteresis (ÎT, the difference of the Tc in the heating and cooling cycles) for pure VO<sub>2</sub> nanorods are very close to previously reported values (~53.6Â°C in a cooling cycle and ~64.6Â°C in a heating cycle, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8-a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. After annealing (above dashed curves), sample N1 and N2 exhibited an increased Tc in both the heating and cooling cycles, which varied for different samples: 71.6Â°C (heating)/60.8Â°C (cooling) for N1 and 70.3Â°C (heating)/ 62.4Â°C (cooling) for N2, representing a Tc increase of 6~7Â°C compared to pure VO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the width of the hysteresis loop (ÎT) of N2 was reduced after annealing from 11Â°C to 7.9Â°C, which is not observed for pure VO<sub>2</sub> and is inconspicuous in sample N1. Thirdly, the enthalpy change (for unit mass) during the transition was reduced after coating (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8-b</xref>). This result is expected because TiO<sub>2</sub> does not exhibit a phase transition in this temperature range. Through integration over the peak range, the titania mass content can be quantitatively calculated using the following formula: W(TiO<sub>2</sub>)  =  {1âI(sample)/I(VO<sub>2</sub>)} Ã 100%, where I denotes the integral intensity over the peak range. Based on this calculation (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8-c</xref>), the TiO<sub>2</sub> shell accounts for ~29.3 wt% and ~51.0 wt% in samples N1 and N2, respectively.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Phase transition property of the as-prepared VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites.</p><p>(a) DSC curves for: pure VO<sub>2</sub>(black curve), sample N1(red curve) and N2(blue curve) before (below solid curves) and after (above dash curves) annealing.

The nucleation is thermodynamically activated, which primarily depends on the microstructure (structural or chemical defects, where nucleation always preferentially initiates). The increased Tc indicates that the chemical stability of the M1 phase has increased compared to that of the R phase. Notably, pure VO<sub>2</sub> also exhibits an increase of Tc after annealing (dashed black curves in <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8-a</xref>). This result indicates that vacuum annealing can induce internal changes within the VO<sub>2</sub> lattices. Intrinsically, non-stoichiometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> can result in this change. Excess of oxygen can act as acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and thus increases the stability of monoclinic phase in Al/Cr-doped VO<sub>2</sub> powders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Recently, Zhang, S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> observed that a deficiency of oxygen (&lt;30âmtorr) stabilised the rutile phase to temperatures as low as 103âK, whereas oxygen-rich growth conditions stabilised the monoclinic phases directly by confocal Raman nano-probing. Oxygen vacancies are commonly observed in VO<sub>2</sub> polycrystalline films prepared under relatively oxygen-deficient reducing atmospheres. These oxygen defects can exert a considerable influence on the transition temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> because the new phase preferentially nucleates at the defect sites. In our case, the annealing under a relatively oxidative atmosphere (~3âtorr) most likely increased the Tc.</p><p>With the exception of non-stoichiometry, interface effects may inevitably play an important role. Firstly, compositional diffusion at the VO<sub>2</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub> interface was confirmed by compositional scanning TEM analysis of the interfacial distribution of Ti and V elements using an EDS detector, as shown in <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9-a to d</xref>. The curves for samples N1 and N2 before (a, b) and after (c, d) annealing exhibited a saddle-like distribution for the titanium content (red curves), with the two saddle points (marked by black sticks) at the interface between core and shell where the thickness of the titania coating reached a maximum. The relative intensity of the KÎ±1 signals of V and Ti reflected the compositional change before and after annealing. In the gel-coated samples (<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9-a and b</xref>), the V intensity with respect to Ti outside of saddle points is very low. In contrast, the V intensity substantially increased after annealing, which implies that some amount of V diffused into the titania lattice. The impact of Ti doping on the dynamic phase transition of VO<sub>2</sub> has been confirmed by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. V<sub>1âx</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> films exhibited lower hysteresis loop widths and increased Tc at higher Ti doping amounts (~9.4Â°C /at.%). A similar interfacial diffusion and Ti-doping can occur at 400Â°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, 450Â°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, or 500Â°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> for TiO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> multilayer films. Ti-doping forms another metastable M2 phase and induces the formation of internal stress, which is reflected in an increase in the Mott phase transition temperature.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Confirmation of the interfacial diffusion and Ti-V doping.</p><p>The compositional scanning TEM curves for: N1 (20ânm titania coating) and N2 (70ânm titania coating) before and after annealing.

The average linear expansion coefficient (100~480Â°C) is 25 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>âK<sup>â1</sup> for VO<sub>2</sub> along c<sub>R</sub> and 4.5 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>âK<sup>â1</sup> along a<sub>R</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, whereas the value for titania is 7.38 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>âK<sup>â1</sup> (a<sub>â¥</sub>) and 3.53 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>âK<sup>â1</sup> (a<sub>â¥</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This mismatch may result in an expansion (or shrinkage) prevailing along the rod length direction (because c<sub>R</sub>[001] corresponds to a<sub>M1</sub>[100]), which induces a compressive (when heating) and a tensile (when cooling) stress on the VO<sub>2</sub> rod. For samples N1 and N2 with undamaged coatings, these thermal stresses may not be fully relaxed by microcracks. In our study, structural distortion was confirmed by slow XRD scans of the strongest VO<sub>2</sub>(M1) (011) peak (<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). There are apparent angular peak shifts in the annealed samples (dashed curves) compared to the unannealed ones (solid curves), which indicates that interfacial stress most likely induced the lattice distortion after annealing. The thermal stress changed the defect state and distribution on the local surface, which would have a significant influence on the phase transition behaviour of VO<sub>2</sub>.

The entire spectral range in question can be divided into two regions: at a shorter wavelength region A the transmittance at 90Â°C is higher than 25Â°C; and at a longer wavelength region B the transmittance at 25Â°C is much higher than that at 90Â°C (the so-called IR switching) In the region B, the Tr behaviour is very conventional for VO<sub>2</sub>, in which the Tr is lower at temperatures above the Tc (metallic R phase) than that at lower temperatures (semiconducting M1 phase). The plasma frequency (Ï<sub>p</sub>) for the R phase in polycrystalline thin films is reported to be 1.0âeV (~1.24âÎ¼m)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> or 1.6âeV (~775ânm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, which is proportional to the free-electron concentration and depends on the temperature and the film/substrate interface state. Hence, the metallic R phase has a lower transmittance and higher reflectance in the IR region (Ï &lt; Ï<sub>p</sub>). However, semiconducting VO<sub>2</sub>(M1) has a band gap at approximately 0.7âeV; therefore; it is highly transparent to photons with energies less than Eg (Î» &gt; ~1.77âÎ¼m). However, at the region A including the whole visible part, the R phase exhibited a higher transmittance than low-temperature M1 phase, although both transmittances were at a relatively low level (&lt;30%) because of intrinsic absorption. This reverse transmittance cause undesirable minus modulation for solar energy as shown in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. This behaviour deteriorate the whole efficiency and may be a considerable drawback for applications that require good visual senses; whereas, such a coating can be used for energy-saving wall paint/coatings or the rear windows of cars. As illustrated in <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11-a</xref>, there are interspaces among rods, typically several tens of nanometres to submicrons. Therefore, the transmittance of our as-prepared samples in region A should primarily be attributed to light transmittance from the uncovered areas of the Teflon tape and the light scattered by the VO<sub>2</sub> rods in the forward direction. Mie scattering predominates because the rod thickness (500â600ânm) was very similar to the wavelength of the incident visible light. According to Mie theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, scattering rises to a maximum when it is the same as the characteristic length of the scattering centre (the rod thickness) and then it decays to zero towards longer wavelengths. Therefore, the Tr change before and after the Mott transition in this region should contribute to the different scattering abilities of the VO<sub>2</sub> composite particles. The M1 phase scatters light more strongly due to its larger refractive index (n(VO<sub>2</sub>(M1))  =  2.7 ~ 2.8, n(VO<sub>2</sub>(R))  =  2.0 ~ 2.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, which can lead to smaller transmittance than that of the R phase. In particular, after being coated with highly-transparent TiO<sub>2</sub>, the composite films exhibited considerably improved luminous transparency. As shown in <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11-a</xref>, the 70ânm TiO<sub>2</sub> coating (N2) significantly increased the luminous transmittance, from ~8% to ~27% (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The transparent TiO<sub>2</sub> coating accounts for a considerable part of the total film in thick N2 samples, which increases the total visible transmittance.</p><p>For a pure VO<sub>2</sub> film, the modulation ability at 2âÎ¼m is ~70.6% with a large hysteresis loop width (more than 10Â°C). The TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated composites exhibited a modified optical switching property, both in the modulation level and hysteresis loop width (<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11-b and d</xref>). A 70ânm TiO<sub>2</sub> coating (sample N2) exhibits a largely increased transmittance in both the M1 and R states, but with somewhat deteriorated modulation ability (~58.6%). A thinner 20ânm coating (sample N1) can also increase the transmittance by a small degree with maintained modulability (~75.2%). Furthermore, the TiO<sub>2</sub> coating can significantly decrease the transition hysteresis, which is in agreement with the DSC measurements. However, films prepared using powders in previous studies commonly exhibited a very wide hysteresis. We prepared films based on VO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with large hysteresis (~21Â°C) and VO<sub>2</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub> composite particles with very wide transition range (~30Â°C). Lu, Z<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> prepared a VO<sub>2</sub>/PEGDA film with hysteresis at ~25Â°C. Our composite particles with considerably reduced hysteresis will benefit future applications for rapidly responding and high-precision controlled materials. The diffusion of Ti into VO<sub>2</sub> will weaken its IR switching property due to the introduction of lattice defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. N2 with considerable Ti-V diffusion will clearly exhibit reduced modulability. However, the significantly enhanced transmittance and reduced hysteresis may compensate for this weakness and further investigations on optimising the VO<sub>2</sub> size and coating thickness will be required to achieve better integrated performance.</p><p>As previously mentioned, VO<sub>2</sub> films have an intrinsic yellow-brown colour and the pure VO<sub>2</sub> film exhibits a dark colour, as shown in <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11-a</xref>, inset (left). However, N2 with a 70ânm TiO<sub>2</sub> coating exhibits a more transparent blue colour (<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11-a</xref>, inset (right)). This result implies that the 70ânm titania coating modified the colour of the film. Calculations of the optical interference effect in the sandwiched 70ânmTiO<sub>2</sub>/500ânmVO<sub>2</sub>/70ânmTiO<sub>2</sub> (n<sub>air</sub> &lt; n<sub>TiO2</sub> &lt; n<sub>VO2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) structure suggest that the 70ânm TiO<sub>2</sub> coating can serve as an effective anti-reflecting coating for red light (Î» ~ 700ânm, Î»  =  4 Ã n Ã d, n is the average refractive index of anatase, n â 2.5 and d is the thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> coating, d â 70ânm). Furthermore, the incidental short wavelength light (~300â400ânm) is reduced by a large degree because of the existence of UV-absorbing TiO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the TiO<sub>2</sub> coating changed the spatial distribution of the scattered visible light, by which we can observe the reflected blue colour. This coating effectively changed the appearance of the film. In summary, TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings can effectively increase the luminous transmittance and modify the colour of films. The modified blue colour is considerably more favourable and acceptable as a functional and decorative coating.</p><p>For practical application, W-doped composites with lower transition temperature were also considered. The UV-Vis spectra were shown in <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>. The transmittance curves and hysteresis loops showed a similar law as undoped VO<sub>2</sub>: after coating, the average transmittance was increased with deteriorated modulation ability; the loop width was also narrowed down by 5.7Â°C. Meanwhile, the coated sample showed a light blue colour in comparison with yellow one of uncoated VO<sub>2</sub>:W film. As compared with undoped films, the IR switching efficiency is diminished because of the incorporation of W dopant, as reported elsewhere. However, the core/shell particles show a modified colour of light blue, which is more comfortable for human sense.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Figure 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>VO<sub>2</sub>:W@TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites with a solar modulation ability at room temperature.</p><p>By the sol-gel coating method, we successfully prepared VO<sub>2</sub>:W@TiO<sub>2</sub> powders (a).

A certain amount of micro-/nanopores or cracks composed the majority of the total surface area, especially in sample N2. A larger specific area can ensure more active sites for adsorption and subsequent reactions, but desorption of the degraded species will be significantly hindered if they reside in the inner space, which will in turn reduce the entire degradation efficiency. This may be the reason why sample N2, which had a considerably larger specific surface area than sample N1, did not exhibit considerably enhanced degradation ability. In addition to the specific surface area, other factors such as surface defects, carrier concentrations and carrier transfer rate will also affect the final photocatalytic performance. Modifications of the microstructure can effectively adjust the photocatalytic performance.

Such "interfacial doping" has the advantage of avoiding the introduction of a large amount of defects as compared with bulk doping. Bulk defect will deteriorate the modulation ability of VO<sub>2</sub> to a large degree.

We expect a better photocatalytic property can be obtained by adjusting the annealing program. This integrated structure combining solar-light driven environmental purification with energy modulation can make better use of the solar energy. We forsee the potential of nanocomposite of VO<sub>2</sub> with other functional materials, such as light harvesting/conversion materials, to get combined or mutually optimized multi-functions for solar energy conversion or modulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Preparation of VO<sub>2</sub> nanorods</title><p>Single-crystal VO<sub>2</sub> nanorods were prepared following a previous work by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd, China) and oxalic acid powders (H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, Wako, Japan) were directly added in a 1:2 molar ratio to 200âmL of deionised water ([V]  =  0.037âM) at room temperature. The suspension was continuously stirred until a clear dark blue solution was formed. Then, 40âmL of the suspension was transferred into a 100âmL Teflon-lined autoclave after adjusting its pH to ~1.85 by adding a H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (0.5âM) aqueous solution. After the hydrothermal treatment at 260Â°C for 48âh, the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting black-coloured precipitate was collected by filtration, washed alternatively 3 times with deionised water and alcohol and then dried at 60Â°C in air for 10âh.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Preparation of VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> core/shell nanorods</title><p>To prepare the VO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> core/shell nanostructures, 0.03~0.25âg of the as-synthesised VO<sub>2</sub> nanorod powders was ultrasonically dispersed in 80âmL of water-free ethanol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd, China) to obtain a well-dispersed suspension. Then, 500âÎ¼L~1âmL of titanium tetrabutoxide (TBOT, Sigma Aldrich, reagent grade, 97%) was rapidly added into the suspension under vigorous stirring in an ice water bath for 20âmin. The suspension was then transferred into a three-neck flask that was immersed in a constant-temperature water bath at 80Â°C. Subsequently, the controlled hydrolysis of TBOT was initiated by adding ~20âmL deionised water/ethanol mixture (50âmL/L) dropwisely. As have shown in the results part, the thickness of the shell can be easily tuned by varying the experimental parameters, which primarily include the loading amount of VO<sub>2</sub>, the volume of TBOT and the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O. The as-prepared core-shell powders were collected by filtration, washed twice with ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60Â°C for 6âh.</p><p>To obtain a crystalline coating, the as-synthesised powders were placed into an alumina crucible and then annealed in a vacuum quartz-tube furnace under a flow of air at specific air pressure and temperature. To avoid VO<sub>2</sub> oxidation, the annealing process was optimised. Typically, with an air pressure of ~3âtorr, the sample was heated from ambient temperature to 400Â°C at a heating rate of ~10Â°C /min and then held at 400Â°C for 15âmin before naturally cooling to room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Characterisation</title><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were conducted on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu KÎ± radiation (Î»  =  1.5418 Ã) using a voltage and current of 40âkV and 40âmA, respectively. Unless stated otherwise, all the samples were measured at a scanning rate of 3Â°/min. The microscopic morphology was obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, HITACHI S-3400, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 15âkV. The microstructure and composition of the samples were further analysed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL2010) with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) attachment. Scanning TEM was operated in dark field imaging mode. The Raman spectra of the composite samples were measured using a Raman microscope (Renishaw in Via) with a 514ânm laser source at an input power of 1âmW. This small power was applied to avoid local heating effects.The phase transition behaviours of the resulting products were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC200F3, NETZSCH) over the temperature range from 0 to 90Â°C using a liquid nitrogen cooling unit. The heating and cooling rates were set at 10Â°C/min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Photocatalytic reaction</title><p>~0.1âg of the powder samples were ultrasonically dispersed in 50âmL deionized water followed by the addition of 500âÎ¼L of a 0.01âM rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution. The mixture was then stirred under darkness for 2âh to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the suspension with continuous stirring was exposed under a Xe lamb (300âW) with an incident direction normal to the surface of the solution. At given irradiation intervals, ~3âmL aliquots of the suspension were collected and separated by centrifugation. The absorption spectrum of the supernatant was measured using a UV-Vis spectrometer (HITACHI U-3010). The concentration of RhB was determined by monitoring the changes in the absorbance maximum at ~554ânm. According to the Lambert-Beer law, the absorbance is proportional to the concentration of a dilute solution. The specific surface area was measured on an ASAP2010 (Micromeritics,U.S.A) instrument using the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption method with BET analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Evaluation of the thermochromic properties</title><p>Films made of the obtained samples were prepared by coating the powder onto a float glass substrate. For measuring, a piece of double-sided thermal-resistant teflon tape was sticked onto a glass substrate. A stock suspension with solid loading amount of 3wt% was prepared by dispersing a certain amount of powder ultrasonically in ethanol. Then a film was made by casting the suspension solution by anilox roll on the Teflon-tape. After natural drying, repeating this process for twice or 3 times to make sure the whole surface was coated by powders and then compressed air gun was used to blow away redundant powders which werenot sticked on the teflon surface. The diffuse transmittance (Tr) and reflectance (Re) measurements of the film at the wavelength range from 250ânm to 2600ânm at 25Â°C and 90Â°C were conducted using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-3010) with a integrating sphere and a temperature controlling unit. The transmittance curve of the sole tape-sticked glass is calibrated as baseline for transmittance measurements.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported in part by a fund from the National Key Basic Research Program (NKBRP, 2009CB939904), the high-tech project of MOST (2012AA030605, 2012BAA10B03) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Contract No: 51172265, 51032008, 51102270, 51272273, 51272271).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>M.K. and Y.M.L. designed the experiment.
