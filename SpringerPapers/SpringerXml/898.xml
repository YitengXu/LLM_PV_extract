To achieve that, massive volumes of data need to be sensed and transmitted between the elements of the grid. A robust and efficient communication infrastructure is thus as essential part of smart grid. Some of the data transmissions are not time-critical, providing an opportunity to improve the communication network performance. In this paper, we present a new approach to optimize smart grid communications through time-based scheduling.

The electricity consumption has doubled in the past 20 years and it is supposed to keep rising at least the same speed. Since the majority of electricity generation relies on coal, oil and gas resources, the growth in power usage brings more and more significant environmental problem. Additionally, more aspects of modern life are dependent on the electricity supply. Though, incorporating renewable resources based generators (e.g. photovoltaic power plants and wind turbines) as well as making the whole infrastructure more monitorable and controllable become an important strategic act to preserve power grid sustainability.</p><p id="Par3">The need to employ more power generators based on renewable sources brings several challenges to be solved. First, both wind and solar power plants provide rather unstable electricity production varying with current weather that is difficult to be predicted, but may be estimated from short term weather forecast. Nowadays, end electricity users are also encouraged to install their own small power sources in order to save money lowering the electricity consumption and potentially send electricity back to the network in cases of overproduction. Since storing energy or transmitting it over long distances causes significant losses, the task of keeping the power grid capable of maintaining these changes is nontrivial.</p><p id="Par4">The concept of smart grid represents a complex approach to improve current power distribution infrastructure in order to provide application such as demand response, use of distributed energy resources (DER) or real-time state monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The overall goals are to lower energy losses and to make the electricity network more reliable, efficient and environmental-friendly. In order to achieve the previously mentioned applications, smart metering and remotely controllable devices, communication infrastructure and computational systems for data collection and decision making are supposed to be added to the existing power distribution network.</p><p id="Par5">To make the grid state analysis and decision making as relevant as possible, a large amount of up-to date complete data will be needed. Typically, the data will be generated in metering/monitoring points all over the network and then collected in central offices and, conversely, control commands will be sent from central offices to elements of the grid. Hence, a bidirectional, robust and reliable communication network is a critical part of smart grid. Due to its complexity, expenses associated with deploying a communication infrastructure of this scale are supposed to be high and strongly dependent on concrete technology used.</p><p id="Par6">The communication requests are expected to have variable data sizes and requirements on latency and reliability of delivery. Since some of the data transfers are not time critical, the communication may be planned using proper scheduling techniques, request importance evaluation, real time adaptation and predictions of network traffic load and message sizes in order to balance traffic load and to prevent and manage communication network overloads. Thus, a given communication infrastructure will be capable to maintain bigger number of communication requests and to provide most relevant data possible at the time, so a better trade-off between quality and price of the communication infrastructure may be earned. To schedule the messages efficiently is a new optimization problem with many aspects specific to smart grid environment.</p><p id="Par7">In this paper, we propose new approach to optimize smart grid communications through time-based scheduling. As the first step, an analysis of smart grid communication was conducted, based on existing literature as well as our practical experience from the smart grid design and implementation projects that we actively contribute to within the context of the Czech Republic. Then, the optimization problem is identified along with its inputs as well as techniques to find the solution are outlined.</p><p id="Par8">The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, messages exchanged between smart grid elements are summarized with emphasis to their communication requirements. In the Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, communication technologies usable for smart grids with their specifics and challenges are listed. In the Sect. <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, the opportunity to use a scheduling algorithm in order to optimize traffic load is described and design of a potential solution is outlined and the specifics of given optimization problems are described.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Communication in Smart Grids</title><p id="Par9">As long as smart grids are being developed as enhancement of current electricity distribution networks rather than brand-new infrastructures, the concrete implementations vary through different countries according to the existing power grids specifics. On the other hand, the overall structure, high-level applications and other general characteristics remain the same. In order to provide a standardized model of smart grid basic structure, SGAM (Smart Grid Architecture Model) framework has been presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the model omits technical and implementation details, it provides a good insight into the organizational structure and defines several levels of abstraction the smart grids may be looked on, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Along the “interoperability” axis, several layers are listed, where each one is supported by layers located below. For example, the function layer describes functions and services provided by the smart grid in order to fulfill business requirements and policies. Similarly, the information layer summarizes all the data needed by the functions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Smart grid architecture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/467210_1_En_37_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">According to the SGAM framework, communication infrastructure serves as the support element for all the upper layers.
