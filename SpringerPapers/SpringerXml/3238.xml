However, new electronics relying on polymer semiconductors are opening up new application spaces like stretchable and self-healing sensors and devices, and these can facilitate the integration of such devices into our homes, our clothing, and even our bodies. While there has been tremendous interest in such technologies, the widespread adoption of these organic electronics requires low-cost manufacturing techniques. Fortunately, the realization of organic electronics can take inspiration from a technology developed since the beginning of the Common Era: printing.

In contrast to most silicon-based devices, which typically require high-temperature melt processing or chemical vapor deposition, OSC devices are amenable to high-throughput, large-area deposition like roll-to-roll (R2R) printing processes, which facilitate lower-energy and more versatile fabrication. Due to their unique electronic properties and intrinsic mechanical flexibility, semiconducting polymers have seen widespread use in devices ranging from photovoltaics (OPVs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and field-effect transistors (OFETs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> to emerging technologies such as electronic skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, stretchable electronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, thereby expanding application spaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and opening new ones underserved by conventional silicon technologies.</p><p id="Par4">Small-molecule OSCs have traditionally led the field in terms of high-performance devices, but high-mobility polymers are becoming increasingly competitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Both have exceeded the performance of amorphous silicon and can even possess charge carrier mobilities within the same order of magnitude as polycrystalline silicon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to advances in the optimization of intrinsic material properties, a crucial consideration for the development of high-performance devices lies in the manner by which they are processed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">A wide range of solution-based methods have been employed for the deposition of polymer semiconductor layers, with spin coating as the most commonly used technique in research-scale devices. While spin coating has an advantage in small-scale fabrication because of its simplicity and availability, the technique is wasteful of materials and is a batch process with limited throughput and industrial relevance. In addition, spin coating does not produce a uniform shear stress distribution during coating and may make controlling film morphology difficult. Mounting evidence in the literature demonstrates the crucial influence of deposition method on film morphology and draws attention to the importance of finely tuning processing parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In particular, precise control over polymer thin-film morphology, which not only includes the crystalline domains for semicrystalline materials (e.g., degree of crystallinity, grain size, and grain orientation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> but also the amorphous domains (e.g., tie chain density, chain orientation, and alignment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, is important for good charge transport properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (a short description appears in section Controlling morphology and device performance).</p><p id="Par6">Meniscus-guided coating (MGC) techniques are well-poised to address these concerns. The term “meniscus-guided” refers to the fact that a meniscus is translated across a substrate by virtue of a coating head or viscous forces, in effect guiding and controlling film deposition. Common MGC methods include dip coating, blade coating, solution shearing, and slot die coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Because of the intrinsic directionality of the coating process, MGC techniques can confer molecular alignment of the deposited OSC layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and are quite amenable to continuous, steady-state printing, such as in R2R processing. Unlike spin coating, where ~ 90% of the material is discarded, material utilization in MGC can be upwards of 99% using R2R processes in large-scale applications.</p><p id="Par7">The performance and solution processability of semiconducting polymers is highly dependent on material and processing parameters. In polymer semiconductor solutions, one of the key parameters is appropriate solvent selection. Poor solubility may lead to unfavorable aggregation, time-dependent viscosity changes, and potential gelation, but the common use of halogenated solvents (which are generally good solvents) in lab-scale studies poses a significant environmental hazard for industrial-scale processes, potentially limiting manufacturing. Designing appropriate polymer structures that yield high mobility while retaining solution processability and favorable behavior during morphology evolution is a delicate process that has spurred on vigorous research aimed at turning this art into science<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">This review is a survey of the deposition of polymeric semiconductor thin films using MGC techniques and the materials and processing-related parameters that need to be addressed for the fabrication of high-performance devices with desired functionality. More importantly, we aim to provide insights and a critical review of research on MGC deposition and recently reported techniques used to control printed thin-film morphology. We further highlight areas requiring additional scientific inquiry. While many other researchers have published important contributions to the field, we regret that length constraints require their omission from this review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Solution processing</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fluid mechanical phenomena</title><p id="Par9">On the laboratory scale, small-scale deposition processes that are facile for demonstrating charge transport characteristics for newly synthesized materials are often used to provide proofs of concept. However, in order to scale up, a firm understanding of the fundamental fluid mechanical processes is needed, and the many factors that influence the resulting flow and shear fields must be accounted for in order to rationally control the deposition process. Toward this end, we describe below the relevant considerations common for MGC methods and emphasize that such issues should guide future research.</p><p id="Par10">Box <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">1</xref> summarizes the variety of fluid flows and gradients that affect polymer nucleation, aggregation, and alignment in solution at the primary meniscus. For most MGC methods, there is contact between the solution and part of the coating apparatus (such as a die nozzle or coating blade) so that the meniscus is the liquid–air interface that connects the coating head to the substrate, where the solution, substrate, and air form a three-phase contact line. Before solution enters the region under the influence of the meniscus, the velocity field established by the coating head can itself alter the morphology of the resulting thin film (vide infra). For simple blade coating with 0° tilt angle (blade parallel to the substrate), the system resembles classical parallel-plate Couette flow, and the Navier–Stokes equation can be solved exactly to yield a linear velocity profile. When the gap distance between the two plates is very small, the Reynolds number—Re = <italic>ρνL</italic>/<italic>μ</italic>, where Re relates the fluid density <italic>ρ</italic>, the relative velocity of the parallel plates <italic>ν</italic>, the gap distance <italic>L</italic>, and the fluid viscosity <italic>μ</italic>—becomes very small and reflects the diminished influence of inertial forces compared to viscous forces. Stokes flow refers to these low Re situations and is governed by a set of linearized (and thus approximate) steady-state Navier–Stokes equations, which allow for analytical solutions to more complex flows when Re « 1.</p><p id="Par11">In the general blade coating case (non-zero tilt angles) when the gap height between the coating head is very small compared to the lateral dimension along the coating direction, the scenario becomes the classical slider-block (or “slider-bearing”) problem, and the Reynolds equations of lubrication theory can be used to approximate the velocity profile—which consists of a parabolic component caused by the pressure gradient (Hagen–Poiseuille flow) and a linear component (Couette flow)—and to estimate the shear strain up until solution enters the forward meniscus. For modest tilt angles, the shear field is only modestly affected by the pressure term in the equations, which intuitively originates from the passage of a volume of incompressible liquid from a larger cross-sectional area through the small gap before entering the meniscus. The shear strain is instead primarily boundary-driven, dominated mostly by the motion of the coating head (or equivalently, the substrate). Such a mathematical treatment of the slider-block geometry applies only for Newtonian fluids, which is an assumption valid for relatively dilute polymer solutions. More concentrated solutions or ones with very high-molecular-weight polymer may exhibit non-Newtonian (shear rate-dependent) behaviors like shear thinning, shear thickening, or even (time-dependent) thixotropy, which may have deep implications for control of thin-film morphology. As we will see, the region before the meniscus under the coating head is where control of the fluid flow can dramatically influence the resulting film.</p><p id="Par12">One problem with these approaches, however, is that different flows are very likely induced by the process of thin-film formation downstream close to the drying front. A priori, we know that a dramatic concentration gradient is established within the meniscus—the concentration of solute increases from the initial value of the solution entering the meniscus to the bulk density of the dry solute in the film. As the polymer concentration rises near the contact line, the viscosity of the solution also begins to diverge as the material solidifies and is no longer a liquid. Because solvent evaporation is enhanced closer to the contact line as opposed to closer to the coating head, a capillary flow toward the contact line—also known as the coffee-ring effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>—can be induced. Depending on the solvent, it is possible that a surface tension gradient also arises along the meniscus, which can cause Marangoni flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> to either recirculate solution back toward the coating head (in the case of surface tension gradients arising from differential evaporation in solvent mixtures) or enhance the flow toward the contact line (in the case of solutal Marangoni flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>). Moreover, because the meniscus functions as the evaporation front for the solvent, a temperature gradient exists and can cause complex flow patterns because the Marangoni effect and the temperature gradient can cause flows in opposite directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The relative importance of each of these phenomena leads to complicated relationships among each of these factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Lastly, in the evaporative regime (explained further in the next section), the movement of the contact line is directly influenced by the rate at and manner by which the dissolved solute is deposited. Stick-and-slip behavior is quite common and often manifests as undulations in dry film thickness. A competition between a surface tension-related pinning force and a depinning force related to bulk fluid motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, stick-and-slip phenomena result from the time-dependent processes involved with mass transport to the contact line, the material’s solidification from solution, and solvent evaporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The meniscus is elongated during the “stick” phase as the substrate continues to move with respect to the bulk fluid until it rapidly contracts back to a shortened length, leaving behind a thick, stripe-like solute deposit where the meniscus was pinned. When other fluid dynamical processes like viscous fingering (convective concentration instabilities) or density-dependent Rayleigh–Bénard convection are pronounced, the deposits can be shaped like dots or more elaborate structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This periodic distortion of the meniscus is a function of solution concentration, solvent evaporation flux, solute convection, shear viscosity, coating speed, height of the wetting film, and substrate surface energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. While much work has been conducted in the dynamics and statics of wetting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, little of this knowledge has been directly applied to polymer OSC device fabrication beyond simple substrate surface treatments, which are often used to enhance crystalline ordering with only a subsidiary purpose of enhancing solution wetting for thin-film deposition.</p><p id="Par14">It is clear that the ultimate morphology and (semi-)crystalline microstructure of polymer thin films deposited by MGC methods results from the concerted action of each of these processes. While additives, appropriate solvent selection, solvent blending, substrate surface treatments, etc. can be used to individually tune the relative importance of a given phenomenon, their combined effect is difficult to predict. Currently, coupled simulations incorporating all of these processes is computationally infeasible given the complexity of modeling solvent evaporation with solute crystallization and precipitation. Although attempts have been made to individually model portions of the system with simplifying assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, a combined simulation that unifies flows induced within the meniscus with the velocity profile upstream and the contact line would allow for more effective modeling of the film deposition process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Deposition regimes</title><p id="Par15">Box <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2</xref> summarizes the two fluid mechanical deposition regimes characterized by the resulting dry thin-film thickness: one in which film thickness first decreases with coating speed (or web speed) and one in which film thickness increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The thickness of the wet film is a function of the capillary number Ca = <italic>µν</italic>/<italic>γ</italic><sub>d</sub>, which gives a measure of the relative effects of viscous forces over surface tension. Here <italic>µ</italic> is the solution viscosity, <italic>ν</italic> is the relative velocity between the web and blade, and <italic>γ</italic><sub>d</sub> is the surface tension of the liquid in ambient atmosphere. For low deposition speeds, solvent evaporation from the meniscus occurs on a timescale comparable to that of solid film formation, resulting in a film-drying process that is under the direct influence of the meniscus, the fluid flow fields within, and any shear forces imparted. This “evaporative regime”—known also as convective assembly—is characterized by a power-law decrease in dry film thickness as a function of increasing coating speed (<italic>t</italic> ∝ <italic>v</italic><sup>−1</sup>) due to a shorter deposition time per unit length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. It is in this regime that stick-slip phenomenon is often found, and this cyclic process results in periodic variation in film thickness that may be undesirable for devices requiring highly uniform films. Furthermore, in multicomponent solutions, differential solute diffusivities may result in the spatial heterogeneity of each of the components in the final film when solidification happens over these relatively larger timescales.</p><p id="Par16">As web speed is increased, the transition region occurs where film thickness begins to increase with coating speed into the classical Landau–Levich (LL) regime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. At high print speeds, viscous effects dominate, and a wet film is first dragged out before solvent evaporation deposits the resulting film. Unlike in the evaporative regime, the back meniscus (upstream of the primary, forward meniscus; Box <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2a</xref>) plays an important role in film deposition by acting as the origin of pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. By first dragging out a wet film, the effects of the coating mechanism are effectively decoupled from the solid film formation because of the relaxation time for polymer chains (or aggregates) to change conformation (or orientation) is fast compared to solvent evaporation. Still, practical considerations include avoiding long evaporation times (i.e., minutes or more) and dewetting of the film from the substrate, which can cause the pooling of solution from the edges toward the center and lead to lateral nonuniformity via the coffee-ring effect previously mentioned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The transition between the two regimes occurs at a coating speed determined by a variety of factors. Increasing the solution concentration, deposition temperature, and aspiration rate of the surrounding inert carrier gas (i.e., air or nitrogen) directly enhance solvent evaporation, shifting upward the thickness curve as a function of coating speed in the evaporation regime. However, it is unclear whether or not the transition into the LL regime is moved toward higher speeds, but decreased solution viscosity and (possibly) increased polymer-solvent diffusivity can push this transition point toward the higher coating speeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Depending on the application, the feasible operating window of coating speeds within either the evaporative or the LL regimes can be adjusted by tuning these parameters. The typical transition speed is around a few mm s<sup>–1</sup> for dilute conjugated polymer solutions at room temperature in a solvent with a boiling point near 125 °C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Solution formulation</title><p id="Par18">While a more complete understanding of the complex interplay among fluid mechanical phenomena is important, another element of the deposition process that has received less attention is solution formulation. Although the requirements for properties such as fluid viscosity are less strict than for techniques like inkjet printing, such factors can have a variety of effects on the resulting films. For example, adjustment of solution viscosity and surface tension to manipulate film thickness often comes at the expense of solvent choice or concentration optimization for the particular OSC application. Very importantly, the environmental friendliness of the chosen solvent is crucial to the industrial-scale deployment of solution-processed OSC devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. It is believed that the success of OPVs is dependent on scale-up by factors of millions or more; in order to truly realize global production capacity, non-toxic and non-halogenated solvents must be used, further restricting the allowable parameter space. In another example, polymer concentration has a straightforward effect on film thickness, increasing the coating-speed-dependence of the dry film thickness. However, the effect of concentration on semiconducting polymer aggregation, nucleation, and crystal growth—as well as the possibility of non-Newtonian behavior and other fluid mechanical considerations (see section Fluid mechanical phenomena)—during MGC is less clear and requires further study.</p><p id="Par19">Recent trends in the study of organic photovoltaics have revealed the importance of solvent selection in the microstructural evolution of polymer thin films. For most bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs, the solution is at least a ternary-component system consisting of electron-donor molecules, acceptor molecules, and solvent. Reports have shown that the use of binary solvent blends consisting of a high- and a low-boiling-point solvent allows for more controlled evolution of the final microstructure because of the former’s lower evaporation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It is believed that this allows for residual solvent molecules to plasticize the polymer by virtue of remaining in the film for a longer period of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. However, this vision of solvent evaporation posits boiling point as one of the most important parameters for solvent selection and blending and ignores deviations in total vapor pressure, an approximation of evaporative flux, caused by each of the components of the solution. Generally, the binary solvent mixture is composed of two species whose chemical dissimilarities would engender activity coefficients that are not unity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Net associative interactions among the molecules of the two solvents would cause a negative deviation from Raoult’s law, decreasing the expected vapor pressure and indicating that more solvent remains in the drying film than anticipated. Such a scenario does not necessarily require solvents with differing boiling points and can also partly explain why recent OPV work has converged to using small amounts of additives like 1,8-diiodooctane to enhance film morphology. However, for these quaternary-component systems, each set of pairwise interactions may have important effects on how solvated the polymer components are, which can affect polymer–polymer interactions in solution, the polymers’ hydrodynamic shape during MGC, nucleation of a given species during drying, and the process of phase separation as the film evolves into its final microstructure. Such interactions may reveal alternative explanations—other than plasticization—for the improved film morphology induced by solvent mixtures and are in need of further inquiry.</p><p id="Par20">Whereas some work has begun to address polymer–polymer interactions through the lens of Flory–Huggins solution theory by looking at their interaction parameter <italic>χ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, a complete analysis requires the consideration of all components of the system and their specific pairwise interactions. Even for simpler binary systems consisting only of polymer and solvent, solvent choice is often overlooked and if it is not, attention is only paid to the solvent’s boiling point to explain good or poor film morphology. Since semiconducting polymers are chemically heterogeneous amalgams of conjugated cores (sometimes with very different alternating mers) and insulating side chains, the two major associative interactions—alkyl stacking to form lamellae and <italic>π</italic>-stacking—may be modulated to differing degrees by a given solvent. In this way, Hansen solubility parameters resolve the simple Hildebrand solubility parameter into three constituent values each corresponding to a different type of associative interaction and would facilitate a more complete understanding of solvation power for rational solvent selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The equilibrium solution-phase aggregate (if aggregating) or free polymer coil (if not) likely differs in size and shape if the solvent quality is changed and may affect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> or be affected differently by the velocity and shear fields induced during MGC. Here solution-phase X-ray or neutron scattering can play an important role in quantitatively describing polymer chain configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, because aggregates likely serve as the nuclei for crystallite formation in semicrystalline polymers, solvent choice plays a pivotal role in controlling thin-film microstructure and reinforces the fact that proper ink formulation informed with a firm understanding of the fluid dynamical relationships among the deposition method, the polymer, and the solvent is needed for the rational control of solid film formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Printing techniques</title><p id="Par21">Printing techniques can be broadly classified into contact and non-contact methods, differentiated by whether a surface—e.g., the printing head, etc.—comes in direct, physical contact with the substrate to be coated. Contact methods include gravure printing, screen printing, and flexographic printing, which to date have not been commonly utilized in OSC processing. Conversely, non-contact methods include blade coating, slot die coating, and inkjet printing; meniscus-guided methods are a subset of non-contact methods. Here we describe several MGC techniques to give the reader a brief overview of the MGC landscape, and in particular, we highlight slot die coating due to its industrial relevance.</p><p id="Par22">Among the simplest MGC technique is dip coating, in which a substrate is vertically withdrawn from a solution reservoir. Depending on the withdrawal speed, solute concentration, solution viscosity, and reservoir temperature, either a dried (evaporative regime) or liquid thin film (LL regime) can be deposited. It should be noted that dip coating may be done with a single substrate (i.e., immersion and subsequent withdrawal) or in a continuous R2R configuration.</p><p id="Par23">In contrast, a variety of similar techniques in which a solid edge is passed over a bead or reservoir of solution can be classified under as “blade coating.” Typically, blade coating is described as translating a sharp blade held perpendicular to the substrate over a solution droplet. The forward meniscus is formed at the trailing edge, and the ink reservoir upstream of the meniscus is exposed to the ambient. A cylindrical or rectangular bar may be also used, which is often referred to as “bar coating.” Solution shearing is a similar technique where an angled blade is used with a temperature-controlled substrate, which induces a controlled flow profile on the solution and also effectively restricts evaporation of the rear upstream meniscus. From a fluid mechanical perspective, blade coating is effectively horizontal dip coating, meaning the same evaporation and LL regimes are present. However, in dip coating the primary source of shear strain is viscous rather than boundary-driven, as in the case when a solid blade is used. Blade coating is commonly encountered in the literature as it is a lab-scale analog to industrial-scale coating methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Slot die coating</title><p id="Par24">Slot die coating is extremely high throughput and has a large tolerance for ink viscosity ranging from 10<sup>–3</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> Pa⋅s. Because of this, slot die coating is a prominent MGC method for industrial applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and warrants discussion in the context of polymer semiconductors. Slot die coating involves a hollow die head through which solution is pumped onto a moving web at a fixed substrate-to-head (gap) height. Capillary forces hold the liquid bead between the web and die head as the web is translated at a fixed speed. One of the main advantages of slot die coating is that it is a pre-metered, continuous process—specification of web width, speed, and ink flow rate (from a controlled pump) determines the resulting thin film thickness, within stable operating parameters (Box <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2b</xref>). At slow speeds, solvent evaporation occurs at the downstream forward meniscus, resulting in a solid film deposited at the air–liquid–solid interface. Such slow evaporative-regime slot die coating is commonly referred to as zone casting. For semiconducting polymer solutions, this typically entails slow speeds on the order of tens of microns per second. Understandably, for industrial-scale manufacturing it is generally more attractive to operate in the LL regime to attain high throughput (often at speeds greater than meters per minute). Colloquially, and for the purposes of this review, the LL regime is implied in the term “slot die coating.” In this case, the slot die head achieves steady-state coating equal to the liquid feed rate. Controlling process variables enables the deposition of a uniform wet film that dries homogenously between a few and several hundred microns thick.</p><p id="Par25">The limits of achievable wet film thickness are acutely dependent on a range of variables, including but not limited to solution viscosity, surface tension, web speed, pump rate, and die head geometry (Box <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. A key concern is determining the window of operating limits in such a vast parameter space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Improper operating conditions may lead to defects and nonuniform film thickness, if any solid film is deposited at all. Analytical solutions of the governing fluid dynamical equations exist for very few idealized situations but can provide important parameters like the minimum wet film thickness <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub> and the zero-pressure-difference film thickness <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The first theoretical study of slot die coating operating limits was presented in 1976<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, but despite a wealth of research over several decades, a comprehensive unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. It is fair to say that the overarching theme of understanding slot die coating stability is that it is presently—for all practical purposes—largely empirical. Even numerical methods by solving the 2-D Navier–Stokes system of equations struggle to determine limits of instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">For <italic>Ca</italic> « 1, capillary forces dominate fluid flow, holding the fluid between the gap and enabling stable coating flow. At high Ca, capillary forces are unable to prevent viscous forces from disrupting the flow profile as the liquid film is dragged out. However, it should come as no surprise that flow stability cannot be simply reduced to a single dimensionless quantity. There exist analytical models for stability windows albeit with varying degrees of fluid ideality—namely, inviscid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, viscous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, and viscocapillary flow; we direct the reader to others’ work for a detailed mathematical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. While such models can relate geometric and operating parameters to <italic>Ca</italic>, they are usually restricted to specific conditions resulting from their underlying assumptions—e.g., small Ca and small Re. It should be noted that these analyses are also presented by assuming Newtonian fluid behavior. Since slot die coating has been used for fabricating organic thin films relatively recently, there have not been many detailed studies of the fluid mechanical properties of the OSC solutions themselves. Polymer solutions may exhibit shear-thinning or viscoelastic behavior, which are important considerations given that fluid elasticity generally acts to destabilize the downstream forward meniscus during coating.</p><p id="Par27">Naturally, web speed is limited to some maximum value, beyond which specific failure modes occur. The downstream meniscus is generally pinned to the lip of the slot die head in stable coating flow, but the upstream rear meniscus may fail to pin to the back lip of the die head under low-flow or high web speed conditions. In between the uniform homogenous film and completely unstable coating regions lies a defect region above a critical Ca. Here dynamic wetting failure can lead to defects such as ribbing, air entrainment, and rivulets (Box <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2b</xref>). Furthermore, even within the stable coating window, vortices may also be formed, causing defects or nonuniformities in the printed film. The subset of conditions constituting vortex-free flow is often a small fraction of the stable coating window. In general, the most important factor in determining vortex-free conditions is the lip geometry and angle, but again, vortex avoidance is largely empirically determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Controlling morphology and device performance</title><p id="Par28">The performance of organic electronic devices is closely related to the morphology of the deposited thin film, specifically to the way that the molecules pack in the solid state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Films of conjugated polymers are especially complex because of both their semicrystalline nature and the extensive disorder within their crystalline domains compared to that of small-molecule crystalline domains. In this section, we will discuss the recent use of MGC to enhance OSC device performance by addressing general phenomena that affect charge transport as it pertains to polymer OFETs and OPVs. For the reader’s convenience, we have compiled key device parameters and data for the references cited in this review in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>. It is worth noting that these two devices involve very different ideal film morphologies. Single-material devices, OFETs, involve charge transport that occurs in-plane with the substrate near the dielectric–organic interface. The primary figure of merit for OFET performance is the charge carrier mobility, which is typically measured directly from thin-film transistor devices. The measured charge carrier mobility from transistors is a combination of intra- and inter-chain transport, given that the transistor channel length is on the order of tens of microns, a length scale that is significantly larger than contour length of a single polymer chain with a molecular weight &lt;100 kDa. Promoting the charge transport along the polymer backbone by either designing a coplanar polymer backbone to enhance electron delocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> or synthesizing high-molecular-weight molecules greatly benefits the device performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Moreover, a higher degree of crystallinity in conjugated polymers together with tie chains can assist the charge hopping process for inter-chain charge transport;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> further discussion on OFET charge transport can found in the reviews by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In OPVs, the phase-separated domain size between the two semiconducting materials and efficient out-of-plane charge transport within those percolated domains to the electrodes are understood to be two of the most important device morphology considerations. It is clear that film morphology can dramatically affect device performance, and rational control of the deposition processes is crucial.

Nonetheless, because crystalline order can directly affect device performance, understanding the nucleation and crystal growth behavior of these materials is needed. Precise control of these two processes for polymer films deposited by MGC is not easy compared to crystalline, small-molecule systems. While theoretical and experimental work on homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation in non-conjugated polymer systems is extensive, less effort has been focused on semiconducting polymers. However, while detailed studies of the nucleation of conducting polymers are scarce, insights to approach the problem of conducting polymer nucleation and crystallite growth can be gleaned from work on conventional insulating polymers like semicrystalline polyethylene (PE), which has been studied extensively to determine the mechanism underlying crystallization from the melt and solution. We briefly discuss such mechanisms and refer the reader to other authorities on polymer crystallization for further reading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">The crystallization of a polymer from the melt results in the substantial decrease in conformational entropy of the polymer chain and can be separated into three sequential regimes: initial formation of nuclei; nucleus extension and coalescence; and finally crystal growth (Box <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. As compared to small molecules, the key difference in the polymer nucleation process is the ability for a single chain to be incorporated into more than one nucleus (for sufficiently high molecular weights). The associative interactions between polymer segments result in the formation of aggregates because of either undercooling below the lamella “equilibrium melting temperature” <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>° or supersaturation caused by solvent evaporation.

Both mechanisms of enlargement involve, to some degree, translation and adjustment of the backbones into energetically favorable conformations in the growing nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, and nucleation is complete when the lamella achieves a thickness <italic>L</italic>* after a maturation time <italic>t</italic>*. The crystallization from solution is analogous to that from melt, as the driving force now changes from cooling to supersaturation of the polymer solution during solvent evaporation.</p><p id="Par31">The lamellae of PE crystals consist of polymer backbone “stems” incorporated perpendicular to the plane of the lamella, which can dynamically rearrange during nucleation and growth.

Because it is predicated on such model polymer molecules, polymer nucleation theory as developed by Hoffman, Weeks, and Lauritzen is most applicable to such classes of materials. In contrast, donor–acceptor conjugated polymers have relatively rigid backbones that reduce main chain torsion and that make the polymers stiff or rod-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>.

As mentioned before, ink formulation plays a crucial role in the development of the final film morphology and can be optimized. For example, nucleation agents have been commonly used to alter polymer morphology and overall crystallinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> and, when used for semiconducting polymers, have been shown to increase the crystallization rate of poly(3-alkylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3AT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>.

The directional stress could involve concentration gradients during drying or external forces (mechanical, electric, magnetic, etc.). The generality of these processes can be exploited for different polymer systems with minimal complexity added to the overall processing scheme, and they include zonecasting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>, off-axis spin coating (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>, directional drying in a capillary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, thin-film compression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>, dip coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup>, and Langmuir–Blodgett methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup> among others (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). Maximizing the shear stress in a particular direction should enhance chain alignment in that direction, which for MGC, generally implies faster coating speeds. However, in the LL regime, relaxation of the polymer likely limits any achievable alignment, given that spreading of the wet film and drying are separate processes. In the evaporative regime, the thinner film requires less time for all of the solvent to evaporate, thus causing more rapid supersaturation and increasing the stochastic nucleation of randomly oriented crystallites and reducing overall alignment. In this way, an optimal coating speed balancing these two factors is necessary, but it is difficult to a priori predict the ideal printing conditions for high in-plane alignment of a given polymer.

For MGC involving shear strain, studies often achieve highly aligned, solution-printed polymer thin films by relying on the formation of fibril aggregates in solution.

It is possible that shear stress is effective at aligning these larger aggregate structures as opposed to dissolved free polymer molecules, but the role of crystallites during film formation is unclear.

The key here is the natural proclivity for ordered self-aggregation and the ordered topology of the substrate, which, while restricting this type of multistep alignment to polymers with accessible LC phases, provides a key insight: in integrating both the design and processing of tailored semiconductors, a balance must be struck between high aggregation energy and processability.

While much work in this space is focused on chemical modification and side chain chemistry to control the surface energy of conjugated polymers (beyond the scope of this review), only a few reports specifically use the method of deposition as the primary mechanism.

The crystallites orient mostly edge-on when coated at low speeds but change to a mixture of edge-on and face-on orientations at high speeds.

For applications, like OPVs, requiring multicomponent systems, the influence of the deposition method is intricately convolved with the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase separation, which must be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Phase separation for multicomponent films</title><p id="Par41">In organic solar cells, the phase-separated domain size is one of the most important morphological characteristics that determines the exciton harvest efficiency and that profoundly affects device performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref></sup>. OPVs constitute a very active area of research for an application requiring the interaction of two or more chemically dissimilar components in solution. The resulting dried film active layer is a BHJ composed of donor and acceptor materials, whether they are polymers, small molecules, or any combination thereof. Unlike in inorganic semiconductors, light absorption in OPVs generates coulombically bound excitons rather than free charge carriers due to the lower dielectric constant of organic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref></sup>.

One key to effective energy harvesting is the effective dissociation of coulombically bound excitons at the domain boundaries separating the donor and acceptor before the exciton recombines.

Consequently, most industrial-scale slot die R2R coating processes operate at high speeds well within the LL regime. As discussed previously, rational ink formulation can dramatically influence the final film morphology, but the fluid mechanical effects of the deposition method on phase separation, however, have received far less attention. A few studies demonstrate that differing coating speeds can affect the phase separation between donor and acceptor in the LL regime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref></sup>, but an optimal set of deposition conditions may actually reflect the greater influence of some variables—like dry film thickness—over others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref></sup>. Because factors like the relative speed of solvent evaporation, film thickness, and polymer nucleation rate are interrelated, additional work is need to deconvolve such effects. When the entanglement of polymer chains and the aggregation between different chains dominates, shear strain likely has a limited effect on phase separation: as recently demonstrated, the phase separation of a mixture of high-molecular-weight donor and acceptor polymers is insensitive to coating speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par45">On the other hand, the evaporative regime is less explored for OPV deposition. Although the coating speeds involved may not be directly useful for the industrial printing of OPVs, deposition in this regime can reveal methods to tune film morphology by modulating the flow and shear fields in the solution. As mentioned previously, the ink meniscus generally has a short length (&lt;1 cm), and the flow within the meniscus is a delicate balance between mass and heat transport. Because deposition is under the direct influence of the meniscus, the non-equilibrium state of the ensemble of polymer chains (e.g., extended chains, flow-induced nuclei, aligned molecules, etc.) could be “frozen” into the dry film. Shear strain and extensional flow can be used to control phase separation, overall crystallinity, and domain orientation. In one study, a micro-patterned shearing blade rationally designed to locally increase shear strain and induce extensional flow is shown to enhance the crystallinity of one polymer component, causing an improvement in OPV performance and, most importantly, a reduction of the phase separation scale (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. This work is particularly notable because it is hard to enhance crystallinity without increasing of the phase separation size scale since both are coupled—crystallization is a strong driving force for the system to phase separate. In another study, albeit of polymer/small-molecule blends, higher coating speeds reduce the average phase separation size scale from 100 nm (1.0 mm s<sup>–1</sup>) to 75 nm (2.5 mm s<sup>–1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref></sup>. Other deposition parameters like substrate temperature are also important factors that affect the final deposited BHJ film. For example, higher temperatures result in increased phase-separated domain size and reduced polymer crystallinity in isoindigo/fullerene BHJ films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref></sup>. Moreover, external fields (e.g., electrical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref></sup> and magnetic) or UV light can be used to aid polymer association and aggregation, methods yet to be explored for OPV deposition.
