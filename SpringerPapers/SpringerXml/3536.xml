Here, we adopt a bioclimatic approach based on the Köppen classification to focus on the evolution of warm semi-arid regions over the projected twenty-first century, following three socio-economic scenarios and 12 global climate models from the last IPCC exercise (CMIP5). We show that a global expansion of this climatic domain has already started according to climate observations in the twentieth century (about + 13% of surface increase, i.e. from 6 to 7% of the global land surface). Models project that this expansion will continue throughout the twenty-first century, whatever the scenario: for the most dramatic one (RCP 8.5), the share of the total land surface occupied by warm semi-arid surfaces is about 38% higher in 2100 compared to the present (from ∼ 7 to ∼ 9% of the global land surface). This expansion will essentially take place outside of the tropical belt, showing a poleward migration as large as 11<sup>∘</sup> of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. This expansion is linearly correlated with the projected future global warming (about 853 millions km<sup>2</sup> per degree of warming for RCP 8.5). Different types of climate class transitions and their associated mechanisms are discussed.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agence Nationale de

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Two billion people (34% of the population) today live in the so-called drylands, which cover about 41% of the terrestrial land surface, according to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (Yukie and Otto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>). These water-limited areas hold scarce natural resources and thus represent challenging regions for human societies who tend to show weaker wealth and health scores compared to the world population (Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>). The future of those drylands is thus preoccupying for populations already submitted to difficult conditions: the degradation of eco-climatic conditions could lead to a reduction of limited natural resources, bringing the socio-ecosystem closer to an equilibrium breaking point. Moreover, the expansion of similar regions could draw more populations into dealing with aridity issues that they have not been accustomed to. In this paper, we focus on a specific sub-domain of the global drylands: semi-arid (SA) regions. More specifically, because even beyond aridity, warm and cold regions hold different challenges (to be reflected in coping strategies, such as, e.g. tropical agroforestry), we focus on <italic>warm</italic> semi-arid regions (WSAR). As the overall drylands’ area is expected to widen under several scenarios of climatic change (e.g. Feng and Fu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>)), are existing WSAR expected to aridify? In that case, currently adequate development actions could become obsolete. On the other hand, should we expect the total WSAR area to increase in the future? This could enlarge the geographical relevance of aridity coping strategies. Our goal here is to quantify the total WSA area over the twentieth and the twenty-first century using the most up-to-date climate data and projections and to characterize the geographical extension, distribution and transformation of these regions.</p><p id="Par3">Two main approaches are found in the literature to study the evolution of climatic regions and of drylands specifically. A purely climatic definition uses the precipitation (P) over potential evapotranspiration (PET) ratio (aridity index). Different levels of aridity are distinguished based on consensual thresholds (Yukie and Otto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>): 0.65 (sub-humid), 0.5 (semi-arid), 0.2 (full arid) and 0.05 (hyper-arid). An alternative definition is based on the application of one of the several existing climate classifications, among which the Köppen one is the most widely used (Rubel and Kottek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>). In this classification, temperature (T) and precipitation (P) are the variables used to delimitate climate classes separated by empirical thresholds: these are based on expert knowledge of the climatic conditions of existence of generic biomes. This method has been applied to study climatic shifts at the planet scale (e.g. Fraedrich et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>) for the twentieth century; Rubel and Kottek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>) for the twenty-first century). While the aridity index approach quantifies atmospheric dryness, the climate classification approach is biome-based, allowing common treatment of areas of similar climatic and ecological conditions. Whatever the chosen approach, the evolution of the climatic regions in the future is usually studied through the same overall methodological framework: the definition is applied to time series of climatic data obtained from observations or model simulations, thus producing time series of the localization and the surface extent of the considered climatic regions (e.g. Feng and Fu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>) for the aridity index; Rubel and Kottek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>) for the bioclimatic definition). Although both definitions would allow to study the geographical evolution of drylands, the aridity index only classifies levels of aridity whereas the bioclimatic approach further offers the possibility to analyze all types of climatic conversions between classes. WSA conditions constitute a specific class in the Köppen classification. Besides, this classification has been proved a suitable tool for broad-audience climate science communication (Jylhä et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). For these reasons, the bioclimatic approach was chosen to perform the present study. Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> presents the data sets and methods along with introducing an original index of the WSAR geographical extent. The following questions are then addressed:

The climate classes are then based on the relationship between climate and vegetation, following increasing levels of complexity. Five main climatic groups are first defined, labeled from A (equatorial climates) to E (polar climates). Groups B, C and D respectively stand for “arid”, “warm temperate” and ‘snow” climates. Each group is further divided into sub-classes, using empirical temperature and precipitation thresholds (cf. full nomenclature in Table <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials 1</xref>). The classification is based on monthly mean air temperature and cumulated precipitation only. The various formula and criteria can be found in Kottek et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). All groups but B are first discriminated by temperature criteria. Further subdivisions for groups A, C and D are then calculated based on precipitation criteria. WSA climatic conditions belong to group B of arid climates. This group is characterized at the first order by a dryness threshold (Pth in mm), calculated as a linear function of Tann, the absolute measure of the annual mean temperature in degrees celsius, parameterized accordingly to the annual distribution of precipitation over two semesters (Kottek et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>), formula 2.1):

The arid climate group is further subdivided first into two sub-classes, based on annual mean precipitation (Pann): steppes (5*Pth &lt; Pann &lt; 10*Pth) are differentiated from deserts (Pann &lt; 5*Pth); then, these are split between warm (Tann &gt; 18<sup>∘</sup>C) and cold. In the following, we define WSAR to be locations where the Köppen classification identifies warm steppe. The rationale behind this T-dependence of Pth relies on the influence of T on potential evapotranspiration (PET): warming induces PET to rise, thus increasing the level of P needed to pass the threshold of aridity. This particular feature will be further discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, but already implies that, in a warmer world, without any change in Pann, more regions will be considered as WSA as all values (thresholds) depending on Pth will be raised (larger).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The climate data sets</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>CRU data set for present-day conditions</title><p id="Par10">Observational data is used to characterize the state and trends of WSAR over the twentieth century.

Monthly temperature and precipitation, for all years from 1901 to 2001, were selected for this purpose. The data set is provided at the horizontal resolution of 0.5<sup>∘</sup> latitude by 0.5<sup>∘</sup> longitude.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>CMIP5 outputs for future projections</title><p id="Par11">To address future climate projected changes, we have retrieved globally gridded monthly precipitation and air temperature from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) long-term experiments, for 12 models out of about 30 available (Table <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials 2</xref>). Only those where several <italic>runs</italic> (ensemble of simulations for one model and one scenario) are available for at least one of the time-series (historical or future) were selected: all ensemble members are then averaged together for each model, so as to account for the models’ internal variability and provide an unbiased estimate of the forced climate response in individual model simulations (Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>; Kravtsov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>). For each model, the 1901–2005 period is extracted from the model ensemble mean historical experiment (forced by observed atmospheric composition changes). For the future, the 2006–2100 period has been selected for three representative concentration pathways (RCPs). RCP 2.6 stands as the “mitigation scenario”: the radiative forcing is projected to peak toward the middle of the twenty-first century, then declines (Riahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>); RCP 4.5 is a “stabilization scenario”: the radiative forcing stabilizes by 2100 (Fujino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>; Hijioka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>); RCP 8.5 is a “business as usual scenario”: the radiative forcing rises continuously across the twenty-first century, without peaking (Van Vuuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>). All future scenarios were forced using prescribed atmospheric composition changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The methodology</title><sec id="FPar3"><title>Time-series of running averages</title><p id="Par12">In order to buffer year-to-year variability, the climate classification is computed for 15-year-mean climatologies—the optimal averaging windows for climate classifications according to Fraedrich et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>). The total area (global or regional) can then be calculated for a given climate class (e.g. “warm semi-arid”) for each 15-year period. The time-series of such 15-year running area then allow searching for trends. The last 15-year-average of the RCP time series (2086–2100) is used to characterize the climate state at the end of each RCP. The average 1987–2001 period of the historical time-series is used to characterize the climate state at the end of the twentieth century. These analyses are performed at each model’s resolution.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Multi-model mean classification</title><p id="Par13">In order to provide ensemble mean results, average temperature and precipitation time series are calculated for each RCP (over the 1901–2100 period) as the arithmetic mean of all the models (each model resulting from the mean of the runs, as stated in Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">2.2</xref>). Based on this mean climatology, the ensemble mean Köppen classification is calculated following the same path as for any of the models. This approach will allow for multi-model ensemble mean maps to be produced. In order to calculate multi-model mean (MMM) averages, the time-series are first projected onto a common grid by linear interpolation. An intermediate grid (1.4<sup>∘</sup>×1.4<sup>∘</sup>) is arbitrarily chosen amongst the models’ grids. Such post-treatment partly deteriorates each model’s original outputs. However, the MMM has been shown to give the overall best simulation results compared to observations, although some models perform better for given regions and variables (Gleckler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>WSA domain outer limits</title><p id="Par14">The northern and southern latitudinal boundaries of the overall WSA domain are calculated respectively as the polarmost latitudes enclosing 75% of the total hemispheric WSA surface.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>T and P effect</title><p id="Par15">A complementary analysis is provided in the supplementary material to separate T and P effects on WSA changes (see section <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Twentieth century distribution and evolution of warm semi-arid regions</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results obtained from climate observations</title><p id="Par16">As of today (1987–2001, 15-year period), the WSA total area represents about 7% of the global land surface, according to our calculations of Köppen’s bioclimatic class based on the CRU data set (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Despite a rather large decadal variability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, black curve), WSAR display a clear increasing trend during the second half of the century (smoothed red curve). By the end of the century, WSAR have increased by + 13% compared to the years 1901–1915 (from 6 to 7% of the total land surface). This change can be seen on Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> when comparing the red and the black curves. The surface increase occurred primarily across the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere, and also to some extent in the Sahelian belt in the Northern Hemisphere. Huang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>) and Feng and Fu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>) also analysed global semi-arid (SA) climate changes focusing on the twentieth century. From observations, both studies found that WSA have been expanding over the last 60 years, consistently with the present results. However, as they do not differentiate between cold and warm SA regions, their results cannot be directly and quantitatively compared to ours. P is found to be the main driver of this change (Table <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials 3</xref>): it explains about 75% of the change, while T only explains 23%.

No further increase occurs during the second half of this century. On the contrary, both RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 show a continuing increase after the middle of the twenty-first century, but it is more pronounced for RCP 8.5. These patterns of projected changes were expectable, as they follow the scenarios’ design for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: the radiative forcing is projected to peak by the middle of the century for RCP 2.6 and to go on rising after 2100 for RCP 8.5 (Van Vuuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>).

The evolution of the WSAR therefore derives from an overall aridification process. Changes are more profound for more severe scenarios: according to RCP 8.5, 58% (for the MMM) of the present WSAR will remain WSA in the future (2100), while 21% (corresponding to 2818 ×10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup>) of the initial area will evolve towards the “fully arid” class. More stability is obtained for RCPs 2.6 and 4.5: respectively 75 and 69% of WSAR are maintained while 8 and 13% become more arid.

This is in line with the projected reduced precipitation in most models as discussed by Christensen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>), in response to changes in atmospheric circulation in this area (e.g. strengthening of the Caribbean low-level jet, increased subsidence). As for the future new extra-tropical WSA surfaces, they result from the warming of the cold semi-arid class, or the conversion of temperate classes. The increase in WSAR we found in the Mediterranean region is consistent with the increased subsidence and sea-level pressure described by Lu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) in response to global warming. In Australia, the global weakening of the Walker circulation, combined with warming, is the potential candidate for our simulated changes (Power and Kociuba <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). WSAR becoming “sub-humid” are mainly located in East Africa (Fig. <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials 7</xref>), consistently with the projected precipitation increase in this region (Collins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">This work fits within a corpus of studies anticipating the evolution of the different climatic regions of the world, albeit with a particular focus on drylands and SA regions.

These mainly depend on the available water, hence on the relation between the precipitation and the water demand represented here by temperature-based Pth. As a result, the T factor drives conversions to semi-arid and arid classes through the rising of the Pth threshold. However, other factors than T drive the water demand, which is more often estimated with the potential evapotranspiration (PET). The Penman-Monteith equation, most commonly used to estimate PET, thus integrates the solar-radiation factor, among others. As shown by Scheff and Frierson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>), the PET dependance on temperature is the highest in polar latitudes, while the radiation factor is more influent at the lower latitudes where WSA regions are typically located. In the Köppen classification, the differences of water demand are only modulated through the temperature, regardless of the radiation factor. For these reasons, keeping the aridity thresholds unchanged throughout future projections may lead to overestimating the impact of a temperature change in the future at a given latitude, while the level of solar-radiation, linked to the Earth inclination, does not change. This overestimation may account partly for the preponderance of the T effect in the future WSA surface change as shown in section <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials 5</xref>.</p><p id="Par33">Secondly, the major objection raised in the recent literature regards the effect of [CO<sub>2</sub>] on plants. Here, we differentiate between “atmospheric aridity” (diagnosed from 2m atmospheric variables) and “vegetation aridity”. Many plants may indeed increase the water use efficiency with increasing [CO<sub>2</sub>] (e.g. Donohue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>)). As a result, under higher [CO<sub>2</sub>] “atmospheric” and ”vegetation aridity” become somewhat decoupled, as greater “atmospheric aridity” does not translate into greater stress on vegetation. This could lead to over-estimating future aridification (Roderick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Milly and Dunne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). On the other hand, increased water use efficiency leads to decreasing total evapotranspiration (higher [CO<sub>2</sub>] increases stomatal closure, thus decreasing stomatal conductance). This results in a shift in the Bowen ratio, which warms and dries the overlying atmosphere (e.g. Swann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>) and Berg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>)), thus contributing to increasing “atmospheric aridity”. Because of these complex vegetation response and feedback, ecosystem shifts should not be directly inferred from atmospheric changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par34">The main result of our paper is that the WSA domain will expand globally, and more specifically outside of its present tropical location. This increase is proportional to the projected future global warming in all scenarios and models. We have applied the well-known Köppen classification to outputs from 12 climate models forced with three socio-economic scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5), and analyzed the time evolution of WSAR from 1901 to 2100. Historical behavior was also reconstructed using observed atmospheric forcing. We show that WSAR have already increased in the past, in both observations and models, albeit with lesser magnitude when reconstructed from model outputs. This however is in line with existing literature.</p><p id="Par35">In the future, WSA regions, frontiers between fully arid and sub-humid conditions, will experience both a poleward migration and an increase of the its global extent. WSAR are therefore expected to expand outside the tropical belt, many temperate regions being converted through both warming and drying into WSAR, although T has been shown to be the main driver. Many cold SA regions will become WSAR through warming. The use of the Köppen classification provides a direct picture of the different types of transition. This could be particularly helpful in communicating results to other fields of research or to stakeholders in development programs implemented in present and future WSAR.</p><p id="Par36">Finally, one should be careful not to over-interpretate the shifting of a given bioclimatic class in terms of biome migration: in higher [CO<sub>2</sub>] conditions, new atmosphere-vegetation equilibrium are likely to appear. Thresholds set for the historical period may become less adequate in the future. Although the Köppen classification and the climate models have proven powerful tools to explore the future, further tuning is thus needed, where vegetation is involved, to account for future T and [CO<sub>2</sub>] conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to three anonymous reviewers whose valuable comments contributed to significantly improve this article.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Findell</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lintner</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Giannini</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Seneviratne</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Den Hurk</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lorenz</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagemann</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Meier</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Land-atmosphere feedbacks amplify aridity increase over land under global warming</article-title><source>Nat Clim Chang</source><year>2016</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>869</fpage><lpage>874</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/nclimate3029</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Christensen JH, Kanikicharla KK, Marshall G, Turner J (2013) Climate phenomena and their relevance for future regional climate change.
