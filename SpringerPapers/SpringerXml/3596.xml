Particularly, photocatalytic water splitting by utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts has demonstrated huge potential as a clean, low-cost and sustainable approach for solar H<sub>2</sub> production. However, despite tremendous achievement in this area during the past decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, it is still a great challenge to develop highly efficient, cost-effective and robust photocatalysts driven by sunlight. In recent years, co-catalysts have shown great success in boosting both the activity and stability of photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the high price and extreme scarcity of the most active H<sub>2</sub> evolution co-catalyst, Pt, restricts the commercialization of current photocatalysts. Therefore, seeking an inexpensive and highly active co-catalyst to replace Pt is of paramount significance for achieving large-scale solar H<sub>2</sub> production in the future.</p><p id="Par4">To date, although enormous progress has been made in developing earth-abundant co-catalysts, several major problems, arising from the intrinsic properties of current co-catalysts, still exist: (i) lack of abundant surface functionalities to establish strong connection with photocatalysts, for fast interfacial charge transfer and long-term stability; (ii) inefficient electron shuttling within co-catalysts due to their poor semiconducting/insulating conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or destruction of π-conjugated system (for example, graphene oxide)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>; (iii) undesirable Gibbs free energy for H<sub>2</sub> evolution; (iv) insufficient contact with water molecules due to lack of hydrophilic functionalities; and (v) instability and/or requirement of non-aqueous environment (for example, hydrogenases and their mimics)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is highly desirable to seek a brand-new family of materials as the next generation co-catalysts that can overcome these drawbacks.</p><p id="Par5">MXene, a new family of over 60 two-dimensional (2D) metal carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, has shown great potential as electrodes in (Li)-ion batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and supercapacitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Notably, their distinguished characteristics render them highly promising for solving the above problems as: (i) MXene possesses numerous hydrophilic functionalities (–OH and –O) on its surface, enabling it to easily construct strong connection with various semiconductors; (ii) the excellent metallic conductivity of MXene assures efficient charge-carrier transfer; (iii) the exposed terminal metal sites (for example, Ti, Nb or V) on MXene might lead to much stronger redox reactivity than that of the carbon materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; (iv) the presence of numerous hydrophilic functionalities on MXene promotes its strong interaction with water molecules; and (v) MXene can stably function in aqueous solutions. Considering the above outstanding properties of the MXene family, it is anticipated that MXene will be a promising material to be employed in photocatalysis. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on exploring MXene as a co-catalyst for photocatalysis.</p><p id="Par6">Herein, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the potential of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene as a H<sub>2</sub> evolution co-catalyst. On the basis of theoretical studies, we report a rational design and synthesis of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) and merge them with a chosen photocatalyst, CdS, to successfully achieve a super high visible-light photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub>-production activity. The origin of this high activity is studied by both experimental techniques and theoretical investigations. Moreover, the general function of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs as an active co-catalyst for other photocatalysts is also confirmed, illustrating the considerable potential of MXene family materials to replace rare and costly Pt in photocatalysis/photoelectrocatalysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theoretical exploration of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene as a co-catalyst</title><p id="Par7">To explore the possibility of using Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene as a highly efficient and low-priced co-catalyst to promote H<sub>2</sub> production, we have conducted a series of theoretical investigations based on DFT calculations. A highly active co-catalyst can not only rapidly extract photo-induced electrons from a photocatalyst to its surface, but also efficiently catalyse the H<sub>2</sub> evolution on its surface, by using those electrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Herein, we first focus on the H<sub>2</sub> evolution activity to evaluate whether Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> is an excellent candidate. Usually, the overall H<sub>2</sub> evolution reaction (HER) pathway can be summarized by a three-state diagram, composed of an initial state H<sup>+</sup>+<italic>e</italic><sup>−</sup>, an intermediate adsorbed H*, and a final product ½H<sub>2</sub> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). The Gibbs free energy of the intermediate state, |Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>|, is regarded as a major indicator of the HER activity for various catalysts. The most desirable value for |Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>| should be zero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. For example, the highly active and well-known HER catalyst, Pt, shows a near-zero value of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>≈−0.09 eV (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Thus, we performed DFT studies to calculate Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub> for atomic H adsorption on the surface of O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Their structural models are displayed in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Figs 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">2</xref>, respectively. Pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> exhibits a largely negative Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>=−0.927 eV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), suggesting too strong chemical adsorption of H* on its surface. Meanwhile, a largely positive Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>=1.995 eV is observed for F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating very weak H* adsorption and easy product desorption. Unfortunately, both conditions are unfavourable for HER. Surprisingly, O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> shows a near-zero value of |Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>|=0.00283, eV at its optimal H* coverage (<italic>θ</italic>=1/2) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Hence, we employ DFT calculations to determine the band structures of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>, pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> exhibits metallic characteristics with substantial electronic states crossing the Fermi level. In comparison, F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>) and O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>) exhibit decreased numbers of states at the Fermi level, indicating their lower conductivities. Nevertheless, the continuous electronic states crossing Fermi level for F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> indicate that their conductivities are still good. Hence, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> retains its outstanding electrical conductivity, even after decoration with numerous functionalities, implying its exceptional capability to transport electrons. We believe this unique merit of MXene renders it a superior co-catalyst outperforming its counterparts, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, which suffer obvious conductivity loss after their termination with –O, –OH and –COO<sup>−</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Furthermore, the Fermi levels (<italic>Ε</italic><sub>F</sub>) of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> are calculated to be −0.05 V, 1.88 V and 0.15 V versus SHE, respectively. Among them, O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> displays the most positive value of <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub>, implying its strongest capacity to accept photo-induced electrons from semiconductor photocatalysts.</p><p id="Par9">On the basis of the above theoretical explorations, it can be concluded that both pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and F-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> are not eligible candidates due to their inefficient HER activity and unfavourable <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub>. In contrast, O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> is predicted to be a highly promising co-catalyst, given its outstanding HER activity, excellent metallic conductivity and desirable <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and synthesis of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-incorporated CdS</title><p id="Par10">The above theoretical investigations provide clear guidance to synthesize Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> co-catalyst and couple it with photocatalysts. Firstly, we need to obtain Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> terminated with abundant functionalities instead of pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. Then, we should minimize and maximize the number of –F and –O terminations on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, respectively. To achieve this goal, as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> (MAX phase) powders were firstly etched by HF to remove Al species, producing exfoliated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-E) with an accordion-like architecture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). During the etching process, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-E was spontaneously decorated with substantial functionalities (–OH, –F and –O) on its surface, giving rise to its exceptional hydrophilicity. The transformation from Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> is firmly evidenced by the obvious shift of the (002) and (004) X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks to lower degrees, and the disappearance of the strongest diffraction peak of Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> at 39° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To further increase the surface area and functionalities of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-E was added to de-ionized water and subjected to strong ultra-sonication, during which many large Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-E sheets were cut into small pieces of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 r.p.m. to remove the large Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sheets and particles, leaving the small Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). The successful formation of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs is supported by the XRD pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>), energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) elemental mapping images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 8c–f</xref>), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>), and high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2<italic>p</italic>, O 1<italic>s</italic> and F 1<italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 9b,c,d</xref>).

Meanwhile, the ‘black’ colloid dispersion of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> exhibits a typical Tyndall effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>, inset), reasonably suggesting the formation of a homogeneous dispersion of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs. The engineering of three-dimensional (3D) Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-E into zero-dimensional (0D) Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs dramatically increased their surface area and functionalities, thus greatly favoring their intimate coupling with photocatalysts.</p><p id="Par11">Then, CdS was selected as the photocatalyst to couple with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, since its reported conduction band (CB) potential (−0.7 V versus SHE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> is much more negative than the <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> of O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (1.88 V versus SHE). Besides, to obtain the desired functionalities on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, a hydrothermal strategy is applied to integrate CdS with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs. So the –F terminations can be replaced by –O or –OH in the aqueous environment during hydrothermal treatment. The synthesis process is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>. Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs were firstly introduced into Cd(Ac)<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution, in which Cd<sup>2+</sup> cations were easily adsorbed on numerous -O terminations. Then, an organic sulfur source, thiourea, was added into the above suspension and coordinated with Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Finally, the resulting suspension was subjected to hydrothermal treatment. During this process, most of the –F terminations on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs were replaced by –O/–OH terminations, and thiourea molecules decomposed to gradually release S<sup>2−</sup> anions into the solution. These S<sup>2−</sup> anions were combined with the Cd<sup>2+</sup> cations adsorbed on the surface of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs, leading to the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of CdS NPs on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs. Meanwhile, the excessive Cd<sup>2+</sup> cations were also combined with these S<sup>2−</sup> anions, resulting in the homogeneous nucleation and growth of pure CdS NPs. Then both CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites and CdS NPs self-assembled to form a large cauliflower-structured CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sub-microsphere (SMS), with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs intimately coupled. The nominal mass ratios of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> to CdS were 0, 0.05, 0.1, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt.%, and the resulting samples were labelled as CT0, CT0.05, CT0.1, CT2.5, CT5 and CT7.5, respectively.

A combination of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs with CdS did not affect the crystal structure of CdS, suggesting that the remarkable increase in photocatalytic activity is not caused by any crystal structure alteration in CdS.

However, no diffraction peaks for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> are observed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>, probably due to the low loading and high dispersion of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs on the surface of CdS.</p><p id="Par13">The morphology and composition of the as-synthesized CT2.5 were further investigated by HAADF, EDX, high-resolution (HR)TEM, SEM and XPS techniques.

Excitingly, the coupling of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs with CdS indeed leads to a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic activity. As displayed in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, pristine CdS (CT0) shows a very low photocatalytic activity of 105 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>. In contrast, the loading of a small amount of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (0.05 wt.%) obviously improves the photocatalytic activity of CT0.05 to 993 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>. With increasing amount of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs, the photocatalytic activity of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-loaded CdS is gradually enhanced. Surprisingly, a super high photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub>-production activity of 14,342 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> is achieved on CT2.5, exceeding that of CT0 by an amazing factor of 136.6. In comparison, for the same loading (2.5 wt.%) and experimental conditions, NiS, Ni and MoS<sub>2</sub>-loaded CdS SMS (NiS–CdS, Ni–CdS and MoS<sub>2</sub>–CdS) exhibit lower photocatalytic activities of 12,953, 8,649 and 6,183 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Besides, CT2.5 also shows higher quantum efficiency (40.1% at 420 nm) than the other noble-metal-free CdS-based photocatalysts reported to date, such as: Ni/CdS, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CdS, Ni<sub>2</sub>P/CdS, CoP/CdS, graphene oxide/CdS and MoS<sub>2</sub>/CdS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). On the basis of the above experimental data and literature, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs have proven to be one of the most active earth-abundant co-catalysts. Furthermore, CT2.5 even displays higher activity than 2.5 wt.% Pt loaded CdS SMS (Pt–CdS, 10,978 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>), even though Pt is widely accepted as the most active co-catalyst promoting H<sub>2</sub> production. The HAADF image, EDX elemental mapping images, TEM and HRTEM images of Pt–CdS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 14a–f</xref>) imply that Pt is homogeneously decorated on CdS in the form of clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). The size of Pt in Pt–CdS is much smaller than that of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> in CT2.5, suggesting more active sites exposed on Pt than those on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> for the same loading. In this case, the superior activity of CT2.5 should be ascribed to the much stronger combination between CdS and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> established during hydrothermal treatment, which greatly facilitates the rapid interfacial charge transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This result also highlights the huge potential of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs as a high performance and low-cost co-catalyst to replace Pt.

Firstly, the light-harvesting capability of CT2.5 was measured by the ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra. As displayed in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, the light absorption of CT2.5 is obviously increased throughout the entire region of 350–800 nm, due to the black colour of loaded Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, inset). Similar phenomenon is also observed for CT0.05, CT0.1, CT5 and CT7.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>). The ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectrum of the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs aqueous solution shows no obvious absorption edge in the 250–800 nm region, implying the metallic nature of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs. Furthermore, no apparent shift in the absorption edge of CT2.5 is observed, indicating that Ti, C, F or O element is not doped into the crystal structure of CdS, which is in agreement with the above XRD data. To investigate whether the increased visible-light absorption originating from Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CT2.5, a 560 nm light filter was employed to cutoff any irradiation light with wavelength shorter than 557 nm (the onset absorption edge of CdS in CT2.5), while other experimental conditions were kept identical. Under such conditions, CT2.5 shows no activity for H<sub>2</sub> production, indicating that the enhanced visible-light absorption arising from Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs is unlikely to promote the activity enhancement observed for CT2.5.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Charge separation and transfer</title><p id="Par17">To study the charge-carrier separation and transfer efficiency in CT2.5, a series of characterization techniques including time-resolved and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and transient photocurrent (TPC) response were used.

The enhanced charge separation efficiency is further confirmed by the quenched emission peak around 560 nm for CT2.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). Furthermore, the surface and bulk charge-transfer efficiencies were investigated by the EIS and TPC density measurements, respectively. As indicated in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, CT2.5 shows a much smaller semicircle diameter and a much lower interfacial charge-transfer resistance than those of CT0 in potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH=7) under visible-light irradiation, suggesting the apparent enhancement of interfacial charge-carrier transfer on the surface of CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, to study the bulk charge transfer in CT0 and CT2.5, the TPC density measurements were conducted. Na<sub>2</sub>S and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> were applied as electrolytes to rapidly capture the photo-induced holes on the surface of CT0 and CT2.5. Thus, these hole scavengers were supposed to eliminate the surface charge recombination on CT0 and CT2.5. In such a case, the observed enhancement in the TPC density on loading of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, inset) directly reflects an improved charge separation efficiency in the bulk of CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par18">To gain further insights into the charge separation and transfer mechanism in CT2.5, the CB and valence band (VB) potentials of CdS in CT2.5 were determined to be −0.79 V and 1.54 V versus SHE, respectively, by a combination of Mott-Schottky and Tauc plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 17a,b</xref>). Hence, on light irradiation, the photo-induced electrons on the CB of CdS (<italic>E</italic><sub>CB</sub>=−0.79 V versus SHE) in CT2.5 can promptly migrate to O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs, which rapidly shuttle these photo-induced electrons to their surface active sites, because of their low <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> position and excellent conductivity. Therefore, in the case of CT2.5, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> can serve as an electron trapping and shuttling site not only to suppress the charge recombination on the surface of CdS, but also to promote the charge separation and transfer in the bulk of CdS, which is consistent with the above results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Surface catalytic redox reactions</title><p id="Par19">Following the charge separation and transfer, the last step in photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production includes the surface redox reactions catalysed by the reactive sites on CT2.5.

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, an initial increase in the loading of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs up to 1.89 wt.% (CT0.05, CT0.1 and CT2.5) caused a gradual enlargement in the specific surface area of the CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> composites. However, further increase in the loading of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs resulted in a noticeable decrease in surface area to 3.8 and 3.7 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> for CT5 and CT7.5, respectively, despite that Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs exhibit a large surface area of 120.1 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). This decrease is observed at higher loadings of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs because of their tendency to aggregate on the surface of CdS SMS. Hence, the highest surface area of CT2.5 among all the CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> composites suggests the existence of abundant active sites on its surface, which greatly promote the surface redox catalytic reactions. Moreover, the polarization curves of CT0, CT2.5 and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>) indicate that the presence of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs on the surface of CdS can greatly improve the HER activity of CT2.5, and consequently, contribute to its enhanced photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production.</p><p id="Par20">To further reveal the differences in HER mechanistic behaviour between Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and other state-of-the-art earth-abundant HER catalysts, for example, MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>, DFT calculations were conducted to study the effect of H<sub>2</sub> coverage on Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub> for O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows that one O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> unit cell tends to allow for adsorption of four H* due to its smallest |Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>H*</sub>| (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Note 3</xref>), corresponding to the unsaturated H* coverage of <italic>θ</italic>=1/2.

The surface atomic ratio of F to O, estimated by XPS analysis, for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs and hydrothermally treated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (HT-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs) are 20.6% and 8.0%, respectively. This implies that a large number of the -F terminations were exchanged into –O/–OH terminations for HT-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs during hydrothermal treatment. Then Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs and HT-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs were mechanically mixed with CT0 at the same loading (2.5 wt.%), respectively. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> displays that HT-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs induce a higher photocatalytic activity of 1,527 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup> than Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (1,105 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>), even though the surface area of HT-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (56.7 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>) is much lower than that of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs (120.1 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>) as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Table 4</xref>. The reason for this is that the replacement of –F by –O/–OH on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs increases the density of effective active sites (–O terminations), despite the decreased surface area after hydrothermal treatment.

Since the original <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> of <italic>n</italic>-type CdS (slightly lower than its CB position of −0.91 V versus SHE) is much more negative than the original <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> of O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (1.88 V versus SHE), the intimate contact between CdS and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> in CT2.5 leads to the electron transfer from CdS to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Note 4</xref>), accompanied by the rise of <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> above the hydrogen evolution potential (0.00 V versus SHE) and the equilibrium of <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> in CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> system. The similar phenomenon was reported by Jakob <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, the CB position of CdS in CT2.5 is also lowered to −0.79 V versus SHE as confirmed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 17a</xref>. Meanwhile, the immobilized positive charges remain in CdS near the CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> interface, where a space charge layer is formed, and the CB and VB of CdS are bent ‘upward’. Hence, a Schottky junction is formed between Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and CdS. On visible-light (<italic>λ</italic>≥420 nm) irradiation, the electrons are excited from the VB to the CB of CdS. Due to the reduced space charge layer thickness in nano-sized CdS primary particles, the ‘upward’ bending of the CB and VB for CdS is also limited (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Hence, the photo-induced electrons in the CB can still migrate across the ‘upward’ bent CB to the Fermi level of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, leaving the photo-induced holes in the VB of CdS. As a result, the Schottky junction can serve as an electron trap to efficiently capture the photo-induced electrons, without impeding the electron transfer from CdS to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, as reported in previous works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. After being transferred to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, the photo-induced electrons are further rapidly shuttled to its surface, due to the excellent metallic conductivity. Finally, thanks to the outstanding HER capacity of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, the protons in the aqueous solution are efficiently reduced by the photo-induced electrons at the abundant –O terminations on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> to evolve H<sub>2</sub> gas. Therefore, through tuning the number and type of surface functionalities on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, one can achieve the desirable <italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub> and optimize the HER activity for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, which imposes a pronounced synergetic enhancement effect on the photocatalytic activity of the CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> system.</p><p id="Par23">The potential of this newly developed co-catalyst can be further exploited by a co-loading strategy. For instance, a <italic>p</italic>-type semiconductor NiS could be simultaneously loaded with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs on CdS SMS. Surprisingly, the photocatalytic activity of CdS/1 mol.% NiS/2.5 wt.% Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (CNT2.5) was further increased to 18,560 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup> as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 21a</xref>. This is because the combination of <italic>p</italic>-type NiS with <italic>n</italic>-type CdS results in the formation of a <italic>p–n</italic> junction, which promotes the transfer of photo-induced holes from CdS to NiS. Meanwhile, the photo-induced electrons are rapidly extracted from CdS to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs for H<sub>2</sub> evolution. Therefore, the co-loading strategy imposes a strong synergistic effect on the charge separation and transfer in CNT2.5, which is confirmed by combined techniques of PL spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 22a</xref>) and TPC response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM582">Supplementary Fig. 22b</xref>).

On the basis of the theoretical predictions, we rationally employed the hydrothermal treatment to replace the –F terminations on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> by –O/–OH terminations, and coupled the pretreated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> with CdS to prepare a highly fused CdS/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> composite photocatalyst. Remarkably, this composite photocatalyst exhibited both super high visible-light photocatalytic activity (14,342 μmol h<sup>−1</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>) and apparent quantum efficiency (40.1% at 420 nm), rendering it as one of the best noble-metal-free metal-sulfides photocatalysts. By combining the first-principle calculations and experimental methodology, we found that this unusual activity can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the highly efficient charge separation and migration from CdS to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs and the rapid H<sub>2</sub> evolution on numerous –O terminations present on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs. Successful application of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> NPs as an efficient co-catalyst on ZnS or ZCS excitingly confirms the versatile nature of this newly developed co-catalyst.
