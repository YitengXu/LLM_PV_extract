Although biofuel production by photosynthetic microorganisms is called as the third generation biofuels, and significant innovation is necessary for the feasibility in practice, these fuels are attractive due to renewable and potentially carbon neutral resources. Moreover, photosynthetic microorganisms are attractive since they can grow on non-arable land and utilize saline and wastewater streams. Highly versatile and genetically tractable photosynthetic microorganisms need to capture solar energy and convert atmospheric and waste CO<sub>2</sub> to high-energy chemical products. Understanding of the metabolism and the efficient metabolic engineering of the photosynthetic organisms together with cultivation and separation processes as well as increased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation enables the enhancement of the feasibility of biofuel and biochemical production.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microalgae</kwd><kwd>Cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>Biofuels</kwd><kwd>Metabolic engineering</kwd><kwd>CO<sub>2</sub> fixation</kwd><kwd>Metabolic regulation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40643_2015_Article_45.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Industrial and Production Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) keeps warning the global society on global warming caused by green-house gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> based on the accumulating data and the reliable prediction model. IPCC asks world societies to make decisions to invest for the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions mostly caused by human activities. This may be also considered from the point of view of future cost caused by the severe climate change due to global warming. Namely, the global warming may cause serious local climate change as well as the rise in the sea level, which give severe damage to the societies worldwide. In fact, we have often experienced disastrous climate change year by year, and it seems to be more and more severe.</p><p id="Par3">The global carbon cycle has been perturbed by emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and by changes in land use and land intensity. These perturbations have led to cumulative anthrogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 570 ± 70 petagrams carbon since 1750 to 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Seventy percent of these emissions originated from the combustion of fossil fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">According to the data of International Energy Agency (OECD, 2011), total energy consumption in the world increased more than 78% over the last three decades. Major usage of fossil fuels causes serious environmental problems worldwide, and much attention has been focused on reducing their usage by alternative clean fuels. Namely, due to the global warming problem caused by the increased use of fossil fuels together with limited amount of fossil fuels and the fluctuating cost caused by unstable political disturbances, alternative renewable energy sources have recently been paid much attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In fact, at the present staggering rate of consumption, the world fossil oil reserves will be exhausted in less than 50 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Carbon neutral biofuels are needed to replace the petroleum oil which causes global warming caused by the emission of green house gases. Currently, the world consumes about 15 terawatts of energy per year, and only 7.8% of this is derived from renewable energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, in comparison with other forms of renewable energy such as wind, tidal, and solar energy, liquid biofuels allow solar energy to be stored and also to be used directly in existing engines and transport infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Annually, about 5,500 × 10<sup>21</sup> J of solar energy reaches the Earth’s atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Photosynthetic organisms including higher plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria play the crucial roles of capturing solar energy and storing it as chemical energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The amount of solar energy currently captured by arable crops is limited by arable land area (about 3.9% of the Earth’s surface area), fresh water (about 1% of global water), nutrient supply, and solar energy-to-biomass conversion efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Terrestrial plants capture 121.7 × 10<sup>9</sup> metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] using solar light and CO<sub>2</sub> as the energy and carbon sources. Photosynthesized carbon is then chemically converted to a variety of chemical compounds, and it is attractive to use photosynthetic organisms as green factories for producing carbohydrates, liquid fuels, and pharmaceutical drugs as well as food and feed, thus contributing to the balancing of the atmospheric carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The advantages of using photosynthetic microorganisms include the photosynthetic efficiency, location on non-arable land (about 25% of the Earth’s surface), and the use of saline and wastewater source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], where less than 1% of the available solar energy flux is converted into chemical energy by photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and much effort has been focused on the enhancement of photosynthetic carbon fixation.</p><p id="Par7">The so-called first generation biofuels have been produced from corn starch and sugarcane. However, this causes the problem of the so-called ‘food and energy issues’ as the production scale increases. The second generation biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass has thus been paid recent attention. However, it requires energy-intensive pretreatment for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The third generation biofuel production from photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae has been also attracted some attention, but the cell growth rate is quite low, and thus the productivity of the metabolites is significantly low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Although the biofuel and biochemical production by photosynthetic organisms has a big hurdle to overcome, it is still highly attractive due to CO<sub>2</sub> fixation with sunlight (and water) from environmental protection point of view, and thus contributing to the global warming problem as well. A variety of host organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and microalgae may be considered for the production of biofuels and biochemicals from CO<sub>2</sub> with sunlight. Although photosynthetic organisms offer the ability to produce biofuels and biochemicals directly from CO<sub>2</sub> and sunlight, significant innovation is inevitable for the process development in relation to large-scale cultivation, harvesting, and product separation, since the production rate is significantly low.</p><p id="Par9">The commonly used photosynthetic organisms for biofuel and biochemical production are algae and cyanobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Microalgae are photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms with size ranging from 1 to 100 μm, while cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms with size ranging from 1 to 10 μm. Cyanobacteria gave rise to the chloroplasts of eukaryotic algae and also land plants, and they share many features such as the ability to drive photosynthetic water photolysis and thereby contribute to the production of both atmospheric oxygen and reduced organic carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms that can convert solar energy to chemical energy with efficiency of 10 to 50 times greater than terrestrial plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Algae have far higher cell growth rates than plants and, therefore, have much smaller footprints for land required for producing energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Many microalgae are rich in oil especially under nitrogen-starved condition, which can be converted to biodiesel using existing technology. The productivity of these photosynthetic microorganisms in converting CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon-rich lipids, only a step or two away from biodiesel, significantly exceeds that of agricultural oleaginous crops, without competing for arable land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. They require aquatic environments that may vary from freshwater to seawater. Not only do these organisms fix CO<sub>2</sub>, but they also have the potential to be used for the production of inexpensive bulk chemicals, because the major inputs to the system (light and CO<sub>2</sub>) are essentially free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Microalgae cells contain approximately 50% of carbon, in which 1.8 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> is fixed by producing 1 kg of microalgae biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Recent studies have reported that <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp., <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp., and <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> are among the microalgae strains that have shown promising result to bio-mitigate O<sub>2</sub> emission with typical CO<sub>2</sub> consumption rate of 200 to 1,300 mg/L/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Successful commercial utilization of microalgae has been established in low-volume, high-value derivatives such as nutritional supplements, antioxidants, cosmetics, natural dyes, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">In the case of plants, it is frequently found that metabolite pools exist in more than one location or that the subcellular location of one or more reactions is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Entire sections of metabolic pathways like glycolysis are duplicated between organelles, particularly the plastid and cytosol, with both being potentially active and carrying flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The simplest way is to examine metabolites which are formed in only one of the compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Another method involves the fraction of cellular material prior to metabolite analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Unfortunately, even with the supplemental information provided by analyzing compartment-specific metabolites, it may still be difficult to statistically distinguish different configurations of the metabolic map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In the present article, we focus on the typical photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae and cyanobacteria and attempted to make a review on the metabolic regulation, metabolic engineering, and process development with efficient operation for the production of biofuels and chemicals to understand the current status and expect future perspectives.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Candidate photosynthetic microorganisms for biofuel production</title><p id="Par14">Perhaps the most comprehensive evaluation of algal species has been orchestrated by the US Department of Energy’s Aquatic Species Program (ASP) to develop microalgae as a source of biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Over 3,000 strains of microalgae have been isolated from ponds and seas. Cellular oil content varies with growth phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The cells of the chlorophyte microalga <italic>Parietochloris incise</italic> synthesize almost twice as many triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the stationary phase than in the exponential growth phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although microalgae have a high level of biodiversity, only a few species can be subjected to genetic manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The algae with the best developed genetic toolbox are the unicellular green microalgae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is a well-established model organism for the study of various cellular processes such as photosynthesis, flagella, starch metabolism, and photobiological production of hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Like many other algal species, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> can accumulate significant amount of oil when subjected to unfavorable environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> has proven to be a useful model organism to study the improvement of biodiesel production by microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It is unicellular and stays as haploid during most of its life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], thus it is particularly useful in the context of a forward genetic approach, because the mutant phenotype can be observed during the first generation and does not need to reach a diploid homozygous stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The freshwater green microalgae <italic>P incise</italic> enhances not only its production of TAG under nitrogen starvation but also the production of arachidonic acid, a valuable nutraceutical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Green algae including <italic>Spirogyra</italic> sp. and <italic>Chlorococum</italic> sp. have been shown to accumulate high levels of polysaccharides both in their complex cell walls and as starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This starch can be used for bioethanol production. Bioethanol production from algae shows significant potential due to their low percentage of lignin and hemicelluloses as compared to other lignocellulosic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are also able to directly produce biohydrogen through photofermentation in an anaerobic process involving oxidation of ferredoxin by the hydrogenase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Many species of macroalgae are known to have high levels of carbohydrate, although in many cases these carbohydrates consist of galactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Recent research has shown that the red algae <italic>Gelidium amansii</italic> and the brown algae <italic>Laminaria japonica</italic> are both a potential biomass source for biohydrogen production through anaerobic fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

The algal photosynthesis is at least able to convert approximately 5% to 7% of incident light energy to biomass, where a systems-based approach to understand the stresses and efficiencies associated with light energy harvesting, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and carbon partitioning is necessary to make headway toward improving photosynthetic yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The cell growth conditions are roughly classified as <italic>autotrophic</italic> condition for the case of using only CO<sub>2</sub> under light condition, <italic>mixotrohphic</italic> condition for the case of using both carbohydrate and CO<sub>2</sub> under light condition, and <italic>heterotrphic</italic> condition for the case of using carbohydrate under dark condition. Although autotrophic condition is preferred from the environmental protection point of view using only CO<sub>2</sub> as a carbon source, the cell growth rate is significantly low, and thus the productivity of the metabolic products is low.</p><p id="Par18">The atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is fixed either by C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis where the three carbon molecule such as 3-phosphogrycerate (3PG) is used as the product of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO) reaction or by C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis where four carbon molecule such as oxaloacetate (OAA) is used as the product of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (Ppc) reaction followed by the decarboxylation at malic enzyme (Mez) from malate yielding pyruvate. The C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be created by evolution from ancestral C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis during a global decline in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The C<sub>4</sub> pathway will have higher efficiency than the C<sub>3</sub> pathway in CO<sub>2</sub> fixing with which they consume water and nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Since CO<sub>2</sub> fixation is attractive from the environmental protection point of view, several strategies have been considered for the efficient carbon fixation for the cell synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], where carbon fixation can be enhanced by amplifying carboxysome expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] or heterologous expression of RubisCO gene <italic>rbcLS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The CO<sub>2</sub> fixation can be also enhanced by a hybrid RubisCO, which contains both plant and microalgae subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The green organisms such as plants and algae gain energy via aerobic respiration, and the metabolism changes depending on the oxygen availability. The green organisms are exposed to a variety of oxygen availability in the environment that may vary from fully aerobic state (normoxia) to oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) or the anaerobic condition (anoxia). In the context of recent climate change, excess rainfall and frequent flooding may cause the green cells subjected to hypoxia or anoxia condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP, while under hypoxia and anoxia conditions, the small amount of ATP is generated through glycolysis, and NAD(P)H must be reoxidized by the fermentative pathways. Under oxygen-limiting condition, the glycolysis flux is accelerated by the so-called ‘Pasteur effect’, and plant metabolism uses pyruvate to direct towards ethanolic and lactic fermentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

Photosynthesis reactions such as light reactions, CBB cycle, and starch synthesis occur in chloroplasts. Algae and plant cells have subcellular compartments such as chloroplast, mitochondria, and cytoplasm. After the export of GAP from the chloroplast to cytoplasm, the carbon flow is divided into the sugar synthesis pathway or the glycolytic pathway to form pyruvate. Sugars such as sucrose are the major storage products in the cytoplasm of plant cells.

The potential of using co-solvent mixtures of ionic liquids and polar covalent molecules has been shown for lipid extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. The Soxhlet extraction method uses hexane, while the Bligh and Dyer’s method uses mixture of chloroform and methanol as solvents to extract lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. The other solvents include benzene and ether, but hexane has gained more popularity as a chemical for solvent extraction, and it is also relatively inexpensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. Although n-hexane is widely used to extract oil from various seed crops, it is inefficient to extract microalgae lipid. This is because microalgae lipid contains high concentration of unsaturated fatty acid, while n-hexane is a nonpolar solvent. Thus the selectivity of lipid towards the solvent is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. Methanol and n-hexane are not sustainable, since both solvents are conventionally derived from nonrenewable fossil fuels. On the other hand, ethanol is a greener solvent, since it has a low toxicity level and can be derived from renewable source such as sugar-based plant (e.g., sugar cane and sweet sorghum) and lignocellulosic material (e.g., weed and corn stover) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. The ethanol, however, gives low extraction efficiency. Ultrasonication and microwave can be also used for cell disruption. The cell wall-less mutant is better for oil extraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Super critical fluid extraction</title><p id="Par72">Several supercritical fluids are CO<sub>2</sub>, ethane, methanol, ethanol, benzene, toluene, and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>]. The basic principle of this technology is by achieving a certain phase (supercritical) that is beyond the critical point of a fluid, in which meniscus separating the liquid and vapor phase disappears, leaving only a single homogeneous phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>].

In fact, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> offers several advantages in comparison with chemical solvent extraction such as (1) nontoxic and provide nonoxidizing environment to avoid degradation of extracts, (2) low critical temperature (around 31°C) which prevents thermal degradation of products, (3) high diffusivity and low surface tension which allow penetration of pores smaller than those accessible by chemical solvents, and (4) easy separation of CO<sub>2</sub> at ambient temperature after extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Transesterification of oils</title><p id="Par73">The most suitable catalyst for transesterification of oils with low free fatty acids (FFA) content is necessary.

Alkaline metal alkoxides, even in small concentration of 0.5 mol %, are highly active catalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. Metal alkoxides (e.g., potassium methoxide) in methanol are better options than metal hydroxides (NaOH, KOH). In a short reaction time of about 30 min, they give high yields of about 98% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. They performed better in absence of water, which makes them inappropriate for industrial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>]. FFA will react with base catalyst to form soap leading to lower biodiesel yield and increase the difficulty to separate biodiesel from glycerol.</p><p id="Par74">Acid catalyst (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is not sensitive towards FFA level in oil, and thus esterificaiton (FFA is converted to alkyl ester) and transesterification can occur simultaneously. A chemically catalyzed transesterification process requires a high amount of energy, and separation of catalyst from the product is cost effective. Glycerol, produced as a byproduct of alcoholysis, readily adheres to the surface of immobilized lipase and decreases its enzyme activity, where glycerol removal is a complex process, which may hinder the large-scale operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Free fatty acids contained in extracted oil have to be removed prior to reaction in order to maintain activity of the alkaline catalysts. In the superheated method, free fatty acid and triglycerides are converted to fatty acid methyl ester directly. Academic and commercial enterprises have realized the importance of such research on this topic, and a direct transesterification method for total microalgal lipid content has produced appreciable levels of biodiesel even when there are undetectable levels of neutral lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>]. The advantages of non-catalytic alcoholysis reaction for the production of biodiesel are as follows: (1) the purification process to remove catalyst after reaction is not required, (2) the by-product (glycerol) can be directly utilized in other industry, (3) not only the triglycerides but also the free fatty acid might be converted into fatty acid methyl ester, (4) neutralization process for removal of free fatty acid is not required prior to the reaction process, and (5) the yield of the total system will be improved, and the cost required for the process will be reduced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Improvement of product recovery</title><p id="Par76">In a large-scale operation, the presence of microorganisms, medium composition, and process condition may cause emulsion formation, which lowers the product recovery efficiency.

The rising of sea level caused by green-house gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) also threatens the most populated areas of the world. It is important to find a safe alternative fuel to relieve the escalating energy crisis and to protect the environment. Photosynthetic microorganisms have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production.</p><p id="Par78">Although algae and cyanobacteria have been paid recent attention from the point of view of sustainable biosynthesis as well as biofuel and biochemical production, the cell growth rate is significantly lower as compared to the typical biofuel-producing microorganisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast. It is, therefore, strongly desirable to design microbial cell factories by means of a synthetic biology approach with in-depth understanding of the metabolic regulation mechanism with the aid of a systems biology approach such as modeling.</p><p id="Par79">Several attempts are being made for improving the efficiency of capturing light energy and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation as mentioned before. One of the reasons of the lower cell growth rate in cyanobacteria may be due to an incomplete TCA cycle lacking KGDH and succinyl CoA synthetase (SCS). Recent investigation on <italic>Synecococcus</italic> sp. PCC7002 indicates that the genes encoding αKG decarboxylase (or 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase are present, where NADPH instead of NADH is produced without producing guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by substrate level phosphorylation (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>].
