In the context of recently established carbon peak and carbon neutralization targets, this paper put forward the main problems associated with the green and low-carbon development and utilization of coal. Five key technological innovation directions in mining were proposed, including green coal development, intelligent and efficient mining, low-carbon utilization and conversion of coal, energy conservation and emission reduction, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Focusing on the above technological innovation directions, it is suggested to carry out three basic theories, including the theory of green efficient intelligent mining, clean and low-carbon utilization and transformation of coal, and CCUS. Meanwhile, it is proposed to develop 12 key technologies, including green coal mining and ecological environment protection, efficient coal mining and intelligent mine construction, key technologies and equipment for efficient coal processing, underground coal gasification and mining, ultra-high parameter and ultra-supercritical power generation technology, intelligent and flexible coal-fired power generation technology, new power cycle coal-fired power generation technology, the development of coal-based special fuels, coal-based bulk and specialty chemicals, energy conservation and consumption reduction, large-scale and low-cost carbon capture, CO<sub>2</sub> utilization and storage. Finally, necessary measures from the governmental perspective were also proposed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Carbon neutralization</kwd><kwd>Technological innovation</kwd><kwd>Clean utilization of coal</kwd><kwd>Clean transformation of coal</kwd><kwd>CCUS</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Energy strategy (2035), a consulting project of Chinese Academy of Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2019-ZD-20-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Quansheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>China Coal Society, co-published with Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>25</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40789_2021_Article_458.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Fossil Fuels (incl.

Although industrialization has enabled tremendous progress in human society for more than two hundred years, it has also caused severe environmental damage and high amount of carbon emissions. The estimated total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the combustion of fossil fuels has reached 2.2 trillion tons. The global average temperature has risen by 1.1 °C since 1906, and if the trend continues the commonly discussed 2 °C threshold will be exceeded in the middle of this century if still following this trend. Climate change has already become a global non-traditional security issue.</p><p id="Par3">The Paris Agreement adopted at the Paris Climate Conference in late 2015 established a new mechanism for international climate governance after 2020, and proposed the goal of controlling global temperature rise not to exceed 2 °C and striving to control it below 1.5 °C, to protect the ecological security of the earth. However, the global response to climate change is still facing an urgent situation, and the targets of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) set by each country are far from the reality (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">b</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">For a long time, China has actively participated in and led global climate governance, incorporating the tasks of reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the National Five-Year Plan and medium and long-term development strategic goals. In terms of emission reduction policies, China's energy conservation and emission reduction actions have yielded remarkable results through a series of measures such as adjusting industrial structure, optimizing energy structure, improving energy efficiency, establishing a carbon trade market, and increasing carbon sink (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). In 2019, China's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP (carbon intensity) decreased by 48.1% compared with 2005, and non-fossil energy accounted for 15.3% of total energy production.

The overall layout of “five in one” has been steadily advanced, and the five development concepts of “innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing” have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. On September 22, 2020, President Jinping Xi made a solemn promise at the 75th United Nations General Assembly: China's carbon dioxide emissions will peak by 2030 and strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Subsequently, at the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit on December 12, 2020, President Jinping Xi further put forward clear indicators and requirements for China's response to climate change, in which China will be guided by new development concepts, to promote a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development while fostering high-quality development, and down-to-earthly to fulfill the peak of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and strive to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, which make greater contributions to the global response to climate change (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The 2020 Central Economic Work Conference emphasized the need to successfully achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets, formulate an action plan for carbon emissions peaking by 2030, accelerate the adjustment and optimization of the industrial structure and energy structure, promote peak coal consumption as soon as possible while vigorously developing new energy sources, and improve the dual control system of energy consumption. The proposal of this series of goals is of great strategic significance, which demonstrates China's commitment to tackling climate change, and indicating the direction for its low-carbon energy transition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>China's energy consumption structure and carbon emissions</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>China's energy production and consumption structure</title><p id="Par7">In 2019, China's total national energy consumption was 4.86 billion tons of standard coal, a year-on-year increase of 3.3%.

The sources of carbon dioxide emissions included fossil energy combustion, industrial processes, forest and land use changes, agriculture, etc. The carbon dioxide emissions caused by fossil energy combustion was absolutely dominant, accounting for about 85% (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">b</xref>) (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Greenhouse gas emission structure</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40789_2021_458_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Carbon dioxide emission source</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40789_2021_458_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">In 2019, China's carbon emissions from fossil energy consumption were 9.8 billion tons, accounting for 28.8% of global carbon emissions, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. This corresponds to an increase of 3.4% year-on-year compared to 2018, and 6 times the global average growth rate of emissions (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>).China's carbon dioxide emission intensity per unit of GDP was 8.4 tons/10,000 US dollars, which were 8.3 times, 7.4 times, 5.1 times, and 3.2 times those of France (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>), the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States, respectively.

China's proven coal reserves are about 1.67 trillion tons, accounting for 96% of its fossil fuel reserves. According to the “Research on China's Coal Clean, Efficient and Sustainable Development and Utilization Strategy” by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, it is estimated that by 2030, coal will account for 50% of China's primary energy structure. Thus, in the medium to long term, coal is expected to remain China's main energy source. Under the goal of carbon neutrality, realizing the safe, efficient, green, and low-carbon development and utilization of coal through technological and management innovation is of great significance to guarantee hina's energy security and high-quality economic development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Key problems in the green and low-carbon development and utilization of coal</title><p id="Par14">At the 6th meeting of the Central Leading Group of Finance and Economics, June 3, 2014, President Jinping Xi pointed out that: the large-scale development and utilization of coal has brought two major problems. One is that coal development destroys groundwater and surface ecology, the other is air pollution and high carbon emissions caused by coal utilization. These problems are embodied in the following three aspects.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Coal development severely damages water resources and the ecological environment</title><p id="Par15">China’s water resources and coal resources are inversely distributed. The coal reserves and output of the five western provinces and regions account for more than 70% of the country’s total amount, but water resources account for only 3.9% of the country’s total. Furthermore, coal mining generates large quantities of mine water. At present, about 5 billion cubic meters of mine water is not effectively used wach year, which is equivalent to 50% of China’s annual industrial and civil water shortage. Coal mining can also cause surface subsidence and vegetation degradation. The annual land damage area due to coal mining is about 7.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> hm<sup>2</sup>, while the surface ecological restoration rate remains less than 30% (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). Therefore, the contradiction between coal development and ecological environment protection is acute, and the negative externality on the environment is prominent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Unreasonable approaches to coal development and high energy consumption of coal production</title><p id="Par16">Under the existing technical conditions, the amount of coal resources (referred to as “green coal resources”) available for safe and efficient ecological development in China is relatively small, only 5.05 × 10<sup>11</sup> tons, accounting for about 10% of the national coal resources. Green coal resources can be mined for only 40–50 years (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>). With the exception of some mines in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang and other provinces, where mining conditions are slightly better, the mining conditions in other coal fields are more complicated. At present, numerous problems have emerged during the development of large-scale coal production bases. The disorderly development of large-scale coal production bases has not only caused large-scale overcapacity, but also seriously jeopardized the economic benefits of the coal industry. At the same time, this has also caused China's high-quality resources to be occupied, consumed, and wasted too quickly.</p><p id="Par17">Simultaneously, China’s coal production also has problems with high amount of energy consumption. More attention should be devoted to output and safety, energy conservation, and scientific energy-saving indicator constraints to reduce the high energy consumption of coal production in China. The development of stand-alone technology should be pursued to continuously improve the installed capacity and operating efficiency of stand-alone machines, resulting in conservative design and selection standards and excessive wealth coefficient. Insufficient attention has been paid to the modern mining system and supporting equipment of coal mines, with little accounting for the energy consumption per ton of coal mined during the operation phase, and no clear requirements for energy efficiency, resulting in substantial energy waste.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Low energy efficiency and high emissions of coal utilization</title><p id="Par18">As a high-carbon energy source, coal will inevitably bring about carbon emissions during the process of utilization. China’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are much higher than those of developed countries, and its total emissions now rank first in the world. The energy conversion efficiencies of key coal-consuming industries such as power, steel, and building materials still lag behind the international advanced levels.</p><p id="Par19">In the power industry, the coal consumption for power supply was 374 gce/kWh in 2005 and has decreased to 312 gce/kWh by 2016. The coal consumption for power supply by the most advanced generating sets reached 276 gce/kWh, which is in line with global state-of-art levels, but the overall energy efficiency still has room for improvement. Subcritical coal-fired generating units in China's thermal power industry still account for about 70% of the total installed capacity, resulting in a low overall energy efficiency of coal-fired power generation in China. In advanced countries, coal-fired power generation is mainly supercritical and ultra-supercritical. There is still a huge gap between the overall energy efficiency level in China and the advanced level of 275 gce/kWh in developed countries.</p><p id="Par20">Coal consumption by the iron and steel industry, a key energy-consuming sector in China, accounts for approximately 19% of total coal consumption. In 2016, the average comprehensive energy consumption per ton of steel dropped to 572 kg of standard coal for steel association member companies, which is close to the advanced level of comprehensive energy consumption in the international steel industry.
