But the commercialization of microalgae based product is difficult due to its high processing cost and low productivity. Higher accumulation of these molecules may help to cut the processing cost. There are several reports on the use of various omics techniques to improve the strains of microalgae for increasing the productivity of desired products. To effectively use these techniques, it is important that the glycobiology of microalgae is associated to omics approaches to essentially give rise to the field of algal glycobiotechnology. In the past few decades, lot of work has been done to improve the strain of various microalgae such as <italic>Chlorella</italic>, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Botryococcus braunii</italic> etc., through genome sequencing and metabolic engineering with major focus on significantly increasing the productivity of biofuels, biopolymers, pigments and other products. The advancements in algae glycobiotechnology have highly significant role to play in innovation and new developments for the production algae-derived products as above. It would be highly desirable to understand the basic biology of the products derived using -omics technology together with biochemistry and biotechnology. This review discusses the potential of different omic techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to improve the yield of desired products through algal strain manipulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">The term ‘glycobiotechnology’ term was coined to define an interdisciplinary research area that provided a classical understanding of the structure-function relationships of glycoconjugates. Here, glycoconjugates majorly refers to the interaction of complex carbohydrates with proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids) and also covers various glycosylated structures including hormones, antibiotics, proteoglycans and other metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Glycoconjugates play an important role in inter- and intracellular communication. The study of these glycoconjugates is popularly known as glycomics, which is a subset of glycobiology and explains how a diverse structure of the glycan participates in biochemical processes. Glycobiotechnology is well described in various eukaryotes such as vertebrates, plants and insects, however, very few studies have been undertaken to investigate the glycobiotechnology in algae.</p><p id="Par3">Algae and cyanobacteria represent a polyphyletic group that includes numerous species such as blue-green algae (<italic>Arthrospira, Synococcous</italic>), chlorophytes or green algae (<italic>Chlorella, Chlamydomonas</italic>) and heterokonts (diatoms). The diversity of algae results in extraordinary pathways offering large possibilities for the production of value added compounds such as pigments, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, lipids, biofuels and biopolymers which attract the interest of industries towards algae. Recently, many algal species have received industrial attention because of their capability to produce long chain fatty acids [Poly unsaturated fatty acids, (PUFA), omega-3- fatty acid], chlorophyll, carbohydrates, vitamins and other pigments like astaxanthin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] enabling extensive applications in the food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. In the last decade, the number of scientific publications on microalgae applications has increased from 410 to 3193 (increase of more than 678%). The exponential increase in publications on ‘microalgae application’ from 2010 to 2020 proves that researchers and industries are attracted towards the utilization of microalgae. Further reasons for the choice of algae include its fast growth rates or industrial growth rates, and sustainable production of fine chemicals and biofuels. In addition, algae are attractive expression systems for the sustainable bioproduction of a range of high value products (therapeutic proteins, pharmaceuticals etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, algae have the ability to tolerate wide range of environmental stress.</p><p id="Par4">Strain improvement in algae is becoming a promising strategy for the industries to increase the production of high market value products. Generally, industries use random mutagenesis and spontaneous mutation followed by intelligent screening process to construct an improved strain with desired properties. In the past, increasing production of the target molecule(s) was achieved using traditional techniques such as media manipulation, cultural techniques, improved downstream and extraction processes and, random mutagenesis by physical, chemical and ultraviolet methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In several cases, metabolic engineering have been successful for the strain improvement however, strain improvement of algae through metabolic engineering is still at an early stage and requires substantial development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this regard, the use of ‘omics’ approaches (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics) will provide an in-depth understanding of the underlying biological processes (especially glycobiology) in algae that will provide new opportunities for algal strain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Studies on the distribution of glycoconjugates such as lectin binding sites and lectin receptors at the algal cell surfaces would be highly relevant in this regard.</p><p id="Par5">Algal glycobiology relates with the understanding broadly of structural and functional relationships of carbohydrates (and their derivatives), which are critical for the biological processes such as cellular and molecular and communications, governing the malfunction to control the disease and immunity and other aspects of developmental biology. From this point of view, via glycomics the complex information is conveyed by these biomolecules. Thus, the understanding the molecular mechanisms of the algae-derived products are critical. It is hoped that -omics studies will be helpful in providing the insights towards understanding the metabolic functions and possible solutions for developing algal biorefinery.</p><p id="Par6">The advancements in algae glycobiotechnology have highly significant role to play in innovation and new developments for the production algae-derived products. It would be highly desirable to understand the basic biology of the products derived using -omics technology together with biochemistry and biotechnology. This would need screening and characterization of biomolecules employing -omics tools to reconstruct the metabolic pathways and remodeled process engineering to produce the products in high titers with desired properties. The cost of production will also be an important aspect. Such approaches on cellular and molecular mechanisms of algae-derived products are expected to result in efficient algal cell factories.</p><p id="Par7">The benefits of algal strain improvement can be better understood through some recent advancements and applications. For instance, it is known that the cost of biofuels produced from algae is high as compared to petroleum due to its high processing cost which indicates that further improvements are required to make it economically feasible with provision forscale-up.The main reasons for this have primarily been low biomass and low lipids yields by the algal cultures explored.To increase the cell biomass and lipid contents in algae cell, metabolic and genetic engineering have been considered useful to target the pathways for triggering specific enzymes and modify specific genes appropriately to achieve the desired products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For instance, <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> can be metabolically engineered by the overexpression of glycerol-3-phosphate acycltransferase 2 enzyme isoform in the algae for increasing the lipid content while decreasing the carbohydrate and protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was reported that 2.9-folds increase in triacylglycerides (preferred feedstock for biofuel) can be achieved as compared to glycolipids. In another investigation, the over expression of Acetyl-CoA (ACS) gene in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> increased the lipid content by 6-foldsas compared to the natural strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. ACS and malonyl-CoA are the two desirable enzymes for lipid production that convert acetate to acetyl-CoA which is an important molecule in lipid synthesis. Apart from biofuels, the production of astaxanthin (a keto-carotenoid pigment) can also be enhanced by altering the algal glycobiology through strain manipulation.</p><p id="Par8"><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Workflow of analysis of glycoconjugates in microalgae via omics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12934_2021_1656_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Astaxanthin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity and also shows therapeutic potential against Alzheimer, Parkinson, cancer and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Astaxanthin pigment is commonly produced by <italic>Haematococcus pluvial</italic> strain, cyanobacteria <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. (which is a prokaryote) does not express β-carotene gene naturally, and responsible enzyme has been engineered using DNA from <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> through cpc560 and psbA2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Natural strain of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> is unable to produce pigments but after genetic engineering, this strain produced 1 mg/L/day astaxanthin in autotrophy and 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L/day in mixotrophy medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The biosynthesis of astaxanthin involves three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and one molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate which are combined by IPP isomerase and converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by GGPP synthase. In algae, for example in <italic>H. pluvialis </italic>the biosynthesis of astaxanthin was observed in a stoichiometric fashion but the interaction mechanism was not clear. Studies on the molecular mechanism for the pathways showed that there was inter-dependence at the transcriptional level and the interaction was feedback-coordinated at the metabolite level. The biosynthesis took place in the endoplasmic reticulum, involving some diacylglycerol acyltransferases, which catalyzed astaxanthin esterification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Glycogen and starch based metabolic pathways are responsible for the production of bioethanol in microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Altering these pathways can help produce high quantities and types of bioethanol. For instance, a prokaryotic strain of <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 strain was engineered with <italic>E. coli</italic> alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by y<italic>qh</italic>D gene) and ketoacid decarboxylase gene (<italic>Kiv</italic>D) for the production of isobutanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One another prokaryotic strain, <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. PCC6803 strain was also engineered by Varman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] by introducing two important genes, <italic>Kiv</italic>D and alcohol dehydrogenase (<italic>adh</italic>A gene), for the enhanced production of isobutanol.</p><p id="Par11">Many industrially important chemicals and biopolymers are also produced by algae.For example, the cyanobacteria, <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> UTEX 2973,was exploited for its fast growing nature and was expressed with <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 derived heterologous <italic>phaCAB</italic> gene to enhance polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biopolymer production. The recombinant cyanobacteria had the capability to produce 420 mg L<sup>–1</sup>of PHB in 10 days cultivation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The studies discussed above show that many metabolic pathways in algae can be engineered or manipulated through the -omics approach to increase the production of industrially valuable products. There is a lack of both comprehensive and critical analysis of -omics applications with correlation to algal glycobiotechnology. Therefore, in this review aims to discuss various-omics approaches for strain improvements for higher productivity of desired commodities while highlighting the fate of algal glycobiology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Omics approaches</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genomics</title><p id="Par13">Advancement in omics technologies, metabolic engineering and system biology has pushed the idea of algal application as microbial cell factories to the forefront. Algae are highly diverse group of aquatic organisms and therefore produce diversity of bioproducts. Recent advances in genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics has made algae a “multi-use feedstock” with application in nutraceuticals, biofuel, material science and biomedical fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Genomics analysis provides information about biosynthetic and metabolic capabilities of algae and therefore gives a blueprint for enhancing its productivity as cell factories. Next generation sequencing technologies have made sequencing economic and reliable. Genome mining of algal strains has identified novel biosynthetic gene clusters for production of diverse compounds with application in biomedical and industrial microbiological arena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Variation in gene and functionality can be examined by intra- and inter-species comparison using comparative genomics.</p><p id="Par14">Algalomic technologies have been prominently used for biofuels. Algal oil particularly triacylglycerides are precursors for conversion into biodiesel and therefore algal lipids serving as feedstock for biodiesel are subjected to intensive investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The first complete genome sequence was of model algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> that was published in 2007 and subsequent sequencing of organellar and whole genome served as a base for functional annotation of lipid biosynthetic genes in microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Whole genome sequencing has helped in transferring knowledge of pathways and protein from animal, plant fungi and bacteria to algae. Adaptation of reference algae such as <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> at genetic and molecular level has been experimentally characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Development of a genetically engineered strain for higher efficiency in primary production and production of renewable energy requires comprehensive understanding of genetics and molecular biology. It has been pointed out that even though algae were utilized for the production of high value product; their greatest potential is in conversion of solar energy into chemical energy with low net carbon emission. Biocrude production from microalgae was established but was energetically expensive in comparison to conventional extraction of fossil fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although conventional strategies are available which could provide satisfactory result for strain improvement, genetic modification can provide rapid and substantial results for biocrude production. Incorporation of beneficial traits into producer strain requires comprehensive knowledge of algal biology which will help to conduct target optimization of the trait. It is important to understand that the algal gene regulation is also important to perform efficient and skillful manipulation. Library of algal genome has been expanded but is of limited use before systemic mapping, curation and annotation of genomes, as it consumes much more time than sequencing. Genome sequencing and analysis is important to understand and comprehend microalgal systems. Algae have huge diversity compared to which the available genome sequences are much smaller in number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Many genetic tools have been added to the catalogue to improve the efficiency of algae for industrial purposes. Initial reports of genome editing in microalgae used Zinc Finger Nuclease for editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Diatom <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> was engineered using magnanuclease and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) for enhancement in lipid accumulation. Gene UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was disrupted which resulted in 45 fold increase in accumulation of triacylglycerol, engineering of such enhanced lipid producing strain highlights the power of genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. TALEN technique was used to knock out gene encoding for urease enzyme, PCR was used to detect knockout cassette in urease gene, western blot was used to detect absence of urease protein in mutant cell line and untargeted metabolomics was used to access the build-up of urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Genomics helps in predicting metabolism in algae and therefore reduces wet lab work. Information provided by genome sequencing can be employed in strategies for metabolic engineering. System biology giving leads for improvement in strain based on understanding of the metabolism, is dependent upon the data from omics-technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Flux balance analysis which is used to study the biochemical network requires reconstructed network based upon genome sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Breadth of functional capabilities of algae can be understood by ecological niche and phenotypic diversity of genome. Algae possess three different genomes, a large nuclear genome, a plastid genome and a mitochondrial genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
