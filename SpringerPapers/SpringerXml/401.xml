Especially in micro forming, it is not only the geometry of the basic tool bodies that plays a role, but also their surface topology, since it can be used considerably to control the material flow. The determination of the permissible tolerances has so far been an only empirically solved problem, whereby the applied trial-and-error methods in the development of tool kits end up being costly in the tool development for new workpiece geometries. The method of tolerance engineering described in Sect. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-11280-6_2" ext-link-type="doi">2.5</ext-link> (Influence of tool geometry on process stability in micro metal forming) provides a remedy for this with regard to the scatter occurring as a result of the forming processes. In addition, the wear of the tools has to be taken into account, which is the topic in Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref> (Increase of tool life in micro deep drawing). In Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref> the various issues of tool wear are discussed, including the measurement and the results of the wear, which determine the tool life.
</p><p id="Par4">Knowledge about tool wear and protection methods like hard coatings (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref> for test results) are used to design forming tools. For the manufacture of tool elements, which have typical dimensions of some mm and feature sizes in the range of some 10 µm, both new and enhanced standard methods are applied. One new method is the 3D laser directed chemical etching (laser chemical etching, LCM). This method was initially used in a 2D variant for cutting thin sheet from delicate materials like nitinol. The control of the cutting depth is limited in these cases to ensure an appropriate cutting depth for complete material separation. 3D shaping makes proper control of the removal process in all three dimensions necessary. Section <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref> (Controlled and scalable laser chemical removal for the manufacturing of micro forming tools) introduces the process development towards a fast process for 3D removal without disturbances and a path planning method for optimized workpiece (i.e. tool) quality. One of the features of the process is the ability to generate sharp edges. Section <xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref> (Process behavior in laser chemical machining and strategies for industrial use) addresses one problem with the introduction of the LCM method into industrial use. While the process is very attractive to industry as it uses a low power cw laser instead of expensive ultra-short pulse lasers, there might be problems due to the usage of sulfuric acid or phosphorus acid as etchants. Therefore, alternative etchants like citric acid and others were tested and are presented in Sect. <xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref>. Section <xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref> also shows the feasibility of optimizing the cell layout for the process by FEM simulation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to design the cells for a laminar and homogeneous flow across the workpiece.</p><p id="Par5">While it is shown in Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref> that sound control of the overall geometry of the tool is possible using laser chemical etching, the control of the surface microstructure appears to be difficult with this method. Due to the fact that the surface structure plays an important role in the material flow in (micro) forming, two sections present results on that. The standard method of tool-making by milling was investigated in respect to the development of surface structures and their prediction and control by optimization methods. The results in Sect. <xref rid="Sec47" ref-type="sec">4.5</xref> (Flexible manufacture of tribologically optimized forming tools) show the structures that develop and how to predict the processing parameters, starting with the desired structure in an inverse optimization. One problem which had to be solved to master this inverse calculation was tool deflection by passive forces during cutting and tool wear during the milling process. Different tool wear models were tested and compared concerning accuracy and calculation time. Due to the small dimensions of the cutting tool, the deflection is much more pronounced than in conventional cutting. An additional size effect is the transition between the interaction modes of the tool and workpiece, i.e. ploughing or cutting appears, depending on the actual conditions. The related knowledge from Sect. <xref rid="Sec47" ref-type="sec">4.5</xref> was used in Sect. <xref rid="Sec59" ref-type="sec">4.6</xref> (Predictive compensation measures for the prevention of shape deviations of micromilled dental products) to optimize the milling of small free-form parts, i.e. dental prostheses. Like the work in Sect. <xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref>, also the work in Sect. <xref rid="Sec59" ref-type="sec">4.6</xref> was done together with industrial partners, having a discrete problem to be solved. This kind of knowledge transfer was also done in other work; see e.g. Sect. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-11280-6_2" ext-link-type="doi">2.4</ext-link> (Conditioning of part properties) and Sect. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-11280-6_5" ext-link-type="doi">5.3</ext-link> (Inspection of functional surfaces on micro components in the interior of cavities). The challenge in the work shown in Sect. <xref rid="Sec59" ref-type="sec">4.6</xref> was to develop a method for optimized tool paths independent from the actual machine tool.</p><p id="Par6">The second method for the control of the surface structure of tools was again a new method, which is elaborated in Sect. <xref rid="Sec64" ref-type="sec">4.7</xref> (Thermo-chemical-mechanical shaping of diamond for micro forming dies). It is well known that diamond coatings and solid diamond tools (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref>) are suited for forming, especially for aluminum alloys, therefore the surface structure of such tools is of interest. On the other hand, diamond surfaces are very durable and therefore difficult to machine. Starting from the assumption that chemical wear of diamond cutting tools is dominant when cutting iron parts, experiments were conducted to use the diffusion of carbon into iron as a measure for structuring the diamond surface. This work led to a method based on a mechanism with thermal, mechanical and chemical aspects. The mechanisms and the achievable structures in diamond surfaces are explained in Sect. <xref rid="Sec64" ref-type="sec">4.7</xref>.</p><p id="Par7" specific-use="web-only"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold> The editors and authors of this book like to thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (German Research Foundation) for the financial support of the SFB 747 “Mikrokaltumformen—Prozesse, Charakerisierung, Optimierung” (Collaborative Research Center “Micro Cold Forming—Processes, Characterization, Optimization”).

In order to achieve sufficient product quality, excessive tool wear has to be avoided. In the micro range, so-called scaling effects and their influence on tool wear in micro forming have not been investigated so far. For the investigation, tests in micro deep drawing were carried out with metal sheets (s &lt; 50 µm) of pure aluminum Al99.5, a copper alloy E-Cu58 and stainless steel 1.4301. The failure mechanisms of the micro cups produced were identified as bottom fracture and cup wall damage, and tool wear was measured and characterized with optical measurements and EDX analyses. Moreover, micro cups can be produced by DLC- and PVD-coated tools in a dry forming process. To investigate the wear behavior in a continuous process, a forming tool was developed with an integrated blanking and deep drawing die. The tool wear was measured optically, and the wear mechanisms could be identified in a combined micro and deep drawing process. As a result, the tool could be modified by a manufacturing in selective laser melting and the tool life increased by 290%. Furthermore, a method for tool wear examination in long-term tests was developed. In lateral micro upsetting, the tool wear history can be examined by analyzing the formed product. Several tool materials and coatings were tested with up to 500,000 strokes.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Keywords</bold> Deep drawing ∙ Micro forming ∙ Tool wear</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par11">A long tool life is an important requirement for cost-efficient mass production. The tool life defines how long the tool can be used in production, which determines the downtime and productivity. Wear mechanisms during macro forming experiments have been studied. However, experiments in the micro range revealed that so-called scaling effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">Vol08</xref>] influence the tool wear behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">Gei01</xref>]. Scaling effects comprise technical and physical properties that do not correlate linearly with a linear change of the tool geometry. In deep drawing experiments, the influence of scaling (1–8 mm punch diameter) was first analyzed by Justinger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">Jus07</xref>]. They determined that the tool size influences the friction. The results show that the friction increases with a decreasing punch diameter. In order to understand the wear mechanisms in this range, Manabe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">Man08</xref>] manufactured a combined blanking and deep drawing die. With this tool, circular blanks were cut in a first step and in the second step deep drawn to micro cups. These tests were performed as single tests as well as under static conditions. However, the dominant tool wear mechanisms and the influence on tool life in mass production have not been investigated so far.</p><p id="Par12">Thus, the goal of this work is to increase the tool life for cost-efficient mass production in micro deep drawing. First, the tool life is defined in simple micro deep drawing experiments. The tool life is determined by micro cup failures. To further analyze the tool, a setup is constructed that allows a continuous mass production of micro cups. A forming tool was manufactured with an integrated blanking and deep drawing die. In these long-term tests, the tool life was increased by the characterization of tool wear and the subsequent modification of the dies. Furthermore, a simple method was developed to determine exactly the tool life. In lateral micro upsetting, a wire is penetrated by a punch in a long-term test. As the tool geometry is reproduced on the formed wire, the tool wear history of the tool can be examined. This method allows a simple investigation of different tool materials and serves as a simplified method for the selection of the tool material.</p><p id="Par13">It is shown that the wear mechanisms in deep drawing depend on the microstructure, which also influences the tool life. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the tool can be modified according to the dominant wear mechanisms, which increases the tool life. The experiments also reveal that it is possible to substitute the deep drawing with a fast and economical lateral micro upsetting method to investigate tool wear mechanisms and the influence on tool life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Definitions</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Tool Life</title><p id="Par14">In this section, the tool life of micro deep drawing dies is defined by how long micro cups can be produced without cup failures. In deep drawing, there are two typical cup failures – bottom tears and wrinkle formations. These failures occur when the tool geometry or blank holder pressure is not chosen properly. Furthermore, the process conditions can be changed during the production as a result of tool wear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">Hu10</xref>]. If so, the friction between the tools increases, which leads to higher process forces and bottom tears. Another cup failure is cup wall damage, which can occur due to worn areas on the die radius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">Hu10</xref>]. In this case, the circular blank cannot be uniformly deep drawn, which results in a cup with non-uniform cup walls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Dry Forming</title><p id="Par15">Dry forming comprises forming technologies without using lubricants. For economic and geo-ecological reasons, it is important to use lubricant-free forming processes in future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">Vol18</xref>]. In the dry forming process, the friction is typically reduced by surface modifications like coatings and structures. Especially in the micro range, surface modifications have a great potential for efficient forming technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">Hu11a</xref>]. Due to scaling effects, the influence of lubrication is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">Vol08</xref>]. Another advantage of lubricant-free forming is that an additional process step can be omitted, because cleaning of the lubricated products is not necessary. Cleaning of micro parts is especially difficult because the surface tension of the lubricant is relatively high compared to the macro range, which leads to the adherence of the micro parts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Experimental Setups</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Reciprocating Ball-on-Plate Test</title><p id="Par16">A ball-on-plate test was applied to examine the friction coefficient of a sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">Hu11a</xref>].

Moreover, the punch force cannot be attributed to the wear behavior, as the punch force is influenced by different parameters separately. Therefore, a method was developed to investigate the wear behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">Sev18</xref>]. A lateral micro upsetting is used. The setup and process of the method is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4.4</xref>. A punch penetrates a wire with a defined forming depth and a measured forming force. Then the punch reverses. As this is a progressive process, the wire is fed by a feed system so that the punch can deform the wire in a continuous process with different strokes per minute. To ensure that the forming process is reducible, the wire is fed through the wire guide. Compared to the combined blanking and deep drawing process, the lateral micro upsetting can be built simply and fast, the sample can be attributed for each punch force, and the micro tools per test series are cheaper. This method is used for the wear examination of different tool materials and coatings in a continuous dry forming process.

Moreover, punches made of hard metal were coated with the materials AlTiN, TiSiN, TiN and AlCrN in a PVD process by Oerlikon Balzers.

In the micro range, the quality of the structure is more important with a highly dynamic, permanent load (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">4.2.6.2</xref>). Thus, the tool wear of ASP23 is lower. Hard metal has both a high hardness (1520 HV) and a fine structure, which results in lower tool wear. The PVD-coated hard metal punches, due to the improved hardness (2300–3500 HV), show the best wear behavior. In a comparison of the coated punches, it was found that a surface with a higher roughness leads to higher tool wear. Moreover, a high influence of the substrate is observed by testing a punch of HSS (800 HV) with the coating AlTiN (3300 HV). The coating is damaged due to eggshell effects, which leads to a strongly progressive wear and results in the highest tool wear of the coated punches.</p><p id="Par50">Analysis of the wire surfaces assumes that punch features are formed into the wire while penetrating the wire.

Hence, the punch is used in this experiment up to 200,000 strokes without any tool wear.

The tool geometry is reproduced on the wire with a forming accuracy below 1.5 µm. Thus, the tool wear history can be analyzed by every wire reproduction of each stroke, which allows the exact determination of the tool life. Furthermore, there are several advantages of measuring tool wear by analyzing the formed product instead of analyzing the tool itself. No stopping of the production is necessary, which leads to reduced downtimes, the accessibility on the formed product is better, and no positioning errors occur from dismounting and remounting the tool.</p><p id="Par54" specific-use="web-only"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold> The editors and authors of this book like to thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (German Research Foundation) for the financial support of the SFB 747 “Mikrokaltumformen—Prozesse, Charakerisierung, Optimierung” (Collaborative Research Center “Micro Cold Forming—Processes, Characterization, Optimization”).

However, profound understanding of the removal mechanisms as well as comparative studies with competing processes regarding quality and efficiency are still required to use this process, not only for 2D cutting but also for 3D removal and to further widen the industrial acceptance of the LCM process. For this reason, an analytical modeling to calculate the temperature distribution at the workpiece surface is developed. The spatial correlation with the resulting removal geometry makes it possible to determine the limit temperatures for a disturbance-free regime, as well as the boiling-related gas bubble formation and adhesion as the main cause for the occurring removal disturbances. Moreover, a closed-loop quality control based on inverse process models and an adaptive controller is designed to compensate the deviations of quality features of single or sequences of removals. Using post-production measurements, it is shown that the desired geometry can be achieved with shape deviations of 2.4 μm within only 3 pre-production steps. Furthermore, comparison of the machining quality with micro milling reveals that the LCM process is characterized by a high dimensional accuracy and sharp edge radii (11.2 ± 1.3 μm) especially for structure sizes &lt;200 μm. Besides, additional examples of LCM-manufactured micro forming tools in different materials are presented to prove the process flexibility and diversity. Thereby, the achieved removal velocities in LCM of up to 1.25 mm/min in self-passivating metals are found to be comparable with those obtained in electrochemical machining.</p><p id="Par57"><bold>Keywords</bold> Laser micro machining ∙ Predictive model ∙ Quality</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Process Fundamentals</title><p id="Par58">Laser irradiation is used in laser chemical machining as a localized and selective heat source that can induce a suitable thermal impact for the activation of a heterogeneous chemical reaction between a liquid environment and a metallic surface, and results in an anodic metal dissolution under the formation of hydrogen and water-soluble metallic salts following the chemical reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Bae11</xref>]:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>4.1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Despite the low generated electromotive forces (some 0.1 V for a temperature rise of 100 K), the electric field strengths are very high due to the small battery dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Bae11</xref>].

The latter mainly determines the removal speed within the aqueous electrolytes. Further, the convective flow also represents an important factor by determining the transport of reaction products as well as the provision and exchange of reactants. Increased convection can enhance the reaction rates by several orders of magnitude. At high laser intensities, electrolyte boiling can occur, resulting in the formation of vapor gas bubbles. In addition to Yavas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">Yav94</xref>], it has been reported that the bubbles formed result in removal disturbances that impede the controllability of the LCM process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">Meh13</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">4.20</xref> shows a schematic illustration of the effect of adhering boiling gas bubbles on the LCM process. Depending on its size and dynamics, the bubble affects the amount and distribution of the deposited laser energy differently. It can shield the workpiece surface against the electrolyte, resulting in a reduced material dissolution reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">Mes17a</xref>] and in the deposition of metallic salts and oxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">Eck17a</xref>]. However, the thermal impact due to the laser-workpiece interaction results in a lateral heat conduction towards the periphery, which explains partially the W-like removal profile. With increasing gas bubble size, the effect of light (total) reflection is assumed to increase too due to the transition from an optically dense medium (electrolyte) into an optically thinner medium (gaseous volume of gas bubble). The adhering bubble can act like a scattering center and deflect a part of the incoming laser beam to its periphery (light deflection effect). While the shielding effect results in a reduced removal depth and the deposition of metal salts and oxides, the light reflections lead to a broadening or a dislocation of the removal cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">Meh18</xref>].<fig id="Fig20"><label>Fig. 4.20</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LCM process with <bold>a</bold> disturbance-free removal and <bold>b</bold> disturbed removal caused by adhering boiling-related gas bubble</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig20_HTML.png" id="MO21"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>LCM Machines Concepts</title><p id="Par62">Depending on the production requirements, two LCM process variants are used.

This can be explained by the higher electronegativities of cobalt (63%) and chromium (25%), as the main elements in Stellite 21, in comparison with that of titanium. Higher electronegativity impedes the tendency to release electrons and thereby slows down the speed of the chemical reaction.</p><p id="Par69">Moreover, the formation of gas bubbles, which could be related to the chemical reaction and to the electrolyte boiling, is on the one hand dependent on the material used and on the other hand exerts a significant influence on the machining quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">Meh16b</xref>].

However, the background etching tends to get saturated at higher temperatures due to the fast consumption of reactants. In contrast, the laser-induced chemical machining results in a dependence on the parameters used in removal rates up to 50 µm/s.

Although different absorption coefficients, laser spot sizes and laser powers, the removal results show a strong dependence on the effective absorbed laser power <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>abs</italic></sub> as well as a negligible influence of the laser wavelength. The material removal is found to be scalable with the laser power <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> and the spot size <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>spot</italic></sub> following the quotient <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>/d</italic><sub><italic>spot</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">Mes17a</xref>]. Thereby, the disturbance-free removal in different materials such as titanium, stainless steel or cobalt-chromium alloys within a 5 molar phosphoric acid environment was ensured at <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>/d</italic><sub><italic>spot</italic></sub> between 20 and 50 mW/µm. The laser chemical machining of self-passivating metals takes place when a certain threshold laser power is applied. This was determined to be between 0.6 W and 0.7 W for LCM of titanium and stainless steel in a 5 molar phosphoric acid solution with a laser spot size of 30 µm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">Mes17a</xref>]. Once the material dissolution is initiated, the material removal increases linearly in width and depth with the laser power. This is characteristic of a disturbance-free removal, which is labeled by a bell-like profile. A further increase of the laser power (over the electrolyte boiling point) results in removal disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">Meh13</xref>]. These are characterized by cross-sectional W-like or curved zigzag 2D removal profiles, which are related first to the electrolyte boiling and second to the insufficient transport of reaction products, as well as the exchange of new reactants. Although reducing the processing quality, the removal rates in general continue to increase with the laser power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">Ste11</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">In addition, the feed velocity is also a key parameter in LCM process. Without consideration of the removal quality, it was shown that the removal depth decreases exponentially with the feed velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">Ste09a</xref>]. Based on this, only feed velocities of &lt;40 µm/s are used during the JLCM process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">Ste09a</xref>]. In contrast, a single scan with feed velocities &gt;100 µm/s leads, at suitable laser powers, to a non-visible material modification at the workpiece surface. However, the roughness peaks at the surface are chemically attacked and slightly removed. This is shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">Eck17b</xref>], where a reduction of the surface roughness in titanium was achieved after some 10 scan repetitions with a feed velocity <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>feed</italic></sub> = 2 mm/s. Thus, surface finishing can be realized with the combination of higher feed velocities and multi-scans. It has to be mentioned that an areal mean roughness <italic>Sa</italic> of about 0.1 µm could be achieved when first the roughness peaks were removed and subsequently the remaining isolated surface valleys were leveled. This usually necessitates a removal depth of some 10 µm, depending on the initial surface roughness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">Eck18</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">Furthermore, the influence of lateral overlapping should be considered for large-area LCM. Hauser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">Hau15</xref>] have shown that constant absorption conditions can be presumed only for the first removal path. Due to the changed surface topography, the removal in the following path is different. Enhanced absorption due to multi-reflections on the inner walls of the first path as well as higher electrolyte dynamics result in deeper removal in the subsequent path. Moreover, the suitable lateral overlapping is found to be dependent on the removal width of a single path and on the material used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">Mes18a</xref>]. Due to the Gaussian laser beam profile, the roughness <italic>Sa</italic> at the cavity ground is usually &gt;2 µm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">Mes17b</xref>]. This makes a subsequent finishing step necessary. Therefore, a two-step strategy with a roughing step based on single scans with velocities &lt;40 µm/s and a finishing step based on multi-scans with feed velocities &gt;50 µm/s is assumed to be the expedient approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">Mes18</xref>].

This will be discussed in more detail in Sect. <xref rid="Sec38" ref-type="sec">4.3.6</xref>.

To further increase the removal rates as well as the processing quality, the trend toward hybridized ECM is expected to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">Gup16</xref>]. This includes the combination of ECM with other processes such as electro discharge machining (EDM) or laser machining (LM). In the case of laser-assisted ECM, a laser beam of 100 to 300 µm in diameter is coupled in a coaxial arrangement to the electrolyte stream through a nozzle electrode with a diameter of 1 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">Paj06</xref>]. Due to the laser-assistance the removal rates of different metallic materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, nickel and titanium alloys, have been increased up to 50% in comparison to those obtained with ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">Sil11a</xref>]. Furthermore, Bäuerle has proved that an electrodeless ECM especially of metals within an electrolyte environment can be initiated by laser irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Bae11</xref>]. Thereby, the laser-induced temperature field can be generated by a localized thermobattery that allows a current flow within the metallic surface and can thereby change the electrochemical potential to the range of an anodic material dissolution. Based on this knowledge, laser chemical machining (LCM) was developed especially for the micro machining of metallic surfaces. A similar concept is used by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) to machine silicon-based photovoltaic elements. There, the laser beam is guided via total refection onto a liquid jet with a diameter of 30 to 80 μm generated in a nozzle with pressures up to 500 bar. Depending on the electrolyte solution, the laser heating or ablation can be combined with physical-chemical reactions such as etching, doping or deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">Kra08</xref>]. A different method uses wet-chemical-assisted laser ablation, in which semiconductors such as gallium nitride (GaN) are irradiated with a fs-laser in hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution in order to realize micro channels. Nakashima et al. have demonstrated that the processing in a liquid environment results in smooth structures with sizes of some 100 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">Nak09</xref>].</p><p id="Par147">LCM and ECM have quite similar mechanisms of dissolution and surface modification. These processes have the common feature that material removal is based on the chemical dissolution on an atomic scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">Meh16a</xref>]. In LCM the material removal is accomplished by the laser-induced chemical reaction between an electrolyte and the metallic surface of the workpiece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">Now94</xref>] and is mainly dependent on the laser-induced temperature distribution over the workpiece surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">Mes17a</xref>]. Besides, the thermophysical properties of the metallic material, the electrolyte characteristics (light absorption, concentration, flow direction and velocity, etc.) as well as the chemical reactivity of both are additional factors that influence the removal quality and rate. The influence of these factors is described in detail in Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref>. In general, laser chemical machining enables non-contact material processing using low laser power densities compared to the laser ablation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">Meh12</xref>]. Depending on the material-electrolyte combination, the material removal can be realized on the one hand by self-passivation or by means of an applied potential, resulting in a thin passivation layer. According to Nernst, the electrochemical potential is proportional to the temperature, and therefore to the laser power applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">Ste10</xref>].</p><p id="Par148">In Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref> the competitiveness of laser chemical machining (LCM) in comparison with electrochemical machining and micro milling for the manufacture of micro tools was demonstrated, especially for structures with dimensions &lt;200 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">Mes18</xref>]. Using thermal and closed-loop models, a profound understanding of the LCM removal mechanisms with the aim of avoiding removal disturbances has been developed. This opens up the opportunity for a predictable and controllable removal quality. However, the environmental aspects as well as the machine handling are still key aspects to consider prior to widespread industrial acceptance of the LCM process. For this reason, the use of alternative sustainable electrolytes frequently used in ECM, such as sodium-based solutions, is investigated and compared to the acidic etchants regarding the removal characteristics (width and depth) and quality. Furthermore, automation concepts for workpiece alignment, in-process removal control as well as fast and safe workpiece exchange are presented. In addition, fluid dynamic simulations are performed with the aim of improving the design of the chemical cells and to ensure a homogeneous electrolyte flow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par149">For the experimental investigations, self-passivating and technologically relevant (in the aerospace industry and medical technology) metallic materials, e.g. titanium (3.7024), stainless steel (1.4310), cobalt-chrome alloy Stellite 21 and the tool steel X100CrMoV8-2 (in hardened and tempered condition) were machined in different electrolyte solutions.

In Fig. <xref rid="Fig34" ref-type="fig">4.34</xref> it is shown that the first material removal, which is related to molten titanium, starts at laser powers of about 2.4 W. This removal is mainly the result of melt pool dynamics that throw out molten material from the center to the outer sides and is governed by temperatures that exceed the melting point of titanium (&gt;1668 °C). This can be explained by a sudden jump in the absorption coefficient by temperatures &gt;800 °C from 40% to &gt;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">Kwo12</xref>].</p><p id="Par154">Figure <xref rid="Fig35" ref-type="fig">4.35</xref> shows the resulting removal velocities <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rem</italic></sub> in titanium in dependence on the electrolyte used.

In accordance to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">Uen08</xref>], the removal is assumed to comprise intergranular penetration and grain dropping occurring by turns. In contrast, the laser-induced chemical removal using acidic aqueous solution, e.g. phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), results in much smoother surfaces without any significant intergranular corrosion effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig37" ref-type="fig">4.37</xref>, left). However, the resulting cavity geometry depends on the processing parameters used. At higher laser powers, removal disturbances can take place in the cavity center (Fig. <xref rid="Fig37" ref-type="fig">4.37</xref>, right).

One of these strategies is to increase the degree of automation with the aim of enabling more flexible and faster processing. Investigations have shown that the quality of laser chemical machined micro tools is highly dependent on the positioning and alignment of the semi–finished products in the processing room (chemical cell). A first approach to improve the reproducibility is to implement automatic workpiece positioning using image processing. Therefore, the position of the workpiece within the processing cell is detected by means of reference points and compared with the predetermined position of the CAD data and the path planning algorithm. The system determines the positioning error by using image processing techniques and permits automatic alignment of the ideal starting and workpiece position with an accuracy of &lt;1 µm with respect to the laser focal position. Thus, reproducible starting conditions for laser chemical machining can be ensured. This results in fewer parameter adjustments during processing and contributes to a reduced processing time.

Otherwise, changes of these parameters over time could affect the machining behavior and result in losses in quality (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig40" ref-type="fig">4.40</xref>). Several factors limit the economic efficiency of the process. The conventional removal rates enable the use of only low process speeds (some µm/s), which means long processing times. Furthermore, as sample changing is performed manually, both the machining precision and speed are affected. To avoid this related downtime and to ensure user-friendly and safe operation, the system design must be trouble-free and low-maintenance.

However, the increase of reaction rates is mainly accompanied by an increased formation of hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">Meh13</xref>]. In addition, it necessitates the use of higher laser powers that can induce high surface temperatures and result in electrolyte boiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">Sil11a</xref>].

For industrial use of LCM, these factors should be taken into account, as well as the electrolyte flow behavior. Investigations have shown that the geometry of the process cell could affect the flow behavior, induces turbulence and gas bubbles, and results in a reduced processing quality (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig42" ref-type="fig">4.42</xref>). Considering these factors, numerical fluid dynamic simulations (CFD) were performed to define a suitable cell geometry and electrolyte flow behavior.<fig id="Fig42"><label>Fig. 4.42</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Numerical fluid dynamic simulation of electrolyte flow within the process cell (half of the cell) before optimization</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig42_HTML.png" id="MO48"/></fig></p><p id="Par163">The CFD simulation results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig43" ref-type="fig">4.43</xref>.

These flow conditions can guarantee a constant electrolyte exchange and continuous transportation of the gas bubbles that emerge, and thereby a stable machining operation. Further, it is possible to reduce or expand the interior of the process cell depending on the workpiece size using inserts, as well as to set the electrolyte flow velocity by switching on or off the inlet and outlet channels with respect to the pump setting parameters.<fig id="Fig43"><label>Fig. 4.43</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Numerical fluid dynamic simulation of electrolyte flow within the process cell, (plan view above) electrolyte flow from inlet to outlet, (plan view below) flow distribution on workpiece surface, (cross-section) three cross-sections of flow distribution on workpiece surface</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig43_HTML.png" id="MO49"/></fig></p><p id="Par164" specific-use="web-only"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold> The editors and authors of this book like to thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (German Research Foundation) for the financial support of the SFB 747 “Mikrokaltumformen—Prozesse, Charakerisierung, Optimierung” (Collaborative Research Center “Micro Cold Forming—Processes, Characterization, Optimization”).

This comprises the extension of analytical process models to wear characteristics of milling tool for die making and micro-tribological investigations. These models allow us to derive optimized process parameters for the manufacturing process of tribologically optimized micro-forming dies by using the non-linear inverse problems method. These optimized forming dies exhibit micro-textured surfaces and have a distinct impact on the micro-contact conditions between the die and the work piece, and thus leads to a reduction in dry friction during the actual forming process.</p><p id="Par167"><bold>Keywords</bold> Surface ∙ Cutting ∙ Optimization</p><sec id="Sec48"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par168">Metal cutting is one of the most widely used methods to produce the final shape of manufactured products in macro dimensions [Alt00]. Therefore, its application for micro-parts is a logical step. However, due to size effects in the micro-regime, new challenges arise and need to be addressed for a successful application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">Vol10</xref>]. Serendipitously, size effects in metal cutting can also offer new opportunities. The inconsistencies in material removal when undershooting the minimum uncut chip thickness in micro-milling leads to the generation of regular micro-textures. These micro-textured surfaces have been shown to reduce friction in dry tribological contact, which can be explained by changes in the micro-contact conditions determining the predominant friction mechanisms. The transfer of micro-textured surfaces generated by micro-milling is seen to be one key steps towards the development of robust dry deep drawing processes. The concept of micro-forming dies exhibiting textured surfaces (e.g. generated by micro-milling) can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig44" ref-type="fig">4.44</xref>. However, identifying the most suitable textures offering minimum dry friction and finding the associated process parameter for their generation in micro-milling is not trivial.<fig id="Fig44"><label>Fig. 4.44</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Dry friction in a mold used for micro-cold forming</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig44_HTML.png" id="MO50"/></fig></p><p id="Par169">Process modeling can help to overcome these issues. In this work, a process model based on sweep volumes incorporating the continuous change from chipping to plowing is presented. This addresses the unique mixture of material removal mechanisms that allow for the manufacture of regular surface textures in hardened tool steel where the texture’s design is first of all determined by the process parameters feed per tooth and line pitch. Suitable process parameters for the manufacture of desired textured surfaces are identified by means of inverse simulation, while taking into concern inverse problems. Classic inverse problems identify the source of observed data. For example, in a computed tomography scan an image is reconstructed from a sinogram, which is the measured density via x-rays over multiple angles. One way to solve such an inverse problem is to use Phillips-Tikhonov-Regularization by minimizing a Tikhonov functional:<disp-formula id="Equ7"><label>4.7</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ7_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

It is not a finite element or volume method and it differs from these approaches. Its main components are models of the work piece, tool and the tool path. The tool moves along its tool path and a sweep volume is generated. This sweep volume and a model of the workpiece are used to calculate the material removal process and change of the workpiece itself. While this method can be applied in the macro scale (see the Chapter <italic>Predictive compensation measures for the prevention of shape deviations of mircomilled dental products</italic> for one example), it is extended to reproduce size effects in micro-scale. These size effects are the occurrence of plowing when undershooting the minimum uncut chip thickness, as well as a considerably increased cutting tool deflection. More detail into the model generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">Pio11</xref>], validation, and simulation process is given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">Veh15b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">Veh17a</xref>]. The process model focuses on the finishing step of micro-milling where the last layer of material is removed. This can be applied to all stages of micro-milling. Since size effects are most influential in the last finishing step, a macro model can be used for earlier stages to reduce computational effort and reduce computation times.</p><p id="Par180">The cutting tools used in milling process are also affected by the process. The wear of the tools alters the characteristics of produced surfaces. For micro-milling the shape of the cutter highly influences the surface quality. Progressive tool wear ultimately leads to a decrease in the quality of the work result. Once product specifications (which are the geometrical accuracy and the roughnesses of work pieces) can no longer be obtained, the milling tool will be replaced to provide the desired work result.</p><p id="Par181">In this section, a process model for micro-milling is outlined and the modeling of wear on the tool is explained. Further detail on how to find parameters with respect to wear are given, including how it can be integrated into the theory of inverse problems.</p><p id="Par182">Process Model</p><p id="Par183">The micro-milling process is modeled in three consecutive steps. The first step is the implementation of the process kinematics. The kinematic of a milling cutter is described by a composition of the rotational and translational motion of the tool. This composition describes how the tool is rotating around itself and moving along a given tool path. To account for dynamical changes occurring during the process, a dynamical force model is applied. This is accomplished with a system of ordinary differential equations. The model is presented in details in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">Pio11</xref>]. Moreover, it is assumed, that the reader is familiar with kinematics of the micro-milling process. If otherwise, refer for example to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Alt06</xref>].</p><p id="Par184">To obtain the surface, additional information is needed, such as the shape of the cutting tool, material and size of the workpiece and the material to be machined. Additionally, the material removal mechanism has to be included. For ball-end micro-scale machined surfaces, the minimum chip thickness has to be considered. This means that the chip formation is divided into three parts, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">Veh15b</xref>]. Below a certain minimum cutting depth, material is elastically deformed and thus no material is removed; that is, no chip is formed. Above a certain cutting depth, material is completely removed and the chip thickness is equal to the cutting depth. The third stage describes the transition between the former two stages. A visualization of the three different stages and its model are given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig46" ref-type="fig">4.46</xref> according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">Veh15b</xref>]. Because the cutting depth is different at all points of the milling tool and only cutting depth smaller than the tool radius are used for the last milling step, all three stages are constantly present. This results in micro-structures on the produced surface, depending on the process parameters.<fig id="Fig46"><label>Fig. 4.46</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Three stages of the micro-cutting process according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Ara09</xref>], and visualization of the function for the implementation of the chip removal in dependence on the cutting depth into the process model</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig46_HTML.png" id="MO56"/></fig></p><p id="Par185">The forward model generates a detailed map of the generated surface. Thus, it can be used to compare characteristics of surfaces from different input parameters. To allow a comparison of different surfaces and their tribological characteristics a characterization of the surface is needed.</p><p id="Par186">One way to compare surfaces is to divide deviations into six categories, as defined by DIN: 760:1982-06 from the Deutsche Institut für Normierung (DIN Standards). Deviations of the third and fourth categories describing the roughness of a surface are of special interest. This is further specified in DIN EN ISO 4287, where the so-called one-dimensional characteristics are defined. These include peak-to-valley value, median roughness, average roughness and more. These values are only statistical height parameters, whose calculation is based on every data point. Those parameters that do not include any information about the number of peaks, distribution of peaks and so on, are not sufficient for the application in this work.</p><p id="Par187">For a more precise classification, the Abbott-Firestone-Curve or bearing area curve can be used; some alternative procedures are introduced later in this chapter. The Abbott-Firestone-Curve describes the ratio of the surface at a given height and allows to compare surfaces and their properties. From a mathematical perspective, it is a cumulative probability density function of the surface’s profile height. For the rest of this chapter, it is assumed that all of the data are provided as bearing area curves.</p><p id="Par188">During the manufacturing process, the cutting tool wears out. This results in a change of the cutting tool shape, as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig47" ref-type="fig">4.47</xref>. The figure shows a ball-end cutting tool after use. Without wear, the front view would show a circle segment. In the top view (bottom two pictures) the white spots mark the wear. Due to the forces acting on the cutting tool during the manufacturing process, it starts to flatten out. A simple way to model this behavior is to flatten the tool shape over the time. A more accurate way is to consider the actual forces in each point and then model the material removal and deformation of the cutting tool. Two models for the wear over time are included. The first model uses a predefined wear depending on the time. The second model simulates the wear depending on the force applied on the cutting edges. The programming of the first model is less elaborate and it substantially reduces simulation time, whereas the second model is more accurate. To understand how wear of the cutting tool influences the process itself, use of the second model is advised. For ideal parameter identification and adjustment of process parameters during manufacturing, use of the first model is advised.<fig id="Fig47"><label>Fig. 4.47</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images of a cutting tool as an example of the wear on a ball-end tool</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig47_HTML.png" id="MO57"/></fig></p><p id="Par189">To identify the wear and exact shape of a cutting tool from a surface measurement, a parameter identification can be performed. This parameter-identification does not depend on the chosen model for wear on the cutting tool because no change in the wear is assumed. For measurements over a long time interval, separate parameter identifications for different points in time are done. The cutting tool in the model is described in polar coordinates and discretized over the radius to allow a equidistant discretization on the cutting edge (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig48" ref-type="fig">4.48</xref> for a nonuniform wear on a ball-end tool).<fig id="Fig48"><label>Fig. 4.48</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Profile of a simulation of nonuniform wear on a ball-end tool</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig48_HTML.png" id="MO58"/></fig></p><p id="Par190">The mathematical operator is extended with the model of wear on the cutting tool and takes an additional input <italic>t</italic>.

The aims of this investigation are the assessment of short-term and long-term frictional behavior and wear. However, tribological assessment in the micro-regime is challenging due to size effects, such as the dominance of adhesion, and also the application of delicate samples and experimental setups. This led to the development and application of specialized equipment for micro-tribological investigations. With regard to design and complexity of these experiments, the DIN 50322 defines six categories of setups linked to sheet metal forming processes. These categories range from I, representative for the actual forming process in industrial environment, to VI for model like experiments with simple sample geometries and equipment. The accessibility to the surfaces under test and the simplicity of the setup is improved for higher category numbers, although the comparability and transferability of the investigation’s results to the real forming process is limited. Precise micro-forming presses have been developed for category I tribological experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">Sch08a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Beh15</xref>].

For the presented material combination, hardened tool steel and Aluminum Al99.9, the tribological active sample surface should ideally exhibit an arithmetical mean height Sa of about 150 nm to achieve minimum friction. A lower sample roughness leads to an increase in friction, which can be traced back to an increased impact of adhesion. Roughness greater than 150 nm is expected to promote interlocking of surface’s asperities also associated with an increase of friction. However, a deeper understanding of the correlation of the surface topography and dry friction, and their mathematical description inevitably requires function orientated surface characterization ahead of common statistical roughness parameters, including suitable contact modeling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>Function Orientated Surface Characterization</title><p id="Par214">The precise description of the interrelationship of the topography of a surface and their functional properties, such as the friction provoked in dry tribological contact, requires for sufficient roughness measurement and analysis techniques.

For example, profilometry does not allow to reliably distinguishing a dent from a scratch on a technical surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">Gei97</xref>]. Rather, areal measurement and characterization of surfaces is necessary. The first appropriate areal roughness measurement systems such as confocal microscopes or white light interferometers (WLI) were introduced in the ninetieths of the last century. Together with the ISO 25178 standard <italic>Geometrical product specification (GPS)</italic>—<italic>surface texture: areal</italic> for areal roughness analysis, released in 2012, there is today a powerful toolbox for sufficient and function orientated surface characterization.</p><p id="Par215">The ISO 25178 standard distinguishes between two categories of parameters for surface characterization: areal field parameters and areal feature parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">Lea13</xref>]. Areal field parameters comprise first of all of the statistical surface parameters (or height parameters) such as the arithmetical mean height Sa. Those parameters originate form two-dimensional profilometry and were transferred to areal surface characterization. All areal field parameters have in common, that their calculation is based on the use of every data point measured and filtered over the surface evaluation area. With regard to function orientated surface characterization the function related parameters (a sub-category of areal field parameters) are of greater relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">Veh15b</xref>]. Function related parameters mainly comprise those parameters derived from the Abbott-Firestone curve or material ratio curve such as the material ratio corresponding to a section height Smr(c) or the Sk parameters determined by graphical construction. For surface characterization using areal feature parameters (these are e.g. the peak density Spd or the arithmetical mean of peak curvature Spc) only beforehand determined features on the surfaces are taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">Lea13</xref>]. These features are categorized by the areal features hills (H) and dales (D), line features such as ridge lines (R), and the punctual features peak (P) and valley (V). The determination of feature parameters from a filtered surface is carried out using watershed segmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">Blu03</xref>]. To avoid over segmentation additional Wolf-pruning is applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">Wol84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">Wol93</xref>]. Wolf-pruning removes all fractions of the surface of interest below a predetermined threshold height value. The threshold value is defined as percentage of the maximum height difference of the filtered surface Sz and is 5% by default. With regard to micro-contact and friction modeling the determination of the hills (H) and related parameters of surfaces are of greatest relevance, as they directly determine the contact state on microscopic level when interfacing with another surface and thus as expected the dry frictional conditions.

Dental prostheses require hard and tough materials like cobalt-chrome alloys or ceramics due to the demands of the application. When machining, static and dynamic interactions between the milling tool and the workpiece govern the cutting process and may worsen the work result, especially the geometrical accuracy. The deflection of the tool has a significant influence. However, deflections can be compensated through adapted manufacturing strategies by adjusting the process parameters or by optimizing the tool path, therefore increasing the quality of the final product. In the work presented, the deflection of the milling tool is compensated by readjusting tool positioning before the actual process to ensure the nominal tool position and eliminate form deviations of the workpiece. The interaction between tool and workpiece is investigated with help of micro- and macroscopic surface simulations, supported by experimental data and parameter identification. The optimization is performed through mathematical methods from the area of inverse problems, applying regularization with sparsity constraints.</p><p id="Par231"><bold>Keywords</bold> Milling ∙ Simulation ∙ Optimization</p><sec id="Sec60"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par232">Micro-milling as part of micro-machining offers high efficiency and adaptability regarding machinable geometries and materials, while maintaining relatively high material removal rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">Veh15a</xref>]. Deploying these advantages, micro-milling is an established process for the manufacture of mold inserts and also dental prostheses (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig56" ref-type="fig">4.56</xref>), which require hard and tough materials, such as cobalt-chrome (CoCr) alloys, ceramics or titanium alloys.<fig id="Fig56"><label>Fig. 4.56</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Dental bridge from CoCr alloy</p><p>(Courtesy of Bego Medical GmbH)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig56_HTML.png" id="MO74"/></fig></p><p id="Par233">Because mating surfaces of dental prostheses are often seated in narrow cavities with steep inclines, milling tools with large length-to-diameter ratios (up to l/d = 18) are necessary to machine these functional surfaces. However, these fine tools are prone to deflection as a direct outcome of the acting process forces. Shape deviations up to several tens of micrometers can be caused by the deflections and can eventually lead to a rejection of the prosthesis. Thus, applicants of micro-milling processes are obliged to enhance their technology if they wish to stay competitive.</p><p id="Par234">A promising and universal method to meet these production challenges is to prepare an adjusted tool path via Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), which can help to reduce shape deviations. However, these preparations are difficult to reproduce because they always depend on the individual capabilities of the programmer and do not necessarily consider all factors responsible for shape deviations. To this day, apart from the workpiece geometry given by a CAD model, only the tool geometry and the machining strategy are considered within CAM systems, whereas material properties and the interaction of tool and workpiece leading to variable process forces and, therefore, hard to predict tool deflections are not yet considered in these systems.</p><p id="Par235">Here, aiming for a better comprehension of the process itself and to investigate possible correlations between process forces, tool deflection and shape deviations, defined abstracted geometries are machined, which inhibit most the critical conditions in the manufacture of dental prostheses. The forces and the resulting shape are measured and compared for a variety of machining conditions. The obtained insights were then employed for a predictive optimization method using modeling and simulations elaborated in preliminary works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">Pio15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">Pio11</xref>].</p><p id="Par236">The simulation based approach requires a calibration of the existing model.

The main difference between micro-milling and conventional milling is the size of the applied tools and the associated structures that can be manufactured. Generally, tool or structure size range in dimensions smaller than a millimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Cam12</xref>].</p><p id="Par240">Regarding machine tools, the manufacture of micro-components or workpieces inhibiting micro-features requires adapted machine behavior and process control. Because of the diameters of these small tools, high spindle speeds of several ten thousand up to a few hundred thousand rpm are essential to achieve adequate cutting velocities. Aside from high-frequency main spindles, means for higher position accuracy, higher stiffness and improved thermal stability of the machine system are decisive. Consequently, machine tools for micro-milling rely on technologies such as hydrostatic bearings, linear direct drives, precision scales, active cooling and controlled compensation of thermal expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">Che10</xref>].</p><p id="Par241">In contrast to conventional cutting, which employs a variety of cutting materials, micro-cutting and particularly micro-milling are almost solely performed with cemented carbide tools. For the machining of hard and tough materials, a physical vapor deposited (PVD) coating (e.g. TiAlN) is applied to reduce tool wear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Ara08</xref>]. Tool suppliers have to meet the demands for the provision of defined cutting edges because powder metallurgic tools are limited in their achievable cutting edge sharpness. In conjunction with the small chip thickness in micro-milling, effects can occur that may result in a plastic deformation (ploughing) in addition to mere cutting, in case the chip thickness falls below a critical minimum. Consequently, process forces can increase and often be the cause of unpredictable tool damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">Uhl14</xref>].</p><p id="Par242">Tool deflection during micro-milling was examined by Dow et al. by machining slots with a linearly varying depth and circular grooves with a radius of 80 mm and a depth of 0.50 mm in hardened tool steel.

Therefore, diamond appears as a suitable material for micro forming tools, especially when provided with micro-structured surfaces; thus, the results of forming processes will be improved compared to tools with smooth surfaces. For machining single crystal diamond, the thermo-chemical effect between diamond and selected carbon-affine metals like iron or nickel at high temperatures was exploited. Major findings of this investigation reveal that, besides graphitization, the diamond removal is governed by oxidation, while diffusion was not detected.

Nevertheless, a transformation of diamond to graphite under normal conditions is not detectable, due to the required high activation energy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig71" ref-type="fig">4.71</xref>b; transition state complex). Even so, there are some catalytic metals like iron, nickel, molybdenum or vanadium that can decrease the required activation energy to graphitize diamond (Fig. <xref rid="Fig71" ref-type="fig">4.71</xref>b; metal–carbon complex). Paul et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">Pau96</xref>] proposed that transition metals with unpaired d-shell electrons decrease the required activation energy. Furthermore, they suggested that the number of unpaired d-shell electrons is proportional to the transformation rate obtained during diamond machining experiments. Thus, for example, iron with four unpaired d-shell electrons should produce a higher transformation rate than cerium with one unpaired d-shell electron. Measurable quantities of diamond–graphite transformation start under normal pressure at around 700 °C. Once the diamond comes into contact with the transition metal at elevated temperature, the C-C bonds are stretched and afterwards destroyed. Unbound carbon atoms can subsequently diffuse into the transition metal, graphitize, react with ambient oxygen to form CO or CO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig71" ref-type="fig">4.71</xref>b; metal–carbon–oxygen complex), or react with the metal to form carbides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">Pau96</xref>].</p><p id="Par295">This effect of increased diamond transformation in contact with transition metals has been used by different researchers to polish single [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">Tat16</xref>] and polycrystalline diamond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">Wei01</xref>] by the technique of dynamic friction polishing. The principal setup of this technique is a fast rotating metal plate made of carbon-affine metals like iron, nickel, manganese or molybdenum, which is pressed against the diamond. To increase the contact temperature between the metal plate and the diamond, the contact force is increased or external heating is used to heat the metal plate or the diamond, respectively.

The remainder of the specimens consisted of SiC and Si and were pressed against a metal plate made from 1.4301 steel. The contact pressure between the diamond and metal plate was chosen between 2.2 MPa and 5.5 MPa, and the sliding speed of the rotating metal plate between 8 and 31 m/s. To characterize the technique of friction polishing without external heating for polycrystalline diamond composites, Chen et al. were able to develop a material removal map and determined three different working regimes, which are divided into zones with low material removal rates, safe removal and a cracking zone, depending on the contact pressure and sliding speed. By using experimental parameters (e.g. 25 m/s and 2.7 MPa), the diamond removal rate amounts to 0.084 µm/min and the achieved surface roughness of the diamond reaches down to Ra = 50 nm after 18 min polishing time.</p><p id="Par297">To understand the influence of the ambient gas during dynamic friction polishing, Suzuki and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">Suz03</xref>] investigated the diamond removal mechanism in various atmospheres.

As the ambient gas, air, oxygen, argon and nitrogen were applied. Suzuki et al. could show that polishing in air and under argon atmosphere led to similar diamond removal rates of 900 µm/min and 920 µm/min respectively. Polishing under oxygen atmosphere enhanced the diamond removal rate to 1480 µm/min, whereas a nitrogen atmosphere reduced the diamond removal rate to 820 µm/min. These high diamond removal rates are attributable to the high contact pressure, which generates a high contact temperature. With respect to the experiments performed and the subsequently executed investigations, the authors concluded that there is no effect of oxidation under argon and nitrogen atmospheres. The basic mechanism in this experiment is a rapid diffusion of carbon into the stainless metal plate, while oxygen increases the diamond removal strongly.</p><p id="Par298">To exploit the higher diamond wear affected by ambient oxygen, Wang et al.

The chemical vapor deposited diamond films exhibited a surface roughness of 8 and 17 µm before polishing. Aluminum was chosen as the material for the metal plate, which has no thermo-chemical effect on the diamond. Therefore, the diamond wear potential of the oxidizing agents can be identified separately. As the second plate material, iron was used to investigate the interaction between iron and the oxidizing agent. For all experiments the metal plate was preheated to 350 °C. Wang et al. could show that all oxidizing agents have a diamond removal effect after 3 h of polishing at a pressure of 0.1 MPa and a rotating speed of 81 rpm. The highest diamond wear was achieved with the mixture of LiNO<sub>3</sub> + KNO<sub>3</sub> with 1.2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/h. When using the iron plate and the LiNO<sub>3</sub> + KNO<sub>3</sub> mixture, the diamond wear increased to 1.7 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/h with a final surface roughness of Ra = 0.4 µm.

Therefore, a 20 kHz, 700 W ultrasonic generator was used to oscillate the metallic friction tool; a piezo ceramic converts the electrical voltage into a mechanical longitudinal vibration and the booster amplifies the amplitude. The friction tool was clamped in a non-amplifying sonotrode with an amplitude of about 8 µm in the z-direction.

The diamond holder was fixed on a dynamometer to control the force acting between the diamond and the friction tool. To prevent bending of the oscillating friction tool, a second diamond was fixed on the opposite side and pressed against the friction tool as a counterpart. In order to realize the required reaction temperature, heating elements were integrated in the holder close to the diamonds. The temperature of the machined diamond was determined by an optical pyrometer with a wavelength of 1.6 µm.

By this concept, a separation of the effective diamond removal mechanisms and, therefore, a determination of the diamond removal caused by the mechanisms becomes possible. The basis of this concept is the ultrasonic assisted friction polishing process, which is carried out under atmosphere and in a high vacuum chamber. During polishing in atmosphere, all the diamond removal mechanisms (oxidation, diffusion and carbide forming, graphitization as well as mechanical diamond removal) are acting at the same time. When polishing in high vacuum, oxidation of cracked carbon atoms is prevented. To avoid a mechanical abrasive diamond removal, pure contact tests with non-moving contact parameters at elevated temperatures were performed.<fig id="Fig75"><label>Fig. 4.75</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustration of the experimental procedure for separating the diamond removal mechanism in machining of diamond</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig75_HTML.png" id="MO100"/></fig></p><p id="Par305">The friction polishing experiments in atmosphere were conducted in a contact temperature range between 20 and 450 °C and in high vacuum between 20 and 300 °C.

The removed diamond volume was measured between 6.18 × 10<sup>0</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> for 20 °C, 10 min, and 7.04 × 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> for 450 °C, 50 min. These values lead to a median cavity depth of 0.25 µm and 19.76 µm, respectively. The results confirm the strong influence of the contact temperature. With rising temperature, the removed diamond volumes increased. Experiments without preheating showed the lowest diamond removal and a rough surface (condition A). With increasing temperature, the surface roughness decreased to a minimum (condition B) and rose with further increase of the contact temperatures (condition C). These different roughness values can be attributed to the varying regimes and varying diamond removal mechanisms, as well as the changing material properties of the friction tool condition for higher temperatures. Nevertheless, different mechanisms are acting in parallel. For experiments at lower contact temperature, the machined diamond shows a rutted surface with grooves in the direction of the vibration. In contrast to this, diamond surfaces machined at the contact temperature of 300 °C show a smooth surface with almost no surface fissuring. These results imply that at lower contact temperatures mechanically induced diamond wear takes place simultaneously with the thermo-chemical mechanism. The increasing surface roughness at elevated contact temperatures is due to the fact that the friction tool loses its mechanical strength. As a result, surface disruption occurred and the diamond surface mirrored the deteriorated surface of the tool.

The slightly higher diamond removal rates for short machining times can be attributed to the cylindrical shape of the friction tool. At the beginning of the machining, the cylindrical friction tool is pressed against the diamond in line contact, which results in a higher contact load. After a short time, the tool is slightly flattened and the contact load decreases compared to the contact load with longer machining times. For experiments with a contact temperature of 400 °C, the diamond removal rates showed a much higher variability. Longer machining times showed no significant influence of the diamond removal rate, which is an indication that diffusion of carbon atoms into the tool material is negligible. For further proof, a metallurgical element analysis was carried out to identify the raised carbon content in the subsurface of the friction tool. For the analysis, a friction tool which was used at 300 °C and 60 min was chosen. The tool was cut and 10,000 measurements in an area of 0.5 mm × 0.1 mm from the contact zone into the tool material were taken as the depth profile. The investigation found no carbon atoms in the tool material, which underlines that diffusion is insignificant.</p><p id="Par311">To investigate the influence of oxygen, polishing experiments were carried out in a high vacuum condition with 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa and contact temperatures between 20 and 300 °C. Higher contact temperatures led to breakouts on the diamond surface, starting at the edge. In contrast to the experiments in atmosphere, the highest diamond removal was identified for machining conditions D and E without preheating. The removed diamond volume was two times higher than the diamond removal in atmosphere. Preheating of the diamond to contact temperatures reduced the diamond removal. With a further rise to 300 °C, the diamond removal increased again and the formation of graphite on the diamond surface was detected by Raman analysis, which is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig77" ref-type="fig">4.77</xref>. For lower contact temperature, the formation of graphite could not be detected.<fig id="Fig77"><label>Fig. 4.77</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Polished diamond surface in high vacuum (<bold>a</bold>) and Raman analysis (<bold>b</bold>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig77_HTML.png" id="MO102"/></fig></p><p id="Par312">In addition to polishing experiments, contact tests in a nitrogen atmosphere were conducted to analyze the possibility of diamond removal by graphitization and diffusion. The experiments were conducted at contact temperatures between 600 and 850 °C. Experiments with lower contact temperatures showed no (600 °C) or a very low (650°C) diamond removal. With increasing contact temperature up to 800 °C, the diamond removal increased steadily. Contact tests at a temperature of 800 °C (condition G) showed a lower diamond removal compared to vacuum experiments with a highest contact temperature of 300 °C (condition F). When increasing the contact temperature up to 850 °C, the diamond removal increased significantly. These results reveal that the formation of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> is the significant mechanism for ultrasonic assisted polishing of single crystal diamond in contact with pure iron. Experiments in atmosphere show up to 30 times higher diamond removal rates compared to experiments in high vacuum. With increased contact temperatures, the formation of graphite has a more relevant role under the elimination of oxygen. Lower contact temperatures in ambient atmosphere and in high vacuum lead to a strong abrasive diamond removal (Table <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">4.12</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab12"><label>Table 4.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Significant data points with nickel as tool material for different experimental setups and machining conditions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left" colspan="3"><p>Polishing in atmosphere</p></th><th align="left" colspan="3"><p>Polishing in high vacuum</p></th><th align="left" colspan="3"><p>Contact test</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Machining condition</p></td><td align="left"><p>A</p></td><td align="left"><p>B</p></td><td align="left"><p>C</p></td><td align="left"><p>D</p></td><td align="left"><p>E</p></td><td align="left"><p>F</p></td><td align="left"><p>G</p></td><td align="left"><p>H</p></td><td align="left"><p>I</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Contact temperature [°C]</p></td><td align="left"><p>20</p></td><td align="left"><p>300</p></td><td align="left"><p>450</p></td><td align="left"><p>20</p></td><td align="left"><p>200</p></td><td align="left"><p>300</p></td><td align="left"><p>750</p></td><td align="left"><p>850</p></td><td align="left"><p>850</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Contact time [min]</p></td><td align="left"><p>35</p></td><td align="left"><p>60</p></td><td align="left"><p>50</p></td><td align="left"><p>35</p></td><td align="left"><p>60</p></td><td align="left"><p>60</p></td><td align="left"><p>50</p></td><td align="left"><p>30</p></td><td align="left"><p>60</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Surface roughness [nm]</p></td><td align="left"><p>505</p></td><td align="left"><p>109</p></td><td align="left"><p>2344</p></td><td align="left"><p>127</p></td><td align="left"><p>106</p></td><td align="left"><p>/</p></td><td align="left"><p>153</p></td><td align="left"><p>240</p></td><td align="left"><p>239</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Diamond removal x10<sup>6</sup> [µm³]</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.23</p></td><td align="left"><p>3.25</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.98</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.18</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.10</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.01</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.01</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.06</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.07</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par313">In further experiments, nickel was used as the tool material for friction polishing at ambient atmosphere (Fig. <xref rid="Fig78" ref-type="fig">4.78</xref>).

With rise of the preheating temperature and time, the removed diamond volume increases to the maximum at condition B and decreases slightly with a further rise of preheating (condition C). The reduction of the ability to remove diamond is probably caused by the formation of nickel oxides. Experiments without preheating showed a rough surface and declined strongly with increasing temperature to a minimum at condition B. A strong rutted diamond surface was identified for condition C. Compared to the experiments with iron, nickel led to a higher diamond surface roughness after machining. For all the investigated contact temperatures, the diamond removal rates identified show a similar curved shape. For shorter machining times (10 min), the diamond removal rates showed high values. With increase of the machining time to 60 min the diamond removal rates decrease significantly for all the contact temperatures used.

To characterize a “smear effect” based on the tool motion during the ultrasonic assisted friction polishing, an L-shaped structure was chosen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig83" ref-type="fig">4.83</xref>c and d) with the same dimensions. With respect to the polishing and contact load experiments, a preheating temperature of 250 °C, a machining time of 120 min and a contact load of 4 N for the concave and 2 N for the convex micro-structured friction tools was chosen.
<fig id="Fig83"><label>Fig. 4.83</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Micro-structured friction tool <bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold> and micro-structured single crystal diamond <bold>e</bold>–<bold>h</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/463048_1_En_4_Fig83_HTML.png" id="MO108"/></fig></p><p id="Par326">The experimental results exhibit for all four micro-structures the possibility of shaping single crystal diamond by ultrasonic assisted friction polishing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig83" ref-type="fig">4.83</xref> right column e–h). It can be seen that the shape of the transferred micro-structure on the top of the diamond has sharp edges and has the same dimensions as the friction tool. This confirms that the micro-structure is transferred accurately into the diamond and the micro-structured friction tool can keep the geometry during processing. Convex micro-structured diamond surfaces show a deeper micro-structure (43 µm + 33 µm) than concave micro-structured diamond surfaces (25 µm + 20 µm). This result is based on a better oxygen feed to the convex micro-structured friction tool than to the concave micro-structured friction tool with a plane surface which has a tight contact with the diamond surface.
