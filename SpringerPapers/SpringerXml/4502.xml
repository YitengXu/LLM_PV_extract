for developing countries, which face broad energy-related issues such as a wide demand–supply gap, extensive fossil fuel dependency, and low accessibility to clean energy. Globally, smart grid technology has been identified to address these affairs and enable a smooth transition from traditional to smart energy systems, ensuring energy security. This paper studies the critical role in strengthening the power system, integrating renewable sources, electrifying the transport sector, and harnessing bioenergy. Evaluating the current energy scenario in Nepal, this article presents the smart grid as a solution to existing and future energy issues and the associated challenges during its implementation, urging concerned authorities to launch initiatives to promote it. Moreover, this study also lays the foundation for future research into the smart grid’s potential to reform the power sector in other developing nations with abundant renewable energy sources and

such as fossil fuels are finite. Their continued use has evident health and environmental consequences owing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution, water pollution, land degradation, and waste production (Yadav et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2020</xref>). To solve these issues, long-term initiatives aimed at achieving global sustainable development are required (Gorjian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2019</xref>). However, a country’s social and economic growth would be impossible without effective administration and the use of existing renewable energy sources (RESs) (Gorjian and Ghobadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Therefore, having access to renewable energy has become decisive in achieving social, environmental, and economic progress. Nepal is one of those developing nations which is currently underutilizing its potential RESs: with a per capita electricity consumption of 267 kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2020 (Himalayan News Service <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to modernize the conventional energy system, following the path of other developed/developing countries to meet respective energy targets.</p><p id="Par4">According to International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the share of renewable energy in total global electricity production should increase from 33.3% in 2018 to 85% in 2050 to restrict global average temperature rise below 2 °C, as mentioned in Paris Climate Agreement 2015 (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2018</xref>). At the end of 2020, the total renewable energy capacity reached 2799 Gigawatts (GW) globally, and its share in total production has increased from 33.3% in 2018 to 36.6% in 2020. Hydropower (1,211 GW) provided the largest renewable share, with the wind (733 GW) and solar photovoltaic (PV) (714 GW) accounting for the majority of the remaining share (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2021a</xref>). China (31.97%), the United States (US) (10.43%), Brazil (5.36%), India (4.79%), and Germany (4.72%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) each contributed a significant part of the global renewable energy generating capacity (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2021b</xref>). Globally, renewable energy generation capacity has been significantly rising yearly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) because of the advancement of smart technologies, encouraging the integration of RESs like solar PV and wind power via the transformation of conventional grids into smart grids.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Global share of renewable energy 2020, and <bold>b</bold> Globally generated annual renewable energy over the past years (Data Source: (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2021b</xref>))</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_19084_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The energy transition from non-renewable to renewable has been emerging as a global energy plan (Fuentes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). Therefore, the average annual rise of global renewable energy consumption has been significantly increased by 8.62% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Heavy dependence on conventional fuels has raised concerns over environmental and socioeconomic sustainability (Sovacool et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2011</xref>); therefore, the focus of Nepal’s energy policies needs to shift from traditional energy technology to smart and efficient energy technology. Hence, transforming existing power grids into smart ones is crucial to boost energy transition and achieve sustainable development goals. However, limited studies have evaluated the need for this technological shift, and few have recognized smart grid technology as a viable option for achieving Nepal’s sustainable energy transformation.</p><p id="Par6">Thus, the primary aim of this study is to offer a tool to assist Nepal’s energy sector transformation/reformation. More specifically, this paper explores different technologies that aid in smart grid transition and management of micro-grids and aims to highlight the role of electric vehicles and wastewater treatment in promoting sustainable energy in the future. It discusses the technical, managerial, and legal barriers that emerge in smart grid implementation, and thus devises necessary solutions/roadmap that can be adopted to overcome them. Moreover, to achieve 2050’s global target of 85% share of renewable energy in total electricity production, all developing countries should emphasize efficacious incorporation of their available RESs through making their grid flexible and innovation-friendly by adopting a smart grid strategy. Therefore, this paper highlights and encourages its essentialness and opportunities in developing countries like Nepal for achieving the global goal of a sustainable and clean energy future. Finally, based on the findings in the context of Nepal, this study proposes suitable policies and institutional frameworks that can be relevant to transforming energy sector in developing countries, and thus also suggests prioritization of investments in Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) in the future.</p><p id="Par7">For the literature review, the “Google Scholar” search engine (scholar.google.com) was used, and research articles, mostly after the year 2000, were reviewed. Keywords like “smart grids,” “renewable energy,” “technology,” “hydropower,” “solar power,” “wind energy,” and “sustainability” etc. were used for the search. Data and energy status were reviewed through National Electricity Reports and thoroughly compared with National Reports from other countries like India, Bangladesh, and Brazil. Moreover, secondary data regarding current global energy scenarios, electricity demand and capacity, and transmission network in Nepal were obtained from IRENA, Water and Energy Commission (WECS), and World Bank, respectively. Reports from Asian Development Bank as well as relevant literatures were also analyzed to discuss the status of the development of some technologies, as well as to underline some key issues and barriers in those realms. Finally, National Policy Reports were reviewed, and the policy implications of smart grid technologies were discussed alongside the managerial implications.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Smart grids</title><p id="Par8">The term Smart Grid was, presumably, first coined in a paper titled “Toward a smart grid: power delivery for the twenty-first century” in 2005 (Massoud Amin and Wollenberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2005</xref>). The Smart Grids European Technology Platform has defined a smart grid as “an electricity network that can smartly integrate the actions of all users connected to it —generators, consumers and those that do both—to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic, and secure electricity supply” (Vesnic-Alujevic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2016</xref>). Some European countries and the US realized the necessity of modernization of the power grid in the 1980s and made significant progress in transforming the smart grid (Simões et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2011</xref>). In contrast, developing countries like Nepal have only recently realized its need to effectively manage produced energy, reduce power loss, and appropriate utilization of potential RESs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Global perspective</title><p id="Par9">Smart Grids have been globally popular since the mid-2000s and progressively developed worldwide, most remarkably in the US, the UK, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. During the initial phases of smart grids development, the US and the European Union (EU) aired numerous pilot projects, deploying smart grid applications such as smart meters, electric vehicles (EVs), distributed generation, smart network management, etc. (Simões et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2011</xref>). Currently, they are focused on increasing energy efficiency and RES inclusion, bolstering and broadening their linkage between countries and states (Ponce-Jara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2017</xref>; Gorjian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021</xref>). Despite China being a latecomer to smart grid deployment, its expenditures on smart grid projects mainly focused on high-voltage transmission networks have already surpassed those of the US. Meanwhile, developing nations India and Brazil are investing/advancing their efforts to transform their grid by initiating many developments and reform programs with the formation of various commissions, regulations, and acts (Asaad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>; Dranka and Ferreira <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Their programs include installing smart meters, applying geographic information systems in distribution networks, and energy derivation from alternate sources. Their efforts are chiefly converged to electricity theft detection and loss reduction (Ponce-Jara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Bangladesh and India are also facing various power supply issues. With heightening demand and dependence on coal- and oil-based power plants, Bangladesh is susceptible to the heavy blow from the ongoing energy crisis (Uddin and Taplin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2006</xref>). The ongoing affairs of its power system are poor and aging power system infrastructure, limited fossil fuel resources, high losses, low renewable energy usage, and high GHGs emissions. The Government of Bangladesh and its distribution companies have been inclined toward smart grid technology to incorporate available renewable sources in the primary grid and thus helps reduce dependence on carbon-intensive fossil fuel plants (Islam and Bloemink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2018</xref>). Facing similar problems, India has also been implementing smart grid technologies for energy security, limiting global warming, strengthening the renewable energy sector, and escaping the energy crisis (Singh and Tiwari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2017</xref>). Furthermore, the global trend of increasing renewable energy capacity over the previous decade (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) justifies the need for Nepal to make the transition toward smart grid technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The current scenario in Nepal</title><p id="Par11">In Nepal’s current power system, fragile transmission and distribution network, aging infrastructure, high transmission and distribution loss, power theft, poor RESs penetration, and heavy reliance on fossil fuels are significant concerns that need to be addressed promptly (The Kathmandu Post <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2018</xref>). The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), to alleviate these issues, intends to set up 5 million smart meters in stages by 2025. It had intended to station 98,000 smart meters in two distribution centers in Kathmandu Valley (KaV) by May 2020 and 450,000 smart meters in 10 distribution centers in KaV by May 2021. However, due to complexities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, only around 60,000 smart meters have been deployed, but still, immediate benefits like lower meter reading costs and reduction in losses have been realized in the early phases. Furthermore, it projects to set up a total of 3 million smart meters by May 2023 and 5 million smart meters by May 2025. Along with this, NEA has a target to take up several pilot projects (ADB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). It has started the Kathmandu Valley Substation Automation Project to make the grid system more reliable and smart, as well as lower operating costs and improve equipment service life. In addition, numerous high-voltage transmission lines (400 kV) have been finished, and others are now being built or proposed (NEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Recently, NEA has taken the initiative to install 50 EV charging stations in essential places and highways across the country in response to the government’s plan and policies to increase the share of EVs. On April 09, 2021, a contract was signed with M/s Wanbang Digital Energy Co., Ltd., China, with 1 year estimated time of completion, with the preconstruction survey work ongoing currently. Moreover, NEA has plans for extending the number of charging station up to 300 shortly (The Himalayan Times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2021</xref>). Regarding utilization of RESs, Nepal’s first large-scale private-owned solar power plant of capacity 8.5 Megawatt (MW) was connected to the national transmission line by Ridi Hydropower Company in Butwal (Bhusal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). Additionally, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has issued construction licenses to 15 solar power projects amounting total capacity of about 92 MW (DoED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>).

It led to losses of about US$24.69 million yearly in the industrial sector (Poudyal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2019</xref>). It was facilitated through preliminary strategy and plan adopted by NEA and GoN to mitigate the crisis by controlling electricity loss and increasing performance of electrical energy system (ADB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>).

In recent years, by promoting local production, import, and effective demand-side management via coordinated resource utilization, Nepal has successfully annihilated load-shedding. Still, it persistently continues experiencing the antagonistic effects of inadequate and inconsistent power supply due to various problems depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Furthermore, the total generation capacity has increased gradually from 706 MW in 2011 to 1900 MW in 2021, while the peak demand has overgrown from 946.10 to 1500 MW (ADB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; NEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>; DoED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2022</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Key causes and consequences of Nepal insufficient and unreliable power supply (Data </p><p>Source: ADB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_19084_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">If not resolved by adopting an appropriate strategy in time, these problems will surely make the energy system of Nepal more vulnerable to a broad demand–supply gap and frequent power failures when required to meet the high demand in forthcoming years.

With a rise in consumption, the emission of GHGs like CO<sub>2</sub> has also elevated inexorably. In 2017, 45.4% of overall CO<sub>2</sub> emission was released by the transportation sector in Nepal (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2020</xref>). Such emission has contributed to air pollution and global warming, which have a deteriorating effect on human health and the environmental ecosystem (Shrestha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Therefore, to restrict the rising GHGs discharges from carbon-intensive technologies, it is suggested that the nation should take essential activities to shift to alternative low carbon technology. Electrifying the transport sector would be a sustainable solution to restrict GHG emissions (Kainuma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2017</xref>). But the current scenario is quite the opposite, where imported oil products fully fulfill energy demand in the transport sector. Electricity shared only 0.06% of the final energy consumption of the transport sector, whereas oil products shared 99.94% in 2017 (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">To improve this situation, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, in association with the United Nations Center for Regional Development (UNCRD), has devised National Sustainable Transport Strategy (NSTS) with an insight to develop a transport system that is “efficient, accessible, people-centric, affordable, reliable, safe, inclusive, environmentally friendly, and climate and disaster-resilient” (Acharya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). To mitigate climate change, Nepal’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is a mechanism under Paris Climate Agreement 2015 in which it agrees to manage climate change and has four targets linked with the transport sector shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

Almost three-quarters (72.84%) of total final energy consumption comes from traditional energy sources like firewood, agricultural waste, biofuel, etc., while electricity contributes only 3.66% in total consumption (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). As per NEA, nearly 87% of households all over the country have electricity access through the national grid line. In rural areas not directly connected to the national grid, GoN, in association with Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), has been providing electricity service through distributed sources like solar PV, wind, and micro-hydro power (MyRepublica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). However, those sources cannot resolve the rural electrification problem due to seasonal discrepancies in generation capacity and demand fluctuation. Those shortcomings can be overcome if distributed sources are integrated by establishing community-scale microgrids and hybrid power plants combining various available sources. Bhorleni village in Makwanpur district has a hybrid plant aggregated with 15 kilowatts (kW) solar and 10 kW wind power, which supplies electricity to 131 houses at a minimal cost. Besides, a 12 kW solar-wind hybrid plant has been established in Dhaubadi Village of Nawalparasi district (Poudyal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2019</xref>).

Major hydropower stations, the primary sources of electricity, lie in the Himalayan region due to abundant perennial rivers. However, the main load centers like industries, commercial zones, and large apartments lie far from generating stations requiring longer transmission lines to fetch the required power. It is congested in commercial and industrial regions like KaV, Butwal, and Hetauda, and scattered sparsely in other areas. About 75% of the long transmission lines, as of 2019, operate at 132 kV. Only about 12% of transmission lines operate at 220 kV or higher, resulting in transmission loss of 4.64%, higher than the acceptable limit of about 2% (NACAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>). With the ever-increasing penetration of RESs and aging infrastructure, it becomes arduous to maintain grid stability and flexibility with existing transmission infrastructure.

In the existing grid of Nepal, it is impossible to control different electrical parameters like impedance, phase angle, and magnitude of voltage in real time, which constrain the grid flexibility. But with FACTS devices and controllers, these parameters can be altered and composed in real time, offering a new level of opportunity for managing the network.</p><p id="Par25">To control power flows, Nepal’s AC grid system has been designed to incorporate mechanically switched series and shunt compensation along with voltage regulating components and phase-shifting transformers. To achieve a smooth transition into the smart grid, these components should be replaced by FACTS devices that use power semiconductors for quicker reaction to disturbance than mechanical systems. Static Var Compensator (SVC) and Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) are conventional FACTS devices based on thyrist or switched capacitors and reactors. But the advancement of power electronics led to the invention of voltage source converters (VSCs) hinged on gate turn-off (GTO) and insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBTS) ensure modern FACTS devices-static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and unified power flow controller (UPFC).

The energy storage system improves the quality, reliability, and balancing of power in the grid and allows energy storage during non-peak hours and discharging during peak hours (Spataru and Bouffaron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2016</xref>). The disposition and incorporation of energy storage techniques like the flywheel, supercapacitors, advanced battery technology, and pumped hydro storage has provided a broad vision for smart microgrids (Abdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>). AMI allows technology such as smart meters to facilitate a two-way exchange of information between consumers and utilities (Balakrishna and Swarup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). This would provide microgrids with a wide variety of capabilities, such as remote consumption control, time-based pricing, demand forecasting, theft and loss detection, and efficient revenue collection.

Despite having an early start, Nepal has been unable to make any significant progress in electrifying the transport sector due to several barriers as discussed in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. Many studies recommend some feasible solutions to overcome these hurdles; nevertheless, various practical factors may make implementation difficult (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Nepal is a landlocked country, and the country’s harsh topography has made expanding the road network challenging. As a result, the requirement to import the bulk of materials and components, particularly without access to the cheapest form of transportation, namely, water transport, has stifled local industrial growth. In addition, several necessary mineral resources, such as lithium, iron, cobalt, nickel etc., have not been explored due to a lack of capital and technology (Paudel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2019</xref>). Furthermore, because the majority of remote areas lack access to roads and energy, the current distribution of EVs across the country is not uniform and concentrated in cities; for instance, Safa Tempos operate in KaV.

If charging activities co-occur with current consumption peaks, the possibility for increased peak energy demand may entail due to substantial EVs penetration. The uncontrolled charging of large-scale EVs results in significant voltage drop, overloading, and power loss in the distribution system (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2013</xref>). To alleviate these issues, one of the possible measures is to employ EVs as flexible/dynamic loads that can offer balancing services to networks with a high proportion of varying renewable energy supply (Kempton and Letendre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1997</xref>; Bibak and Tekiner-Moğulkoç <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>). To fully realize EVs’ capability as a flexible or dynamic load, smart charging procedures must be employed.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Smart charging</title><p id="Par38">Smart charging can occur in a centralized manner through aggregators or decentralized manner through decentralized control structures. In a centralized control structure, the optimal scheduling of each EV is handled by an aggregator. At the same time, in a decentralized system, each electric vehicle chooses its charging method without contacting the central controller or other linked EVs (Galus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>). In comparison to uncontrolled charging, both the centralized and decentralized systems may successfully decrease the energy costs and prevent the overloading of grid components by shifting peak demand to off-peak hours (Vaya and Andersson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2012</xref>; Patil and Kalkhambkar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2020</xref>). Although the centralized approach is more reliable and accurate and provides a more significant reduction in the GHG emission (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>), the scalability issues, the necessity for effective real-time bi-directional communications, high cost of implementation, and lack of privacy protection (Vaya and Andersson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2012</xref>) can pose restraints for its performance in the context of Nepal. But, in a decentralized system, EV users can plan their charging strategy and avoid the issues mentioned earlier to a greater extent (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2019</xref>). Both strategies have their pros and cons; however, in decentralized strategy, the quick convergence of optimization problem requires low computational efforts and provides greater efficiency, which indirectly lowers the cost of equipment (Jian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2019</xref>; Liao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2021</xref>). So, from cost–benefit perspective, the decentralized strategy appears to be a more feasible system for Nepal, which is in the early phase of EV development. Furthermore, to reap the benefits of the smart charging approach, EV charging stations should be strategically positioned in the distribution network of the power grid following the enhanced approach as discussed in Ahmad et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021b</xref>). Nonetheless, before implementation, a detailed study is required to determine whether a particular charging strategy is appropriate for a specific region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>V2X technology</title><p id="Par39">In a smart grid, when linked to the power grid for charging/discharging, EVs are referred to as grid-connected EVs (GEVs).

And, the exact vehicle can be changed later from the power grid during off-peak hours or by intermittent renewable sources like rooftop solar PV (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2018a</xref>; Shariff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). Also, with the advent of V2G technology, EVs may be clustered via aggregator to offer grid services such as load leveling, peak shaving, and voltage regulation at a lower cost and with less environmental effects than present systems.

As a result, smart grid technology has become an essential foundation for building net-zero energy/self-sufficient WWTPs (Moazeni and Khazaei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Net-zero energy concept in WWTPs (</p><p>adapted from Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2017a</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_19084_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO16"/></fig></p><p id="Par46">Several studies have highlighted the potential of WWTPs to produce biogas, thermal energy, and other biochemical derivatives that can be converted into electricity via a variety of methods, including (a) anaerobic fermentation of separated sludge and conversion of biogas to electricity, (b) combustion of separated sludge and conversion of heat to power, and (c) integration in the water treatment process of microbial fuel cells (Mamut and Badea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>). Recent research in Nepal found that the entire biogas potential from the projected 200 MLD wastewater in KaV, with an average COD content of 1000 ± 225 mg/L, is estimated to be 23,105 ± 5185 Nm<sup>3</sup>/day, corresponding to a total energy potential of 3.35 ± 0.76 MW (Ramtel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2021</xref>). With the introduction of smart grid technology, opportunities will arise to harness the potential bioenergy present in centralized and decentralized WWTPs around the country, allowing them to become energy self-sufficient and excess energy to be incorporated into the national grid line.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Challenges of smart grid implementation in Nepal</title><p id="Par47">Smart grids employ cutting-edge technology to address current complexities in Nepal’s traditional electricity networks while also providing a plethora of chances to improve their efficiency and reliability. However, its implementation is hindered by the several technical and socioeconomic challenges summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Major challenges associated with the application of a smart grid in Nepal</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_19084_Fig16_HTML.png" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par48">Nepal’s present grid infrastructure is insufficient to meet expected renewable energy integration and response management demands, posing several smart grid designs, building, operation, and maintenance issues. The frequent and intermittent variation of active power supplied by integrated renewable energy sources causes significant voltage variance at the distribution level. Existing grid voltage regulators, such as tap changers and capacitor tanks, cannot correct rapid fluctuations caused by these sources. As a result, power electronics technologies like FACTS and RACDS, efficient energy storage systems, and other smart technology must be incorporated to ensure voltage and frequency stability in the grid (Fallahzadeh-Abarghouei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>; Firouzjah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>). However, smart infrastructures such as smart meters, energy storage systems, FACTS, database management, communication systems, etc. require sizeable initial investment (EPRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>). The availability of funding is thus a key barrier to establishing a smart grid in Nepal.</p><p id="Par49">In addition, there are no well-defined rules or guidelines in Nepal to govern smart grid efforts. The majority of present legal and regulatory frameworks were created to address existing networks and utilities. As a result, current legislative and regulatory frameworks will need to be amended to facilitate the deployment of smart grids. The new framework must be designed to maximize contributions from all sectors, and all stakeholders—government, utilities/investors, and consumers—share the potential risks. Therefore, new regulations and policies must consider the following aspects (Kappagantu and Daniel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par50">Investment to be shared among consumers, utilities/investors, and the government</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Incentives for the adoption of renewable energy technology</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Reducing the tax levied on EVs and renewable energy technologies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Create action plans and norms</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Meet all stakeholders’ expectations, particularly those of consumers</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">A genuine emphasis on workforce development and public awareness campaigns</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par56">Utilities in <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">smart grids</xref> have a significant data management challenge since a considerable quantity of data is generated. As a result, processing and storing huge volumes of data exchanged among multiple smart grid components need a secure processing and storage facility. Otherwise, hackers and viruses can get unauthorized access to data and leak it, posing a severe threat to users’ privacy and confidentiality (Tu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2017</xref>). So, database management and cyber security are significant challenges to address while adopting smart grid technologies.</p><p id="Par57">Another obstacle to establishing a smart grid strategy in Nepal can be a lack of consumer understanding about the smart grid. As a result, consumers should be educated about the concept of a smart grid, its role in the transition to carbon-free energy, and its advantages for them. They must also be taught about their energy usage habits, allowing them to participate actively in demand response management and become prosumers (producer + consumer) rather than simply consumers. Furthermore, authorities and regulators must have a comprehensive understanding of the smart grid’s future potential, and utilities must concentrate on fully exploiting its capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions and policy implications</title><p id="Par58">We reviewed the current scenario, explored the needs, and presented various opportunities that developing countries like Nepal can undertake by implementing smart grid technologies. Through these technologies, Nepal can increase the share of renewable energy usage to address current and future energy problems and contribute toward the global sustainable development goal.</p><p id="Par59">The semiconductor-based FACTS and RACDS devices, by replacing current mechanically-driven devices, will make the system more responsive during faults, and energy losses will be reduced. Similarly, a smart grid will provide a huge opportunity to alleviate the rural electrification problem by widely implementing smart microgrids built on plentiful RESs such as solar PV, wind, and biomass, engaging the private business and connecting them to the national grid. Similarly, smart and scheduled charging of EVs in a smart grid environment will encourage people to embrace EV technology; therefore, vehicular emissions and dependence on fossil fuel will be reduced significantly. EV concepts such as V2H and V2G will enable EVs to be utilized as both an energy supplier and a load, making them essential partakers in demand response management. Furthermore, by capturing, regulating, and controlling their potential biomass energy, the smart grid will assist WWTPs throughout the country to become energy self-sufficient.</p><p id="Par60">Although smart grids provide a broad range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, several technical and socioeconomic challenges may make their implementation difficult. These issues can be addressed if the GoN and NEA jointly adopt policies and strategies that promote their development. The results of existing smart grid initiatives like the Kathmandu Valley Smart Metering Project, on the other hand, can offer insight into how its development will proceed in Nepal.</p><p id="Par61">The findings of this study imply that several components of smart grid technology are in a trend of progressive deployment in the country as a result of new initiatives, policies, and frameworks implemented by the government and related authorities in recent years. Also, this paper concludes that there is a significant potential of this technology in Nepal’s energy sector for the effective and efficient utilization of vast RESs, better energy management, environmental protection, and overall socio-economic progress; however, there is a significant gap between current degree of achievements and the potential available. The following policy-related suggestions are proposed based on the findings of this study. First, government and other national authorities should make policies and frameworks that support and prioritize the investment in RETs. In this regard, a stable political environment is necessary to assure the safety of investment of domestic and foreign investors. Also, the government should proactively promote the research and development activities to identify the issues concerning the time and budget overrun of national-level hydropower projects to avoid similar complications in the future. These policies should be designed optimally to reinforce the other climate change–related policies. Second, utilities should pursue digitalization, which provides a significant opportunity to minimize grid losses, energy theft, timely fault detection, and operational expenses. Digital media makes it easier for customers to analyze and manage their energy usage patterns, reduce energy waste, and support demand-side management. Third, the increasing necessity for grid restructuring demands decentralized the power system control. Currently, NEA is the centralized government entity that monitors the planning, execution, and operations of projects and initiatives related to different components of the power system. With a large number of distributed RESs generating energy in near future, it will be difficult to manage centrally. Therefore, for Nepal’s energy sector seeking resiliency, reliability, and flexibility, a decentralized control system might be a new paradigm.</p><p id="Par62">In essence, policymakers in developing countries like Nepal should promote the smart grid approach to minimize energy loss, lower energy costs, utilize clean energy, and improve power system reliability and management. This will also result in new employment opportunities, which will help the country’s overall socio-economic growth. In a broader sense, the advent of smart grid technologies will not only serve as a solution to existing energy-related problems across developing countries but will also reduce global carbon footprint and contribute to the achievement of global sustainable energy goals, and thus lessen the impacts of global climate change in the years to come.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors like to acknowledge collaborative organizations/institutions: Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal; Tarbiat Modares University (TMU), Iran; School of Engineering and Mathematical Science, La Trobe University, Australia; Federal University of Fronteira Sul, Erechim, Brazil.
