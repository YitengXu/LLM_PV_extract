The self-healing of the OER-active nickel iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) has not been successful due to irreversible leaching of Fe catalytic centers. Here, we investigate the introduction of cobalt (Co) into the NiFe-LDH as a promoter for in situ Fe redeposition. An active borate-intercalated NiCoFe-LDH catalyst is synthesized using electrodeposition and shows no degradation after OER tests at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at pH 14 for 1000 h, demonstrating its self-healing ability under harsh OER conditions. Importantly, the presence of both ferrous ions and borate ions in the electrolyte is found to be crucial to the catalyst’s self-healing. Furthermore, the implementation of this catalyst in photoelectrochemical devices is demonstrated with an integrated silicon photoanode. The self-healing mechanism leads to a self-limiting catalyst thickness, which is ideal for integration with photoelectrodes since redeposition is not accompanied by increased parasitic light absorption.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">While self-healing catalysts may survive the harsh environments used for oxygen evolution, understanding how to develop such electrocatalysts remains a challenge.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Converting intermittent renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind energy, into storable chemical fuels is a key pathway toward a sustainable energy future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Two principal routes currently under intensive investigation are electrocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction. Hydrogen and hydrocarbons generated through these processes could serve as energy carriers for long-term storage, provide renewable transportation fuels, and enable versatile generation and distribution. Although these value-added chemicals are produced from water or CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reactions taking place at the cathodes, anodic hydroxyl ion oxidation is required to provide an abundant source of electrons and protons and complete the overall reaction. Therefore, as researchers pursue high-performance catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR), it is equally important to develop efficient and durable catalysts for the kinetically challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been devoted to this field and the activity of OER catalysts has been significantly improved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Among these active OER catalysts, nickel–iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) have stood out as one of the most promising candidates owing to their earth-abundant compositions and high OER activity in alkaline conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Even though there has been debate over the role of Fe as either an active center or as a Lewis acid that enhances Ni activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the ability of Fe to promote the OER activity of Ni oxyhydroxides is generally acknowledged. Recent mechanistic studies strongly suggest that iron comprises the active centers for OER in NiFe-LDH, while the nickel hydroxide lattice provides a thermodynamically stable host to accommodate the catalytic Fe centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The Pourbaix diagram of the Ni-water system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> shows that the Ni-based compounds, including Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiOOH, are indeed thermodynamically stable under the OER conditions. However, the high valence state active Fe intermediates, such as cis-dioxo-Fe(VI) (FeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, have been found to be thermodynamically unstable under the OER conditions, consistent with the reported Pourbaix diagram of the Fe-water system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These catalytic Fe centers may leach out of the catalyst during reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which leads to the degradation of the OER activity over time. To achieve ultimate stability of the catalyst, it has been suggested that self-healing of the leached catalytic centers may be the only realistic strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Although promising short-term (1 h) dynamic stability of Fe active centers in NiFe oxyhydroxides has been recently demonstrated via energetically tuned surface adsorption of Fe from electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, an effective self-healing strategy has not been realized for NiFe-LDH catalyst for long-term OER operation under harsh alkaline conditions. Thus, long-term stability of these catalysts represents a key property gap that must be overcome for the realization of practical systems incorporating this best-in-class OER catalyst.</p><p id="Par4">The requirement for self-healing is that the leaching and redeposition of catalytic centers must reach dynamic equilibrium at OER operational potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, we found that for NiFe-LDH catalysts, the redeposition of the leached Fe catalytic centers at OER operational potentials was not effective during long-term operation. There exists a gap between the potentials for effective Fe redeposition and OER operational potentials, which is the major obstacle for realizing self-healing in this catalyst. Here, we propose to improve the efficiency of Fe redeposition at the OER operational potentials by employing Co as a catalyst for the oxidative redeposition of Fe hydroxide. Using this concept, a Co-catalyzed self-healing mechanism is proposed and a borate-intercalated NiCoFe-LDH (denoted as NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub>) catalyst is designed and experimentally determined to show excellent self-healing ability under alkaline conditions while retaining high activity. The benign synthesis condition, the self-healing ability at low operational potentials, and the self-limiting thickness of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst also make it ideally suited for integration into photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems for solar fuels generation. As a proof of concept, a self-healing water splitting photoanode is demonstrated with an integrated NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub>/NiO/CuO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/n-Si photoanode, confirming that simultaneously stable and efficient performance can be obtained under alkaline conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Why self-healing is not achieved with NiFe-LDH catalysts</title><p id="Par5">Recently, it has been reported that short-term dynamic stability of Fe active centers in Fe-containing oxyhydroxides for OER can be achieved by adding Fe(III) ions into the KOH electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this approach, it is thought that the leaching of Fe active centers is balanced by the readsorption of Fe, which is governed by the adsorption energy between Fe(III) and other metal species in the catalysts. However, we find that catalyst stabilization based on this adsorption mechanism alone is not sufficient to maintain the stability of NiFe-LDH catalysts during long-term operation. To investigate this, borate-intercalated NiFe-LDH (denoted as NiFe-B<sub>i</sub>) catalysts were electrodeposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates in borate buffer containing Ni(II) and Fe(II) ions. The OER performance of the catalysts was tested using a three-electrode electrochemical cell (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). The long-term stability of the NiFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalysts was assessed at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> in different electrolytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). In particular, catalyst stabilization strategies were explored to compensate the losses of Fe catalytic centers and the intercalated borate ions (B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) by adding Fe(II) ions and potassium borate (K<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O, KB<sub>i</sub>) into the KOH electrolyte. Consistent with the findings of Chung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the stability of the NiFe-LDH catalyst was indeed improved in electrolyte containing both Fe(II) ions and borate ions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). However, while dynamic stability seemed to be achieved for the first 12 h of testing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), a gradual increase in the overpotential was observed after sustained long-term operation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Although the increase in overpotential was small, it indicated the catalyst was not ultimately stable and the degradation would eventually lead to the deterioration of catalytic activity over an extended period of time. The results indicate that self-healing of the NiFe-LDH catalyst cannot be achieved by simply adding Fe ions into the electrolyte. This could be ascribed to a reduced efficiency for Fe redeposition with increasing time due to the decreasing concentration of Fe ions in the electrolyte associated with gradual precipitation of Fe ions to Fe oxyhydroxides with low solubility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We found by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) that although 50 μM Fe ions were added to the 1 M KOH electrolyte, the concentration of soluble Fe ions in the freshly prepared electrolyte was only 16.7 μM, which drastically decreased to 2.6 μM after aging in air for 100 h (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Understanding this temporal change of Fe ion concentration is essential to the design of an effective self-healing strategy for long-term operation.

The deposition rates of Fe hydroxides revealed by in situ EQCM measurement showed that there was almost no deposition below 1.62 V vs. RHE.

Clearly, there exists a gap between the potentials for effective Fe redeposition and OER operational potentials, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>.

The redeposition of Fe occurs through the oxidation of Fe(II) ions dissolved in the electrolyte into Fe(III)OOH. Even though the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potential is relatively low (0.771 V vs. RHE), a previous study on the kinetics of electrochemical Fe(II)/Fe(III) oxidation has revealed that no oxidation of Fe(II) occurs at oxygen evolution potentials on an anode material (lead) without the introduction of a catalytic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Rather, such a catalytic effect was required for effective Fe(II)/Fe(III) oxidation at lower potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It has been discovered that some ions, such as Cu, Mn and Co, have a catalytic effect on the Fe(II)/Fe(III) oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Here, we hypothesize that the catalytic effect of Co(II) ions could improve the Fe redeposition efficiency at the OER operational potential, so that the dynamic equilibrium required for self-healing can be reached. Based on this idea, we propose to introduce Co into the NiFe-LDH lattice as a promoter for the self-healing of Fe catalytic centers.

Flat substrates were used for better understanding of the intrinsic catalytic properties of the deposited catalyst layer, which has a thickness of approximately 35 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). During electrodeposition of the catalyst layer, the catalytic effect of Co on the deposition of Fe (and Ni) was directly observed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). Compared with NiFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst deposited at the same current density or at the same potential, the molar surface density of Fe (and Ni) in the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst was significantly increased in the presence of Co(II) in the electrolyte.

The drastically enhanced OER activity after adding Co(II) ions suggests Fe was successfully incorporated, which is ascribed to the catalytic effect of Co on the oxidation of Fe(II)(OH)<sub>2</sub> to Fe(III)OOH. The catalytic effect of Co, which is consistent with previous observations of the oxygenation of ferrous iron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, bridges the gap between the deposition potential of Fe oxyhydroxides and the operational potential for OER, thus making self-healing possible. Our in situ sequential electrodeposition results are also consistent with previous findings which reveal that Fe, rather than Ni, is the active site for OER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, since the incorporation of Ni after the Co-catalyzed Fe deposition has no effect on the OER activity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5b, e</xref>).

In KB<sub>i</sub> electrolyte (0.25 M KB<sub>i</sub>, pH 14) without the addition of Fe(II) ions, the OER activity of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst quickly deteriorated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), suggesting that the borate buffer significantly increased the leaching rate of the Fe catalytic centers. After chronopotentiometric testing of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst layer at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> for 10 h in KB<sub>i</sub> electrolyte, the molar surface density of Fe decreased from 10.4 to 5.4 nmol cm<sup>−2</sup> according to ICP-MS analysis. The higher leaching rate is also consistent with the higher solubility of Fe ions in KB<sub>i</sub> electrolyte as compared to KOH electrolyte (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). However, the self-healing effect of Fe ions was pronounced in this experiment. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, for the first sample tested in freshly prepared KB<sub>i</sub> electrolyte, the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst degraded catastrophically after about 10 h. However, when the second and third samples were tested in the same electrolyte, the time for the catastrophic degradation was delayed to 35 and 60 h, respectively. This suggested that even the extremely small amount of leached Fe ions from the electrode into the electrolyte could slow down the degradation process of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst. By intentionally adding 50 μM Fe(II) ions into the electrolyte, the stability of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst was strikingly increased relative to that in KB<sub>i</sub> electrolyte without adding Fe(II) ions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), suggesting the effectiveness of the self-healing even under conditions that drive a high leaching rate. As Fe impurities are already present in the electrolyte of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers due to the adventitious Fe in KOH and the corrosion of stainless steel components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, commercial alkaline water electrolyzers are expected to be tolerant to the addition of small concentration of Fe(II) ions into the electrolyte.</p><p id="Par11">The influence of Ni(II) and Co(II) ions added into the electrolyte were also investigated. After testing the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst films in freshly prepared KB<sub>i</sub> electrolytes for half an hour, 30 μM of Ni(II), Co(II), or Fe(II) ions were added to the electrolyte, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The addition of Ni(II) ions did not prevent the degradation of the catalytic activity, from which it is concluded that they do not participate in the self-healing mechanism. While both Co(II) and Fe(II) ions were found to improve the catalytic activity of the samples, the causes for the improvement were found to be different. In particular, it was observed that the catalyst film thickness increased after the chronopotentiometry test in Co(II)-containing electrolyte, as confirmed by the significant optical darkening of the sample and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). As such, the improved catalytic activity is assigned to the increased loading of Co which also possesses moderate OER activity. In contrast, the morphology of the catalyst was unchanged after the chronopotentiometry test in Fe(II)-containing electrolyte, indicating that the improved catalytic activity was not due to the thickening of catalyst film, but truly due to self-healing.</p><p id="Par12">The stability of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalysts was tested in different electrolytes and the molar surface density within the films before and after testing was analyzed by ICP-MS of subsequently digested layers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>). In pure 1 M KOH electrolyte, the potential increased by ~23 mV after 100 h at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The degradation of OER activity was mainly due to the loss of Fe active centers during the OER process, as evidenced by the reduced molar surface density of Fe after the stability test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). When Fe(II) ions were added to the KOH electrolyte, the molar surface density of Fe increased after the stability test, suggesting that the self-healing mechanism of Fe redeposition was activated. However, the galvanostatic operating potential still increased by ~14 mV after 100 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), which was most likely due to the loss of intercalated borate ions, as evidenced by the reduced intensity of the B 1 <italic>s</italic> core-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak after the stability test (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). Furthermore, the ICP-MS data showed that the molar surface density of Ni was reduced after the stability test in Fe(II)-containing KOH electrolyte. Although Ni hydroxide is thermodynamically stable under the OER condition, the loss of intercalated borate ions could affect the structural integrity of the catalyst. The drastic structural rearrangement of α-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> to γ-NiOOH during OER could cause the destabilization and leaching of otherwise thermodynamically stable Ni species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. By further adding borate ions into the electrolyte to compensate the loss of intercalated borate ions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>), the degradation of the catalytic activity was eliminated, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>.

At a bias of 1.2 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent increased steadily for the first few hours and remained constant at approximately 29 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> for the remainder of the 100 h test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The photocurrent density-potential (<italic>J-V</italic>) curves in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> reveal a cathodic shift of the onset potential by ~50 mV after the stability test, which is attributed to the improved OER activity of the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst due to self-healing. As a result, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the photoanode was improved from 2.0% to 3.0% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The efficiency and stability of the photoanode compare favorably with previously reported n-Si photoanodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S20</xref>). The self-improved PEC performance of the photoanode demonstrates that the NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst is ideally suited for PEC applications.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>PEC performance of an integrated NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub>/NiO/CuO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/n-Si photoanode.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of the PEC device. <bold>b</bold> Chronoamperometric curve of the photoanode measured at 1.2 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G for 100 h. <bold>c</bold><italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic> curves of the photoanode before and after the stability test under AM 1.5G and in the dark. <bold>d</bold> ABPE curves of the photoanode before and after the stability test.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_26281_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">This work presents a self-healing strategy to address the long-term stability issue of NiFe-LDH catalyst due to the leaching of Fe catalytic centers. We found that in its usual configuration, self-healing of NiFe-LDH catalyst was not possible because catalytic Fe could not be redeposited at OER operational potentials. We proposed and investigated the introduction of Co as a promoter for in situ redeposition of Fe. A highly active borate-intercalated NiCoFe-LDH catalyst was synthesized using a simple electrodeposition method and showed no sign of degradation after OER tests at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at pH 14 for 1000 h (or at 300 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at pH 14.9 for 100 h), demonstrating its extraordinary self-healing ability under harsh OER conditions. The self-healing NiCoFe-B<sub>i</sub> catalyst we have realized for OER under highly alkaline conditions could not only find applications in commercialized alkaline water electrolyzers, but also in state-of-the-art CO<sub>2</sub>RR electrocatalysis systems. Furthermore, it is nearly ideally suited for integration into PEC systems, as demonstrated with a self-improving Si photoanode. Perhaps more importantly, the mechanism proposed herein provides a general guideline for the development of self-healing catalysts by employing additional constituents specifically designed to promote the self-healing of the catalytic centers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Preparation of electrodes</title><p id="Par19">FTO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with precision detergent (Alconox), deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol by ultrasonication for 15 min each.

Then a copper wire was soldered onto the Ag contact using indium. The exposed metallic parts were then encapsulated with epoxy (Araldite).

The pH of the KB<sub>i</sub> buffer was further adjusted to 10 by adding KOH.

The anode chamber and the cathode chamber were separated by a proton-exchange membrane (PEM, Nafion 117, Dupont). This prevented the deposition of Fe on the counter electrode as well as the deposition of leached Pt on the working electrode. The cell was integrated with a water jacket and the temperature of the electrolyte was maintained at 20 °C using a constant temperature water circulator.
