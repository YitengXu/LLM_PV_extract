In this study, we further exploited this hypothesis in both <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> C3 and the model green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. We found that both the rate of CEF around photosystem I and the activity of thylakoid membrane-located ATP synthetase increased significantly during N starvation to drive ATP production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutant <italic>pgrl1,</italic> which is deficient in PGRL1-mediated CEF, accumulated less neutral lipids and had reduced rates of CEF under N starvation. Further analysis revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling regulates N starvation-induced neutral lipid biosynthesis in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> by increasing calmodulin activity and boosting the expression of the calcium sensor protein that regulates Pgrl1-mediated CEF. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated CEF supplies ATP for N starvation-induced lipid biosynthesis in green alga. The increased CEF may re-equilibrate the ATP/NADPH balance and recycle excess light energy in photosystems to prevent photooxidative damage, suggesting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated CEF also played a key role in protecting and sustaining photosystems.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep15117.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep15117" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep15117</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biodiesel, one of the most commonly used biofuels, is an ideal recyclable energy carrier and thus also a potential primary energy source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Various biolipids can be used as feedstock for biodiesel production, including edible vegetable oils, non-edible oils and microalgae oils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. There has recently been a renewed interest in producing biodiesel from microalgae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, microalgae that can grow rapidly and convert solar energy into chemical energy via CO<sub>2</sub> fixation are now considered a promising oil source for biodiesel production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Lipid accumulation occurs within microalgal cells and varies with growth conditions. For instance, nitrogen (N) limitation or starvation increases lipid accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. When N supplies are insufficient to support the protein synthesis required for growth, excess carbon from photosynthesis is channeled into storage molecules, such as triglyceride or starch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Various microalgal species were reported to accumulate between 40 and 70% of lipid per dry cell weight (DCW) under N limitation or starvation conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Enzymes and structural proteins depend on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an end product of photophosphorylation and cellular respiration, to fuel biosynthetic reactions, motility and cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In green algae, two different pathways of electron transport during photosynthesis exist: linear electron flow (LEF) and cyclic electron flow (CEF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. During oxygenic photosynthesis, photosystem (PS) I and II cooperate to achieve a LEF that produces reducing power (NADPH) and generates a transmembrane proton gradient that drives ATP biosynthesis. CEF around PS I only produces ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The NADPH and ATP can be used in the Krebs and glyoxylate cycles to yield NADH for respiratory oxidative phosphorylation (ATP production) in the mitochondrion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Most of the ATP needed by algae is provided by photophosphorylation and respiratory oxidative phosphorylation. Although lipid accumulation is an energy storage process, additional energy in the form of ATP is required to drive this biosynthetic process. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying lipid accumulation in oil-producing microalgae is complex and the source of ATP that drives lipid accumulation under N starvation remains to be identified. We previously found that both the photophosphorylation and respiratory oxidative phosphorylation rates decrease during the N starvation induced oil droplet formation in <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> C3, while the rate of CEF increased, possibly producing the ATP needed for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism underlying these metabolic changes was unclear.</p><p>As a ubiquitous intracellular secondary messenger, Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an important role in the signal transduction events occurring in response to environmental stimuli, such as light, temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, water, nutrients and stresses in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors contribute to the response to N starvation in <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. by transducing extracellular stress signals to the cell that promote neutral lipid synthesis. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor calmodulin (CaM) senses changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and then regulates proteins to produce the appropriate response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The finding that RNAi-mediated down-regulation of the chloroplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (CAS) protein in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> strongly inhibits CEF and is rescued by increasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, suggests that CEF is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to identify the source of ATP during neutral lipid biosynthesis in green algae under N starvation, using both <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> C3, an oil-producing microalga isolated from the wild and the model green alga, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. We found that the rate of CEF around PS I increased under N starvation to compensate for the reduced rates of photophosphorylation and drive ATP production for neutral lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutant strain <italic>pgrl1</italic>, which exhibits restricted CEF, had significantly reduced neutral lipid accumulation under N starvation. In addition, the increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels under N starvation served as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that was transmitted through the CaM and/or CAS-mediated pathway to increase CEF. Based on these findings, we propose a working model for enhanced ATP production for lipid biosynthesis during N starvation that involves Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated CEF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CEF around PS I is the main source of ATP for neutral lipid biosynthesis</title><p>By microscopy observation, 18S rDNA sequencing and BLAST analysis, we isolated and identified a <italic>Chlorella</italic> strain named <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> C3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p>CEF around PS I, or cyclic photophosphorylation, drives the production of ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. As shown in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the key stages of N-induced oil droplet formation in <italic>Chlorella</italic> are as follows: day 0, the control stage (Cs); day 0–0.5, the pre-oil droplet formation stage (PDFs); day 0.5–2, the oil droplet formation stage (ODFs); and day 2–8, the late-oil droplet formation stage (LDFs). We proposed a role for CEF in ATP supply. To test whether CEF-mediated photophosphorylation supplies ATP for neutral lipid synthesis in <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> C3 under N starvation, we measured the electron transport rate in the photosynthetic chain at the four key stages of oil droplet formation. As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, the electron transport rate of PS II decreased continuously upon N- treatment, indicating decreased oxygenic photosynthesis driven by LEF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. By contrast, the electron transport rate via PS I, including both LEF and CEF, declined slightly at 0.5 d (the PDFs) and then slowly increased until 8 d (the ODFs) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the rate of CEF around PS I increased. We confirmed this finding by direct CEF rate measurements (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electron transport rates in <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> C3 during oil droplet formation.</p><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron transport rates via PS I and PS II.

As the decreased LEF rate resulting from N- treatment (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) inhibited the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient that could drive ATP synthesis in the chloroplast, the increased ATP synthetase activity was driven by the transmembrane proton gradient generated by the CEF around PS I (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).

The stimulated CEF (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) protects photosystems from oxidative stress, possibly by (1) directly dissipating light energy to drive the electron transfer and the formation of the proton gradient for ATP synthesis (which could then energize the lipid biosynthesis pathway) and (2) increasing ATP production to reduce the ATP/NADPH ratio. Therefore, as an important electron transfer pathway, the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated CEF supplemented the depressed LEF in photosystems under N starvation, suggesting the key role in protecting and sustaining the operation of photosystems.</p><p>Thus, as an important operating mode of the photosynthetic chain in photosystems, CEF plays many regulatory roles in cellular physiological processes besides ATP production. Based on the data in our previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and present study, we propose a scenario (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) in which a series of mechanisms is sequentially triggered in the oil-producing green algae in response to an increased ATP demand to produce neutral lipids and re-equilibrate the ATP/NADPH imbalance resulting from the inhibition of photophosphorylation driven by LEF and respiratory oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).
