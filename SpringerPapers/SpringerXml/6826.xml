However, despite the importance of this process, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the metabolic remodeling induced by N starvation and especially by stress recovery are still poorly understood, and new candidates for bioengineering are needed to make this process useful for biofuel production.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p>We have studied the molecular changes involved in the adaptive mechanisms to N starvation and full recovery of the vegetative cells in the microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> during a four-day time course.</p><p>High throughput mass spectrometry was employed to integrate the proteome and the metabolome with physiological changes. N starvation led to an accumulation of oil bodies and reduced Fv/Fm.. Distinct enzymes potentially participating in the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CAH7, CAH8, PEPC1) are strongly accumulated. The membrane composition is changed, as indicated by quantitative lipid profiles. A reprogramming of protein biosynthesis was observed by increased levels of cytosolic ribosomes, while chloroplastidic were dramatically reduced. Readdition of N led to, the identification of early responsive proteins mediating stress recovery, indicating their key role in regaining and sustaining normal vegetative growth.</p><p>Analysis of the data with multivariate correlation analysis, Granger causality, and sparse partial least square (sPLS) provided a functional network perspective of the molecular processes. Cell growth and N metabolism were clearly linked by the branched chain amino acids, suggesting an important role in this stress. Lipid accumulation was also tightly correlated to the COP II protein, involved in vesicle and lysosome coating, and a major lipid droplet protein. This protein, together with other key proteins mediating signal transduction and adaption (BRI1, snRKs), constitute a series of new metabolic and regulatory targets.</p></sec><sec

biofuel production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nutrient availability, temperature, and light intensity are the major environmental determinants of algal growth, reproduction, and morphology, including the accumulation of lipids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Photoautotrophically grown algae offer better solar energy conversion efficiency and a range of technical and ethical advances compared to traditional oil crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Considering their increasing importance as bioproducers and the need to achieve an optimized balance between lipid production and growth, thorough analyses of the underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate stress-induced accumulation of lipids in microalgae are necessary. Nevertheless, these analyses are still in a very early stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Growth-inhibiting conditions and an imbalance between carbon and some macro- and micro- elements such as Fe, S, Zn, or N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] lead to metabolic rearrangements modulating cell division, morphology, and photosynthetic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the accumulation of starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and/or lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to protect cellular structures and increase the microalgae survival probability under adverse circumstances. The accumulation of lipid bodies in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> under N deficiency has been recently documented in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], establishing a well-known environment in which changes in morphology and some key genes are defined.</p><p>These studies together with the availability of a sequenced genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], proteomics and metabolomics protocols and databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], pathway annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and a wide range of molecular biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and transcriptomics tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] make <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> the premier molecular model for research in microalgae.</p><p>The employment of recent advances in high throughput profiling methodologies has allowed the system-level characterization of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> at transcriptomic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], proteomic, and metabolomic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the present study, we have added a further layer of investigation, in particular distinguishing short- and long-term adaptive mechanisms and the recovery phase of the cells from N starvation to normal vegetative growth. In contrast to previous studies on differential gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] or metabolomics analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we have studied N starvation and the following recovery process after N readdition during a four-day experiment. Using classical physiological measurements, mass spectrometry for quantitative proteomics (GeLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS) and metabolomic (GC-MS) changes, and mining available datasets we depicted the responses of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to available N, showing the dynamic behavior of the biochemical pathways and metabolism to the N availability and providing new potential bioengineering targets for increased lipid accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physiological responses to nitrogen starvation and recovery in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> cells</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> cells show a high ability to adapt dynamically to environmental conditions. The stress adaption process is based in short- and long-term changes in metabolism affecting the morphological phenotype. Therefore, we have selected controls (0 h), three sampling times under N starvation (5 h-N5h, 24 h-N24h, 72 h-N72h), and two further samplings after N replenishment (77 h + N5h, 96 h + N24h), aiming to cover both short- and long-term responses for acclimation and recovery.</p><p>N starvation leads to a block of growth (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which is significantly slower than that in control cultures (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1). The fresh weight (FW) of the cultures was sustained during initial N starvation, and reduced after 72 h. Also, chlorophylls were affected, with a turn in the culture color from green to yellow under N starvation with a 30% decrease in Fv/Fm (Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As expected, N starvation induced a quick accumulation of lipids, a 1.75-fold increase in 72 h (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), most of them in the form of lipid bodies (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). N starvation is affecting the normal physiological behavior of the cells, blocking cell growth and reducing photosynthesis. Cells stop dividing probably because there is no available N for sustaining protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. Under these circumstances intracellular N should be recycled to support critical life-supporting pathways. Photosynthesis and antennas are reduced to avoid oxidative cellular damages and changes in cellular pools. The excess of available energy and carbon is then channeled into an increased production of lipids. Lipids act not only as an energy and carbon sink, but also in membrane stabilization.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Physiological measurements.</bold> Variations in the photosynthetic rate (Fv/Fm) and in the accumulation of lipids, fatty acids, and fresh weight during the experimental time course.

Notice that the autofluorescence of the cells is dramatically reduced at 72 to 77 h, indicating a sharp decrease in the pigment content. Lipid bodies disappear completely 24 h after the addition of ammonia (96 h). Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C until analysis.

The FW of cell cultures was increased 1.5- and 2.5-fold at 5 h or 24 h after N replenishment. The degradation of TAGs and also the recovered photosynthetetic activity probably provided the energy needed for this fast recovery of vegetative cell growth. These results support the hypothesis that there are sensing mechanisms that regulate not only N uptake and N assimilation, but also many other metabolic pathways (ranging from glycolysis to secondary metabolism) defining physiology and cell growth.</p><p>An initial functional overview of the changes in the proteome (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Tables S1, S2) and metabolome (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Table S3) showed that N starvation affects most of the cellular metabolism (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S2, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Figure S4, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S5, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Figure S6), that is, ammonia transport and fixation proteins, photorespiration, or oxidative pentose phosphate pathways.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) resulted in a similar classification of the samples (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Figure S7a, b; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Tables S4,S5) while sparse partial least square (sPLS) analysis gave a slightly different picture (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Figure S7c; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Table S6). PC1 seems to explain the adaption to N starvation: ammonia transport and assimilation enzymes are positively correlated to this component, while N demanding activities, like polyamine and protein biosynthesis, and amino acid degradation are negatively correlated. Furthermore, the high correlation of central metabolism enzymes and cGMP-dependent kinases showed that N starvation also affects normal respiration. The high correlation of glycerol pathways and C18:2 indicated the importance of lipid biosynthesis during N starvation. PC2, on the other hand, explains the N-starvation recovery and growth on the basis of an increased energy production through lipid degradation, and the recovery of the pigments biosynthesis. These findings support our previous hypothesis, based on physiological parameters, of how N starvation affects the cell function since the previously described effects can be explained at a biochemical level based on PC1 and PC2 (plotting other components does not improve the separation between groups (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Figure S7d, e, f)). Biclustering of functional categories of protein changes (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) against the time points of N starvation and N readdition demonstrated impressively that the recovered cells are more similar to the control cells and that there is a complete remodeling of cellular processes during starvation and recovery. Clusters of short- and long-term responsive functional processes can be identified. Furthermore, we have used sPLS networks in which protein and metabolites were used as predictive variables to explain the physiological parameters aiming to establish interactions between proteins, metabolites, and phenotype (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S5D, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Figure S8, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>: Figure S9).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Classification of the different samples according to multivariate methods.</bold><bold>(A)</bold> Principal componet analysis (PCA) of the integrated proteomic, metabolomic, and physiological datasets.

Glyceraldehyde-3-P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) showed maximum peaks at 72 h. Interestingly, one pyruvate kinase isoform (Cre06.g280950.t1.2) was only detectable after N depletion, showing a drop in abundance 24 h after N repletion. At the same time pyruvate increased after N repletion. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA2) and glucose-6-P-isomerase (PGIC) showed a peak after 5 h and were then repressed until N repletion. This repression might lead to the accumulation of the glucose-6-P-pool which could be channeled into starch synthesis. Indeed, starch accumulates during N starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Starch synthases (SS1, SS2, SS4, GBSS1) were upregulated during starvation, and quickly decreased after N repletion. The sugars fructose, glucose, and trehalose are accumulated during starvation (+15-, +5-, and +9-fold, respectively), being reduced after N repletion. Trehalose has been described as a substitute of N-containing compatible solutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and a positive regulator of starch biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. More recently a key role of trehalose in stress responses by regulating the SNF/bZIP system was postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Glucose and fructose can also act as regulators of this system involving hexokinase (HXK) and potentially sucrose and trehalose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, sucrose metabolism is not clarified completely in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. One gene which is at least assigned to sucrose metabolism is sucrose phosphate phosphatase (SPP). HXK and SPP abundances were already increased 24 h after N starvation, showing a maximum peak after 72 h, being quickly downregulated after N repletion.</p><p>On the other hand, the pool of glucose-6-P can also enter the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The rate-controlling enzyme of this pathway glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) showed an increased abundance under N starvation with a peak 5 h after N repletion (+3 to 5fold). In contrast, nonoxidative enzymes, transaldolase and cytosolic ribose-5-P-isomerase, showed an opposite trend with a minimum presence after 24 h of stress, potentially reducing the synthesis of ribulose-5-P (see discussion below).</p><p>To extend the classical correlation analysis, we applied Granger causality analysis (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]). Here, time-lagged correlations are exploited with the potential that pairs of precusors and products can be identified. The Granger causality function is implemented in the COVAIN toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The COVAIN function also applies a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to reveal only significant correlations (for further information see the COVAIN manual; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.univie.ac.at/mosys/software.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.univie.ac.at/mosys/software.html</ext-link>). Because of the low number of time points, only a few Granger causalities have been identified and they have to be treated carefully. For example, in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A Granger causality showed a steady increase of NADH:ubiquinone reductase (Cre09.g415850.t1.2) that was negatively correlated with one of the precursors of NAD-biosynthesis nicotinic acid (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A), pointing to an increase in mitochondrial activity. The citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid, TCA) enzymes were in general upregulated, with a twofold increase for most of the proteins after 72 h, and a quick return to control levels after N repletion. Both succinate dehydrogenase (SDH2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH1) behaved the same. The abundance of TCA intermediates was not consistent with a unified response of this pathway. Pyruvate concentration is reduced during N starvation while malate is accumulated. Succinate and oxalate levels are constant during the whole experiment. The malic enzyme (ME3) also remains at constant levels during N starvation, but after repletion its abundance is increased sevenfold, which is correlated to a fivefold decrease of malate abundance. The upregulation of the TCA cycle is also functional for the production of carbon backbones for amino acid biosynthesis by anaplerotic reactions.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Examples for identified Granger causalities.</bold> Metabolite, protein, and physiological data were combined and analyzed with respect to time-shifted correlations using the toolbox COVAIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

These results showed that, as proposed by Plumley and Schmidt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], the efficiency of PSII during N starvation is not mainly limited by protein content but by other compounds such as chlorophylls.

By contrast, proteins involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation were overaccumulated: two ammonia transporters (g3261.t2, Cre13.g569850.t1.2) were induced by N starvation. Interestingly, Cre13.g569850.t1.2 accumulation continued with a maximum abundance 24 h after N repletion (a threefold increase compared to 24 h of N starvation), indicating a long responsive time in this element. Enzymes of the Glu-Gln (GS/GOGAT) system were also upregulated, and the abundance of all glutamine synthase (GS) isoforms increased five- to tenfold, just to decrease quickly to control levels after N repletion. On the other hand, glutamate synthase (GSN) isoforms behave differentially: GSN1 abundance is stable, while GSN2 was induced by N starvation. Glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH1, GDH2), involved in N degradation, showed a tenfold decrease starting to respond to N repletion after 24 h (slower than GS and GSN enzymes).

We detected a differential behavior between chloroplast and cytoplasmic ribosomes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Figure S4).

However, these proteins quickly responded to N replenishment, recovering its initial abundance values in 5 h. Our data refine the current model of ribosome recycling following N starvation, in contrast to previous theories pointing to an untargeted ribosomal degradation-resynthesis. Here, we rather observe a targeted accumulation of cytosolic and a degradation of chloroplastidic ribosomes. Furthermore, the differential behavior of cytosolic, increased, and chloroplast, decreased, ribosomes suggests a more active role of the nuclear encoded proteins for adapting to N starvation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Response of lipid metabolism to N starvation</title><p>N starvation led to the accumulation of lipids (Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) mainly in the form of TAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In consequence we expected to detect upregulated lipid biosynthetic pathways but, surprisingly, most of the enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis were not changed after starvation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S5A). The key enzymes 3-ketoacyl-CoA-synthase 1 (KAS1), which catalyzes the reaction of acetyl-ACP with chain-extending malonyl-ACP, and one isoform of enoyl-ACP-reductase (Cre06.g294950.t1.3), which catalyzes the last step of the fatty acid biosynthesis, are downregulated. This behavior was previously shown at protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The downregulation of two triglyceride lipases (Cre01.g002400.t1.3, g9707.t1) suggests that this decrease compensates the decrease in lipogenic enzymes allowing an effective lipid accumulation. At transcript level a modest increment (less than +2-fold) of biosynthetic genes of fatty acids under N deprivation was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. An undescribed monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthase annotated to locus g14367.t1 showed a +3-fold change following N starvation. The product of this reaction could serve as a substrate for the desaturation of oleic and linoleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] while also controlling the cell proliferation by blocking replicative DNA polymerase as described in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The pool of glycerol, essential for the formation of TAG, was significantly increased after N starvation (+4-fold; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Table S3), and can be explained by the accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/dihydroxyacetone-3-phosphate reductases (GPD2, GPD4) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S5B). These enzymes showed a high correlation to glycerol in the interaction network (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S5C). This network also links acetate, glycerol, and C18:2, oxidoreductases, ribosomal proteins, and a major lipid droplet protein (Cre09.g405500.t1.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].

Cre09.g405500.t1.3 was not detected at 0 h, but from 5 h to 72 h it increased its abundance up to 14-fold. Proteins for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transport and assimilation and specific signaling proteins (BSU1) were also part of this network. These results demonstrate the power of the integrative networks based on sPLS-correlation for discovering new interactions between proteins and metabolites, allowing the capability to also accurately associate uncharacterized proteins to functional clusters.</p><p>N starvation leads not only to the accumulation of lipids, but also to the change of the total lipid composition of the cells.

Chloroplastidic desaturase ∆12 (CDD12, Cre13.g590500.t1.2) is eightfold reduced at transcript level, and may explain the reduction in C18:3. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase ∆9 (SCD, Cre09.g397250.t1.2) transcripts are twofold increased during N starvation and may also explain the increase of C18:2.

As expected, the levels of histones and other core proteins did not significantly change with time, whereas other chromatin-interacting proteins followed different dynamics. N starvation induced an initial decrease in RNA polymerase I and RNA helicases, which were partially recovered after repletion. On the other hand, N starvation triggered the accumulation of DNA binding proteins, such as Cre06.g252000.t1.2, a leucine/zipper transcription factor, which was quickly silenced again after N replenishment (a fivefold reduction in 5 h). An Argonaute-like protein (AGO; Cre04.g214250.t1.3) was also induced by N repletion, suggesting a role of the siRNA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

The reduction of PSII activity would lead to the production of less reactive oxygen species, but at a cost of reducing ATP and NADPH production. But even in a situation of reduced growth, as observed under N starvation, energy is still necessary to sustain metabolism. We detected an increase of cyclic electron flow proteins which pump H<sup>+</sup> to the thylakoid lumen in order to increase ATP production. Furthermore, and based on the metabolic reconstruction, an increased pool of glucose-6-P was predicted. Part of this glucose-6-P can join the initial reactions of the oxidative pentose pathway. The corresponding enzymes were accumulated, rather than glycolytic enzymes. In contrast, nonoxidative enzymes, transaldolase, and cytosolic ribose-5-P-isomerase showed an opposite trend with a minimum presence after 24 h of stress, potentially reducing the synthesis of ribulose-5-P. The pool of ribose-5-P could enter the chloroplastic reductive pentose phosphate pathway to produce 3-phosphoglycerate, which can continue with the glycolytic pathway. The result of this reprogramming could be the production of enough pyruvate and NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> to support biosynthetic processes at a cost of half ATP payback compared to glycolysis. This hypothesis was supported by the accumulation of phosphoribulokinase (PRK1), which followed the same abundance trend as G6PDH and 6PGDH. These changes in protein abundance are coincident with the changes in the mRNA expression levels given by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] in an N-depletion study; furthermore, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] recently described the increased accumulation in the metabolites 3-phosphoglycerate and ribose-5-P during N starvation. This remodeling, although energetically unfavorable, can be used by the cell to maintain adequate levels of NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, which are required to maintain an increased lipid production. However, future studies applying flux analyses are necessary to investigate these processes in more detail.</p><p>The functional role of cyclic electron flow and the quick recovery of PSII efficiency (correlated rather to pigment biosynthesis than to the recovery of PSII proteins) indicate that photosystems and electron transfer chain were fully functional during N starvation, even though the abundance of some subunits and cytochromes was reduced.</p><p>Athough CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes were in general reduced, the abundance of CCM proteins CAH7, CAH8, and PEPC1 increased. CAH7 was only detected after a long exposure to N depletion (72 h) and may explain why this enzyme was not detected in previous studies limited in time to not more than 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. CAH7 and CAH8 are similar and both of them contain a hydrophobic chain which localizes them in periplasmic space associated to the plasma membrane, probably covering decreased CAH1 and 2 activities and transferring inorganic CO<sub>2</sub> to a transport system or pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The specific role of these CAHs under nutrient deprivation remains undetermined and cannot be easily explained at this time. By contrast, the kinases belonging to the Snrk2-SNF2 family have an essential role in the control of gene expression through the activation of bZIP transcription factors and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. These were quickly responsive to N starvation in our experimental system. Kinases of this family control the lipid accumulation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and have been linked to increased tolerance to N deficiency in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] or S in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. SNF families, also implied in energy sensing and gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], control the metabolic response to other stresses like cold acclimation, inducing the accumulation of sugars and starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The accumulation of the signaling molecules glucose-6-P and trehalose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and the specific dynamics of HEX and SPP found in the N starvation, provide an extra support to this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Branched chain amino acids linked N metabolism and cell growth</title><p>The unavailability of N caused a rearrangement of amino acid metabolism at the same time. The pool of glutamate, essential for ammonia assimilation, was drastically reduced after starvation, triggering aspartate aminotransferases and citrate synthases from the oxoglutarate pathway. Enzymes belonging to branched chain amino acids (BCAs) were negatively correlated to the abundance of Val, Ile, and Leu, which indicates that enzyme abundance is increased to compensate the lower abundance of BCAs. Leu and Ile were significantly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9) to Cre16.g687350.t1.2, an acyl-CoA oxidase and mediator of amino acid degradation, and a monofunctional catalase which may be controlling the oxidative damage. Interestingly, the same interaction cluster was found when analyzing the sPLS-based network; it was the bridge that linked FW and amino acid-nitrogen clusters.</p><p>The increased abundance of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase subunits (CMP1, CMP2) and the dynamics shown by arginine and ornithine suggest the importance of the urea cycle for recycling the ammonia originated in the protein breakdown.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Are glycerol metabolism, MLDP, and COP II proteins key elements for lipid droplet formation and TAG accumulation?</title><p>The increased abundance of total lipids and lipid droplets following N-deprivation could indicate that the TAG of the droplets is synthesized de novo. The expected increase of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway was, in general, not present but two Acetyl-CoA-Synthetases (g1224.t1, Cre12.g507400.t1.2) required for the activation of fatty acids and forming part of lipid droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] were significantly accumulated. Glycerol metabolism, needed to provide the backbone for the glycerolipid biosynthesis, was significantly responsive, with a combined accumulation of the proteins of this pathway of more than 50-fold. Cre09.g405500, a major lipid droplet protein (MLDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], increased 14-fold under N starvation and was linked to C18:2 and glycerol, showing further correlation (&gt;0.93) with clathrin and COP II, which forms vesicle coats and allows liposome fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The MLDP protein was identified by Moellering and Benning and by James <italic>et al.</italic> after analyzing lipid bodies associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Recently Wase <italic>et al.</italic> described a similar behavior of this protein under N deprivation, showing a 4.1-fold change after six days of culture without nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. MLDP is highly correlated with lipid accumulation during N starvation and dropped completely after N replenishment. MLDP and other proteins linked by sPLS and Granger causality analysis such as COP II provide hub proteins in the adaptation process to N starvation and revovery (see Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). These proteins are involved in vesicle formation, suggesting their strong role in lipid body formation, thereby confining the TAGs into storage structures and promoting their accumulation. Lipid body formation can be also influenced by GTPases as COP II protein is inactivated by GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], which we also found to be decreased during N starvation. Correlation networks need to be further analyzed since they also reach fatty acid and starch biosynthetic enzymes, pointing to key processes and promising targets for strain engineering.</p><p>The increased C18:2 and the consequent alteration of the different fatty acids suggest a remodeling of the membranes, and thus fatty acids in membranes seem to be recycled into TAGs. TAG lipases and phospholipases were downregulated.</p><p>N repletion led to an increased beta-oxidation for rapid lipid degradation and also increased the abundance of five acyl-CoA-oxidases. These were not correlated to enzymes of the BCA metabolism, demonstrating differential regulatory pathways. The lipase Cre01.g002400.t1.3 that was recovered after N replenishment was negatively correlated (&gt;|0.9|) to the translation initiation inhibitor (Cre12.g551350.t1.2) and a protein showing a DNA methyltransferase domain (Cre12.g508050.t1.2). This might indicate that the transcriptional response to N starvation is regulated not only by transcription factors, but also by epigenetic mechanisms, as suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Can N recovery help us to understand lipid accumulation or metabolism and provide new targets for biotechnological improvement of oil production?</title><p>The study of specific changes occurring 5 h and 24 h after N resupply provides specific targets that could have potential use for bioengineering applications. Some of them have been depicted above (PEPC, CAH); however, there are specific targets that can be highlighted. One of the possible ways of intervention involves the enzymes and proteins related to lipid body stabilization and degradation with MLDP a key protein in the lipid biogenesis network. MLDP has been studied extensively and, despite its silencing by RNAi, does not lead to an increased lipid accumulation; however, the droplet size is significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. This is a surprising result since our data, and also that of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], points out that the abundance of this protein is positively correlated to lipid accumulation. The combined manipulation of this protein together with beta oxidation, silencing acyl-CoA oxidases (especially Cre16.g687350.t1.2, Cre11.g467350.t1.2) and lipase (Cre01.g002400.t1.3), could result in an increased accumulation of lipids. Lipid transporters also play a key role in lipid metabolism, with Cre15.g641200.t1.2 a mitochondrial fatty acid transporter as a responsive candidate. g13764.t1, Cre13.g573150.t1.3 (hydroxylases) and Cre11.g467350.t1.2 (acyl-CoA oxidase) were accumulated (hydroxylases) or repressed (acyl-CoA oxidase) under N starvation, following the same trend as its transcripts.</p><p>Interestingly, these genes were not reported to be significantly expressed under other stresses such as C, S, or Fe deprivation or oxidative stress according to AlgaePath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. However, finding central metabolism enzymes related to lipid biogenesis and only responsive to N starvation (when comparing with the available NGS/proteomics datasets) is particularly difficult. Furthermore, modifying the gene expression of a number of genes is tricky, and a perfect flux model should be available in order to avoid unintended effects. Previous attempts to increase lipid accumulation by targeting specific genes have not been completely successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This indicates that lipid accumulation is the result of a complex regulatory network linking cellular processes such as vesicle formation as well as processes of central metabolism such as G6P, branched chain amino acids, and energy metabolism. This is clearly demonstrated by the system-level analysis of our study.</p><p>In this sense, our results and other proteomic and transcriptomic datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] show many complementary genes/protein clusters responsive to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This suggests that there are major points of metabolic regulation based on common signaling elements that can be considered as potential targets for increasing lipid accumulation. Numerous DNA and RNA binding proteins and helicases showed differential accumulations in our assay (described above), but these candidates could not be easily proposed as biotechnological targets since their interaction network is unknown. On the other hand, the BRI1 suppressor (Cre01.g050850.t1.2), an inhibitor of BRI1, a receptor-like kinase which is responsive to brassinosteroids located both in plasma and in nuclear membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], was correlated to glycerol and C18:2, and it is known to initiate a signaling cascade leading to regulation of gene expression in the nucleus through BZR/BES proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. BZR is known to block the metabolic switch in response to P deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] and other abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and also inhibits chloroplast development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], so a similar effect could be expected in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Thus, blocking not only the receptor, but also the transcription factor BZR by 14-3-3 proteins may be needed to respond to N starvation. In our dataset a 14-3-3 protein responding to N deprivation and recovery was quantified (Cre06.g257500.t1.2). The BRI1 suppressor was only detected when N was not present in the medium, showing a quick adaptive response to environment.</p><p>FtsH chloroplast metalloproteases are closely related to development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], and chloroplast function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], also regulating lipid degradation in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. We found three metalloproteases (Cre12.g485800.t1.2, Cre17.g720050.t1.2, g14586.t1) that were downregulated when N was absent from the media. Interestingly, and according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and considering all available datasets, Cre17.g720050.t1.2 responds only to N starvation, making this enzyme a potential candidate for further study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The comprehensive analysis of systemic responses to N starvation and recovery in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> demonstrated that metabolism and growth are significantly affected at a system level.

Val, Leu, and Ile are positively correlated to a monofunctional catalase grouping with amino acids, and on the other side to an acyl-CoA oxidase linked to the FW.
