Commonly, perovskite devices used in such tandem architectures are in the so-called âinvertedâ or positive-intrinsic-negative (<italic>pin)</italic> configuration, due to their superior stability and reduced optical losses when integrated into tandem devices. Additionally, these devices feature bandgaps wider (â¼1.7â1.8âeV) than typical perovskite cells optimised to maximise single junction efficiency (â¼1.5 to 1.6âeV). However, one major issue related to wide bandgap PSCs is the management of their energy losses. Firstly, compared to their narrower bandgap counterparts, wide bandgap perovskites are known to suffer from significantly larger open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) non-radiative losses, commonly limiting the V<sub>OC</sub> toÂ the â¼1.2âV range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Historically, the origin of these V<sub>OC</sub> losses was proposed to be caused by halide-segregation and the consequent shift of the effective energy bandgap to lower values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This phenomenon is connected to the high Br content required to achieve bandgaps above 1.6âeV and a resulting phase instability with these halide compositions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, more recently, this picture has been challenged by several studies which have demonstrated that halide segregation can only account for a small part of the overall V<sub>OC</sub> losses and that the limiting factor is mostly related to non-radiative recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the transport layers (TLs), before halide segregation has even commenced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it has been shown that devices featuring methylammonium-free wide-gap perovskites, not exhibiting halide-segregation, still suffer from substantial V<sub>OC</sub> losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, the same study also showed that wide-gap PSCs display a significant mismatch between the internal quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) achieved by the absorber and the external V<sub>OC</sub> of the device, the latter being substantially lower even for highly optimized and efficient devices. Additionally, strong V<sub>OC</sub> losses are commonly associated with a larger trap density in wide gap bromide-rich perovskite materials, limiting the potential of the absorber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Another loss mechanism that wide-gap PSCs currently face is related to a reduction in short-circuit current (J<sub>SC</sub>) under continuous illumination. A recent study demonstrated that ion redistribution in perovskite devices can induce screening of the internal field and limit the charge collection at short-circuit conditions, effectively limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the final device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, maximizing the built-in voltage (V<sub>bi</sub>) in the perovskite absorber has emerged as an imperative strategy to efficiently extract the photogenerated carriers at short-circuit conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it has also been shown that perovskite devices exhibit substantial PL emission even at short-circuit conditions, meaning that charge extraction is not yet fully optimized and a significant fraction of charges still undergo recombination within the bulk of the perovskite absorber layer, even at short-circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In this work, by coupling theoretical and experimental approaches, we investigate and effectively reduce these two major types of losses in <italic>pin</italic> wide-gap (1.8âeV) PSCs. At open-circuit conditions, we theoretically demonstrate that the V<sub>OC</sub> is mostly limited by a poor energetic alignment between the perovskite and the charge transport layers (CTL), causing a detrimental QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch. Experimentally, we use guanidinium bromide (GuaBr) and imidazolium bromide (ImBr) to induce a low dimensional phase at the top surface, which eliminates the QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch, improving the V<sub>OC</sub> of the device. At short-circuit conditions, we find that the J<sub>SC</sub> losses are related to poor charge extraction, which is consistent with internal field screening induced by mobile ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We find that modifying the hole transporting layer (HTL) with a series of ionic interlayers or by using molecularly thin self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as HTLs enhance the charge extraction, which we infer to be due to maximizing the internal field at the perovskite/HTL interface, limiting the effect of the ionic screening. Our fully optimized devices, featuring a SAM as the HTL and ImBr as surface modifiers, allow for suppression of the QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch, achieving V<sub>OC</sub> values as high as 1.29âV, and a strong reduction of the J<sub>SC</sub> losses, reaching J<sub>SC</sub>s up to 17âmA/cm<sup>2</sup> and fill factors (FFs) above 80%, and corresponding efficiencies of 17%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Understanding the QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch in wide-gap devices</title><p id="Par5">In a recent study, we showed that wide-gap PSCs suffer from a significant mismatch between the internal QFLSÂ and the external V<sub>OC</sub>, even for highly optimized devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. According to that study, as schematically represented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, such effects can be caused by the energetic misalignment originating from using a wider perovskite bandgap with the same transport layers originally optimized for 1.6âeV devices. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, drift-diffusion simulations of a series of perovskite <italic>pin</italic> devices with varying bandgaps show how the evolution of the V<sub>OC</sub> with respect to the perovskite bandgap is strongly affected by the energetic alignment of the transport layers. To understand the specific processes behind the open-circuit losses, we perform drift-diffusion simulations on a model 1.8âeV perovskite device utilizing phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transporting layer (ETL) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as the HTL, based on the results from Oliver et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Simulation details can be found in Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. For clarity, here we focus only on discussing the perovskite/ETL interface, but the same argument can be translated to the HTL interface. In agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we observe how, in a standard wide bandgap device, the combination of energetic misalignment between the perovskite and the ETL and fast interface recombination induces a significant mismatch between QFLS and V<sub>OC</sub>, limiting the V<sub>OC</sub> to values below 1.2âV, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>. In such a scenario, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, at open-circuit conditions, the energetic mismatch between the perovskite/ETL does not allow for the electrons reaching the PCBM layer to be reinjected into the perovskite. As a result, the large density of electrons in the PCBM canÂ non-radiatively recombine across the interface with the free holes present in the perovskite at the proximity of the interface I<sub>1</sub>, creating a constant depletion of carriers, causing the QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. According to the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) formalism, the rate of trap assisted recombination (<italic>R</italic><sub>SRH</sub>) for unbalanced electron and hole densities, as is the case in the regions near this interface, will depend almost exclusively on the minority carrier density, in this case, holes in the perovskite (<italic>n</italic><sub>h</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup><disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math id="Equ1_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">SRH</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Details of the full derivation can be found in Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.Â According to this picture, an efficient approach to reduce the non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface consists of directly modifying the perovskite surface so that the hole density in the proximity of the PCBM interface is reduced, as presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. The whole thickness range of the simulation results is presented in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. Consequently, by reducing the hole density at the interface I<sub>1</sub>, recombination of charges across this interface is effectively nullified, despite the energetic alignment being in principle still detrimental. This is visible by the small recombination current at I<sub>1</sub> in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. As a result, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, the V<sub>OC</sub> is greatly enhanced, and the QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch eliminated. Importantly, this approach allows us to access the internal thermodynamic potential of the wide-gap perovskite material without the need for optimising transport layers depending on the perovskite bandgap.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Drift-diffusion simulations.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram representing 1.6âeV and 1.8âeV perovskite solar cells using a hole and electron transport layer optimized for the 1.6âeV cell.

In Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>, the PFN-P2 treatment applied on the PTAA surface in our reference devices is replaced with a bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide Li salt (Li-TFSI), or one of two quaternary ammonium compounds, tetramethylammonium Br (TMA-Br) or tetraethylammonium TFSI (TEA-TFSI). Although similar salts have been used as passivating agents or to enhance device stabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, in our study, we use a combination of anions and cations with different sizes to investigate the effects of mobile (Li<sup>+</sup>, Br<sup>â</sup>) or immobile (TMA<sup>+</sup>, TEA<sup>+</sup>, TFSI<sup>â</sup>) ionic species at the interlayer between PTAA and perovskite. The device metrics presented in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref> reveal the superior interface enhancement when both ions are large/immobile, such as for TEA-TFSI. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, devices using TEA-TFSI to treat the PTAA surface (optimized in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>), exhibit a significant enhancement in FF, exceeding 80%, and improvement in J<sub>SC</sub>. Moreover, the TEA-treated samples exhibit a modest but beneficial increase in the V<sub>OC</sub> and overall better reproducibility, especially for large area devices. This might be attributed to a beneficial passivation effect of TFSI in contact with the perovskite, as recently demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>, the limited device performance when the TEA-TFSI is mixed into the perovskite bulk indicates that the improvement comes mostly from an interfacial effect rather than a modification of the perovskite absorber. To combine the beneficial effects of both optimized interfaces, GuaBr and ImBr are next applied in devices also utilizing TEA-TFSI. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>, although the devices show consistently enhanced J<sub>SC</sub>, the improvement in V<sub>OC</sub> originating from GuaBr and ImBr (in combination with TEA-TFSI), is not as beneficial as in the case of the standard PTAA devices, not improving the PCE further.</p><p id="Par8">In another approach, we exchange the PTAA HTL with the SAM Me-4PACz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, in this case, to improve the wetting of the perovskite on the SAM, a highly diluted solution of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles is used as an interlayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the SAM devices reported in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> significantly outperformed the PTAA devices, reaching V<sub>OC</sub>s up to 1.24âV and J<sub>SC</sub>s up to 17âmA/cm<sup>2</sup>. In this new architecture, we again observe beneficial effects when GuaBr and ImBr are applied onto the perovskite surface. Similarly to the PTAA devices, the ImBr treatment is found to be consistently the most effective, greatly enhancing the V<sub>OC</sub> up to 1.28âV and the FF to above 81%. As shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>, for ImBr-optimized devices the use of the PCBM:PMMA blend is no longer necessary to increase the V<sub>OC</sub> and the removal of the PMMA exhibits devices with lower hysteresis. The resulting champion device shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> exhibits a steady-state and JV-scan PCE of â¼17%, a V<sub>OC</sub> of 1.27âV and a FF exceeding 82%. Notably, the fully optimized devices show an average PCE improvement of &gt;3% absolute compared to the starting reference. Importantly, the ImBr treated devices again show a reduced performance gap between small and large area devices. Consequently, as exemplified in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>, also large area cells (1âcm<sup>2</sup>) areÂ also able to reach a steady-state V<sub>OC</sub> of 1.29âV, a FF exceeding 80% and a JV-scan PCE of 17%. Exemple forward and reverse JV scans, and steady-state PCEs for all device configurations shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref> are presented in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>.</p><p id="Par9">The effective device bandgap of 1.8âeV was estimated by using the inflection point of the external quantum efficiency EQE<sub>PV</sub> onset, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref>. We did not observe a significant variation in bandgap energy regardless of the substrate on which the perovskite films crystallize (between 1.795 and 1.801âeV), as confirmed by absorption measurements in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>. Consequently, the J<sub>SC</sub> improvement observed in our devices, confirmed by EQE<sub>PV</sub> measurements in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S13</xref>, is unlikely to originate from greater light absorption. Following a recent study by Thiesbrummel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, to confirm if the J<sub>SC</sub> differences are related to charge extraction issues, in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> we investigate the time-dependent evolution of the current when switching the device from V<sub>OC</sub> to 0âV under light. We find that the magnitude of J<sub>SC</sub> decreases over time, suggesting a progressive reduction in charge collection efficiency. In agreement with the JV scans, modifying the PTAA surface with TEA-TFSI effectively reduces the J<sub>SC</sub> losses from &gt;2âmA/cm<sup>2</sup> to about 1âmA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, using Me-4PACz additionally reduces the losses to only 0.5âmA/cm<sup>2</sup>, predominantly maintaining the initial J<sub>SC</sub> over the measurement time. On the other hand, in the PTAA devices modifying the perovskite surface with ImBr reduces the degree of J<sub>SC</sub> decay to a small extent, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>, and shows no additional benefit in SAM devices, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S15</xref>. Overall, this set of results suggests that the improved J<sub>SC</sub> originates mostly from enhanced charge extraction and that it can be tuned by modifying the transport layer interfaces, with a major effect on the HTL side. In order to check that this process is not related to any permanent degradation mechanism, we compared the J<sub>SC</sub> decays when measuring the same sample multiple times (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S16</xref>). Consecutive measurements show identical behaviour, clearly demonstrating that the J<sub>SC</sub> decay is a fully reversible process and not related to any permanent effect. We will return to this point later in detail, to discuss the mechanism behind the reduction in J<sub>SC</sub> decay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Structural characterization</title><p id="Par10">To elucidate structural changes induced by the GuaBr and ImBr treatments, we record X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for all films (SAM cases are shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, PTAA and TEA-TFSI are given in Figs.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S18</xref>). The diffraction pattern for the untreated film confirms the primary perovskite phase, which we index as a cubic cell with lattice parameter 6.17(65) Ã. We do not note any significant difference in the XRD patterns of the perovskite deposited on different HTLs. All films contain PbI<sub>2</sub> (2Î¸â=â12.7Â°) with comparable scattering intensity in the PTAA and TEA-TFSI films but reduced for the SAM films. Following the surface treatments, scattering features emerge at 11.7Â° and 13.1Â° in the case of GuaBr and at 11.5Â° for ImBr, related to new secondary phases.

The new peaks following GuaBr treatment most likely correspond to a mixed halide 4H polytype phase (illustrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, which is indexed as a hexagonal unit cell with lattice parameters <italic>a</italic>â=â<italic>b</italic>â=â8.77(57) Ã, <italic>c</italic>â=â14.94(28) Ã, Î²â=â120Â° and volume 996.6 Ã<sup>3</sup> (calculated XRD pattern is shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S21</xref>).

Given that the peak positions of the 4H polytypes are consistent for different concentrations, the larger unit cell with ImBr treatment could indicate greater incorporation of the treatment cation. Deviations from the purely 4H character at the extreme concentrations indicate a trend from face-sharing to corner-sharing octahedral connectivity at higher treatment concentrations in both cases. This observation is consistent with greater Br<sup>-</sup> incorporation, with I<sup>-</sup> generally preferring to occupy face-sharing sites in mixed-halide polytype phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">These changes in the film composition with the surface treatments are commensurate with morphological differences we observe with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Additionally, brighter (electron-dense) platelet-like crystallites visible on the film surfaces indicates the presence of unreacted PbI<sub>2</sub>. After treatment with GuaBr (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, <bold>ii</bold>), these features are no longer visible and instead small round grains have formed. In the case of the ImBr treatment, the surface structure has significantly evolved (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, <bold>iii</bold>), with the bright grains being replaced by small grains with different morphologies visible on the film surfaces. The effect of both treatments is consistent for each HTL (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S23</xref>) and suggest the newly formed polytype material is primarily at the film surface. In Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S24</xref>, we also acquired cross-sectional SEM images of the films with each treatment, and as expected, we find that the perovskite bulk grain structure is unaffected by the surface treatments.</p><p id="Par13">We investigate this surface effect further with grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, detailed in Figs.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S25</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>. The 2D diffraction pattern from a neat SAM film (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3ei</xref>) confirms the preferred &lt;110&gt; orientation of the 3D perovskite phase, as well as the typical out-of-plane orientation for the PbI<sub>2</sub>. After surface treatment, we observe characteristic scattering from the GuaBr and ImBr-induced phases in agreement with the XRD measurements, with isotropic Debye-Scherrer rings showing these phases have no preferred orientation. Azimuthally integrated 1D plots of the GIWAXS data (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S26</xref>) confirm greater intensity from the secondary phases than in the XRD, consistent with a higher concentration of the secondary phase near the surface, as opposed to throughout the bulk of the film. Moreover, we also find that the remaining PbI<sub>2</sub> now has isotropic orientation, confirming that interaction with the post-treatments has resulted in a reorganisation of the film surface.

In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the PLQY of the neat perovskite film of 0.7% is improved to 1% and 2% after GuaBr and ImBr treatments respectively, indicating effective surface passivation. Most importantly, the large PLQY losses induced by the PCBM layer are strongly reduced by either GuaBr or ImBr treatments, approaching similar PLQY values of the neat perovskite on glass. Consistent with the device V<sub>OC</sub>s, ImBr outperformed GuaBr. Contrary to 1.6âeV devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the PTAA/PFN-P2/perovskite interface shows a significant reduction of PLQY, denoting strong interface recombination at the HTL/perovskite interface. Consistent with the V<sub>OC</sub> of the full devices, the TEA-TFSI does not show any significant improvement. Importantly, as shown in Figs.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S30</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>, all half-stack perovskite films deposited on PTAA, present a significant degree of phase segregation and, therefore, the PLQY is estimated by fitting only the emission at 700ânm, as reported in a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As such, the losses and QFLS calculated from half-stacks on PTAA only represent an estimate of the non-radiative recombination losses. However, when the PTAA is replaced with the SAM, no halide segregation is observed during the measurement (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S30</xref>) and the PLQY approaches that of neat perovskite on glass, denoting almost complete elimination of the interface recombination induced by the transport layers, consistent with previous findings for lower bandgap perovskites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This phenomenon has been previously associated with more efficientÂ charge extraction by the SAM layers compared to PTAA, which avoids a build-up of interfacial charge, responsible for phase segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The associated non-radiative energy losses are presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, calculated with respect to the thermodynamic limit of the perovskite absorber as detailed in Figs.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S32</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S33</xref>. To check that the nanoparticulate Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> âwetting layerâ is not influencing the recombination at the SAM/perovskite interface, we investigate the PLQY and non-radiative losses for aÂ SAM/perovskite sample with and without Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S34</xref>). Given that the losses at the interfaces of the two samples are the same, we can conclude that the additional Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticle treatment is not influencing the recombination mechanisms of this interface and therefore not changing our conclusion about the role of Me4PACz as HTL. By measuring the PLQY of full devices it is possible to compare the internal QFLS and the external V<sub>OC</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, we find that our reference device suffers from a very large QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch of almost 100âmeV. With regard to the reference device with PTAA/PFN-P2, treating the perovskite surface with GuaBr and ImBr helps to reduce the mismatch quite substantially. The devices with TEA-TFSI show only a modest decrease of QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch and no effect upon GuaBr and ImBr treatment, in agreement with the device JV data in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>. Finally, when the HTL interface is also fully optimized by using the SAM, the combination with ImBr eliminates the QFLS-V<sub>OC</sub> mismatch entirely enabling to access the internal thermodynamic potential (for V<sub>OC</sub>) of the perovskite absorber layer.

At open-circuit, no carriers are extracted from the device and hence the PL intensity is high. Under short-circuit conditions, we expect the PL to be significantly quenched due to the carriers being extracted from the solar cell and hence no longer being available for recombination within the active layer. Comparing these two operational conditions, we can observe that the different device optimizations have an impact on the remaining PL and hence QFLS at short-circuit conditions, indicative of significant free carrier density still present in the device during charge extraction. By comparing the PL at these two conditions we quantify the âqualityâ of charge collection of our devices.

These results agree with recent findings which revealed efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to the ITO by using the Me4-PACz SAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the case of TEA-TFSI and SAM devices, the ImBr and GuaBr treatments do not increase the quality of charge collection, consistent with the JV results. Interestingly, similarly as for the J<sub>SC</sub> decays, we observe that the biggest impact on the charge collection efficiency originates from modifying the HTL interface rather than the perovskite surface. Overall, we find that the collection quality maps are qualitatively in very good agreement with the J<sub>SC</sub> trend obtained from the JV scans presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, as well as with the J<sub>SC</sub> decays.</p><p id="Par20">To establish a physical model of the enhanced collection efficiency, we perform steady-state and time-dependent drift-diffusion simulations implementing mobile ions on modelled PTAA, TEA-TFSI and SAM devices. The reference PTAA device has been modelled following a combination of experimental results and theoretical models previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We modelled the TEA-TFSI device by adding a 1ânm interlayer with high ionic density (10<sup>18â</sup>cm<sup>â3</sup>) between the perovskite and the HTL, where the ions (positive and negative) were homogeneously distributed within this layer and fixed in position so that they do not displace when an electric field is applied during simulated operation. For the SAM device, we simulated the SAM by using a 1ânm HTL, with the HOMO level set to align 0.1âeV shallower that the VBM of the perovskite and with lower interface recombination velocity (in comparison to PTAA/Perovskite). For all the models, we allow a certain density of ions from within the perovskite absorber layer to redistribute throughout the device layers under operation. WeÂ also investigated allowing both negative and positive ions to redistribute during measurements and found that in order to replicate the current loss at short-circuit that we observe experimentally, we need to allow onlyÂ the positive ions to build up within the HTM layer. The details of the simulations can be found in Supplementary NoteÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>. In Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S40</xref>, the simulated JV curves are found to be in good agreement with the experimental trend. The time-dependent simulation results show that the simulated J<sub>SC</sub> decays, presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, qualitatively follow the experimental results presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> with the different device configurations. We first examine the built-in voltage drop in the perovskite in the proximity to the HTL at <italic>t</italic>â=â1âs and the variation of the mobile ion distribution (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>). In our model, we assume that cations from the perovskite can diffuse into the PTAA HTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Consequently, we simulate that a large density (surface charge density of 10<sup>12â</sup>cm<sup>â2</sup>) of cations accumulates within the PTAA layer, which consequently screens a large fraction of the available internal field in the perovskite. On the other hand, despite that in the model all layers are permeable to ions, the high ionic density of the ionic-interlayer or the ultra-thin HTL (simulating the case of TEA-TFSI and SAM respectively), inhibits the diffusion of a large density of mobile ions into the HTL causing an accumulation of ionic charges at the perovskite/HTL interface and the formation of a narrow Debye layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, these last two scenarios lead to a field at the <italic>p</italic>-interface in favour of hole extraction. We note that because of reduced interface recombination, the very thin HTL case exhibits the largest J<sub>SC</sub> even if the internal field in this region is slightly lower compared to the ionic-interlayer simulation. A schematic representation of the band diagram (simulated in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S41</xref>) corresponding to these conditions is depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>. As presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>, despite the difference in J<sub>SC</sub> decays between samples, we find that at 0âV, in all cases, the internal field in the bulk is screened over time due to ion redistribution. Despite that, in the case of the TEA-TFSI modification and the SAM, part of the initial internal field remains, promoting charge extraction. The correlation between the reduced J<sub>SC</sub> decays and the voltage drop at the <italic>p</italic>-interface indicates that theÂ charge collection is strongly influenced by the extraction efficiency in the proximity of the HTL interface rather than in the perovskite bulk where the remaining field is small in all conditions. We also note that the upward band bending at the HTL interface, besides promoting hole extraction, also repels electrons, which can reduce non-radiative recombination of non-extracted carriers at short-circuit conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Impact of surface treatment on stability</title><p id="Par21">Lastly, we investigate if there is any impact of the surface treatment and the lower dimensional phases induced by the GuaBr or ImBr on the stability of the perovskite films and devices. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6aâc</xref>, we present the performance of devices over time, thermally stressed at 85âÂ°C in N<sub>2</sub> in the dark. The GuaBr devices show a faster degradation than the âreference devicesâ, with average PCE reaching 80% of its peak (T<sub>80</sub>) after ~480âh, as compared to a T<sub>80</sub> lifetime of ~800âh of the SAM reference devices. The ImBr devices exhibited the highest thermal stability, reaching an average T<sub>80</sub> of ~950âh. This effect is clearly visible in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>, where the V<sub>OC</sub> improvement of the ImBr device is maintained for &gt;1200âh, whereas the V<sub>OC</sub> of the GuaBr devices falls below the reference cells after &lt;200âh of thermal stress.

In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6fâi</xref>, we show photographs and UV-Vis absorption spectra of perovskite films with and without surface modification aged in air under ambient light and 40â45% relative humidity. We observe that the films which have been treated with GuaBr undergo a relatively rapid change in appearance, turning from dark brown/black to light brown, and a reduction in the strength of the absorption onset after only 3âdays. In contrast, the ImBr treated films exhibit a predominantly unchanged absorption profile and characteristic black perovskite films after 13â15âdays, whereases the reference films show a small change over this timescale. We show further images of aged perovskite films in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S42</xref>. It, therefore, appears that the GuaBr treatment results in a deterioration of the ambient stability of the perovskite films, whereas the ImBr treatment results in a small improvement in the ambient stability of the perovskite films, in comparison to reference untreated films.</p><p id="Par23">These results highlight that although in terms of device performance the two different surface treatments exhibit comparably beneficial effects, only the ImBr treated devices retained their initial improvement, enhancing the general stability of the perovskite material. Possibly, the Gua<sup>+</sup> cation can diffuse and incorporate in the bulk 3D perovskite structure more easily than Im<sup>+</sup>, inducing additional degradation of the original perovskite phase. However, there could be a number of different causes, which are important to reveal in order to realise a generalisable strategy for passivation and long-term stability enhancement of metal halide perovskite materials and devices.</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, we have used a fundamental understanding of the operational device physics of wide bandgap PSCs to identify key losses in performance, and engineer improvement strategies to deliver enhanced widegap perovskite thin-films and solar cells. Specifically, we have rationalized that using either very thin HTM layers (SAMs) or introducing an ionic interlayer is important for reducing the short-circuit current of <italic>pin</italic>Â perovskite solar cells. Introducing a surface passivation layer, which results in the growth of a low dimensional top layer, is important for reducing the voltage losses, eliminating the discrepancy between QFLSÂ and V<sub>OC</sub>, allowing accessÂ to the full potential of the absorber material. As such, we demonstrated that the major limitations of these devices are not related to the material itself but mostly to the transport layers and interfaces. Our results highlight how using optoelectronic modelling to guide device and interface engineering can lead to successful optimization of widegap PSCs, potentially leading to a more successful implementation in tandem solar cells with higher efficiencies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Device fabrication</title><p id="Par25">Glass substrates coated with patterned indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, Biotain Crystal Co., 10â15 ohm/sq.â1) were washed with acetone, Hellmanex III, deionised (DI) water and isopropanol (IPA).

The hybrid perovskite single-junction solar cells were completed by thermal evaporation of Ag electrodes (100ânm) through shadow masks under high vacuum (6âÃâ10<sup>â6</sup> torr) using a thermal evaporator (Nano 36, Kurt J. Lesker) placed in ambient environment. The devices used for thermal stability uses Au electrodes instead of Ag.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>External quantum efficiency (EQE)</title><p id="Par26">The external quantum efficiency of our devices was determined using Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy.
