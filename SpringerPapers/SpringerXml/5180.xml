Therefore, bioenergy source identification in this region is crucial to better understanding biomass potential and utilization. On the other hand, national bioenergy development usually refers to government policies, including granting permits to use forest land, especially on unproductive land. Thus, balanced utilization of tropical forests as an energy source is required. It must consider several aspects comprehensively, including its function in protecting the surrounding landscape, contributing to food security, and creating economic opportunities for communities around forest areas. This paper addresses biomass utilization in the Wallacea region aligned with Indonesian policy targets for bioenergy generation to achieve the net zero emission target by 2060. The study is carried out by limiting the scope of the area and relying on international databases and the nation’s potential targeting biomass research. In addition, the recent development of conversion technologies is adjusted based on available biomass types, including geographic information systems for potential biomass analysis. The analysis and data synchronization are presented in charts, graphs, and tables. In the early section, the potential of biomass in the Wallacea is explained. The following section discusses several scenarios, routes, and utilization technology options for biomass utilization. Various studies that have been conducted are presented in this section, including machine learning adoptions to model and optimize biomass conversion processes. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities are discussed by looking at various factors, such as accessibility, socio-economics, life cycle assessment, and environmental issues.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tropical biomass</kwd><kwd>Geographic information system</kwd><kwd>Wallacea</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Conversion technology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>British Council COP26 Trilateral Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The University of Tokyo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13399_2023_Article_4223.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><title>Highlights</title><p>• Wallacea is a meeting point between Asia and Australia with rich biodiversity.</p><p>• Biomass utilization in the Wallacea should be aligned with the national bioenergy policy.</p><p>• Biomass potential and suitable conversion technologies have been discussed.</p><p>• A matrix related to biomass feedstock and its utilization technology was proposed.</p><p>• Machine learning and optimization algorithms can be used to boost biomass use.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Developing a sustainable energy system requires encouraging renewable energy, reducing environmental impact, and high efficiency at competitive costs. The use of renewable energy to diversify the energy mix for achieving the net zero emission target is increasing. Various countries compete in promoting renewable energy and include long-term roadmaps in their energy mix. Biomass is a crucial alternative to renewable energy because it is considered carbon neutral and widely spread evenly worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Carbon neutral is a term to describe the state where the net release of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or other greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere is zero. It means that the amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere is balanced by the amount removed from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted through various measures, such as reducing emissions, carbon sequestration, or using renewable energy sources. Biomass is a complex compound with components generally consisting of starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, proteins, and other minerals. Analyzing and considering the different characteristics of each type of biomass can significantly determine the appropriate biomass treatment, including suitable conversion methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For example, high moisture biomass requires drying as a pretreatment to increase its calorific value. Also, high alkali and alkaline earth metals in the feedstock must be washed before utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the energy input demand for drying and water washing can significantly reduce the overall efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Based on human intervention, biomass can be categorized into three types: natural plants (aquatic and terrestrial plantations), energy crops, and biomass waste, as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Forestry is an example of the first category, where resources can grow naturally and be utilized for human needs. In addition, biomass is grown and dedicated to energy sources such as biofuel production in energy crops. In energy crops, the fuel produced can be solid, liquid, or gas. Furthermore, they can be converted depending on the demand to generate electricity or heat. Finally, biomass waste is advantageous for energy use because it is inexpensive and can reduce the environmental impacts of inappropriate disposals and treatments, such as open burning and landfilling.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>General classification of biomass</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4223_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Based on the region, biomass can be classified into the tropical, sub-tropical, boreal, and temperate domains. The tropics is the area between the tropic of Cancer (23.5°N) and Capricorn (23.5°S), with complex weather patterns and various environments. The tropical domain covers most global forests, up to 45%, followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The temperature in the tropical area tends to be uniform without significant differences except in the highlands. This area has an average temperature of at least 18 °C and receives enough rainwater in its soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since most terrestrial biomass is located in the tropical domain, it can become essential to the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Tropical forests are believed to accommodate more than 50% of the world’s biodiversity and store two-thirds of all the carbon in terrestrial plants, making them incredibly valuable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Burning biomass for energy use has been carried out for a long time and can significantly impact atmospheric chemistry and climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Indonesia is an archipelagic tropical country with abundant and diverse biomass potential. There are many sources of biomass from forests, plantations, and agriculture, which include wood residue, rice husks, corn residue, and special wood plantations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Wallacea, as part of the tropical region, attracts much attention from researchers because it is a meeting point between Asia and Australia and has rich biodiversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This paper discusses the scenarios for using biomass as an energy source, including the available technologies, especially for the Wallacea region. Constructing feasible technological scenarios and end-products is also important to build sustainable bioenergy-based systems. Furthermore, it is aligned with Indonesian policy targets for bioenergy generation to achieve a carbon–neutral target by 2060. Firstly, the potential of biomass in the Wallacea region needs to be addressed. The following section discusses several scenarios, routes, and utilization technology options for biomass utilization. Various studies that have been conducted are presented in this section, including the adoption of machine learning (ML) to model and optimize biomass conversion processes. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities are discussed by looking at various factors, such as accessibility, socio-economics, life cycle assessment (LCA), and environmental issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Energy situation and potential resources in Indonesia</title><p id="Par6">Indonesia’s primary energy supply in 2021 was 225.65 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), which was dominated by fossil energy sources, especially coal (36%), followed by oil (32%) and gas (16%), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Biomass utilization was estimated at 11% of total energy, equivalent to 23.88 Mtoe, higher than other renewable energy, including hydropower, geothermal, and PV utilization. The national energy mix policy targets a contribution of 31% by 2050 for renewable energy. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) also sets a 29% emission reduction with a contribution of 314 million tonnes (Mt) of reduction in the energy sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This sector is predicted to generate about 1,669 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> under the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario in 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Adding large coal power plants in recent years will significantly affect the emissions. New coal power plants with a total capacity of 4,800 MW, for example, at least potentially emit 27–32 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) annually if it is not equipped with carbon capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Primary energy supply in 2021 (<bold>a</bold>) and in 2050 (<bold>b</bold>), as targeted by the government

Indonesia has the potential for geothermal, hydro (including micro-hydro), biomass, and solar of 29.5, 94.5, 32.7, and 207.9 GW, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although with a total potential of 443.2 GW, the installed renewable energy capacity was only 11.6 GW in 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Mahidin et al. reported that the potential biomass in this country is around 130 Mt, equivalent to 34.4 Mtoe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The findings are meant to encourage higher biomass utilization in the future and to guide the development of energy and forestry policies. They reported that the potential energy of forest biomass in Indonesia was about 132 PJ, with 50.4% from harvesting residues and 49.6% from wood processing residues. A higher number was reported in another study of 1261 PJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Differences in approaches for estimation are likely to affect the output. Another study reported the breakdown for each type of biomass, especially for crop waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The study took into account the area of the plantation and the specific waste per area (t/ha). They reported palm oil waste has a potential of about 32.86 Mt annually, followed by coconut (7.11 Mt), rubber trunk (3.79 Mt), and sugar cane (2.73 Mt). This country produces the largest palm oil in the world, owing to the massive expansion of palm plantations and high global demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A potential of 40 to 168 GL of bio-methanol could be generated for fuel, according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It equals half of Indonesia’s current power consumption, potentially reducing emissions by 9 to 38% of the total carbon emitted yearly.</p><p id="Par9">In the electricity generation sector, renewable energy utilization is still limited. A study shows fossil-based fuels are still dominant for the next few decades to meet electricity demand (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A massive breakthrough is needed to achieve the government’s decarbonization target, especially for net zero emission in 2060. In the energy sector, efforts have been focused on strategies such as switching to cleaner fuels as alternative approaches to reduce emissions and environmental impacts, including co-firing of coal and biomass and hydrogen energy development. This approach is considered suitable because both can replace hydrocarbon fuels completely. Biomass utilization as a power plant has a potential capacity of 32 GW, spread over many islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The agricultural and forestry sectors are very promising fuel sources, especially from their waste. Palm oil waste, such as palm kernel shells (PKS), empty fruit bunch (EFB), and palm oil mill effluent (POME), has the greatest potential (more than 10,000 MWe) compared to other biomass wastes, such as rice husk and municipal solid waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Stich et al. estimated a biomass potential of about 407 TWh annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Power generation with biomass, in general, can be performed via co-firing with coal. This method is considered promising because of its relatively low cost. However, co-firing has several challenges, primarily related to boiler performance due to the impact of the ash produced. The characteristics of the ash produced can interfere with the performance of boiler heat exchangers. Further investigation is required to ensure co-firing sustainability for the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The demand for power generation by type of fuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4223_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Biomass potential in the Wallacea region</title><p id="Par10">The Wallacea archipelagic region is the islands in the central part of Indonesia, consisting of Sulawesi, the Nusa Tenggara, Timor Island, and the Maluku Islands, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.

In this process, a gasifying agent such as water, steam, or oxygen is generally used to produce a mixture of syngas (H<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, and light hydrocarbons. The utilization of gasification to convert biomass waste, such as rice husk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and wheat straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], has been reported. The gas produced can be used in power plants and processed into H<sub>2</sub>, dimethyl ether (DME), methanol, ethanol, or other fuels. Gasification can also be combined with an integrated system to produce higher efficiency, called the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). Among the common problems faced by the gasification process is the production of tar and unwanted contaminants, such as alkaline compounds, increasing the cost of purification. A gasification reactor’s performance can be influenced by the type and design of the gasification reactor/gasifier, biomass composition, temperature, catalyst, and gasification agent. Gasification technologies can be classified into types: fixed or moving bed, fluidized bed, and entrained flow, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. Compared to the other gasifier, a fluidized bed has numerous benefits such as uniform heat transfer, high biomass-to-gas conversion rates, and flexibility for large-scale production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Even though it might be suitable for coal on a large scale, using an entrained gasifier for biomass waste is not applicable due to its high moisture content and required fine particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Advanced methods for optimization</title><p id="Par30">An approach using a mathematical model is needed to solve problems that involve high complexity, non-linear parameters, and high-dimensional, including those related to the design of thermal conversion processes, optimization, and intensification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, models can be used to determine optimal operating conditions, including various possible outputs for a system. Models can also enable real-time process control and optimization and forecast critical process performance parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Among these strategies, ML has recently attracted considerable attention to optimizing biomass conversion processes, yield prediction, real-time monitoring, and process control, where artificial neural networks (ANN) have been the most commonly used algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The ANN is frequently employed to solve complex non-linear problems for biomass conversion via thermochemical or biochemical processes. Other ML approaches, such as support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), are also widely employed.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Using ML in biomass utilization, presented by Muzammil et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] developed a model to predict several parameters during hydrothermal treatment using biomass wastes such as algae and food waste. The dataset is a compilation of 18 published papers, considering several features, including elemental composition, temperature, and other operating conditions. They found that nitrogen content, solid content, and temperature are the most critical factors in determining some output properties. In addition, Mohammadreza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] compared ML methodologies for predicting the kinetics of hydrothermal carbonization of selective biomass. They found that when the reaction kinetics were fast, the ML models differed from the experimental data. However, it is generally inferred that the ML techniques are suitable for interpolating and extrapolating the kinetics of the hydrothermal carbonization process. Gopirajan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] also concluded that an ML-driven optimization approach is better suited for a process that involves many parameters, such as the hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass.</p><p id="Par32">Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] used ML to understand, predict, interpret, and optimize biomass gasification using information obtained from raw material conditions and gasifier specifications. The results revealed that the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model predicted the compositions of three-phase products and syngas well. Higher H<sub>2</sub> yield could be achieved under several conditions, such as high temperatures (&gt; 800 °C), higher carbon, and lower nitrogen contents. ML-based models were developed for co-pyrolysis biomass to generate biofuel and biochar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The models were trained, tested, and validated using hundreds of biochar and bio-oil data to predict yields of biomass pyrolysis. The authors also offered some analysis techniques to understand the effect of different parameters, thus providing excellent insight into this topic. Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] also used big data and ML to maximize char yield and higher heating value from biomass or other solids pyrolysis. They found that the developed polynomial regressions could accurately predict the desired outputs if the inputs are well known. The gradient boosting model also performed well with high accuracy based on pyrolysis feedstock and operation conditions. In addition, coal-biomass co-pyrolysis models were also studied using collected experimental results from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The data involved 30 biomass and 28 coal samples, such as corn stalks, husks, white pine, and wood waste. The solid fuel compositions were collected and analyzed, including experiment parameters such as the heating rate and the coal-biomass ratio. Among the results, temperature conditions are the most determining factor during co-pyrolysis, followed by mixture ratio, fuel characteristics, and heating value.</p><p id="Par33">ML is also widely used to predict and solve complex biochemical conversion problems.

Furthermore, a fermentative hydrogen production model has been developed using the ANN approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>].

A non-isothermal simultaneous pretreatment and saccharification were also performed. AI-ANN was employed in optimization modeling, adopting process parameters such as temperature, residence time, strain ratio, and substrate loading. In conclusion, every modeling and optimization approach developed has advantages and disadvantages. Using only one evaluation criterion to pick the best ML model is insufficient because each study has different objectives and methodologies. ML and optimization algorithms have advantages over conventional approaches in terms of precision and accuracy and potentially boost the use of biomass as an energy source in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p id="Par35">Currently, sustainable renewable energy development in the Wallacea region faces specific challenges from both technical and regulatory perspectives, such as economic, social, and environmental.

On a regional scale, information is needed regarding how much biomass can be utilized. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>, not all the total biomass waste can be used for energy. This estimate also needs to consider future projections, providing short-, mid-, and long-term estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Although forestry and biomass industries offer relatively cheap and easy access, field measurement may still be required to calculate the recoverable biomass accurately. Even though it is abundant, if it is not easily accessible, it will increase recovery costs due to location constraints and tenure/land management constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Location constraints are challenges in collecting and distributing biomass from harvesting to processing locations. Location-related costs are also determined by distance, mode of transportation, and terrain encountered. A study reports energy consumption while transporting biomass, assuming that one truck can transport 5 t of biomass with 3 km/L of fuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. From the calculation, it is obtained that to distribute a distance of 30 km, 75 MJ/t of dry biomass energy is needed. This value is considered relatively small compared to the energy required in the drying process. In addition to location factors, social, political, and cultural conditions will influence the decision-making process related to the use of biomass because it involves land ownership/land rights.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The hierarchy from available biomass to recoverable biomass</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2023_4223_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par41">In the economic aspect, the assessment shows that converting biomass residues into wood pellets will increase the country’s forest resources’ value and government revenues from natural resource assets.
