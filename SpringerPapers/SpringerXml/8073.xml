We have succeeded to scale-up a type of gas aggregation source, called a multiple ion cluster source, for the generation of complex, ultra-pure nanoparticles made of different materials. The high production rates achieved (tens of g/day) for this kind of gas aggregation sources, and the inherent ability to control the structure of the nanoparticles in a controlled environment, make this equipment appealing for industrial purposes, a highly coveted aspect since the introduction of this type of sources. Furthermore, our innovative UHV experimental station also includes in-flight manipulation and processing capabilities by annealing, acceleration, or interaction with background gases along with <italic>in-situ</italic> characterization of the clusters and nanoparticles fabricated. As an example to demonstrate some of the capabilities of this new equipment, herein we present the fabrication of copper nanoparticles and their processing, including the controlled oxidation (from Cu<sup>0</sup> to CuO through Cu<sub>2</sub>O, and their mixtures) at different stages in the machine.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2018_Article_25472.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">By reducing the dimensions of a material to the nanometer regime, new physicochemical properties emerge that lead to a wide range of novel applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Currently, a large variety of technological fields, such as catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or biomedicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> have an increased need for high throughput methods for the production of clusters and nanoparticles (NPs) with a precise control of size, shape and composition. Wet chemistry protocols meet the requirements of high throughput with relative simplicity and low cost. However, they have intrinsic limitations regarding the purity, size distribution and, for particular NP configurations, thermodynamic restrictions also exist. For an extreme control of the reaction conditions and purity of the clusters and NPs produced, gas-phase techniques working in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) present the ideal environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, thanks to the absence of ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, albeit with lower throughput. Amongst these, sputter gas aggregation sources developed by Haberland and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have become the most popular, not only due to the fraction of ionized NPs, which allows mass/charge selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but also to the wide variety of materials that can be sputtered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In order to overcome the throughput limitation, we have designed and built a scaled-up gas aggregation source. Different approaches have been developed during recent years in order to obtain large NP fluxes with gas aggregation sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In our case, the new design is based on an adjustable multi-magnetron or Multiple Ion Cluster Source (MICS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which incorporates three independent magnetrons inside an aggregation zone. Although the MICS has emerged as a precise tool for the controlled fabrication of complex NP architectures with adjustable chemical composition, size and structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the approach presented here represents a further step in terms of the tailored generation of controlled nanoparticles with high throughput. The new design of the scaled-up MICS is the origin of the <italic>Stardust</italic> machine, an innovative experimental station devoted to the production of large amounts of NPs, which also offers the possibility of in-flight manipulation (i.e.: gas injection at different stages, heating, accelerating,…) and <italic>in-situ</italic> characterization by electron spectroscopy techniques and thermal desorption spectroscopy.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>Stardust</italic> was originally designed to simulate cosmic-dust formation and processing in the circumstellar region of evolved stars. The ultimate goal is to fabricate in the laboratory the nanoparticles that constitute the refractory part of this cosmic dust. Today with the new generation of telescopes and antennas, such as the ALMA interferometer in Chile, we start to obtain detailed information on the physical and chemical conditions that lead to the formation of this refractory dust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding, the range of use of <italic>Stardust</italic> can be extended far beyond this original conception to many different fields of application in nanotechnology. <italic>Stardust</italic> offers a unique workbench to unravel the properties of individual NPs through in-flight processing and analysis.</p><p id="Par5">In this article, we present a description of the technical solution adopted to build the <italic>Stardust</italic> machine and some representative results to demonstrate its capabilities. In particular, we have focused on the precise fabrication, manipulation and <italic>in-situ</italic> analysis of Cu nanoparticles. One of the most interesting processing capabilities involves the reaction with gases at different stages (or modules) in <italic>Stardust</italic>. In this respect, we have performed a controlled oxidation study of Cu NPs.</p><p id="Par6">Copper-oxide NPs exhibit a different band-gap as a function of stoichiometry and therefore it is possible to tune their optical and electronic properties from metal to semiconductor. Thus, the preparation of high-quality copper-oxide NPs with a narrow size distribution are of increasing interest in fields such as solar energy conversion cells or catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Cu based NPs have been previously produced using gas aggregation sources, either for fundamental studies concerning the fabrication process itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, or for testing new cluster sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, to our knowledge, an accurate control of the Cu oxidation state through reactive sputtering using gas aggregation sources that avoid poisoning of the target has not been previously reported. Here we present a fabrication route based on a sputter gas aggregation source with controlled oxygen injection at different stages of NP formation, using the gas-processing capabilities of <italic>Stardust</italic>, which allows accurate tailoring of the degree of oxidation of the NPs, from metallic Cu through Cu<sub>2</sub>O to CuO. The results are compared with oxidation treatments performed on Cu NPs supported on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The stardust machine</title><p id="Par7">In order to provide the maximum flexibility for the fabrication, manipulation and analysis of nanoparticles, <italic>Stardust</italic> was conceived as a modular device.

The presence of three completely independent magnetrons inside the aggregation chamber, allows the simultaneous use of up to three different targets for a precise generation of clusters and NPs of different sizes, composition and structure, ranging from single element particles to alloys or core-shell nanostructures, with a precise control of the stoichiometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. A scaled-up MICS was designed in order to achieve high NP fluxes and larger NP sizes. This new device, fabricated by Oxford Applied Research Ltd. under the name MICS3, employs 3 magnetrons of 2” diameter (instead of 1” from the original design). The aggregation zone where the three magnetrons are located has been re-dimensioned and two facing path-troughs towards the exterior have been included at both sides. These new entrances can be used either for pressure measurements, plasma monitoring or for gas injection. Further information about this module is provided in Section <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> of the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).</p><p id="Par9">The NPs produced in the MICS module can be further manipulated, analyzed or collected in other modules. The subsequent three modules are dedicated to the monitoring and modification of physical properties of the generated NPs. They are called <italic>Diagnosis</italic>, <italic>Oven</italic> and <italic>Acceleration</italic> modules.</p><p id="Par10">In the <italic>Diagnosis</italic> module the NPs yield can be monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-1 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It also incorporates a fast entry port for the introduction of substrates, allowing samples to be prepared for <italic>ex-situ</italic> analysis. An electrostatic quadrupole deflector can guide the charged particles towards a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The quadrupole can be placed in line with the NP beam to perform mass filtering. In an initial configuration, it was mounted in line, but to increase throughput we consider the configuration described to be a better option. Full details of this module are given in the ESM, Section S2.</p><p id="Par11">After travelling through the diagnosis chamber the NPs enter the <italic>Oven</italic> module. In their path through this module the NPs are immersed in an IR-bath, absorbing the electromagnetic radiation during their transit, which results in an increase in their temperature. Details of this module are provided in the ESM, Section S3.</p><p id="Par12">The last manipulation module of <italic>Stardust</italic> is the <italic>Acceleration</italic> module, where it is possible to modify the speed and trajectory of the NPs during their travel through it using charged particle optics, and/or induce interactions with injected gases. Just before the exit of this module, a Faraday cup and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-2 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are installed to help monitoring all processing in the chamber. A scheme of this sequence is provided in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>.1 of the ESM.</p><p id="Par13">Finally, in the fifth module called <italic>ANA</italic>, <italic>in-situ</italic> analysis of the NPs can be undertaken by electron spectroscopy techniques and thermal desorption spectroscopy. A PHOIBOS 100 1D electron/ion analyzer with a one-dimensional delay line detector allows X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and low-energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS) to be performed. Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) is performed using a Pfeiffer HiQuad QMG 700 with QMA 400 mass spectrometer, with a mass range of 0 to 512 amu, and a CP 400 ion counter preamplifier (Detection limit 10<sup>−15</sup> mbar).</p><p id="Par14">With the exception of the MICS module, the disposition of each module in the machine can be modified to adapt the experimental set-up to a particular scientific objective. Thus, they can be placed in the standard configuration, presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, removed or placed in a different sequence. This design confers high versatility to the whole system. In the near future, an additional module called <italic>INFRA-ICE</italic> will be incorporated. This will be equipped with an infrared spectrometer and a closed-cycle helium cryostat and will further boost the characterization capabilities of <italic>Stardust</italic> allowing both the study of deposited clusters/NPs and ice-analogs using reflection and transmission FTIR spectroscopy.</p><p id="Par15"><italic>Stardust</italic> includes five gas entry points (depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), three in the MICS module where the NPs are fabricated, one in the Acceleration module where the NPs are still in the gas phase and one in ANA, where the NPs are collected on a substrate. This broadens the versatility of <italic>Stardust</italic> for NP processing, not only in terms of the modification of the composition of the NPs, but also for heterogeneous catalytic processes. Gas mixing systems have been implemented to allow dosing of gases and liquid vapors (detailed information in Section S5 of the ESM).</p><p id="Par16">In order to have a highly controllable and clean environment for the fabrication of NPs, it is of paramount importance to have a system base pressure that is as low as possible. Special care was taken to use stainless steel gas pipes and CF flanges.

Furthermore, in these conditions the use of the grid and the Einzel lens increase the NP rate more than a 50%, thanks to the acceleration and focusing effect. These tools would lead as well to an increase in the NP rates discussed above.</p><p id="Par42">Gas injection at different stages of Stardust evidenced differences depending on the gas entry point used. This versatility opens the route to reactions with gases at different stages of the formation of NPs, during their flight along Stardust or supported on substrates. Here, using the oxidation of Cu NPs as a showcase, an exquisite control of the stoichiometry of the resulting NPs was achieved when the oxygen is injected in the aggregation chamber (during NP formation). On the contrary, once the Cu NPs are supported on HOPG, it is not possible to oxidize the Cu NPs in the experimental conditions tested.</p><p id="Par43">Finnaly, with the design and construction of Stardust, we have assembled several techniques that combine the fine control of NP fabrication with high throughputs, in-flight manipulation and <italic>in-situ</italic> characterization. The result is a unique workbench not only for creating analogues of stardust particles in the laboratory, but also for basic research including <italic>in-situ</italic> studies of fundamental properties of supported and non-supported NPs. At the same time, the high throughputs already achieved with this new MICS design open up the use of this machine for applied studies, such as catalysis, and further applications in nanotechnology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Nanoparticle fabrication</title><p id="Par44">Nanoparticles are fabricated with a scaled-up MICS working in UHV (see ESM, Section <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).
