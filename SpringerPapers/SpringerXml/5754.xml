Actually, the increase of the Raman scattering efficiency can be attributed to the following processes: (i) an enhancement of the electromagnetic (EM) fields localized at the edges of metallic particles (Raman hot spots) after excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) at resonance conditions, (ii) a charge-transfer (CT) mechanism wherein an electron can be transferred from an excited metal state to a vibrational level within the target molecule. The EM enhancement is much more efficient than the CT mechanism, but sometimes their coexistence can even lead to single-molecule detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>While solving the limitations of the low Raman scattering cross section of most molecules, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) keeps the advantages of Raman spectroscopy, providing a vibrational fingerprint of the analyzed species and being compatible with biotechnology applications in water-based environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the framework of multiplexing sensors and biosensors development, inkjet printing represents a low-cost, additive patterning technique suitable for the deposition of metal nanoparticles assembled in functional arrayed elements constituting efficient SERS substrates. By means of a servo-assisted piezoelectric printhead, fed with an engineered ink, microdroplets can be ejected on flexible/rigid substrates drawing complex structures with controlled geometry characterized by quite high spatial resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In a previous work, the <italic>in situ</italic> synthesis of silver nanoparticles by inkjet printing on mesoporous silicon was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A silver nitrate-based ink was printed on the Si-H-covered porous silicon surface where Ag<sup>+</sup> cations were reduced to form silver nanoparticles, exploiting the same reaction involved in the consolidated immersion plating technique where porous silicon substrates are dipped in different noble metal ion solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In this work, the inkjet printing synthesis of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is optimized aiming at the development of efficient SERS substrates characterized by a high Raman enhancement, satisfying uniformity and good reproducibility.

A typical stripe pattern of silver NPs on porous silicon is shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Lines are formed by adjacent droplet coalescence and their width is mainly determined by the solvent content of the ink and by the droplet contact angle with the porous silicon surface. Typical lateral width is 400 Î¼m for the water-ethanol ink and 80 to 100 Î¼m for the DMSO-containing one, with oscillations caused by the different number of passes and in particular by the step size, that also influences the uniformity of the line, as shown in the inset.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Ag nanoparticles pattern on porous silicon.</bold> FESEM image of a patterned sample.

In our case, the control over such features can be achieved by the adjustment of the printing parameters as well as by the suitable choice of the ink composition.</p><p>FiguresÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrate the correlation between the NP morphology and their SERS response, when the number of passes of the printhead on the silicon substrate is increased. A MATLAB routine for FESEM images analysis has been developed in order to get an insight on the nanostructure morphological evolution by changing the inkjet printing conditions. FESEM viewgraphs atâÃâ100,000 magnification are used as input for the image analysis of each line. The distributions of the gap between neighboring NPs are obtained by applying the distance transform function to the FESEM images, a MATLAB operator that replaces each background pixel value with the distance from the closest NP, considering the local maxima of the obtained map as the half gap value at each point. Among the output parameters computed by the MATLAB script, we analyzed the coverage percentage, namely the fraction of Ag coated surface, and the average inter-particle gap. This choice is driven by the fundamental role played by the inter-particle distance in a SERS substrate. Actually, the greatest SERS enhancement occurs at hot spots, where the coupling of LSPRs within two (or more) very close NPs yields a huge concentration of the EM field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In particular, at resonance condition, the highest Raman enhancement is obtainable for the smallest inter-particle gap size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Effect of the number of passes: AgNO</bold><sub><bold>3</bold></sub><bold>2.5 10</bold><sup><bold>-2</bold></sup><bold>M.</bold> Left: FESEM images of Ag nanoparticles printed with WE ink, 1,000 dpi, variable number of passes of the printhead on the silicon substrate, 1 to 6.

For each added ink pass, the Ag coverage as well as the size of the NPs increases. Indeed, at lower AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentration (2.5 10<sup>-2</sup> M), the inter-particle gap distribution is quite wide for a single printhead pass and it becomes narrower and narrower as the number of passes increases; at the same time, the average gap decreases and the particles size increases. On the other side, for higher AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentration (5 10<sup>-2</sup> M), despite the increase of the average particle size and of the Ag coverage, the gap distribution between the particle protrusions and its average value are almost unaffected by the ink amount reacting with the porous silicon substrate (i.e., the number of printhead passes). Such a behavior suggests a growth mechanism, in which the forming smaller gaps are rapidly filled, with the coalescence of the bigger NPs.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>FESEM images numerical analysis</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Number of passes</p></th><th align="center"><p>1</p></th><th align="center"><p>2</p></th><th align="center"><p>3</p></th><th align="center"><p>4</p></th><th align="center"><p>5</p></th><th align="center"><p>6</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="7"><p>Concentration 2.5 10<sup>-2</sup> M</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>âCoverage%</p></td><td align="center"><p>13</p></td><td align="center"><p>48</p></td><td align="center"><p>58</p></td><td align="center"><p>72</p></td><td align="center"><p>75</p></td><td align="center"><p>80</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>âAverage inter-particle gap (nm)</p></td><td align="center"><p>89</p></td><td align="center"><p>43</p></td><td align="center"><p>39</p></td><td align="center"><p>36</p></td><td align="center"><p>34</p></td><td align="center"><p>28</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><p>Concentration 5 10<sup>-2</sup> M</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>âCoverage%</p></td><td align="center"><p>70</p></td><td align="center"><p>91</p></td><td align="center"><p>89</p></td><td align="center"><p>89</p></td><td align="center"><p>96</p></td><td align="center"><p>97</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>âAverage inter-particle gap (nm)</p></td><td align="center"><p>60</p></td><td align="center"><p>44</p></td><td align="center"><p>65</p></td><td align="center"><p>68</p></td><td align="center"><p>64</p></td><td align="center"><p>62</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Output parameters for lines printed with WE ink, 1,000 dpi, and variable number of passes, for two different silver nitrate concentrations.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The features of the inter-particle gap size distribution are clearly reflected in the SERS efficiency of the metal-dielectric nanostructures. In order to check such efficiency, the structures shown in the FESEM viewgraphs of FiguresÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> were impregnated with Cyanine Cy5 dissolved in ethanol solutions at a concentration of 10<sup>-6</sup> M. The Raman spectra are characterized by the typical Cy5 bands at 1,605, 1,500, 1,230, and 1,120 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to <italic>v</italic>(Câ=âN)<sub>stretch</sub>, <italic>v</italic>(Câ=âC)<sub>ring-stretch</sub>, <italic>v</italic>(C-N)<sub>stretch</sub>, and <italic>v</italic>(C-H)<sub>ip-bend</sub> modes of the dye, respectively. All the nanostructures provide a SERS effect, as the spectrum of Cy5 cannot be detected on non-silvered porous silicon until a 10<sup>-2</sup> M Cy5 solution is employed for the impregnation. It is straightforward to notice as for the inks with the lower AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentration, the Raman signal of the organic dye shows a monotonic intensity increase by increasing the number of printhead passes, which can be attributed to the efficient Raman hot spots occurring within the smallest inter-particle gaps. For the ink with the higher AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentration, this effect is much less evident because of the similar gap distribution verified for all the samples obtained with different number of passes.</p><p>A complex morphology variation is observed changing the ink composition, moving from the WE to the WDE ink. It is worth to highlight that the addition of a quite low amount of DMSO yields a variation of the chemical-physical properties of the AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution such as the viscosity and the surface tension, thus improving the spatial resolution of the designed pattern and providing an enhanced ink printability which prevents satellite drops ejection. In FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, FESEM images of the silver NPs synthesized with the two inks typologies are compared (corresponding image analysis is presented in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For the same nominal inkjet printing parameters, larger and surface-smoothed NPs are synthesized using the WE ink, whereas sharper edges and smaller sizes are obtained printing the WDE mixture.UV-vis specular reflectance spectra (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, center) are recorded in order to analyze the influence of the different morphologies on the optical response in terms of LSP resonances. The spectra show marked dips related to plasmonic inter-particle short-range interactions due to dimer NP assemblies. While the spectrum for the WE sample shows a quite narrow dip centered at about 400 nm, the silver NPs synthesized with the WDE ink are characterized by a very broad resonance. Interestingly, using a laser excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm, which is far from the dye absorption band (off-electronic resonance condition), the SERS spectra obtained for a spotted Cy5 solution with the same molar concentration yield a greater enhancement for the WDE sample: the signal intensity is almost twice that for the WE one. This difference can be reasonably explained since the laser excitation falls within the plasmonic band of the WDE-synthesized substrate, while in the WE one, the excitation concerns with the reflectance dip tail (plasmonic resonance condition not properly fulfilled for WE substrate).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Solvent effect on NPs morphology.</bold> Left: FESEM images of silver nanoparticles obtained printing AgNO<sub>3</sub> 2.5 10<sup>-2</sup> M (1 to 2) water-ethanol ink, 4 and 6 passes (3 to 4) water/DMSO/ethanol ink, 4 and 6 passes.

With this aim, Rhodamine 6G is chosen as a probe molecule because it offers the possibility to work in surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS) regime. Actually, the HOMO-LUMO electronic transition of the dye occurs around 520 nm, matching the used excitation wavelength and being in this mode in resonance both with the plasmonic substrate and with the analyte electronic transitions.</p><p>SERS spectra collected after dipping the substrates in solutions at increasing dye concentrations are plotted in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The 1,647- and 1,509-cm<sup>-1</sup> modes, assigned to the C-C stretching of the xanthene ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], are easily detected until 10<sup>-12</sup> M concentration. Moreover, also at the lower concentrations, the whole vibrational pattern of Rhodamine 6G is still present, although some changes in the intensity ratios are observed for bands in the 1,200-to-1,400-cm<sup>-1</sup> range.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Limit of detection evaluation.</bold> SERRS spectra of Rhodamine 6G adsorbed from solutions at different dye concentrations (10<sup>-12</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup> M) on a line printed with WDE ink, AgNO<sub>3</sub> 2.5 10<sup>-2</sup> M, 1,000 dpi, six passes.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11671_2014_Article_2275_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Following a previous study, we can evaluate an external amplified Raman efficiency (EARE), defined as the ratio between the dye concentration threshold, which is detectable on the Ag NPs, with respect to the minimum concentration of the detected analyte adsorbed on a bare p-Si substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In our case, since the Raman spectrum of rhodamine cannot be detected after immersion of bare porous silicon in dye solutions with concentration as high as 10<sup>-4</sup> M, an EARE larger than 10<sup>8</sup> can be foreseen for this optimized SERS substrate. It is worth to underline that such performances are comparable to those of immersion plated silvered porous silicon which approached single-molecule detection in SERRS regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As a matter of fact, considering a micrometric laser spot size as the used optical probe and neglecting eventual dye accumulation effects in pores or nanometric gaps of the substrate, single-molecule detection can be expected for concentration lower than 10<sup>-11</sup> M, as in our case.</p><p>Beside high Raman enhancements, a SERS substrate needs to satisfy other severe requirements in terms of nanostructure uniformity and reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the framework of inkjet-printed plasmonic patterns, the homogeneity of the samples has been evaluated recording several SERS spectra of Cy5 diluted at a concentration of 10<sup>-5</sup> M along different sites along the same line, while the reproducibility has been analyzed comparing the intensity of the Raman spectra acquired on different lines synthesized under the same nominal inkjet printing conditions. Using the same excitation conditions, the integrated intensity of the 1,120-cm<sup>-1</sup> peak corresponding to the <italic>v</italic>(C-H)<sub>ip-bend</sub> mode of Cy5, calculated from the measurements performed on five probed spots (with a scanned length of 2 mm) on lines prepared with the WDE ink (AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentration of 2.5 10<sup>-2</sup> M, six passes, and 1,000 dpi), shows fluctuation lower than 20%. The intensity variation of the same Raman band acquired on four different lines (considering for each stripe the average intensity obtained for the previously discussed five spots) is lower than 15%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Arrayed SERS stripes are realized by inkjet printing on mesoporous silicon.
