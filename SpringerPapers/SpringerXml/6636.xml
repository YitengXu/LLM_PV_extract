However, mixers increase not only biomass yield, but also energy consumption. To evaluate performances on increasing light/dark (L/D) cycles and energy consumption of adding a mixer simultaneously, a new parameter named as efficiency of L/D cycle enhancement is introduced. Discrete double inclined ribs, intensively studied in heat transfer, are introduced to tubular PBRs in this work. The number of ribs in a cross section is discussed. These tubular PBRs are investigated in terms of the flow structure, L/D cycle frequency and efficiency of L/D cycle enhancement by computational fluid dynamics. The numerical results show that the increment of L/D cycle frequency caused by the discrete double inclined ribs is larger than the increment of energy consumption caused by the ribs under a wide range of incident light intensity. In general, the increasing of rib length ratio results in a decrease of efficiency and the PBR with two pairs of ribs performs the best. Based on the general trends, a PBR with two pairs of ribs and of which the rib length ratio is 5 is recommended for further studies.<fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web"

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Microalgae are a potential feedstock to produce biofuel (Wijffels and Barbosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>; Georgianna and Mayfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). Currently, microalgae are cultivated in raceway ponds, which have the disadvantages of low productivity and risk of contamination (Georgianna and Mayfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). In contrast, enclosed photobioreactors (PBRs) prevent microalgae from contamination, provide them a comfortable environment and thus achieve a continuous and high-yielding culture with high biomass concentration (Georgianna and Mayfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). Among the types of PBRs, tubular PBRs have the potential for scaling up, due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and the ability to cultivate and harvest biomass continuously (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Easing light saturation and photoinhibition by light/dark (L/D) cycles is a way to increase biomass production. Cells with L/D cycles can grow faster and endure a higher biomass concentration for the so-called flashing light effect (Abu-Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). Huang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>) have illustrated that L/D cycles, rather than turbulent kinetic energy or turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, is the parameter that directly relates to the biomass output by correlation analysis based on experiments and simulations. Also, light fluctuation is the main factor considered in a newly developed microalgal growth model (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">L/D cycles can be achieved by mixers (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>). Vortexes, induced by mixers, move suspension between the illuminated surface and the core center (Gómez-Pérez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>) and, therefore, increase the L/D cycles experienced by cells (Perner-Nochta and Posten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Luo and Al-Dahhan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). However, the adding of mixers also increases energy consumption (mainly pumping costs). For instance, according to Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>), the simulated energy consumption (calculated by pressure drop) of the PBR with helical mixer was 0.3 J kg<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>, which was much higher than that of the smooth PBR (0.0136 J kg<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>). It means that the energy consumption has increased almost by 2106% on inserting of the helical mixer. By comparison, the productivity of <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. increased by 37%, which is much lower than 2106%.</p><p id="Par8">Several researches (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Gómez-Pérez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>) have proposed novel mixers in tubular PBRs and tried to lower the energy consumption of mixers. For example, Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>) have proposed symmetric spiral grooves generating a pair of longitudinal vortexes to enhance the swirl flow of the tubular PBR. Gómez-Pérez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>) have proposed a twisted tube and Gómez-Pérez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>) have proposed a tube with circular groove to reduce the energy consumption of mixers. However, these mixers and PBRs enhanced the mixing at the cost of more energy consumption or saved energy with poorer mixing. Moreover, mixing performance in these researches is mostly evaluated by swirl number. It is noted that a flow with a high swirl number may not be a flow with a correspondingly high frequency of L/D cycles of cells. For example, a flow for which the swirl is far from the separating line of light and dark zones cannot contribute to L/D cycles.</p><p id="Par9">In heat transfer enhancement, to achieve a better performance on heat flux under limited energy consumption, tubes with discrete double inclined ribs have been introduced to generate the theoretical optimal velocity field based on field synergy (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>; Meng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>; Meng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>). The velocity field induced by discrete double inclined ribs consists of six vortexes in a cross section, and these vortexes are located between the core region and the wall vicinity. The flow structure in this pipe is different from that in other types of tubular PBRs, such as PBRs with helical mixer, Kenics mixer, spiral tubular PBR and twisted tubular PBR, investigated by Gómez-Pérez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>), and a PBR with inclined porous mixer studied by Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>), where the core area of the vortexes is near the center line of the pipe. This special flow structure in the pipes with discrete double inclined ribs enhances the convection between the wall vicinity and the core region more efficiently (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). Considering that the light zone is usually near the wall and the dark zone usually contains the core region of the pipe in dense culture, this special flow structure may enhance the L/D cycles more efficiently.</p><p id="Par10">For the above-mentioned reasons, this work introduces the discrete double inclined ribs to the tubular PBRs to increase the L/D cycles. The performance of PBRs with these ribs is comprehensively studied by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results show that PBRs with discrete double inclined ribs performed well in enhancing the L/D cycle of cells under a wide range of incident light intensity with a moderate energy loss. Also, the increment of L/D cycle frequency is larger than the increment of energy consumption, indicating that these types of ribs can own a great potential in upscaling. In addition, a parameter study about the length ratio and the number of ribs was also conducted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>PBRs</title><p id="Par11">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the geometry of the tubular ribs with discrete double inclined ribs. 3D models were constructed by Solidworks tools.

In outdoors, light beams are usually parallel (they are assumed to be incident along the -<italic>y</italic> direction in this work as Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref> have done). To study the influence of the position of vortexes along the light incident direction on the L/D cycle frequency, we propose two new structures—two pairs of ribs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and a pair of ribs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) by removing the ribs from the opposite direction of the light transfer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Numerical and evaluation models</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Simulation models</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Turbulent model</title><p id="Par13">Turbulent flow is required in enclosed PBRs to meet mass transfer requirement and prevent cells from deposition (Perner-Nochta and Posten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Acién Fernández et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>), and an average velocity of 0.5 m s<sup>−1</sup> is suggested for tubular PBRs (Molina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2001</xref>; Perner-Nochta and Posten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>). The suspension properties are set to the properties of water (Gómez-Pérez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). The simulations of turbulent flow in tubes with discrete double inclined ribs have been intensively studied (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>; Meng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>). Among these simulation models, SST <italic>k</italic>–<italic>ω</italic> model has been suggested by Zheng et al.

Detailed description of this experiment can be found in Meng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>), Meng et al.

It is the flow structure that dominates the cell movements in PBRs. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the tangential velocity and streamlines on a section between ribs (<italic>L</italic>* = 3). On the pathway formed by a pair of ribs, the tangential velocity vectors and streamlines head to the tube center, and thus a pair of vortexes forms on both sides of the pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). This vortex structure is in good consistence with the visualization reported by Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>), indicating the reliability of the turbulent model used in this work. These vortexes fill the cross section, and the number of vortexes is the same as the number of ribs at the cross section, indicating that an individual rib induces a vortex. The location of a vortex (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) corresponds to a rib at its upstream (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d), which shows that the location of vortexes could be arranged by removing some ribs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Tangential velocity vectors and streamlines at section <italic>z</italic> = 905 mm, <bold>a</bold> Type-1, <bold>b</bold> Type-2 and <bold>c</bold> Type-3; the solid lines in each streamline picture are critical light intensity when <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> = 375, 800 and 1200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> from the top to center, respectively</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40643_2018_214_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO24"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Particle tracks</title><p id="Par30">Streamline and velocity vectors cannot show the particle mixing in PBRs directly, so the particle trajectories are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.

This may be caused by the third pair of vortexes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), located at the bottom of the tube cross section. This pair of vortexes dominates the flow near it as other vortexes do, so the particle mixing of Type-3 is better than that of Type-2 since the former owns more vortexes. Moreover, the L/D frequency of Type-3 is lower than that of Type-2, because the third pair of vortexes of Type-3 is far from the separating line of light and dark zones, which means a large fraction of the particles of Type-3 is constrained in the bottom area without the L/D cycle.</p><p id="Par33">As incident light intensity increases, <italic>f</italic><sub>av</sub> increases. A stronger incident light penetrates deeper, so that more particles can experience the L/D cycle. Meanwhile, the separating line of light and dark zones is not too far from the top vortex cores.

The pressure drop increases as the rib length ratio, <italic>L</italic>*, increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This is caused by the fact that a longer rib helps to induce a longer flow path around the ribs, resulting in a longer and stronger swirl flow, a better fluid mixing, and a greater flow blockage. Moreover, the pressure drop also increases as the number of ribs increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The increment of the pressure drop between different rib length ratios is not as large as that between different numbers of ribs. This trend is well consistent with the trend of particle trajectories, which indicates that stronger swirl flow could cause more particle movements across the entire cross section at a price of more energy consumption.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Pressure drop of three types of PBRs with different <italic>L</italic>*. <italic>L</italic>* = 0 represents the PBR without ribs, i.e., the smooth PBR, which serves as a benchmark here</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40643_2018_214_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO27"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Efficiency of L/D cycle enhancement</title><p id="Par35">The efficiency of L/D cycle enhancement is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.

It is worth noting that the efficiencies of the L/D cycle enhancement of most mixers which are currently used in other studies are less than 1. For instance, the efficiency of the L/D cycle enhancement of an inclined porous mixer proposed by Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>) is only 4.45% (L/D cycle frequency increases from 1.69 to 3.13 Hz, while pressure loss increases from 25.85 to 520.64 Pa). As expected in the introduction part, the good performance of the discrete double inclined ribs on L/D cycle enhancement results from the special flow structure in this pipe.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The efficiency of L/D cycle enhancement of three types of PBRs with different <italic>L</italic>*.

As <italic>L</italic>* increases, the efficiency shows a general decreasing trend. These two trends are consistent with usual cases that adding more mixers in a tubular PBR can bring the increases of mixing and pressure drop, but a decrease of efficiency. Considering the <italic>f</italic><sub>av</sub> of Type-2 is much higher than that of Type-1, and the efficiency of Type-1 is only slightly above that of Type-2, Type-2 should be used in cultivating. In a similar way, as the <italic>f</italic><sub>av</sub> increases with the increase of <italic>L</italic>*, and the efficiency of <italic>L</italic>* = 4 or 5 performs the best in some cases, <italic>L</italic>* = 4 or 5 may be the optimal choice.</p><p id="Par37">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, Types-1 and -2 are efficient in enhancing L/D cycles under a wide range of incident light intensity. This feature is essential for outdoor cultivation because of the variation of sunlight (Pruvost et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>). Namely, this type of PBRs has a potential for upscale cultivation of microalgae. It should be noticed that, as incident light intensity increases, the efficiency of the L/D cycle enhancement of each PBR decreases while <italic>f</italic><sub>av</sub> increases (as shown in “<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">L/D cycle frequency</xref>” section). This decrease of efficiency may be because the benchmark (<italic>L</italic>* = 0 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) increases more than other PBRs do (<italic>L</italic>* = 3, 4, 5 and 6).</p><p id="Par38">In addition, there might be some further studies that deserve attention. This work mainly focuses on numerical simulation and the results show that PBRs with discrete double inclined ribs perform well at enhancing L/D cycles. The biomass cultivation of species would be necessary to validate the advantages of this type of PBR. It will be conducted in the future. In particle trajectory simulation, cells in this work were taken as inert particles as in most researches (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>; Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>; Pruvost et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>), while in real world particles are not (Suali and Sarbatly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>; Razzak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Kreis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>). A more accurate particle tracking model including the shape and biological properties may present more detailed and accurate particle trajectories. However, it may result in a sharp increase of computing cost.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">This work investigates the performance on enhancing L/D cycles and energy consumption of a tubular PBR with discrete double inclined ribs in dense culture. The special vortex structure in this type of PBRs enhances the L/D cycles efficiently as expected. In most cases (except Type-3 under <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), the efficiencies of L/D cycle enhancement are higher than 1, which means that the dimensionless increment of the L/D cycle frequency is larger than that of the pressure drop. Furthermore, the efficiencies of Types-1 and -2 are higher than 1 over a wide range of incident light intensity (from 375 to 1200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), which indicates that Types-1 and -2 are more suitable for outdoor culture since the intensity of sunlight in nature varies with the time of the day.</p><p id="Par40">As the number of ribs decreases from the opposite direction of the light transfer, the mixing performance of the cells decreases while the L/D cycle frequency does not (L/D cycle frequency is the highest when the number of ribs is 4, which corresponds to Type-2). This result indicates that a vortex far from the separating line of light and dark zones may reduce the L/D cycle, though it may increase the cell mixing. Furthermore, the pressure drop decreases as the number of ribs decreases. The efficiencies of L/D cycle enhancement of the PBR with four (Type-2) and two (Type-1) ribs are higher than that of PBR with six ribs (Type-3), while the difference in the efficiencies between Types-2 and -1 is slight. Considering that the L/D cycle frequency of Type-2 is much higher than that of Type-1, Type-2 possesses the best overall performance in our work and thus it is worthy of further investigation (including the real microalgal culture). As the rib length ratio increases, the pressure drop and averaged L/D cycle frequency increase while the efficiency shows a general decreasing trend. For Type-2, the efficiency of the L/D cycle enhancement is the highest in most cases when the rib length ratio equals 5. Thus, Type-2 with rib length ratio of 5 is recommended for further study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors’ contributions</title><sec><p>CQ: carried out the literature review, CFD and light profile simulations, analysis and interpretation of the data and drafting of the manuscript; YL: conducted CFD simulation; JW: contributed to the conception and design of the study, discussion of the results, critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content and obtaining of funding for the project.
