Herein, we suggest a new protocol for QD film deposition using electrical double-layered PbS QD inks, prepared by solution-phase ligand exchange using methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>). The films are deposited by the supersonic spraying technique, which facilitates the rapid evaporation of the solvent and the subsequent deposition of the PbS QD ink without requiring a post-deposition annealing treatment for solvent removal. The film thickness could be readily controlled by varying the number of spraying sweeps made across the substrate. This spray deposition process yields high-quality n-type QD films quickly (within 1 min) while minimizing the amount of the PbS QD ink used to less than 5 mg for one device (300-nm-thick absorbing layer, 2.5 × 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>). Further, the formation of an additional p-layer by treatment with mercaptopropionic acid allows for facile hole extraction from the QD films, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 3.7% under 1.5 AM illumination.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_669.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have shown great promise for use in optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaics and photodetectors owing to their size- and shape-tunable optical and electrical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, the high scalability of the devices based on solution processing as well as the fact that they can be integrated readily make this technique highly suited for commercial manufacturing. Lead chalcogenide (PbX, X = S, Se, and Te) QDs with tunable bandgaps spanning the visible to near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range are the most suitable for QD-based next-generation photovoltaics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Typically, QDs synthesized <italic>via</italic> colloidal routes are capped with long-chain organic ligands that act as an insulating layer; however, this prevents their direct use in electronic devices because of the weak interparticle coupling resulting from the insulating layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, a post-synthesis ligand exchange is necessary for such QDs to find use in practical devices, wherein the initial bulky ligands are replaced with shorter ligands. Multistep sequential layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly, in which crack-free conductive films of desired thicknesses are formed using spin-coating, dip-coating, and spray-coating, is the most commonly used technique for fabricating devices such as solar cells and field-effect transistors (FETs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nevertheless, such LBL fabrication techniques for forming conductive films suffer from several associated issues. For instance, close-packed dense films that are free of cracks and voids formed because of the decrease in the volume of the ligands after the ligand exchange process are hard to produce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Further, the spin-coating and dip-coating techniques are typically used; however, these only allow for small-scale batch processing and are incompatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing schemes. Recently, several groups have explored spray coating because it may potentially offer the advantages of a well-established industrial technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, they used native-ligand-passivated QDs dispersed in organic solvents as the QD precursors, which required ligand exchange after deposition. In addition, while LBL assembly is, by far, the most suitable technique for forming films that exhibit the desired thickness, it generally involves significant losses of the QD solution and is a time-consuming process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, a strategy has been developed wherein the native ligands are replaced with shorter ligands in the solution phase itself; this strategy allows for the direct deposition of the QD solution onto the substrate, yielding conductive films without requiring a solid-state ligand exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, these QDs with short ligands, whose dispersions are termed as QD inks, do not exhibit colloidal stability, thus making it difficult to fabricate high-quality QD films by controlling certain parameters, such as the film thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, QD inks are typically dispersed in a high-boiling-point solvent such as propylene carbonate (PC) or dimethylformamide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The use of such high-boiling-point solvents makes it difficult to fabricate QD films because removing the solvent during deposition is cumbersome. Therefore, a single-step-deposition process becomes inevitable; however, such processes do not allow for sophisticated control over the film thickness. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. recently fabricated QD solar cells using an iodide-terminated PbS QD ink as the light-absorbing layer. They used the spin-coating method to deposit the films and reported that the efficiency was limited by the thickness of the deposited layer, which was ~150 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we propose a new method for the deposition of conductive PbS QD films using PbS QD inks by a supersonic spray-coating method. The proposed method is a quick one as it involves rapid (supersonic) spraying. We used a PbS QD ink stabilized with MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, which are colloidally stable under ambient conditions, as determined through dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and absorbance spectra analysis. Using this deposition method, the film thickness can be tuned simply by varying the number of spraying passes made. Precursor wastage is minimized, because the precursor is deposited onto the substrate with high accuracy. Finally, the photovoltaic cells produced from the PbS QD ink by using this coating approach exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.7%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis of PbS QD ink</title><p id="Par7">Oleate-capped PbS QDs were synthesized by using Pb(oleate)<sub>2</sub> and bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The ligand-exchange process was accelerated by stirring at 100 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), in contrast to the conventional ligand-exchange process, which is performed at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. NMF, which was used as the solvent for MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, has an ultrahigh dielectric constant (ε ≈ 182), which allows for electrostatic stabilization between the surfaces of the PbS QDs and the new MAPbI<sub>3</sub> ligands. The complete phase transfer of the PbS QDs from octane to NMF took less than 10 min. To ensure compatibility between the two phases, acetone (ε ≈ 21) was used as the nonsolvent; as a result, the PbS QDs-MAPbI<sub>3</sub> could be isolated by the centrifugation of the destabilized QD solution. PC was used as the solvent, in order to ensure the electrostatic stability of the concentrated PbS QDs-MAPbI<sub>3</sub> solution (~100 mg·mL<sup>−1</sup>) after the removal of the free ligands by purification, because of its high dielectric constant (ε ≈ 64) as well as the weak desorption of the anions and the efficient solvation of the cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, NMF was found to be unsuitable because it caused the strong desorption of the anions (PbI<sub>3</sub>), leading to a weak electrostatic double layer, even when the PbS QDs-MAPbI<sub>3</sub> were dissolved in NMF before purification.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustration of phase transfer of PbS QDs from nonpolar solvent (octane) to polar solvent (NMF) induced by ligand exchange of oleates with CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>).

It can be seen that the absorption (~77 meV) and emission (~92 meV) spectra are slightly red-shifted compared to those of the PbS QDs-oleate (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Further, distinct absorbance features are observed after the ligand-exchange reaction at 100 °C, indicating that the size of the particles remains unchanged and that quantum confinement occurs without severe particle aggregation. Further, TEM images of the PbS QDs-MAPbI<sub>3</sub> also confirm that the size of the particles is preserved after the ligand-exchange process and that the size distribution is narrow (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). The colloidal and air stabilities of the QD ink were monitored based on the changes in the absorption peaks as well as the particle size over time as by determined by DLS measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). DLS is a useful tool for monitoring the presence of aggregates and has been used widely for determining the hydrodynamic size of nanoparticles in colloidal suspensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The average hydrodynamic diameter of the particles in the PbS QD ink, as measured by DLS, was 3 nm, which is similar to the value obtained from the TEM measurements (Figs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>), with the particle size remaining constant over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, right). Furthermore, the optical density (OD) corresponding to the 1<sup>st</sup> excitonic transition at 930 nm in the absorbance spectrum (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>) was monitored to determine whether particle aggregation occurred over time.

The spraying process allows for the direct deposition of the PbS QDs without requiring the use of any binder material. More importantly, during the spraying process, the air from the supersonic nozzle is heated to temperatures of up to 250 °C, which results in the rapid evaporation of the solvent and facilitates the deposition of the PbS QD ink, making a post-deposition annealing treatment for solvent removal unnecessary. Subsequently, the liquid droplets disintegrate quickly into finer ones because of the drag induced by the supersonic air stream. Thus, only the dried and crystallized QD particles hit the substrate at supersonic speeds, resulting in superior adhesion.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of spray deposition of PbS QD ink.

To begin with, by varying the nozzle temperature for PbS QD ink film deposition from 150 °C to 400 °C, we found that the optimal nozzle temperature is 250 °C, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>. Propylene carbonate, a solvent for QD inks, has a very high boiling point (242 °C). Thus, when the films were coated at temperatures lower than 250 °C, deposition did not occur even when the number of spraying passes was increased. Further, the films formed at temperatures of 300 °C or higher were not transparent enough even when the number of spraying passes was reduced and the duration of the passes kept short, in order to ensure that the films exhibited the desired thickness. Next, we fabricated PbS QD films at 250 °C while varying the PbS QD concentration to 3 and 10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>. The concentration of the PbS QDs must be low enough to allow for the rapid evaporation of the carrier solution while ensuring the optimal dispersion of the residual PbS QDs. If the PbS QD concentration is too high, agglomeration may occur. Lastly, we fabricated PbS QD films at 250 °C while varying the gas pressure to 3 and 4 bar. The change in the operating pressure resulted in changes in the velocity of the jet stream. At higher pressures, the jet stream was faster; thus, the impact of the droplets of the PbS QD ink against the substrate was stronger, resulting in the formation of denser films.</p><p id="Par14">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the close-packed PbS QD films with a thickness of 300 nm deposited on glass substrates by spray coating. It can be seen that the PbS QD films have a smooth topography with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.4 nm; this is indicative of the high quality of the spray-deposited films. In addition, the film thickness could be controlled readily based on the number of passes/sweeps made during the spraying process; films with thicknesses of 130–400 nm could be obtained with 8–14 sweeps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D–G</xref>). A PbS QD ink solution with a concentration of only 3 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> was supplied to the atomizer at a flow rate of 2 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>, and the spraying time required per pass was merely 4 s for an area with dimensions of 2.5 × 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup> (see Experimental Section). The number of spraying passes/sweeps, <italic>N</italic>, required to deposit a 300-nm-thick film was 12. Therefore, the total amount of PbS QD ink used was 5 mg, and the entire deposition process took less than 1 min. Thus, the proposed supersonic spraying process can produce uniform PbS QD films by rapid and simple spraying using only a small amount of QD ink, as compared to other LBL processes involving spin and spray coating, which typically require more than 30 min to produce QD films with similar thicknesses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Further, we evaluated whether the proposed method was suitable for forming flexible, large-area films by depositing the PbS QD ink to form a film on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate (10 × 6 cm<sup>2</sup>). As can be seen from Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>, the proposed method has distinct advantages over conventional spin-coating methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Characterization of PbS QD films</title><p id="Par15">The native oleate ligands were completely replaced by MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref>). Prior to the ligand exchange, peaks related to several stretching and vibration modes of the oleate ligands were observed in the IR spectrum, such as the C–H and O–H stretching modes (2800–3500 cm<sup>−1</sup>), the C–H bending vibrations, and the carboxylic C–O and vinyl C = C stretching modes (600–1500 cm<sup>−1</sup>); however, all the peaks related to the stretching modes corresponding to the original ligands disappeared after the ligand exchange.

The main peak is attributable to the Pb component of the PbS-PbI<sub>3</sub> structure; however, the smaller one is associated with the metallic Pb decomposed from the PbI<sub>2</sub> precursor during the ligand-exchange process.

Combining the UPS data and the optical bandgap data as determined from the absorption spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>) allowed us to determine the conduction band minimum (CBM).

Thus, based on the binding energy spectra, it can be surmised that the QD films formed were n-type films. Furthermore, we fabricated FETs using the PbI<sub>3</sub>-stabilized PbS QD ink solids to confirm the doping polarity. Source and drain Au contacts deposited on highly doped SiO<sub>2</sub>-coated silicon wafers were used as the substrates, and solutions of the QDs in PC were spray-coated at a nozzle temperature of 250 °C for 3 spraying passes to form ~50-nm-thick films.

Supersonic spray coating using a QD ink is thus an economically viable approach for the commercial manufacturing of solution-processed PbS QD solar cells while allowing for efficient thickness control and ensuring minimal PbS precursor consumption. In the PbS QD solids, the PbI<sub>3</sub> ligands act as surface ligands as well as dopants, resulting in n-type behavior; treatment with MPA leads to a change in the doping polarity of the upper region of the films to p-type, leading to the formation of a structure with a graded architecture.
