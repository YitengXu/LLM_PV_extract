because they present a promising avenue towards cost-effective high efficiency solar power conversion. These devices use molecular dyes or semiconductors in form of quantum dots (QD) or extremely thin absorber (ETA) layers as light harvesting agents. The sensitizer is deposited as a molecular or QD layer at the interface between a hole and electron conducting material, often a large band gap oxide semiconductor of mesoscopic structure. Following light excitation, the light harvester injects negative and positive charge carrier in the respective electronic transport materials, which subsequently are collected as photocurrent at the front and back contacts of the cell. The photo-voltage is given by the difference in the quasi-Fermi level under illumination of the electron- and hole-conducting solids.</p><p>Recently research in this field has accelerated; new efficiency records being attained at short intervals. Thus, after years of struggling to get over the 5% PCE barrier, an ETA cell based on Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> sensitized mesosocopic TiO<sub>2</sub> films reached a PCE of 6.3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> while dye sensitized solid state heterojunctions have reached 7.2 percent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

A further substantial gain in efficiency pushing the PCE to 8.5% was achieved very recently by combining the N719 dye with the p-type semiconductor CsSnI<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>(CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite nanocrystals have attracted attention as a new class of light harvesters for mesososcopic solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Impressive PEC values of up to 6.54% have been obtained with liquid junction cells based on iodide/triiodide redox couple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However a rapid degradation of performance was witnessed due to dissolution of the perovskite in the electrolyte. Because the (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals exhibit a one order of magnitude higher absorption coefficient than the conventional N719 dye, they offer advantages for use in solid state sensitized solar cells where much thinner TiO<sub>2</sub> layer are employed than in liquid junction devices.</p><p>Here we report a new solid-state mesoscopic solar cell employing (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite nanocrystals as a light absorber and <italic>spiro</italic>-MeOTAD as a hole-transporting layer, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.

This strikingly high efficiency can be achieved with submicron thick TiO<sub>2</sub> films due to the large optical absorption cross section (absorption coefficient of 1.5×10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> at 550 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> of the pervoskite nanoparticles and the well-developed interfacial features including complete pore filling by the hole conductor as can be seen in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.

The appearance of a IPCE plateau indicates that the (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> NP's embedded in the 0.6 μm-thick mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> film harvest efficiently the incident photons, converting them with a high quantum yield to electric current.

Open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) is however more significantly influenced by changing the film thickness. The V<sub>OC</sub> decreases from ~0.9 V to ~0.85 V as the film thickness increases to 0.8 μm and further decreases to around 0.8 V when the film is greater than 1.2 μm. V<sub>OC</sub> starts to decline significantly from 1.5 μm. This decrease of V<sub>OC</sub> is expected as the dark current augments linearly dependant with film thickness lowering the electron concentration under ilumination and hence their quasi Fermie level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The FF is gradually decreased with increasing the film thickness, which is a consequence of the lower Voc and an increase of the electron transport resistance. Due to the diminishing V<sub>OC</sub> and FF, PCE (η) is clearly decreased with increasing the TiO<sub>2</sub> film thickness.

Three different thicknesses of mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> layers were investigated (0.6, 1.15 and 1.4 µm). The J<sub>SC</sub> and FF were similar for all 3 cells but the V<sub>OC</sub> dropped from about 920 to 880 to 850 mV with increasing TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness. The dark current scaled nearly linearly with thickness of the mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> layer (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>) and is well mirrored by the behavior of the recombination – or charge transfer-resistance R<sub>CT</sub> (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). The R<sub>CT</sub> near short circuit is dominated by the interface between the hole conductor and the under-layer as apparent from the small potential dependence of the resistance. The behavior of R<sub>CT</sub> changes as soon as the conductance in the photoanode increases due to the rise of the Fermi level in the photo-anode under forward bias (V<sub>applied</sub> &gt; 500mV). R<sub>CT</sub> drops steeply with increasing forward bias because the dark current is now dominated by the flow of electrons across the photo-anode interface to the hole conductor and no longer by the underlayer/hole conductor interface.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>IS measurements as TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness: red 0.6 µm, blue 1.15 µm and green 1.4 µm.</p><p>(a) Dark current during the IS measurements.

The increase of the recombination current with higher surface area of the thicker photoanodes leads to a faster reduction of the R<sub>CT</sub> and ultimately to a lower V<sub>OC</sub>. The capacitance (C<sub>A</sub>) near J<sub>SC</sub>, which is associated to the capacitance of the under layer/hole conductor interface, shows nearly no change. It increases as the mesoscopic TiO<sub>2</sub> film is filled with the electrons induced by the applied potential showing C<sub>A</sub> values comparable to other mesoporous solid state devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and therefore about 100 times lower than in liquid DSC devices. Another feature in common with solid state devices like BHJ or ETA solar cells is the drop of the capacitance at even higher forward bias. The origin of this behavior is not fully understood so far. Bisquert et al. mentioned that the balance with the Helmholtz capacitance might be a reason<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Alternatively also the direct faradaic current flow could also lead to the overall reduction of the capacitance. Finally, we can see that the calculated electron lifetime (τ<sub>n</sub> =  C<sub>A</sub>× R<sub>CT</sub>) shows a faster decline in τ<sub>n</sub> at higher forward bias with increasing TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness leading to the observed overall reduction in the V<sub>OC</sub> (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Time resolve single photon and femto-second laser spectroscopy studies</title><p>A powder of (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> shows a band edge emission which is centered at 780 nm, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure SI2</xref>.

No major difference could be observed between samples based on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>: the recovery of the initial state in 1 ns for both samples shows that no significant charge injection from the excited state of the perovskite into TiO<sub>2</sub> can be evidenced.

On Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>), the amplitude of the bleaching signal at 483 nm was found to be smaller than on a sample deprived of the HTM. The positive absorption signal in the 630–700 nm region completely disappeared, concomitantly with a strong quenching of the stimulated emission above 700 nm. These results suggest a rapid reductive quenching of the excited state of the perovskite by the hole-transporting material. The absorption spectrum of oxidized form of the <italic>spiro</italic>-OMeTAD generated during this process extends in the visible region and could thus interfere with other spectral features observed between 400 and 700 nm.</p><p>The transient spectrum of the sample HTM/(CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>) exhibits the same features observed on the one deprived of <italic>spiro</italic>-OMeTAD (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>), with the bleaching peak in the 480 nm-region being less pronounced than in the case of the perovskite alone on TiO<sub>2</sub>, as discussed previously for the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sample.

The pump energy at the sample was 200 nJ / pulse with a spot size diameter of ca 1 mm. The probe beam consisted of a white light continuum (430-1000 nm), generated by passing a portion of the 778 nm amplified Ti:Sa laser output through a 3 mm-thick sapphire plate. The probe intensity was always inferior to that of the pump and its spot size was much smaller.

The signal and reference were detected with a pair of 163 mm spectrographs (Andor Technology, SR163) equipped with 512x58 pixels back-thinned CCD detectors (Hamamatsu S07030-0906). To improve the detection sensitivity, the pump light was chopped at half the amplifier frequency and the transmitted signal intensity was recorded shot by shot. It was corrected for intensity fluctuations using the reference beam. Transient spectra were averaged until the desired signal-to-noise ratio was achieved (typically 3000 averaged records). The polarization of the probe pulses was at magic angle relative to that of the pump pulses. All spectra were corrected for the spectral chirp of the white-light probe pulses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy</title><p>Photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy was used to probe the photo-generated charge species in a (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> sensitized film.

A 20 W halogen lamp was used as a probe source which was filtered and focused onto the sample prior to being refocused onto the slits of a double monochromator (Gemini-180). The light intensity on the sample was approximately 65 μW cm<sup>−2</sup>. A cooled dual colour solid-state detector (Si/InGaAs) was mounted on the exit slits of the monochromator. This combination gave an effective spectral range of 300–1650 nm. A dual phase lock-in amplifier (SR 830) was used to separate out the AC signal from the detectors. This signal provided the change in transmission (ΔT/T) as a function of wavelength.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) of Korea under contracts No. 2010-0014992 and 2010-0028821 and R31-2008-10029 (WCU program) and the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy under contract No. 20103020010010.
