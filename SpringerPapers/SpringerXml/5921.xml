Porous graphene is a modified graphene with pores on the sheet and/or between the sheets that, as a result, has unique structural and electrochemical properties that are different from pure graphene. Energy storage is a very attractive application for porous graphene due to the increased surface area and additional porosity, which could potentially lead to improved electrochemical performance. Therefore, porous graphene has been extensively studied for various energy storage systems including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors, lithium–sulfur (Li–S), lithium–air (Li–air), and fuel cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Each method has its own advantages and challenges. Using mechanical exfoliation, on one hand, it is difficult to obtain large quantities of graphene, but the small yield of product is of a high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Even though electrical conductivity of RGO is lower than others, chemical production of graphene based upon Hummers’ method followed by reduction is particularly suitable for mass production of nanostructured graphene because graphene oxide (GO) is a good basic building block to create a wide range of porous structures using bottom-up approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Porous graphene can be synthesized using either template or template-free methods.

While in many cases GO is used as the same intermediate and building blocks, it is the ability to alter the microscopic structure of the final structure of graphene that makes this product so widely applicable in energy storage.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Production of porous graphene</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Self-assembled macroporous graphene</title><p id="Par36">The “breath figure” method is a promising approach to create the three-dimensional macroporous graphene structures possessing relatively large micrometer size pores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The breath figure process allows for finely tuned adjustments of the ordered hexagonal structures by varying solvents, substrates, temperature, humidity, airflow, and other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This self-assembly method consists of the following basic steps. First, modification of GO should be performed to make it more hydrophobic because the breath figure method requires GO to be dispersed in an organic phase. A modified GO dispersed in an organic solvent is placed dropwise onto a substrate as humid air flows over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. As the temperature of the interface between the air and solution is reduced due to endothermic evaporation of an organic solvent, water condenses into droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

In this method, polystyrene-grafted GO was synthesized by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to make it dispersible in an organic solvent, benzene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This dispersion was drop-cast onto substrates under humid air flow, resulting in flexible macroporous modified GO films. This method demonstrated that the pore size could be controlled by simply altering the concentration of the precursor solution along with the polymer chain lengths on the surfaces of the GO sheet. By increasing the concentration of polystyrene-grafted GO dispersion, they were able to decrease the pore size from 4 to 1 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Eventually, macroporous graphene was prepared after heat treatment of self-assembled GO at 1000 °C with hydrogen gas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

The capacitance could be further increased to 103.2 F/g after nitrogen-doping through thermal treatment with ammonia gas because of the enhanced conductivity and additional pseudocapacitance from nitrogen heteroatom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Chen also developed a scalable and facile self-assembly of graphene to fabricate macroporous graphene by the breath figure method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Instead of using complicated polymerization steps for synthesizing modified GO, they adopted low-cost and green approach to modifying graphene oxide to be dispersed in an organic phase using a cationic surfactant, dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DODA·Br), Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This cationic surfactant would self-assemble on the negative GO based on electrostatic interactions, allowing it to be more hydrophobic and be dispersed in chloroform due to the long alkyl chains of DODA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The resulting GO/DODA chloroform dispersion was drop cast on to a substrate under 85% relative humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The films exhibited an electrical conductivity of 4.6 S/m and were thermally stable up to temperatures of 400 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

As the Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) suggested, capacitance is directly proportional to the effective surface are of the electrode, which implies that electrodes possessing higher surface area could lead to higher capacitance as well as higher energy density. It should be noted that the effective surface area is a surface area that is accessible by electrolytes, not necessarily the same as the one calculated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. Porous graphene and porous graphene-based hybrids have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their high theoretical surface area along with good mechanical strength and stability.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of the charged and discharged electric double layer capacitor</p><p>(Reprinted with permission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>])</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40580_2017_123_Fig7_HTML.gif" id="MO8"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Macroporous graphene for supercapacitors</title><p id="Par63">Macroporous graphene structures generally possess larger pore and pore volume as compared to micro- and mesoporous graphene. Electrolytes can be held within large macropores, which could reduce required diffusion path length of electrolyte ions. Indeed, macroporous self-assembled graphene hydrogels prepared by one-step hydrothermal process exhibited relatively high a specific capacitance of 152 F/g at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in 5 M KOH aqueous electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. When 3D macroporous graphene was created by in situ self-assembly induced by chemical reduction of GO, it displayed a capacity of 156 F/g at 20 mV/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These capacities of macroporous graphene hydrogels were higher than that of nonporous planar graphene (101 F/g) measured under the same conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. The increased electrochemical performance of macroporous graphene can be attributed to rapid ion transport due to the porous structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. However, 3D macroporous graphene prepared by the breath figure method showed rather lower capacities (87 F/g for pyrolyzed macroporous RGO, and 103 F/g for N-doped macroporous RGO) in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte comparing with nonporous graphene electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

For supercapacitor applications, high surface area can provide more active sites for electric double layer capacitive mechanism, which could lead to higher supercapacitor performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. For instance, activated graphene by KOH having surface area of 3100 m<sup>2</sup>/g showed promising electrochemical performance in a non-aqueous electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile (BMIMBF<sub>4</sub>/AN) electrolyte, a capacitance of 166 F/g was measured in the voltage window of 3.5 V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The energy density was found to be ~ 70 Wh/kg, which is around four times higher than existing activated carbon-based supercapacitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The power density of ~ 75 kW/kg found for the synthesized packaged cell was around an order of magnitude higher than commercial supercapacitors carbon of ~ 4–5 Wh/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

On the other hand, pseudocapacitors utilize fast faradaic reactions, and could store the larger amount of charges than EDLCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Nanostructure hybrid materials composed of graphene and pseudocapacitance materials could be a good platform for high-performance supercapacitors since both electric double layer capacitive and pseudocapacitive mechanisms can be utilized to store charges.</p><p id="Par66">For instance, metal oxide/3D macroporous graphene could store large amount of charges because of its additional pseudocapacitve redox reactions of metal oxides with advantageous macroporous structures. The 3D MnO<sub>2</sub>/macroporous graphene frameworks prepared by template-assisted assembly exhibited an excellent capacitance of 389 F/g at 1 A/g in 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte while 3D macroporous graphene showed around 202 F/g under the same measurement conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These results highlight that incorporating pseudocapacitive materials into macroporous frameworks could significantly enhance electrochemical performance such as capacitance and energy density due to additional faradaic reactions. When macroporous graphene networks were coated with an electroactive conducting polymer PANI, high capacitance of 385 F/g was achieved at 0.5 A/g in 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte, resulting from faradaic reactions of PANI as well as facilitated electrolytes transport caused by 3D macroporous networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Energy is stored based on the intercalation of lithium ions in LIBs where lithium ions move from anodes to cathodes during a discharge process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Energy density, power density, cyclability, safety, rate capability and cost are some of the most important parameters in LIBs.

Furthermore, more Li atoms can be intercalated in defective sites and edges of graphene, which could lead to even higher capacity than 744 mAh/g.</p><p id="Par69">Indeed, macroporous graphene assembled by the breath figure method showed an extremely high capacity of 3025 mAh/g at a discharge current of 50 mA/g for the first discharge cycle, and lost about 50% of its capacity from the second cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This loss of capacity was ascribed to the solid electrolyte interphase formation as well as irreversible redox reactions of oxygen-containing functional groups of graphene sheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Afterwards, a capacity of 1150 mAh/g was obtained after 50 cycles for self-assembled macroporous graphene whereas nonporous graphene showed a capacity of 678 mAh/g after 50 cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In other studies, mesoporous carbon prepared using a CVD method was demonstrated as an anode in LIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Mesoporous graphene possessing a high surface area of 1654 m<sup>2</sup>/g with pores of 3–8 nm also exhibited a high capacity of 1723 mAh/g at 0.1 C as well as high rate capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>].

For example, N-doped 3D macroporous graphene was prepared through a two-step process and tested as an anode in LIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. First, GO sheets were assembled with polystyrene spheres to form PS@GO composite, followed by thermal reduction and N-doping with 5% NH<sub>3</sub> gas at 550 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>].

The 3D structure is beneficial for shortening the diffusion distance of electrons and Li ions leading to higher conductivity, as well as favoring ion migration by allowing easy access of the graphene surface to the electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>].

Incorporating electrically conductive graphene to inorganic cathodes is a good way to increase the overall electrical conductivity, which could potentially result in enhanced electrochemical performance. When porous graphene/inorganic composites are used, higher rate capability can be expected considering its porous nature and high electrochemically accessible surface area.</p><p id="Par72">A continuous 3D graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> composite was prepared using a spray-drying method followed by thermal annealing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. This graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> had a substantial void fraction within the 3D micrometer-sized network, which led to improved rate capability and cycling stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. The capacity of this composite was 149 mAh/g at 0.1 C, and 70 mAh/g at 60 C while conventional carbon-coated LiFePO<sub>4</sub> could deliver only 54 mAh/g at 30 C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. This enhanced cathode performance was attributed to its 3D conductive networks as well as shorter diffusion length of Li<sup>+</sup> caused by its porous structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Micro- and mesoporous activated graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> was also demonstrated as a cathode in LIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. It turned out that Li<sup>+</sup> ion can migrate much faster in activated graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> than in LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and non-activated graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> because of additional small pores on activated graphene sheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. This activated graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> showed impressive rate capabilities.

On the other hand, at a high current rate or 5000 mA/g, activated graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> composites could deliver significantly higher capacity of 60 mAh/g whereas both graphene/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> exhibited very low capacities less than 5 mAh/g at such a high current rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. A similar study was performed, in which activated graphene was decorated with 5 nm LiFePO<sub>4</sub> for a cathode in LIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Similarly, it also displayed greater rate capability and cycling stability due mainly to the enhanced electrical conductivity and the improved electrode–electrolyte contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">In other literatures, redox-active graphene electrodes and its composites have also been demonstrated for cathode materials in LIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. In this strategy, oxygen-containing functional groups on graphene sheets can act as redox centers at ~ 3 V (Vs.

This high capacity is attributed to the unique morphology with the pores providing reaction sites for oxygen reduction reactions and the microporous channels facilitating oxygen diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Defective sites of graphene sheets was proven to suppress the aggregation of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> because of strong interaction between defect sites and Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In another paper, ruthenium (Ru) nanocrystal-decorated porous graphene was demonstrated as a cathode for Li-air batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. It confirmed that pore size and architectures largely influence its electrochemical performance by the fact that nonporous graphene counterpart showed much smaller capacity at identical test conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. After loading the Ru catalyst, Ru/porous graphene composites exhibited a high capacity of 17,710 at 200 mA/g with a significantly decreased overpotential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. When curtailing its capacity to 500 mAh/g during charge/discharge processes, it showed very stable cycling performance with high energy efficiency around 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. Other graphene-based nanocomposites have been proposed and proved to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. For instance, macroporous graphene/graphitic carbon nitride prepared by hydrothermal reduction and freeze-drying exhibited improved capacity higher than 17,000 mAh/g as compared to pristine graphene showing a capacity of 13,000 mAh/g because of synergistic effect of graphene and carbon nitride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion and perspective</title><p id="Par77">As highlighted above, porous graphene has been a subject to extensive research and development in the past years due to its unique properties such as excellent mechanical strength and good electrical conductivity, which makes it a promising material in many applications, especially energy storage. This review paper has introduced various synthesis and processing approaches to preparing porous graphene and porous graphene-based nanocomposites with emphasis on energy storage applications. Overall, porous graphene could result in improved electrochemical performance in energy storage systems because of more available active sites and facilitated ion diffusion throughout the porous structures. However, several issues should be addressed to make porous graphene-based energy storage systems commercially viable. First, the porous architecture of graphene should precisely be controlled during preparation to maximize its electrochemical performance. Morphology and pore size along with a graphene wall thickness affect the behavior and electrochemical properties of graphene. Therefore, it is critical to design hierarchically porous structures with optimized pore size and pore volume for achieving superior performance. Second, production process of porous graphene would essentially be environmentally friendly, simple, affordable and scalable. The advancement of these processes will make graphene more readily available for use in high-performance energy storage devices.</p><p id="Par78">Based on the significant effort on porous graphene, it is likely that porous graphene will play important roles in the next-generation energy storage devices. The utilization of porous graphene in supercapacitors, LIBs, Li–S, Li-air and fuel cells will promote manufacturing and commercializing efficient, safe, and more stable energy storage systems. Furthermore, excellent mechanical properties and stability of graphene will provide other opportunities to create multifunctional flexible energy storage devices, which can meet multiple market’s needs simultaneously.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors’ contributions</title><sec><p>JWJ, PRF, ST and AM contributed equally to the manuscript.
