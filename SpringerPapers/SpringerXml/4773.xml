Here we demonstrate a GaAs FET with a monolayer graphene gate in which the threshold voltage was externally controlled by an additional control gate. The graphene gate forms a Schottky junction with the transistor channel, modulating the channel conductivity. The control gate sets the work function of the graphene gate, controlling the Schottky barrier height and therefore the threshold voltage, and reduces the subthreshold swing down to ~60 mV dec<sup>−1</sup>. The change of the threshold voltage was large enough to turn the initially depletion mode FETs into the enhancement mode FETs. This allowed to realize logic gates with a positive switching threshold in which the threshold voltage of each transistor was independently set. The presented FETs can also be operated as dual-gate FETs, which was demonstrated by realizing frequency mixers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EC | Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The continuous scaling and requirements for low-power operation of field-effect transistors (FETs) limit the range of threshold voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub>), which is the gate-source voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub>) at which a FET turns on. In modern FETs, the gates are made of metal and consequently, the threshold voltage cannot easily be adjusted because it is fixed by the work function of the metal. This problem is even more exacerbated in metal-semiconductor FETs (MESFETs) and high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), which are used in high-speed communication systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In such FETs, there is an additional constraint on the threshold voltage as prohibitively large gate leakage current (<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub>) is obtained if <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> was not properly adjusted. This is because the channel carrier density in these FETs is usually controlled by a Schottky barrier between the metal gate and semiconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The gate current is therefore the current of the Schottky junction which must stay in the off state to keep the gate leakage negligible. The inability to tune the work function of the gate metal, on which the Schottky barrier height (SBH) and consequently the turn-on voltage of the Schottky junction critically depend, limits possible applications of MESFETs and HEMTs.</p><p id="Par3">A better control of the threshold voltage of FETs could be obtained if the gate metal was replaced by a material of adjustable work function. Prior to the 45 nm technology node, poly-Si gates were used to set the threshold voltage in metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs during their fabrication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, poly-Si cannot be used in MESFETs and HEMTs and its work function cannot be adjusted after fabrication, i.e., during device operation. Such adjustment is possible in graphene because its Fermi level (and therefore the work function) can be controlled by an external electric field. The field effect in graphene has mainly been exploited in the applications in electronics in which graphene was used as a transistor channel of graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs). However, graphene also forms a Schottky junction with most of the semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, which has previously been used to realize photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, optical modulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, mixers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and MESFETs with a graphene gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The ability of graphene to form a Schottky junction with semiconductors and consequently act as a gate in a MESFET, opens up a perspective of the control of the threshold voltage of FETs. The electrostatic control of the SBH of graphene-semiconductor Schottky junctions has been used in the past to realize barristors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, vertical heterostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and strain sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here we demonstrate a semiconductor MESFET with a graphene gate, i.e., a graphene-semiconductor FET (GESFET), in which the carrier density in the GaAs transistor channel was set by a monolayer graphene gate. An additional Al/AlO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> control gate was fabricated on top of the graphene gate to externally control the threshold voltage of the transistor. The control gate sets the Fermi level of the graphene gate which adjusts the SBH at the graphene/GaAs interface and therefore the threshold voltage. By changing the voltage between the control and graphene gate, it was possible to change the threshold voltage of the GESFET by up to ~1.4 V. This allowed to change the sign of <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> (e.g., to shift <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> from −0.8 to 0.6 V) in GESFETs with a thin (~250 nm) GaAs channel, i.e., to turn their operation from depletion to enhancement mode after fabrication, which cannot be obtained in conventional MESFETs and HEMTs. The ability to externally control the FET mode was exploited to realize the logic gates with a positive switching threshold, i.e., the logic gates which could be cascaded. The demonstrated GESFETs can also be independently operated by each of the gates as dual-gate transistors. The dual-gate operation allowed the realization of novel functionalities, e.g., frequency up or down-conversion mixers without input resistors and therefore input power dissipation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>GESFET with a single gate</title><p id="Par5">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a shows the schematic of a GESFET in which the transistor channel between the source (S) and drain (D) was made of n-type GaAs. The gate (G) was made of monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which was transferred on top of the GaAs channel. The graphene gate was externally accessed through an Au electrode which forms an Ohmic contact with graphene. The depletion layer of the Schottky junction, formed between the graphene gate and GaAs channel, extends into the channel and reduces the thickness of the conductive (i.e., not depleted) part of the channel. This thickness was controlled by the Schottky junction voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub>), which modulates the depletion layer width and therefore the drain current (<italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>) between the source and drain. For instance, the decrease of <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> increases the depletion layer width and therefore decreases the drain current. The largest modulation of the drain current was obtained when the Schottky junction was reversely biased (<italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> &lt; 0 V) due to the weak modulation of the depletion layer width in forward bias (<italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> &gt; 0 V)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

This decreases the SBH from the initial value Φ<sub>B0</sub> to Φ<sub>B1</sub>, reducing the carrier depletion in the channel. The reduction of the SBH is therefore a consequence of the limited DOS of graphene and negatively affects transistor operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dual-gate GESFET</title><p id="Par9">To control the SBH (i.e., the work function of graphene), a second control Al/AlO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> gate stack is fabricated on top of graphene, resulting in a dual-gate GESFET shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. The graphene gate and control Al gate (C) form a capacitor in which the induced charge depends on the capacitor voltage <italic>V</italic><sub>GC</sub> rather than <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub>. This prevents the influence of <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> on the carrier density in graphene, i.e., it prevents the filling of the electronic states in graphene by the electrons from the GaAs channel when the Schottky junction is reversely biased (<italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> &lt; 0 V). As a consequence, the electrons originating from the depletion region in GaAs fill only the surface states, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b for <italic>V</italic><sub>GC</sub> = 0 V. As the surface states have a very large DOS, the SBH is only slightly reduced from Φ<sub>B0</sub> to Φ<sub>B</sub> ≈ Φ<sub>B0</sub>, i.e., the control gate prevents the lowering of the work function of graphene and deterioration of the transistor properties.

Similar to the transfer curves, the control gate does not make much difference if the channel is not depleted, i.e., for <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> &gt; 0 V. This is because the Fermi level of the graphene gate is inside the valence band in equilibrium, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. At positive gate voltages, the Fermi level in graphene can only shift deeper into the valence band where the DOS of graphene is large enough to suppress such shift and the increase of the SBH in the absence of the control gate. However, at negative gate voltages, the Fermi level shifts toward the Dirac point at which there is the minimum (zero) of the DOS of graphene. Therefore, as the gate voltage becomes more negative, the Fermi level noticeably shifts toward smaller DOS which decreases the SBH in the absence of the control gate. For this reason, as <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> decreases, the drain current decreases faster in the presence of the control gate, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. Once the Fermi level crosses the Dirac point (which happens at <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> ~ −0.6 V in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and enters the conduction band, the further decrease of <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> shifts the Fermi level toward larger DOS, which suppresses the Fermi level shift and the reduction of the SBH in the absence of the control gate. This suppresses further split between the drain currents in the absence and presence of the control gate. However, this effect cannot be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b because the channel was depleted by reducing <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> below −0.6 V in the presence of the control gate.</p><p id="Par12">The requirement to connect the control gate to the graphene gate in order to operate a GESFET as efficiently as a conventional MESFET is necessary only in the GESFETs in which the Fermi level is close to the Dirac point (e.g., as in the GESFET in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3)</xref>. However, if the Fermi level is deep into the valence band, the DOS of graphene is large enough to suppress the changes of the SBH with <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub>. Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> show the electrical characteristics of such a GESFET. It exhibits almost the same subthreshold swing as the conventional MESFET with a Ti/Au gate and turns off before the decrease of <italic>V</italic><sub>GS</sub> shifts the Fermi level close to the Dirac point of graphene. Such GESFETs typically exhibit the smallest subthreshold swing (<italic>S</italic><sub>th</sub> = 65 mV dec<sup>−1</sup> was obtained in this case).</p><p id="Par13">In contrast to a standard MESFET, the work function of a graphene gate in a GESFET can be controlled by the control gate, which is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and experimentally confirmed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>. When a voltage between the control gate and graphene gate is applied, e.g., <italic>V</italic><sub>GC</sub> &gt; 0 V as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, the most of this voltage drops on the oxide of the control gate. However, due to the limited DOS of graphene, there is also a voltage drop <italic>V</italic><sub>q</sub> between the metal contact of the graphene gate and graphene (usually modeled by the quantum capacitance). This lowers the Fermi level in graphene by <italic>e</italic><italic>V</italic><sub>q</sub> and consequently increases the SBH by the same amount to Φ<sub>B</sub> + <italic>e</italic><italic>V</italic><sub>q</sub>. Therefore, the increase of <italic>V</italic><sub>GC</sub> (i.e., the decrease of the control gate potential <italic>V</italic><sub>C</sub> below the potential of the graphene gate <italic>V</italic><sub>G</sub>), increases the threshold voltage <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> because it increases the depletion of carriers in the channel and decreases the drain current.</p><p id="Par14">The influence of the control gate on the threshold voltage is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> which shows that the increase of <italic>V</italic><sub>GC</sub> shifts the transfer curve, i.e., the threshold voltage <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub>, to larger gate voltages.

This means that the control gate of the GESFET can be used to change the transistor operation from the depletion to the enhancement mode, representing an advantage with respect to the conventional MESFETs.
