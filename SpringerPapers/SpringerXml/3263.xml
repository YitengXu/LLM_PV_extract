This is a formidable challenge. Fossil fuels currently account for 87% of Japan’s primary energy consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, responsible for annual emissions of 1.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO<sub>2</sub>, broken down as follows: electricity generation 43%, industry 28%, transportation 19%, and others 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Notably, more than 95% of fossil fuel consumption in Japan is supplied by imports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Japan’s plans for its low-carbon energy future envisage an important role for hydrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The main types of hydrogen include gray, black, blue, and green<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Currently, hydrogen is produced globally primarily from natural gas and this supply is classified as gray. Production of 1 kg of gray hydrogen is associated with an emission of ~10 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen in China is mainly produced from coal which is classified as black. If the by-product CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and sequestered, the hydrogen is defined as blue. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water powered by renewables such as wind and solar is classified as green<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Production of blue and green hydrogen accounted for less than 1% of the total global source of hydrogen in 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The current annual demand for hydrogen in Japan amounts to 1.3 megatons (Mt) and is consumed primarily by the industrial sector including oil refining and production of ammonia and petrochemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">An ambitious target of 20 Mt year<sup>−1</sup> for low-carbon hydrogen consumption by 2050 has been set by the Japanese government. This demand corresponds to ~20% of the total final energy consumption in 2050 as estimated by Japanese research institutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hydrogen is anticipated to play an important role in decarbonizing electricity generation and the hard-to-electrify sectors including heavy industry and long-distance transport and to substitute for fossil fuels as a zero-carbon feedstock in industrial sectors such as iron and steel. An interim target of 3 Mt year<sup>−1</sup> for hydrogen consumption by 2030 is identified in Japan’s government report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">An abundant and low-cost supply of hydrogen is an indispensable requirement in achieving the goal for a viable future hydrogen economy. Japan has set price targets for the supply of low-carbon hydrogen at $3 kg<sup>−1</sup> by 2030, declining to $2 kg<sup>−1</sup> by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The ultimate objective is to have the price for hydrogen competitive with projected future costs for natural gas, the latter estimated at about $10 per million British thermal units. The price for hydrogen on an energy equivalent basis would amount to about $1.4 kg<sup>−1</sup> in this case. The price of $2 kg<sup>−1</sup> targeted for 2050 assumes a premium to allow for the environmental benefits of hydrogen or equivalently a penalty for the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the alternative consumption of natural gas.</p><p id="Par7">The domestic production of green hydrogen from renewable energy in Japan is projected by the International Energy Agency to cost about $6 kg<sup>−1</sup> for 2030, considerably higher than the corresponding target of $3 kg<sup>−1</sup>, reflecting the high costs of domestic renewable electricity generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, Japan’s vision for its future hydrogen economy projects a significant supply from imports. Hydrogen could be shipped to Japan in a variety of possible forms: as liquid hydrogen, as a component of ammonia, or bound to a chemical carrier such as toluene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the case of supplies converted to ammonia, the hydrogen could be recovered prior to its eventual use in Japan or alternatively the ammonia could be employed directly as a zero-carbon energy source or chemical feedstock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the case of hydrogen bound to toluene, forming methylcyclohexane (MCH), the hydrogen could be stripped from the carrier for deployment at the destination and the toluene could be returned to its point of origin to facilitate an additional supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Potential foreign sources include supplies from among others Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Saudi Arabia, and Norway, with projected import costs in 2030 of $3–4 and $3–7 kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, for green and blue hydrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In summary, the supplies of hydrogen from currently anticipated sources are relatively expensive compared to the nation’s targets.</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we perform a detailed techno-economic analysis of the potential for a green hydrogen supply chain to Japan delivered from offshore wind produced in China on an hourly basis from every Chinese coastal province, considering several possible wind investment levels, electrolysis technologies, and transport mechanisms. We estimate the quantity and cost of green hydrogen that could be produced in China and delivered to Japan for the target years (2030 and 2050) highlighted in current Japanese projections. We find that the Chinese offshore source could be delivered at a volume and cost consistent with Japan’s idealized future projections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Projection of a China–Japan hydrogen supply chain</title><p id="Par9">We choose to emphasize the potential source of green hydrogen that could be produced from offshore wind in China. A prior analysis suggests that electricity produced from this source could be competitive on a cost basis with existing sources of power from nuclear or even coal before 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The offshore wind resource in China could provide potentially as much as 12 petawatt hours of electricity annually, approximately four times the demand for wind power projected nationally for 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The advantage of this offshore source for China relates to the extensive range of environments with water depths less than 60 meters in the nation’s exclusive economic zone, which contributes to a significant reduction in costs for the production of wind power (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). In contrast, economically viable offshore wind resources are more limited for Japan, reflecting the more rapid increase of water depths as a function of distance from shore.</p><p id="Par10">We consider three specific technologies for water electrolysis, alkaline electrolyzer cells (AEC), proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cells (PEMEC), and solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC), including estimates of how costs for these devices might be expected to vary in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We estimate the cost for hydrogen delivered to Japan from the three potential transport mechanisms: liquid hydrogen, MCH, and ammonia. The analysis allows for expenses associated with the production of the hydrogen carriers and the construction and operation of reservoirs for storage compensating for times when the wind-fueled source might be temporally low. The analysis allows also for expenses associated with storage at ports prior to shipping, costs for transport and costs for reconstitution of hydrogen from the ammonia and toluene supplies once delivered to the Japanese destination. The expense for the release of hydrogen (i.e., dehydrogenation) from MCH and ammonia depends on the energy source employed. We consider three possible sources: economically advantaged waste heat from industrial sources; combustion of hydrogen or ammonia; and combustion of natural gas. Japan’s road map for its hydrogen future envisages the development of a dehydrogenation technology using waste heat, projecting that the first such system should be commercially available by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We consider separately the costs associated with the delivery of ammonia without dehydrogenation at the destination, recognizing that ammonia could be employed directly as a fuel in power generation.</p><p id="Par11">In the baseline scenario, we assume moderate reductions of the costs of offshore wind projects in the future decades as estimated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The AEC system is considered in the baseline scenario since it is technically mature and the most cost favorable option for water electrolysis. Pressurized tanks are assumed as the default reservoir for storage. The economically advantaged industrial waste heat is assumed as the energy source for the release of hydrogen. The other scenarios assume different costs of offshore wind projects or different options in the hydrogen supply chain. For example, the cost savings for hydrogen storage that could be realized with the use of salt caverns if available for geological storage is investigated separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Large amount of cost-competitive hydrogen from China</title><p id="Par12">The potential quantity of hydrogen that could be delivered from the Chinese offshore wind source to Japan for 2030 and 2050 is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> as a function of the related levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH). This figure presents results from the baseline scenario (see Methods for its assumptions). For delivery of either a given amount of hydrogen or hydrogen-equivalent ammonia, the MCH mechanism is identified as the least expensive pathway, followed, in ascending order by ammonia, ammonia (with dehydrogenation), and liquid hydrogen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The LCOH in the MCH case could be as low as $2.0 and $1.8 kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively while meeting the demand levels of 3 and 20 Mt year<sup>−1</sup> targeted by the Japanese government for 2030 and 2050. Notably, these values of LCOH are significantly lower than the prices targeted for these years by the Japanese government, $3 and $2 kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The LCOH for the three transport mechanisms could be reduced further if the salt cavern option were available for on-site storage in China (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). This choice would be particularly beneficial in the case of liquid hydrogen, allowing it to become more competitive than ammonia for 2050.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Supply curves for hydrogen produced from offshore wind in China and delivered to Japan.</title><p><bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold> are for 2030 and 2050, respectively.

Current Japanese policy, as elaborated in the Green Growth Strategy, contemplates potential hydrogen demands by 2050 of 6, 7, and 5–10 Mt year<sup>−1</sup> in the transportation, industry, and power sectors respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Power plants using hydrogen or ammonia are anticipated to account for no more than 10% of the future electricity generation. The balance would come from renewable sources (50–60%, including wind, solar, hydro, biomass, and geothermal) and from a combination of nuclear and thermal plants (30–40%), the latter equipped with carbon capture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Considering a more ambitious goal for use of hydrogen to replace the envisaged nuclear and thermal components of the power sector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, future demand for hydrogen could reach as high as 40 Mt year<sup>−1</sup>. The data in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> indicate that this demand could be accommodated by hydrogen from China in 2050 at a cost of less than $2 kg<sup>−1</sup>. Even when waste heat is unavailable in the future, this demand could still be satisfied by the supply and direct use of ammonia (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">The geographic distribution of LCOH for the MCH transport mechanism is displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (a for 2030 and b for 2050). The costs with feasible locations for China’s offshore wind range from less than $2 kg<sup>−1</sup> to more than $6 kg<sup>−1</sup>.

The hydrogen supply chain scheme is conducted on an hourly basis for every coastal province under all possible wind investment levels. Wind resource data for the 30-year interval (1990 to 2019) were used to account for climate variability. Three technologies for water electrolysis, AEC, PEMEC, and SOEC, are considered. The electricity produced by offshore wind turbines is assumed to be transported by cable to shore, where centralized electrolyzers are placed to produce hydrogen. An option, which is not explicitly considered here, could involve the production of hydrogen with electrolyzers sited at the wind farm rather than onshore.

The assessment of such an option could be usefully followed up in a subsequent paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Optimization model for least-cost hydrogen delivery</title><p id="Par42">The potential costs and related quantities of hydrogen that could be supplied to Japan are obtained based on a least-cost hydrogen delivery model optimizing jointly investment decisions and hourly operations accounting for the volatility of offshore wind power. The model (written using Release 2020b of the MATLAB and Simulink product families) allows for grid-by-grid analysis of offshore wind deployment, for the operation of electrolysis equipment, for hydrogen conversion, for energy storage, and for related overseas transportation. The mathematical formulation of the proposed optimization model is detailed introduced in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par43">Further information on research design is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Y.
