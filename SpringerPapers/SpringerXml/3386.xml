To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel fabrication process for a monolithic-structured solid-state dye sensitized solar cell (ssDSSC) on textile using all solution based processes. A glass fibre textile substrate was used as the target substrate for the printed ssDSSC that contain multiple layers of electrodes and active materials. The printed ssDSSC on textile have been successfully demonstrated and compared with a reference device made with the same processes on a glass substrate. All PV textile devices were characterized under simulated AM 1.5 conditions and a peak efficiency of 0.4% was achieved. This approach is potentially suitable for the low cost integration of PV devices onto high temperature textiles, but to widen the range of applications future research is required to reduce the processing temperature to enable the device to be fabricated on the standard fabric substrates.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RCUK |

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Electronic textile (e-textile) based wearable technology has been demonstrated for various applications in recent years, for example, intelligent biomedical garments for monitoring, diagnosing and treatment of medical conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, wireless cardiac signal monitoring in sports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and military clothing integrating fabric antennas to support networks and communications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, in every e-textile application the issue of supplying power remains a significant challenge. E-textiles are typically battery powered using conventional rigid batteries that alter the characteristics (e.g. feel and drape) of the fabric. Batteries also require periodic replacement and are therefore inconvenient to use and dispose of. One alternative approach to batteries is to investigate energy harvesting technologies on textiles. Energy harvesting involves the conversion of ambient energy (e.g. kinetic, thermal or light) into electrical energy and this can provide a long-term, easy to use power supply that can potentially be embedded within the textile (i.e. the fabric is functionalized such that it becomes the energy harvester)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> to meet the individual needs. Harvesting light energy through textile based solar cells are expected to be a promising approach. Functionalizing textiles is not straightforward since they are complex structures formed from a wide variety of fibres using many different manufacturing techniques. Fabrics also place constraints on the technologies that can be used (e.g. limiting process temperatures) and the surface roughness presents a challenging substrate on which functional film must be deposited. There are many existing examples of solar cells on fabrics that use conventional rigid silicon (glass) or plastic solar cells, as standalone PV devices, which are attached onto the fabric as a functional patch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This approach alters the feel of the textile dramatically making the fabric relatively inflexible and non-breathable, and the fabric itself has no added functionality.</p><p id="Par3">This paper presents an investigation into the fabrication of solid-state dye sensitized solar cells directly (ssDSSC) on fabric substrates. The constraints of the fabric substrate mean that the existing processes and technologies cannot be simply applied directly onto the textile. In recent years, organic, dye-sensitized, and perovskite solar cells have demonstrated great potential within the photovoltaic market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), introduced by O’Regan and Gratzel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, is a promising candidate for flexible plastic and e-textile applications because of it’s the straightforward and low cost fabrication processes required and high energy conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The original DSSC consisted of two rigid glass substrates incorporating the electrodes with a liquid electrolyte injected between them. Yin <italic>et al</italic>. fabricated plastic DSSCs using flexible Indium tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalene (ITO/PEN) substrates as front and back electrodes with a liquid electrolyte in-between the sealed plastic substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.8%. Opwis <italic>et al</italic>. fabricated DSSCs on a glass fibre textile which had a screen printed polyamide film to smooth out the textile and a sputtered titanium bottom conductive layer. The plastic ITO/PET substrate was used as the top electrode with the liquid electrolyte injected in-between the sealed textile photo anode and the ITO plastic top electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The devices reached a PCE of 1.1%.</p><p id="Par4">Another approach to realise DSSC textiles is to functionalize the yarns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which can be woven in to a textile. Very recently, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. reported a DSSC textiles fabricated using Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) polymer yarns woven into different fabric structures. This used a liquid electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and achieved a PCE of 1.3% for a single fibre, which is the highest reported to date for fibre based DSSCs. This approach presents a challenge in large area applications to connect a number of crossed, cylindrical yarn solar cells that have been woven into the textiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the limitation of the bending radius curvature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, as well as the fibres are tending to break very easily which will lead degrade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> in cell performance. In addition, when woven into textiles, they are partially shaded which may reduce the power conversion efficiency. All of these photovoltaic yarns use conventional liquid electrolyte DSSCs, which suffer from leakage, corrosion and long-term stability problems in practical applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">These issues can be avoided using hole transport materials or solid electrolyte. Since first reported by Bach <italic>et al</italic>. in 1998<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, the amorphous organic material Spiro-OMeTAD (<italic>N</italic><sup>2</sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup>2</sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>2′</italic></sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>2′</italic></sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup>7</sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup>7</sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>7′</italic></sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>7′</italic></sup>-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9<sup><italic>′</italic></sup>-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2<sup><italic>′</italic></sup>,7,7<sup><italic>′</italic></sup>-tetraamine) has been considered as the most promising solid electrolyte for ssDSSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Hardin <italic>et al</italic>. fabricated ssDSSC on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates. In this work, the TiO<sub>2</sub> compact layer (CL) was deposited using spray pyrolysis followed by doctor blading a TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoporous layer for dye sensitisation and then spin coating the solid electrolyte spiro-OMeTAD layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The devices demonstrated a PCE of 2.7% and 2.8% for the evaporated silver (Ag) and laminated silver nanowire (AgNW) top electrodes respectively. Recently, Margulis <italic>et al</italic>. reported the same architecture of ssDSSCs on FTO glass substrates but after spin coating the solid electrolyte, a PEDOT: PSS layer was spin coated to provide a better contact with the spray coated AgNW top electrode. In this case, the device demonstrated an improved PCE of 3.7%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Printing techniques are an established processing technique for realising e-textiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and is a straightforward technique for adding functionality on top of any conventional (non electronic) fabric. The device presented in this research paper is fabricated using a novel combination of solution based deposition techniques including screen printing, drop casting and spray coating. All three deposition techniques are compatible with textile manufacturing. Screen printing, for example, is a common approach for patterning textiles with colour inks bonding to yarn fibre and can withstand washing and friction. Drop casting can be performed using dispensing equipment to deposit an isolated droplet or continuous liquid film and this has been fully automated in inkjet printing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Spray coating is a blanket coating process used in the textile industry to deposit continuous films across large fabric areas. For example, it has been used to back coat upholstery fabrics with hot melt polymer. With these processes there is an ongoing research challenge to achieving the uniformity and consistency required for function electronic devices across a large surface area on different textile surfaces. This work has investigated the use of spray coating through a shadow mask to achieve patterned functional thin films and the combination of processes demonstrates the promising potential of solution based processes for that large scale manufacture of e-textiles devices and functional layers on the surface of a fabric.</p><p id="Par7">Previously, we have investigated liquid state DSSC on Kapton and polyurethane coated polyester cotton fabric that demonstrated an efficiency of 7.03% and 2.78% respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This device structure involved the fabrication of the photo anode on Kapton and fabric substrates, but rigid FTO glass was used as the top electrode. As a result, the DSSC remained inflexible and the liquid electrolyte is unsuitable for fabricating textile devices because it leaks and evaporates through the fabric. We have also previously investigated the properties of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer with processing temperature. DSSC were fabricated on FTO glass and demonstrated an efficiency of 7.41% but it was found the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer requires a minimum processing temperature of 450 °C to sinter the film and achieve the this efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, to achieve a flexible and stable DSSC on textile, this paper presents details of an investigation into the fabrication of a two-dimensional ssDSSC fabricated on woven high temperature glass fibre textile substrates. Textile ssDSSC were printed directly on uncoated glass fibre substrates and on glass fibre textiles planarised using a liquid polyimide film. All materials used can withstand the required 450 °C processing temperature and the performance in each case is compared with a reference structure fabricated on an FTO glass substrate. Devices have been characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), PCE and transmittance measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has also been used to characterise the electrochemical processes occurring within the glass and fabric ssDSSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par9">The textile based ssDSSC is a flexible 2D planar structure that is a variation of the version fabricated on the glass substrate as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a,b)</xref>. All functional layers on both glass and textiles are same, except for the bottom electrode, which is the FTO on glass and a thick film silver layer on the textile substrates. The fabrication process for monolithic-structured ssDSSC on a single textile consists of five main steps as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a–e)</xref>, where all functional layers were directly deposited onto the textile substrates using processes such as screen printing and spray coating. To fabricate the ssDSSC, after initial investigations on uncoated textiles, a flexible polyimide layer was required to reduce the surface roughness of fabric. The use of the liquid polyimide to planarise the surface of the fabric is different to the polyurethane based material typically used due to the temperature limitation of the polyurethane film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Next, the silver bottom electrode was screen printed onto the dried polyimide and this serves to further reduce the surface roughness of the textile substrate as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>. The screen design ensures that the functional layers are only printed where required, and the effect on the fabric properties, such as flexibility and breathability, is minimized.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Isometric view of the schematic diagram, (<bold>a</bold>) FTO glass based ssDSSC device structure; (<bold>b</bold>) textile based ssDSSC device structure.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_37590_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fabrication process diagram of textile based ssDSSC, (<bold>a</bold>) screen printing polyimide and silver layer to form the bottom conductive substrate, (<bold>b</bold>) spray pyrolysis of TiO<sub>2</sub> compact layer, (<bold>c</bold>) screen printed TiO<sub>2</sub> porous layer and staining process, (<bold>d</bold>) drop casting of solid state electrolyte, (3) spray coating of PEDO:PSS and AgNW layer.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_37590_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref> shows the spray pyrolysis deposition of TiO<sub>2</sub> CL using a pre-designed shadow mask aligned with the silver bottom electrode on the fabric substrate. There are many parameters that influence the uniformity, roughness and coverage of the TiO<sub>2</sub> film on the substrates during spraying. This includes the flow rate of the functional ink concentration, the distance between the spray nozzle and the substrate and the gas flow pressure that carries the droplets to the substrates. A spray pressure of 0.3 bar was used for all the functional layers and the spray distance for the CL film was 12 cm. The TiO<sub>2</sub> CL was used to avoid direct contact of the solid electrolyte to the conductive bottom electrode that would otherwise short circuit the cell. The mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> layer was deposited on the TiO<sub>2</sub> CL and sintered to form photo anodes and this was followed by the dye staining process depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref>. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d)</xref> shows the deposition of freshly prepared solid state electrolyte solution, which was drop cast onto the dye stained devices and left for 16 hours to allow the solid state electrolyte to fully infiltrate into the TiO<sub>2</sub> mesoporous film.

The XRD patterns of FTO/glass with the CL TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, shows a strong diffraction peak of TiO<sub>2</sub> at 25.5°, which is due to the thin thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The CL TiO<sub>2</sub> sharp peak is attributed to the existence of a crystalline surface compared to the FTO reference glass substrates.

Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref> shows the SEM micrograph of glass fibre textile used in this research. This was initially planarised and made conductive by screen printing a silver layer with a thickness of 30 µm. The surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) values of glass fibre textile before and after printing the silver layer is 70.5 µm and 26.1 µm respectively. Whilst it shows the surface roughness of the textile was reduced by the silver, it is still far from ideal for the subsequent deposition of reliable functional layers. The nanoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> paste was screen printed three times to achieve a smooth continuous layer with a final thickness of around 30 µm as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>. This is substantially greater than the previously identified target thickness of 8 μm but is unavoidable due to the rough textile surface.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>FESEM images of (<bold>a</bold>) Plan view of bare glass fibre fabric and (<bold>b</bold>) Cross sectional view of the printed bare textile ssDSSCs, (<bold>c</bold>) liquid polyimide surface on the glass fibre woven textiles, (<bold>d</bold>) Cross sectional view of the printed liquid polyimide coated textile ssDSSCs.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_37590_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">The initial glass fibre ssDSSCs with the 30 µm thick TiO<sub>2</sub> layer demonstrated an efficiency of 4.14 × 10<sup>−6</sup>% with a V<sub>OC</sub> of 0.22 V, FF of 0.22 and J<sub>SC</sub> of 3.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. The increased thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> means the glass fibre ssDSSC is much less efficient than the FTO glass version with the 8 µm thick TiO<sub>2</sub> (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) which is ultimately due to the surface roughness of the textiles. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a)</xref> shows the J/V curves of the fabric ssDSSC that indicate there is resistance to charge movement between the functional layers due to the excessive and uneven film thicknesses.

The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) image of the top surface of the liquid polyimide surface is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(c)</xref> and the measured surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of the polyimide layer was 10 µm. As can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(d)</xref>, a 40 µm thick liquid polyimide layer was printed and the textile appears flat compared to the bare textile surface. The surface roughness was further reduced to 7 µm by the screen printed 20 µm conductive silver bottom electrode. This smoother surface enabled the thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer to be reduced to 20 µm, which reduced the resistance in the functional layer. Following the deposition of all functional layers, the device showed a maximum PCE of 0.4% with a V<sub>OC</sub> of 0.31 V, while the FF and J<sub>SC</sub> were 0.25 and 5.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> respectively. The PCE of the textile devices improved significantly because of the smooth flat surface that enabled the even deposition of the subsequent functional layers. This is the first reported fabrication of ssDSSCs on textiles with a PCE of 0.4%. The device also demonstrated good stability with a negligible reduction in PCE after it was kept in air for a period of two weeks without encapsulation. In total, five cells obtained 0.4% with the remaining cells obtaining PCE values in the range of 0.1–0.4%. Devices failures were due to short circuits from either the top and bottom electrode contacting or peeling away from the functional layers around the edges.</p><p id="Par16">The PCE values achieved for the textile ssDSSCs are, however, not comparable to the PCE values achieved on the rigid glass slides. There are two factors reducing the textile ssDSSC’s PCE values. Firstly, the sheet resistance of the printed silver bottom electrode was 22 kΩ/□ whereas the FTO coated glass substrates was 10 Ω/□. This corresponds to an increase in the series resistance of the textile cells resulting in lower current density and PCE. This could be improved by depositing binder free conductive layer using, for example, a silver precursor. Secondly, despite reducing the surface roughness of the printed silver electrode on the polyimide coated textile, it is still two orders of magnitude greater than the FTO coated glass slide. This increases the surface roughness of the subsequently deposited functional layers and the Ra value is greater than the optimised TiO<sub>2</sub> film thickness of 8 μm identified on the glass substrate. A TiO<sub>2</sub> film thickness of 20 μm is required o the textile to achieve a continuous film and the increased thickness reduces the PCE due to recombination. Further reductions in textile surface roughness are required to reduce TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness by, for example, increasing the polyimide coating thickness but this would reduce flexibility, as discussed below.</p><p id="Par17">The flexibility of the cells has been defined by determining the effect of repeated bending deformation on device PCE. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c)</xref> shows the fabricated device under bending around a pen with a radius of 0.5 cm. Actual cyclical bending tests were performed using an automated bending test rig around and devices where repeatedly bent around a radius of 2.5 cm and devices were first encapsulated to prevent abrasive wear during the test. The encapsulated cells were tested with the top AgNW electrode side facing up placing the active films in tension. After 10 bending cycles there was a 60% reduction in efficiency, and after 30 cycles the devices failed. The strain induced in the cell during bending caused the functional layers to mechanically fail due to the polyimide layer cracking. The amount of strain transferred to the device during bending is a function of the thickness and stiffness of the substrate and the polyimide coated glass fibre textile is quite stiff compared with a conventional textile. The strain in the polyimide and device layers can be alleviated by increasing the thickness of the encapsulation layer such that the cell is positioned closer to the neutral axis reducing the strain experienced during bending<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Regarding stability in air, the PCE versus time is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(d)</xref>. The encapsulated cells showed no reduction in PCE after 15 days, and after a further 30 days storage the PCE had reduced by around 0.03%. However, after 100 days the PCE had reduced by 80%. This indicates that the encapsulation layer initially protects the devices against exposure to air but this protection fails over time due to the permeability of the encapsulation layer.</p><p id="Par18">In a solar cell, electron transport, recombination and lifetime directly influence the photovoltaic performance, and these are affected by device impedance, which can be studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS was performed on both the glass and fabric based ssDSSCs, which were measured at a 10 mV forward bias under dark conditions and the Nyquist and bode plots are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a–d)</xref>. The equivalent circuit model for the glass substrates used to fit the experimental curve is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(e)</xref> and the fitted data results are given in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref> shows the Nyquist plot for the glass based device. There is a small semicircle in the high frequency range (Z<sub>re</sub> 300 to 500 Ω) that is correlated to the active layer/PEDOT: PSS and AgNW electrode interface (R3 in the equivalent circuit). The large semicircle is in the low-frequency range (Z<sub>re</sub> 500 to 1200 Ω), and is associated with the active layer:TiO<sub>2</sub> CL interface (R2 in the equivalent circuit) and the constant phase element (CPE) is the capacitance of this interface. The larger semicircle is pre-dominantly associated with charge transfer from the dye to the porous TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The values of R2 and R3 directly indicate the electrochemical activity across the junction of the cells and the lower these are the better the device performance. As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, R2 and R3 for the glass ssDSSC (PCE of 2.83%) are 0.72 and 165 kΩ respectively. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref> shows the Nyquist plot of the fabric ssDSSC. The shape of this plot is different to the glass ssDSSC and there is only a single large semicircle (Z<sub>re</sub> 1000 Ω to 120 kΩ). The absence of the smaller semicircle in the high frequency range is due to the challenge of probing the soft fabric. The glass device was tested using crocodile clips device but these pinched through the functional layers and caused the fabric ssDSSC to fail. The fabric DSSC was therefore tested using a 0.2 mm area probe but this was found to penetrate the 100 nm thick top electrode and contact the active layer directly. Hence resistor R3 can be ignored in the circuit model for the fabric ssDSSC curve as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows an increased R2 value of 120 kΩ, which indicates a higher rate of recombination due to the increased thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer for the fabric ssDSSCs.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Nyquist plot of ssDSSCs on FTO coated glass substrates.

The bare glass fibre textile required a TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness of 30 μm leading to an efficiency of 4.14 × 10<sup>−6</sup>%. The textile surface was planarised using a liquid polyimide and this enabled a TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness of 20 μm resulting in an efficiency of 0.4%. The optimised TiO<sub>2</sub> thickness on the glass ssDSSC was 8 μm but to achieve this a thicker layer of polyimide would be required. However, whilst the polyimide can withstand the processing temperatures used throughout this work and it is flexible to a degree, it does still increase the stiffness of the fabric and cracks after cyclical bending causing devices to fail. Further work is required to improve the flexibility of the polyimide without compromising its ability to survive at high temperature. The cell encapsulation process greatly improves the ability of the device to avoid the effects of oxidation and, by optimizing the encapsulation thickness, it could be used to reduce the strain in the device and polyimide layers thereby improving flexibility. This work has demonstrated the potential for fabricating ssDSSCs directly on fabric using solution based processes suitable for continuous roll-to-roll manufacturing. This PV device configuration could also be fabricated on standard textiles such as cotton, but the high temperature required by the TiO<sub>2</sub> CL is an issue and further research work is required to reduce the processing temperature required by the compact layers to less than 150 °C. EIS analysis indicated that glass based device showed a higher charge transfer and lower recombination rate compared to the fabric ssDSSC. This reinforces the importance of reducing the thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer in order to reduce the resistance in the fabric ssDSSC to obtain a higher efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par22">FTO coated glass substrates with the thickness of 1.0 mm and a resistivity of 10 ohm/sq were purchased from Solaronix (TCO10-10).

The glass fibre textile was cut into 15 cm × 15 cm, attached to an alumina tile by a Kapton tape, and placed on the substrate stage holder of the screen printer prior to printing. A squeegee speed 70 cm/min was used throughout. The printing gap for the liquid polyimide layer was set to 1.2 µm for the first two deposits and increased to 1.4 µm for the last two deposits. The screen printed polyimide layer was subsequently annealed at 150 °C and 275 °C for 45 minutes respectively in an oven.

After printing the TiO<sub>2</sub> CL, the textiles substrates were annealed at 500 °C for half an hour. The mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> films were screen printed with a printing gap of 1.8 µm using the commercially available paste and slowly heated to 500 °C for 30 min in an oven in an oxygen environment. The film was cured at 450 °C for 30 minutes, after which it was immersed into a dye solution for 16 hours for staining. The dye solution was Ruthernizer 535-bisTBA in ethyl alcohol solution (100 mg dye powder added to 15 ml of ethyl alcohol). The dye-loaded devices were carefully washed with ethanol to remove loosely bound dye molecules and minimise the resistance of the films. Then the devices were transferred to a nitrogen filled glovebox for drop casting 3 µl of the solid electrolyte onto the surface of the dye loaded TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The organic hole conductor, or solid electrolyte solution, was made by dissolving 260 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1.2 ml of chlorobenzene and then adding 25 μl of tert-butylpyridine and 40 μl of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt solution. The lithium salt contains 170 mg lithium salt and 1 ml of acetonitrile. The doped spiro-OMeTAD solution was allowed to infiltrate the TiO<sub>2</sub> for 12 hours in a nitrogen filled glove box. Then a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spray coated inside the glove box with a spray distance of 20 cm, and heated on a hot plate at 50 °C for half an hour.
