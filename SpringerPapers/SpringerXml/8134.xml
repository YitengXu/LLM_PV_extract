However, achieving high conversion efficiency is challenging since most Co related coordination environments facilitate fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Here, we design two kinds of Co-COF catalysts with oxygen coordinated Co atoms and find that after tuning of coordination environment, the reported Co framework catalyst with Co-O<sub>4</sub> sites exhibits a high CO production rate of 18000 µmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> with selectivity as high as 95.7% under visible light irradiation. From in/ex-situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is revealed that the predesigned Co-O<sub>4</sub> sites significantly facilitate the carrier migration in framework matrixes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the photocatalytic process. This work opens a way for the design of high-performance catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">A class of inexpensive aminoanthraquinone organic dyes are shown to facilitate visible-light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Over the past half century, the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> has increased steadily because of the excessive consumption of fossil fuels and the continuous discharge of CO<sub>2</sub>, causing disastrous environmental problems, such as global warming and ecological deterioration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As a result, CO<sub>2</sub> neutralization technologies are urgently required to alleviate the pressures of both the existing high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level and the continuous increment in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) has been considered an environmentally friendly solution for these problems, as light is clean, noninvasive, and remote-controllable. To date, the most used photocatalysts for the CO<sub>2</sub>RR are metal oxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, sulfides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, polyoxometalates (POMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and conjugated microporous polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Despite the promise of these photocatalysts, the production and selectivity of reaction products are quite low due to three essential limitations—poor light absorption efficiency, fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and less efficacious active sites—which often result in undesired side reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, seeking more efficient photocatalysts is of great significance to overcome these obstacles.</p><p id="Par4">Covalent organic framework (COF) is a class of organic polymers linked by reversible covalent bonds. COFs have highly periodic and modular crystalline structures, defining their programmable characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Recently, these porous frameworks have emerged as potential candidates for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR to CO due to their large surface areas, astonishing π-conjugated skeletons, high chemical and thermal stabilities, tuneable pore sizes, and functionalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To enhance the photocatalytic activity of the parent COF, several strategies have been developed in recent years. Among these strategies, incorporating metal sites into the host frameworks of COF is a feasible and compelling method for improving the photocatalytic activity since it increases the number of active sites, facilitates electron transfer into the COF, and enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, when considering the chemical microenvironments integrated with metal and local binding modes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, different metal coordination sites, such as metal-N<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, metal-N<sub>3</sub>O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, metal-N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and metal-N<sub>4</sub>O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, often exhibit distinct performance characteristics for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR. Unfortunately, the related structure-activity relationship is not clear, which results in a large deviation in the design of high-efficiency CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction catalysts. Therefore, the most significant consideration is to establish guidelines for a clear functional description of the metal-coordination centers, which is the core thought for understanding how to design a metal-COF catalyst with high efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the optimal coordination environments of metal centers in the COF matrixes are essential factors for catalyst design, as they determine the activities of metal sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To this end, a programmable design approach, as a strategy for dividing complex systems into more manageable modules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, is usually used in the programmable chemical synthesis of reticular materials and offers a good opportunity to regulate the chemical microenvironments of metal-COF composites with specific purposes and rationalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Guided by this approach, metal-COF composites with modular structures are regarded as good platforms for CO<sub>2</sub> photochemical conversion, which involves various rigid secondary units, such as organic functional groups and metal sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. By means of the programmable approach, these basic structural modules may be selected and optimized to modulate the microenvironments for the catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, using the programmable approach to design desired coordination modes in well-defined COF remains unexplored.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we design two types of cobalt Schiff base COF composites for the photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR to CO, in which cobalt is anchored by coordinated oxygen atoms. Benefiting from the controllable functional groups in the precursor modules and the strong coordination of cobalt (II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the cobalt-COF (Co-COF) was spontaneously formed according to the predesigned position of the -OH group in aldehyde modules by a programmable approach to provide precise coordination microenvironments. Through various spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations, a distinct Co-O<sub>4</sub> coordination mode is identified. The corresponding Co-COF composite exhibits a remarkably high CO production rate of 18000 µmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> and an excellent CO selectivity of 95.7%. The CO production rate is higher than and the selectivity is comparable to the current record reported for metal-COF photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the supereminent photocatalytic performance of Co-COF with Co-O<sub>4</sub> sites is mainly attributed to the strong separation ability of photoinduced electrons and holes although the contributions of high CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity and low charge-transfer resistance are also important.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Construction and analysis of microenvironments</title><p id="Par7">Here, 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)−1,3,5-triazine (TAPT) was used as a fixed module, and different aldehyde molecules were selected to serve as modules for building different porous frameworks containing isolated Co sites (Co-X-COF, where X represents aldehyde modules used to synthesize different COF matrixes, such as 2,3-dihydroxybenzene-1,4-dicarboxaldehyde (2,3-DHTA) and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (TP)). Specifically, 2,3-DHTA was employed to form Co-O<sub>4</sub> sites, while TP was applied to generate Co-O<sub>3</sub>N sites for comparative studies on different chemical environments.

This result indicated the successful construction of the 2,3-DHTA-COF matrix.

Remarkably, on sunny days in winter, the average production rate of the photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR to CO catalyzed by Co-2,3-DHTA-COF reached 11000 ± 20 µmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, and the selectivity towards CO reached 89% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24b</xref>).

The good photocatalytic stability of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF was verified in three CO<sub>2</sub> reduction cycle tests with a slight deterioration (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>). Furthermore, the good chemical stability of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF was confirmed by comparing its TEM images, FTIR spectra, PXRD patterns, and XPS spectra before and after the catalytic process (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reaction mechanism</title><p id="Par24">The high photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction performance of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF inspired us to investigate the CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction mechanism by isothermal CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, various ex/in situ spectral measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption was the first action before the catalytic steps, we first studied the adsorption isotherm of CO<sub>2</sub> on the parent COF and Co-COF. The CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacities of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF and Co-TP-COF were 46.1 and 37.8 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>), which were 3.8 times that of 2,3-DHTA-COF and 1.2 times that of TP-COF, respectively. The higher CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF was attributed to its chemisorption for CO<sub>2</sub> through the stronger coordination interaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with Co (II) where the CO<sub>2</sub> desorption peak was observed at ~212 °C, while the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption of 2,3-DHTA-COF was physical in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> since its CO<sub>2</sub> desorption peak was observed at approximately 80 °C, as determined by a temperature-programmed CO<sub>2</sub> desorption experiment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). In addition, although the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of TP-COF (33.5 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) was significantly higher than that of 2,3-DHTA-COF (12.8 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>), the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of Co-TP-COF was less than that of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF. Given that 2,3-DHTA-COF and TP-COF had the same topological structure, this result suggested that Co-O<sub>4</sub> coordination in 2,3-DHTA-COF, rather than the topological structure, played a crucial role in the enhancement of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity. Benefiting from the microenvironment constructed by the 2,3-DHTA modules, the optimal Co-2,3-DHTA-COF exhibited a high capacity CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, which was favorable for the CO<sub>2</sub>RR to CO.</p><p id="Par25">It is known that upon illumination with visible light, the electrons in semiconducting materials could move to the conduction band to create holes in the valence band. The electron-hole separation efficacy was one of the most important factors for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Thus, the photogenerated electron-hole separation efficiency was determined by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The steady-state PL spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30a</xref>) indicated that the strong emission of the photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> was effectively quenched in the presence of Co-COF/COF, while the PL spectrum of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> was not quenched with various amounts of the sacrificial agent TEOA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31a</xref>), as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. However, with the addition of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF, the PL spectrum of the excited [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> was gradually quenched, but there was almost no influence on the visible absorption spectrum of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31b, c</xref>). This result suggested that the PL spectrum directly quenched by Co-2,3-DHTA-COF in the photocatalytic system was not static quenching because static quenching, along with the formation of complexes between the luminophore and quencher, usually resulted in a change in the visible absorption spectrum of the luminophore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In addition, the plot of PL intensity versus the content of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31d</xref>) turned out to have upwards curvature when fitted with the Stern−Volmer equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, indicating that the PL of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> was not inherently collision quenching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Therefore, the quenching of the PL intensity of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> was directly caused by the transfer of photoexcited electrons from [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> to Co-2,3-DHTA-COF.</p><p id="Par26">The evidence for this transfer was provided by ultrafast femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>, after excitation of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>, a bleaching peak was observed at approximately 450 nm, and the strength of this peak decreased with increasing delay time, which indicated that the recombination of a fraction of electrons and holes occurred in [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> with the prolonged delay time. For Co-2,3-DHTA-COF, the strong and broad photoinduced bleaching peaks were observed at 490 nm and 550–650 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33a</xref>), which was attributed to the generation of photoexcited electrons in the conduction band of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. As the delay time increased to 1 ns, these peaks were not observed in Co-2,3-DHTA-COF due to the recombination of electrons and holes. Similar results were obtained for Co-TP-COF and 2,3-DHTA-COF (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33b, c</xref>). Nevertheless, when Co-2,3-DHTA-COF was added into the solution of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>, the peak strength of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF at approximately 550–650 nm increased with increasing delay time (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32d</xref>), indicating that the electron transferred from [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> to Co-2,3-DHTA-COF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, the above results suggested that the photoelectrons were transferred from the excited state of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> to Co-COF/COF.</p><p id="Par27">Compared with the COF matrixes, Co-COF displayed more significantly quenched photoluminescence emission and enhanced electron trapping and charge carrier separation. Thus, an adequate supply of electrons was realized by COF with abundant cobalt sites to optimize the elementary process of CO<sub>2</sub> photocatalytic reduction. In addition, the significantly decreased lifetime of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> in the presence of Co-COF/COF also supported favorable electron transfer. Compared with Co-2,3-DHTA-COF, Co-TP-COF exhibited a less pronounced PL quenching effect and leaded to a longer lifetime of [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> (173 ns in the presence of Co-TP-COF versus 156 ns in the presence of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30b</xref>), which suggested that the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs was better prevented by Co-2,3-DHTA-COF, and long-lived electrons were provided for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. For Co-TP-COF and 2,3-DHTA-COF, when [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> was added, there was no obvious change in the fs-TA spectra within 7 ns (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33e, f</xref>), indicating the rapid recombination of electrons and holes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. This result further verified that Co-2,3-DHTA-COF induced a high separation efficiency of electron and hole pairs for excited [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the lifetimes of the photogenerated electrons in Co-TP-COF and Co-2,3-DHTA-COF were evaluated by PL decay spectroscopy. By fitting the curves in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref> with a biexponential equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, the average lifetime (τ<sub>avg</sub>) values of photogenerated electrons in Co-2,3-DHTA-COF and Co-TP-COF were calculated to be 3.17 and 2.12 ns, respectively, supporting the result from the steady-state PL measurement. As such, the isolated Co metal sites anchored on 2,3-DHTA-COF facilitated photoinduced electron separation, resulting in enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction efficiency.</p><p id="Par28">Next, the surface charge transfer efficiency was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">35</xref>), and the charge transfer resistance simulated by the equivalent circuit followed the sequence Co-2,3-DHTA-COF (23 Ω) &lt; Co-TP-COF (42 Ω) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Considering that the Co content in 2,3-DHTA-COF was higher than that in Co-TP-COF, this order suggested an inverse relation between interfacial charge transfer resistance and the contents of cobalt sites. Similarly, the Co-COF samples showed lower charge transfer resistance levels than their parent COF matrices. These results were well supported by the transient photocurrent response, where the transient photocurrent density of Co-2,3-DHTA-COF was significantly higher than that of Co-TP-COF, indicating a relatively high charge migration rate (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">36</xref>). Obviously, cobalt-active centers with different microenvironments played crucial roles in the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, electron transportation, and separation of electrons and holes. Therefore, the Co-O<sub>4</sub> sites in Co-2,3-DHTA-COF clearly enabled this Co-COF to provide the high CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity, low charge-transfer resistance, and strong separation of electrons and holes, resulting in high photocatalytic performance of the CO<sub>2</sub>RR to CO.</p><p id="Par29">Moreover, in-situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR measurements were performed to study the possible intermediates in CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).
