id="Par26">Beside visible light the solar radiation which strikes the Earth’s atmosphere also contains ultraviolet (UV) and infrared irradiation. Based on the biological effects it induces, UV is divided into UV-C (100–280 nm), UV-B (280–320 nm) and UV-A (320–400 nm). UV-C, the most dangerous, is completely absorbed by the ozone layer in the atmosphere. As a consequence, UV-B is the shortest wavelength component of the sunlight which reaches the surface of the Earth. As an integral part of solar radiation, UV always accompanies visible light. This is of special importance for plants which are both sessile and photosynthetic organisms. The UV-B range is absorbed by many constituents of the cell with harmful consequences. UV-B is cytotoxic, damaging the cell at many levels, including nucleic acids, lipids, photosynthetic pigments and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Higher levels of UV-B cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activate general stress signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, the UV-B-dependent formation of dimers between adjacent pyrimidines in DNA strands may be both mutagenic and genotoxic due to blocking the progress of DNA polymerase. As a result, the exposure of plants to high levels of UV can lead to cell death dependent on ROS signaling (for a review see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]).</p><p id="Par27">The depletion of the ozone layer has resulted in an increase in the level of UV-B reaching the Earth’s surface. That is why the impact of this wavelength range on living organisms started to be intensively investigated in the eighties. Most experiments have been performed in growth chambers with relatively low photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) supplemented with a high dose of UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They showed a very strong impact of UV-B on the content of photosynthesis dependent pigments, the activity of photosynthetic enzymes and photosynthetic efficiency (for a review see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). UV-B affects Photosystem II (PSII) to much greater extent than Photosystem I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The degradation of integral components of PSII reaction centers, including D1 and D2 proteins, is an extensively studied aspect of the effect of UV-B on photosynthesis. Many compounds have been hypothesized as primary targets of UV-B action on photosynthesis, including the reaction centre itself, quinone acceptors and redox-active tyrosines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. UV-B is also absorbed by the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster and can cause its damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The reaction to UV depends both on its dose and the irradiation scheme. Acute treatment has a more severe effect than chronic exposure which activates acclimation responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These responses are aimed at minimizing the impact of UV-B on plant cells. They include leaf thickening, alterations in cuticular wax layers and the biosynthesis of UV-B-absorbing phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Leaf yellowing is one of the most visible symptoms of irradiation with high doses of UV-B. It results from chlorophyll degradation and the decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes. There are similar symptoms during many abiotic and biotic stresses, as well as during natural senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many of the stress conditions which cause leaf yellowing also induce the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Indeed, UV-B treatment of mature leaves markedly up-regulates the expression of these genes and down-regulates some photosynthesis-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The influence of UV irradiation on plants also depends on their age. DNA damage, measured by homologous recombination events, is clearly more severe in younger <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and <italic>Nicotiana</italic> plants than in older ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, the decline in anthocyanin, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents as well as in photosynthetic yield is higher in older plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The effect of UV-B on plant functioning is also affected by environmental conditions (for a review see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). The negative impact of UV irradiation on the growth parameters of cucumber increased with increasing nitrogen fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants grown in an elevated temperature are more sensitive to UV-B irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">There is often a synergistic effect between stresses induced by different factors. Pre-treatment of barley seedlings with other stressors, like a high NaCl concentration minimized the UV-B-induced decrease in the content of photosynthetic pigments and in photosynthetic efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. After UV-B pretreatment, plant survival was enhanced under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Plant tolerance to cold is increased by UV-B as shown by studies both in a growth chamber and in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Drought stress also has a lesser impact on plants pre-treated with UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (for a review see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). UV-B irradiation can enhance plant resistance to pathogen attack via changing plant morphology, the production of secondary metabolites and the expression of genes controlling pathogen viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, rice plants overexpressing <italic>WRKY89</italic>, a gene induced by pathogen attack, are more resistant to UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">The interplay between PAR and UV irradiation is the most widely studied (for a review see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). High light up-regulates the expression of the genes involved in flavonoids synthesis including <italic>PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE 1</italic> (<italic>PAL1</italic>) and <italic>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</italic> (<italic>CHS</italic>)<italic>,</italic> as well as the genes encoding ROS scavengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Flavonoids such as isoflavons and anthocyanins are UV absorbing pigments shown to increase plant tolerance to strong UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with an impaired production of ascorbate, a ROS scavenger, are more sensitive to UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This suggests that enhanced ascorbate synthesis helps plants to cope with UV-B-induced stress. The resistance of bean plants to elevated UV-B irradiation positively correlates with light intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A low dose of UV-B, when supplemented with visible light, does not influence photosynthesis or the expression of photosynthesis-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The chlorophyll content in plants grown in a UV-B-enriched environment may be even 25 % higher than that of the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The recovery of photosynthesis after UV-B damage is also faster under illumination with photosynthetically active light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. UV-B causes the degradation of D1 protein to a 20 kDa fragment which is subsequently completely degraded by proteases in a light-dependent manner. Additionally, <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of D1 protein occurs only under visible light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Growing plants under visible light supplemented with UV-B activates mechanisms which allow them to survive under subsequent high light stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Although high doses of UV-B have a negative impact on photosynthetic systems, UV-B is used in post-harvest technology to slow down yellowing during storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To address this inconsistency we examined the effect of short, 5 min high-dose (8 W·m<sup>−2</sup>) UV-B irradiation on detached <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves. As light is known to alleviate the effects of UV-B on plants, two different experimental regimes were applied after irradiation. The irradiated samples were kept either in darkness or under constant white light for up to 4 days. To characterize the influence of UV-B on photosynthesis the content of photosynthetic pigments, levels of D1 protein as well as photosynthetic efficiency were analyzed. The production of anthocyanins was examined both at the levels of gene expression and anthocyanin accumulation. Additionally, the expression of the senescence-associated genes, <italic>SAG12</italic>, <italic>SAG13, SENESCENCE1</italic> (<italic>SEN1</italic>) and <italic>WRKY53</italic> was tested. Finally, cell death was checked using trypan blue staining. The results clearly showed that irradiation with a high dose of UV-B can induce two different pathways. The key controlling factor is the presence or absence of visible light after UV-B irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par33"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia-0, and <italic>uvr8-6</italic> (<italic>uvb-resistance 8–6</italic>, SALK_033468, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) and <italic>mcp2d-1</italic> (<italic>metacaspase 2d-1</italic>, SAIL_856_D05, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) seeds were obtained from The Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC, Nottingham, UK).

Adult leaves from 5–6 week old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants were used for all experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>UV-B treatment</title><p id="Par35">Two experimental models were used involving either dark or continuous light treatment. Leaves meant for dark treatment were taken from plants dark-adapted for 16 h prior to the experiment and handled in green safe light. Leaves meant for light treatment were taken directly from the growth chamber during the light period. The irradiation of both kind of samples started at 10 a.m. i.e. 2 h after the photoperiodic light had been turned on. Just before irradiation the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves were detached from the plant and put on water-soaked paper. One half of each leaf was covered with black paper (control) and the whole leaf was exposed to 5 min of high intensity UV-B (8 W·m<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup>, under USHIO UV-B Lamps G8T5E). After treatment the covers were removed and leaves were transferred either to constant darkness or to constant white light (100 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup> ·s<sup>−1</sup>) delivered by LEDs (Tops 10 Power Pure White Led OSW4XAHAE1E).

On the one hand, we wanted to avoid possible effects of the circadian clock. On the other hand, we wanted to test the influence of UVB on either the dark- or light-adapted state of the leaves. Therefore, we decided to start both light and dark experiments at the same time point i.e. 2 h after dawn. In consequence, the plants used for testing the dark-adapted state were kept in darkness for that time. To make sure that this extended night did not result in drastic changes in the observed phenomena, leaf yellowing was observed in leaves taken from plants which were either dark-adapted or kept in photoperiodic light for 2 h before UV-B irradiation, and transferred to darkness afterwards. In both cases chlorophyll degradation was lower in UV-B irradiated leaf halves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, compare a and b), with differences observed only in the rate of degradation which was more prominent in control leaf halves from dark-adapted plants.

The first of these involved detached leaves from dark-adapted plants. The leaves were UV-B irradiated and kept in darkness for up to 4 days. In the other model leaves were taken from plants 2 h after the start of the light period. They were UV-B irradiated and placed in constant light (100 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup> ·s<sup>−1</sup>). Dark-induced leaf yellowing was observed in control leaf halves, while those from constant light stayed green but showed reddening, probably due to anthocyanin accumulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The opposite effect of post-UV-treatment light conditions was observed in leaf halves irradiated with 8 W·m<sup>−2</sup> of UV-B for 5 min.

The overall changes in the levels of chlorophyll a (chl a) and chlorophyll b (chl b) were similar. In continuous light, starting from the second day, the chlorophyll levels began to drop in the UV-B followed by continuous light (UVL) samples, resulting in a statistically relevant difference between 0UVL and 4UVL, as well as between 1UVL and 4UVL (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Table S3).

However, the dynamic of these processes was different. While in UV-B treated leaves (UVD) the decrease was slow and steady from day 1 on, in the control (CD) it was pretty rapid after 3 days. UV-B treatment slowed down chlorophyll degradation. On day 4 in UVD samples chl a and chl b amounted to 129 % and 153 % of that observed in CD respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. However, whereas a difference between day 0 and day 4 was statistically significant for CD, no statistical significance was observed for UVD. 4 days after irradiation the levels of both chlorophylls were clearly lower in UVL than in CL and similar to CD leaves. During treatment, the chl a/b ratio did not change significantly for CL samples, but increased in CD samples.

The differences between maximum quantum yield of PSII (QYmax) levels were more clearly visible than these between levels of photosynthetic pigments. QYmax stayed unchanged in the control leaves kept in continuous light (no statistically significant differences between subsequent days in CL leaves).

These differences manifest as statistically significant between 3UVL and other leaves from this series (0UVL, 1UVL, 2UVL). In the CD leaves, the quantum yield decreased, first slowly, and from day 3 on, quite rapidly.

Consistent with visual observations, a very strong increase in the levels of anthocyanins was observed in leaves transferred to continuous light. At the end of experiment, the anthocyanin content in leaves from constant light was 36 times higher than that observed in dark-treated leaves.

This process may be a result of natural senescence or stress (biotic or abiotic). Senescence is also induced in leaves that are detached and stored in darkness or individually darkened on a plant kept in a photoperiod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Yellowing may be delayed by interference with the chlorophyll degradation pathway, as observed in numerous mutants, collectively known as “stay-green”. Those mutants can be classified as either functional, i.e. those with delayed overall senescence, or cosmetic, i.e. those where only chlorophyll degradation is delayed while other aspects of senescence progress normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">In our model, the darkening of detached leaf halves resulted in a decrease in both chl a and chl b content and an increase in the chl a/chl b ratio. These trends are similar to those observed before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, we did not observe such a significant amount of chlorophyll degradation products as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Some amount of pheophytins was found only after 4 days of darkness (not shown).</p><p id="Par72">A much higher retention of carotenoids is typical of the senescing leaves of almost all plants. Usually, the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Changes in the levels of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein and β-carotene occur in parallel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Our results are consistent with those observations. The level of carotenoids did not change during the first two days of darkening, and started to decrease from the 3rd day. Taken together, these results indicate that our system is an appropriate experimental model of senescence.</p><p id="Par73">Sub-lethal doses of UV-C, UV-B and gamma irradiation are widely used in post-harvest technology. Beneficial, hormetic effects of such irradiation include the sanitization of fresh vegetables and fruits, an increase in phenolic compounds, in the content of lycopene and other pigments, the up-regulation of antioxidant content and antioxidant enzyme activity (for a rewiev see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). Treatment with ultraviolet light may also influence chlorophyll content. Irradiation with a relatively high dose of UV-B (8.8 kJ ﻿·m<sup>-</sup>2) has been shown to delay the yellowing of broccoli florets ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) and lime peel during storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This yellowing results from the storage of detached plant parts in darkness. It has been shown that dark storage induces senescence and the expression of senescence-associated genes in broccoli starting after 3 days of storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">We show that a similar dose-dependent effect can be observed in detached <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves kept in darkness after irradiation with 8 W·m<sup>−2</sup> UV-B (i.e. 2,4 kJ·m<sup>−2</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our results indicate that high-doses of UV-B interfere with chlorophyll degradation in darkness and slow it down. The contents of all photosynthetic pigments tested, except neoxanthin and violaxanthin, were slightly lower in irradiated leaves during the first 2 days after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, starting from day 3 chlorophyll degradation in control leaves progressed much faster and the balance reversed in favor of UV-B treated plants. The same was observed for photosynthesis efficiency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The maximal quantum yield of PSII was higher in UV treated leaves than in control (only darkened) ones. Thus, starting from 3 days after irradiation the positive effects of the treatment outweighed the negative ones. Chlorophyll a and b were degraded in darkened samples but the degradation rate of both pigments was modulated by UV irradiation. The chl a/chl b ratio increased in darkened control leaves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), in accordance with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This probably results from the faster degradation of LHCII-derived (Light-harvesting complex II) chlorophylls mediated by a complex of STAY-GREEN1 (SGR1) with chlorophyll catabolic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], as it is counteracted in a mutant with impaired SGR1 protein function (<italic>nonyellowing1-1, nye1-1</italic>) during mild stress treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Interestingly, in UV-treated samples the chl a/chl b ratio remained almost unchanged during the whole time-course of the experiment. This suggests that in the absence of visible light UV-B activated signals can interfere with a specific pathway of LHCII degradation. In our system the Lhcb1 protein level remained unchanged during the experiment (Western blot data not shown). It has been observed that the degradation of Lhc proteins starts later than degradation of D1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. It is likely that the components of LHCII, namely proteins and pigments, are degraded sequentially and that chlorophyll degradation precedes other processes.</p><p id="Par75">The amounts of β-carotene and lutein were slightly higher after UV irradiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). These pigments are constituents of the photosynthetic protein pigment complexes, PSII and LHCII respectively. The increased retention of β-carotene after UV-B treatment correlates with the slower degradation of D1 protein and may result from the increased stability of the whole complex.</p><p id="Par76">Lutein and other xanthophylls which build LHCII complexes are important in photoprotection mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The higher level of lutein and unchanged level of violaxanthin after UV-B pretreatment may result from a slower degradation of LHCII. Neoxanthin was the only pigment that showed an immediate decrease after UV-B treatment. It is known that neoxanthin absorbs UV and that it can photoisomerize upon excitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Although other carotenoids also can photoisomerize, the effect for neoxanthin is the strongest and can reach 10 % of this pigment’s content. Thus, the observed decrease may result from photoisomerization. Light is necessary for an effective conversion of neoxanthin isomers to the primary conformation. Since there is no light in our system, the process is very slow and the level of neoxanthin in UV treated samples remains lowest during the whole time-course of the experiment.</p><p id="Par77">All UV effects on photosynthesis in darkened leaves were accompanied with a slower decrease in total protein level, a slower decrease in the amount of D1 protein as well as a slower decrease in the level of photosynthesis-related transcripts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This is consistent with observed changes in photosynthetic efficiency. The specific product of UV-induced D1 protein cleavage was present after the treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, day 0). As in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we showed the persistence of this product in the absence of light, in our case for up to 4 days. Taken together, our results suggest that UV-B treatment alleviates the effects of darkening on the functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus.</p><p id="Par78">The examination of expression levels of senescence-associated genes showed that the UV effect observed was not caused by a simple retardation of senescence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). On the one hand, the mRNA levels of S<italic>AG12</italic> and <italic>SEN1</italic> were lower after short UV-B treatment in samples darkened for 3 days, when the differences in chlorophyll degradation started to be visible. On the other hand, over the whole experiment the expression of <italic>WRKY53</italic> was elevated in irradiated samples. The amount of <italic>SAG13</italic> transcripts was higher for the first 2 days after the treatment and started to decrease on 3rd day. This rather complicated pattern of senescence-associated gene regulation suggests that UV-B interferes with their expression; it does not supplement darkening-induced senescence but tends to modulate it.</p><p id="Par79">It should be noted that the advantageous effects of UV started to be visible at the same time as cell death symptoms appeared, confirmed by trypan blue staining. This shows that in our experimental system leaves are highly susceptible to both the damaging effects of UV-B and to the beneficial ones. The exact mechanism of the inhibition of dark-induced leaf yellowing by high doses of UV remains to be determined. To date, studies on the UV-dependent inhibition of chlorophyll degradation have been performed using broccoli florets and lime peel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It has been shown that UV-B inhibits the activity of chlorophyll peroxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and recently, the specifically affected by UV-B chlorophyll peroxidase C has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">Our results demonstrated that the inhibition of chlorophyll degradation in darkness was independent of the UV-B photoreceptor, UVR8, since leaves of the <italic>uvr8</italic> mutant showed the same symptoms as those of WT plants i.e. slowed dark-induced chlorophyll degradation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S1, dark). The more severe damage observed in <italic>uvr8</italic> mutants probably results from the lack of UVR8-regulated protective mechanisms It is in line with the hypothesis that UVR8 mediates responses to low UV-B doses, whereas high doses of UV-B activate an independent pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This cascade regulates UV-B dependent programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. One of the regulators of cell death induced during biotic and abiotic stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is metacaspase 2d (MCP2d). Experiments employing the <italic>mcp2d</italic> mutant demonstrated that the effects of UV-B observed in this mutant were comparable to the wild type (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S1, dark). Thus, the inhibition of dark-induced chlorophyll degradation was not due to the inhibition of the activity of this metacaspase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Visible light influences UV-B action</title><p id="Par81">Visible light dramatically affected the response of leaves to high doses of UV. While darkened leaves stayed green even 4 days after UV irradiation, yellowing was observed in leaves transferred to continuous light starting from the 2nd day (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This yellowing was a result of a decrease in the levels of all photosynthetic pigments and was accompanied by a decrease in photosynthesis efficiency (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In contrast to the senescing CD samples, in UVL ones the chl a/chl b ratio decreased. The decrease resembled the effect observed in the <italic>nye1-1</italic> mutant during mild salt stress (Sakuraba et al. 2014). This suggests that the level of activation of different pigment degradation pathways during UV-mediated senescence in light was not the same as during dark-induced senescence. In particular, the specific, SGR1-dependent pathway of LHCII degradation appeared not to be activated.</p><p id="Par82">The cumulative dose of UV-B necessary to decrease the chlorophyll level has been calculated for <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> as 300 kJ·m<sup>−2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> grown in a 12 h light photoperiod with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 300 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup> ·s<sup>−1</sup> plus 6 kJ·m<sup>−2</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> of UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the chlorophyll content increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Even the addition 2,4 W·m<sup>−2</sup> of UV-B for 5 h (i.e. 8,64 kJ·m<sup>−2</sup> dose) to 40 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup> ·s<sup>−1</sup> of PPFD did not influence the chlorophyll level in 29 day old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In this experiment the content of both chlorophylls, lutein, violaxanthin and antheraxanthin remained unchanged as long as 4 days after UV-B irradiation. The UV-B dose used in our experiment e.g. 2,4 kJ·m<sup>−2</sup> was comparable with above experiments. The main differences were: using detached leaves from plants grown in a shorter (10 h of light) photoperiod and using constant illumination after the treatment. However, when leaves after UV-B treatment were transferred back to the photoperiod, the same symptoms were observed, but with slower kinetics (data not shown). The influence of PAR intensity during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth on the effect of UV-B has been shown before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The light intensity during the growth was lower in our experiment (70 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup> ·s<sup>−1</sup>) than those reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] (130 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup> ·s<sup>−1</sup>) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] (300 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>). Thus, it is possible that either light intensity and/or the duration of the photoperiod modulate the UV-B effects on photosynthesis (compare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). Additionally, Götz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] showed that a low level of UV-B during growth leads to a low accumulation of protective isoflavonoids. This may lead to a higher susceptibility of the plants to UV-B irradiation, compared to the plants grown in the presence of higher UV-B levels. While in our growth chamber UV-B irradiation was completely excluded, no data on the intensity of UV-B during plant growth are provided either by Moon’s or Poulson’s groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">The expression of senescence-associated genes has been shown to be up-regulated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> grown under white light supplemented with UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, in our system the expression of all senescence-associated genes tested was strongly up-regulated in UVL leaves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). A comparison of the results obtained for darkened and illuminated samples shows that PAR is a key factor in the induction of senescence-associated genes by UV-B. In consequence, the observed decrease in photosynthesis resulting from chlorophyll degradation seems to be a result of the initiation of the senescence process.</p><p id="Par84">Interestingly, UV-B pretreatment completely inhibited the accumulation of anthocyanins in continuous light. The expression of anthocyanin regulatory genes as well as anthocyanin accumulation have been shown to be strongly increased by UV-A and by visible light, mainly in the blue range. UV-B alone is much less effective, but it acts synergistically with visible light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In our experiments the expression levels of <italic>PAL1</italic> and <italic>CHS</italic> were elevated in leaves continuously illuminated with white light as compared to darkened samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). UV-B either did not influence (<italic>CHS</italic>) or slightly reduced (<italic>PAL1</italic>) this increase. In contrast, while anthocyanin accumulation was very strongly enhanced by white light, UV-B pretreatment counteracted this effect. The activation of the senescence program by UV-B irradiation, might eliminate the need for the production of photoprotective pigments.</p><p id="Par85">Although the impact of UV-B on photosynthesis, chlorophyll degradation, expression of senescence-associated genes was modulated by the subsequent light conditions, cell death was observed in samples both darkened and illuminated with continuous light. Visible light proved to be necessary for the proper course of a senescence program triggered by a high dose of UV-B. Light is required for the onset of cell death under nutrient-limiting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts after UV-C treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].

Indeed, in our system the senescence program leading to cell death was initiated in illuminated samples. In darkened ones other processes leading to cell death were activated.
