Efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective methods of disinfection for pathogens are vital to the health of human beings. The photocatalysis route has attracted worldwide attention due to its highly efficient oxidative capabilities and sustainable recycling, which can be used to realize the disinfection purposes without secondary pollution. Though many studies have comprehensively reviewed the work about photocatalytic disinfection, including design and fabrication of photocatalytic coatings, inactivation mechanisms, or practical applications, systematic reviews about the disinfection photocatalysis coatings from fabrication to effort for practical use are still rare. Among different ways of fabricating photocatalytic materials, thermal spray is a versatile surface coating technique and competitive in constructing large-scale functional coatings, which is a most promising way for the future environmental purification, biomedical and life health applications. In this review, we briefly introduced various photocatalytic materials and corresponding inactivation mechanisms for virus, bacteria and fungus. We summarized the thermal-sprayed photocatalysts and their antimicrobial performances. Finally, we discussed the future perspectives of the photocatalytic disinfection coatings for potential applications. This review would shed light on the development and implementation of sustainable disinfection strategies that is applicable for extensive use for controlling pathogens in the near future.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>coating</kwd><kwd>disinfection</kwd><kwd>inactivation mechanisms</kwd><kwd>photocatalyst</kwd><kwd>thermal

(e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae) exist in water and air (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Owing to the health threat caused by infections through air, water, food and a range of other modes of infection, elimination of the pathogens is a significant concern, which leads to a growing demand for disinfection techniques (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Numerous measures have been taken to tackle the microbial contamination problems, among which the conventional methods were usually based on physical and biological strategies, including conventional chemical disinfectants (e.g., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and alcohol, formaldehyde, or hydrogen peroxide), antimicrobial drugs (e.g., antibiotics) and ultraviolet irradiation (UV-C, UV-B and UV-A) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). However, the chemical disinfectants or antimicrobial drugs usually brought about other concerns including secondary toxic pollutants, drug resistance, and extra consumption (resources/energy used in producing the chemicals), while the methods using UV-induced processes have also been found to suffer from a lack of residual effect. Therefore, new disinfection techniques have been developed to address the shortcomings of the conventional methods.</p><p id="Par3">Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including photocatalysis, offer good potential alternative for disinfection purpose without extra consumption or producing secondary pollutants. As one of the AOPs method, photocatalysis route is regarded as a most promising antimicrobial strategy. In the process of eliminating pathogens in air, water, or on solid surface, the photocatalyst can be excited by light irradiation to produce h<sup>+</sup> and a series of powerful reactive oxide species (ROSs) including ·O<sup>2−</sup>, ·OH, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for inactivation of pathogenic microbes without secondary pollution. There are no mass loss and performance decrease for photocatalytic materials when they perform purification functions. Therefore, photocatalysis route has a number of advantages over the conventional disinfection methods (e.g., chemical disinfectants, UV irradiation, etc.), including good reusability, long-term stability, and eco-friendliness. Since the discovery of the photocatalytic water splitting effect of TiO<sub>2</sub> by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, research in photocatalysis has been carried out for the disinfection use, showing great potentials in air treatment, water remediation, food preservation, and many other fields (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Until now, photocatalytic disinfection has become an effective route for inactivation of different pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, or fungi, etc.). Photocatalytic material is a key factor to achieve high effective anti-infection. In the last two decades, ever-growing efforts have been made for the development of photocatalytic disinfection applications. Two categories of photocatalysts have been developed for inactivation of microbial species: the metal oxides like photocatalysts, including TiO<sub>2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), zinc oxide (ZnO) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>), tungsten oxide (WO<sub>3</sub>) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), and the nonmetal catalysts, such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), C<sub>60</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>), and so on. With the advance of analytical methods for pathogens detection and increasing public health concern, there is a pressing need to evaluate the performance of photocatalysis as an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable strategy for the disinfection of air, water, and solid surface and also the future opportunities for industrial use.</p><p id="Par5">Most of the photocatalytic powders and suspensions perform outstanding photocatalytic efficiency in eliminating the waterborne pathogens due to high surface area. However, drawbacks of difficulty in separation and recycling of the photocatalysts in suspension are the major factors that hindered their application in versatile environmental conditions. To tackle the problem, researchers developed different methods to immobilize the photocatalysts onto certain solid substrates or supports, which combines the advantages of functionality and practicability in photocatalytic disinfection. Among different methods of immobilization, surface coating technique is a most promising one in fabricating functional coatings with photocatalytic antimicrobial properties.</p><p id="Par6">Among different synthesis methods of surface coatings, thermal spray technique (e.g., plasma spray, flame spray, high-velocity oxygen-fuel spray, electric arc spraying, and cold spray) offers facile one-step fabrication of large-scale photocatalytic materials on arbitrary solid surfaces and also the capability of mass synthesis of photocatalytic materials via chemical reaction during the spraying processing. Therefore, the thermal spray method has great potentials in fabricating functional photocatalytic coatings with biocidal properties.</p><p id="Par7">In this review, four categories of photocatalytic materials, i.e., TiO<sub>2</sub>- and TiO<sub>2</sub>-based photocatalysts, metal-containing photocatalysts other than TiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials, metal-free photocatalysts, and two-dimensional photocatalysts for pathogen inactivation, were introduced. Moreover, we critically reviewed the antimicrobial performance and mechanisms of newly developed thermal-sprayed photocatalytic coatings from different emerging trends in the last two decades. Additionally, we presented the antimicrobial mechanisms of the coatings based on generation of photoactivated reactive oxide species. Finally, we discussed the future challenges and opportunities of thermal-sprayed photocatalytic coatings in disinfection applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Typical Photocatalytic Disinfection Materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TiO<sub>2</sub>- and TiO<sub>2</sub>-Based Photocatalysts</title><p id="Par8">TiO<sub>2</sub> is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts. TiO<sub>2</sub> was extensively explored for photocatalytic disinfection applications over the past years, which shows advantages of high photoactivity and stability, nontoxicity, and low cost. Among different types of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, Degussa P25 is the most popular photocatalyst, which is widely used for broad spectra anti-bacteria or anti-virus use (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). Yet two major drawbacks of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterials are high recombination rates and large band gap, which limit their photocatalytic disinfection properties. Intensive efforts have been devoted to improving the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO<sub>2</sub>. One of the most important routes is the modification of TiO<sub>2</sub> by using metallic/nonmetallic elements or metal oxides (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). On the one hand, the decoration of Ag, CuO, or SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was proved to enhance the UV-induced bactericidal effect of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts, among which the SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were also able to enhance the virus adsorption and hence the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency. On the other hand, the decoration of metallic elements (e.g., Pd, Cu, Mn, Co), nonmetallic elements (e.g., N, F), or rare earth elements/oxides (e.g., Rh<sup>4+</sup>, SrO) were also employed to enhance the visible-induced photocatalytic inactivation effect of viruses and bacteria (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Some of the recent work about modifications of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts are summarized as follows.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical modifications of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts for enhanced disinfection properties (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1118_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Precious metals like Ag and Cu are commonly used metallic elements for the TiO<sub>2</sub> modification. Younas et al. prepared Ag ion-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles by liquid impregnation (LI) method for antibacterial use (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). The experiments confirmed that under UV light illumination, the particles showed the disinfection efficiency of up to 16%, but when used synergistically with 1 wt.% Ag-TiO<sub>2</sub>, 100% of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) bacteria were killed in 30 min. Cu is an essential trace element in living organisms; thus, it could be used as a TiO<sub>2</sub> dopant for visible-light photocatalytic activity but with less toxicity. Gladis et al. reported copper-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles synthesized by a two-step method. The sol–gel deposition was followed by microwave hydrothermal treatment, which achieved a band gap reduction down to 2.86 eV at a relatively low nominal doping level of 2.0% (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Remarkable antibacterial properties against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were realized by TiO<sub>2</sub>-Cu<sup>2+</sup> without any cytotoxicity to human blood cells, which was considered to be related to the leach of Cu ions in combination with the oxidative attack based on TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis.</p><p id="Par10">Since most metallic dopants have toxic effects, nonmetallic elements (e.g., N, F), nano carbon or SiO<sub>2</sub> can be used as alternatives for modifying TiO<sub>2</sub>. By using the nonmetallic dopant, diminished toxicity and improved photocatalytic activity has been seen for the modified catalyst. Janpetch et al. developed a hybrid nanocomposite material of bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, and doping of the material by nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) gave rise to remarkably enhanced visible-light sensitivity (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). The results showed that N-F co-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> demonstrated high efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria under fluorescence light. Metal and nonmetal co-doping techniques were also used to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub>. For instance, N, W co-doping was used to narrow the band gap of TiO<sub>2</sub> to about 2.3 eV and achieve high photocatalytic activity under both UV and visible-light illumination (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">As to carbon-modified TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts, Leary and Westwood proposed several fundamental factors accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of TiO<sub>2</sub> by incorporating carbonaceous nanomaterials, where decreased band gap, reduced charge-carrier recombination rate, and promoted adsorption of reactants on the photocatalyst surface play the predominate roles (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). Different kinds of allotropies of carbon were used for the modification of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Magnetic carbon nanotube (MCNT) composites with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) have enhanced photocatalytic disinfection efficiency and better applicability than bare TiO<sub>2</sub> and/or MCNT, including better solar light applicability and easier catalyst separation process by utilizing its magnetic property. Y. Shimizu et al. investigated the bactericidal mechanism of <italic>E. coli</italic> by using MCNT-TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites under various conditions and photocatalytic disinfection models (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). The results showed that the MCNT-TiO<sub>2</sub> composite had higher disinfection efficiencies than bare TiO<sub>2</sub>, and the physical bacterial capture was the dominant disinfection mechanism. The authors found that high disinfection rate can be realized at an optimum MCNT: TiO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 5:1, while the hydroxyl radical ·OH was reactive oxygen species on the photocatalytic disinfection using MCNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, Fu et al. developed onion like carbon (OLC) modified TiO<sub>2</sub> composite coatings by suspension plasma spraying (SPS) using TiO<sub>2</sub> and OLC nanoparticles as the starting nanomaterials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). Nanostructured features of OLC and TiO<sub>2</sub> particles were retained in the coatings and unique dispersion of the OLC particles in the coatings was achieved. The authors revealed that the addition of OLC nanoparticles enhanced the photocatalytic performances of the pure TiO<sub>2</sub>. The synergistic effect of OLC and TiO<sub>2</sub> particles was further elaborated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Metal-Containing Photocatalysts Other than TiO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="Par12">To achieve solar-driven disinfection of waterborne pathogens, a number of efficient, UV to visible-absorptive, metal-containing photocatalysts other than TiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials have been developed, including ZnO (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>), Bi<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>6</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>), WO<sub>3</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>), Ga<sub>0.25</sub>Zn<sub>4.67</sub>S<sub>5.08</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>), CuI (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>), etc.</p><p id="Par13">ZnO (which has a band gap of 3.37 eV) is abundant in nature, relatively inexpensive and strongly oxidative, which is similar with TiO<sub>2</sub> when working as photocatalyst. ZnO nanoparticles are widely known for their enormous surface to volume ratio (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>). However, the toxicity of the ZnO nanoparticles in water can pose threats to human health. In order to take advantage of the photocatalytic surface and the safe disposal of ZnO, two ways of immobilization routes are developed. The first is to develop ZnO nanorods on flat substrates (e.g., glass) with seeded ZnO, while the second route is to immobilize the ZnO nanomaterials onto membrane substrates.</p><p id="Par14">As to the first case, Alarcon et al. prepared ZnO nanorods on a glass substrate, from seed layers fabricated from c-irradiated zinc acetate in a thermal bath of a basic zinc nitrate (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). Sanchez et al. reported immobilized ZnO nanorod films grown on ZnO-seeded polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates in alkaline aqueous solution (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>). Rodríguez et al. deposited ZnO-seeded glass substrate by using a spray pyrolysis technique; then, they fabricated ZnO nanorod film from a mixed solution of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and NaOH. Benefited from larger surfaces of the nanorods, ZnO exhibited good efficiency in bacteria disinfection, and previous measurements showed that the efficiency of ZnO NRs samples correlates with the texture of the nanorod and the number of rods per area (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Ceramic membranes of nano porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) were employed to grow highly adherent ZnO nanostructured films (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Najma et al. developed highly porous networks of ZnO nanosheets on AAO substrate. The membranes were found highly reactive under UV irradiation and greatly deteriorated bacterial population in the nearby vicinity. Moreover, the membranes also showed an appreciable antibacterial activity in the dark experimental conditions.

Both mesoporous anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires and single-crystalline rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods have been achieved, which exhibited remarkable sterilization of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Additionally, Purbia et al. synthesized C-doped anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> multi-tubes by using banana stem fiber as sacrificial template. High surface area (~ 99 m<sup>2</sup>/g) with a mesoporous structure made of ~ 15 ± 3 nm nanoparticles were reported, which exhibited enhanced light absorption property in visible region and excellent photocatalytic activity (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>). Furthermore, Zhang et al. prepared porous g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> by loading graphitic g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> onto expanded perlite (EP) support through a facile hydrothermal process. EP/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> (8-log reduction) and antiviral activity (<italic>MS</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>phage</italic>) under visible-light exposure of 180 and 240 min, respectively (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>). Yan et al. reported that Ga<sub>0.25</sub>Zn<sub>4.67</sub>S<sub>5.08</sub> microspheres prepared at 400 °C exhibited the best antibacterial performance, which attained complete killing of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 within 4 h. The authors attributed the superior photocatalytic activity to high specific surface areas and narrowed band gap (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>). All these studies improved the disinfection performance of the photocatalyst by taking advantage of the high porosity.</p><p id="Par43">Developing micro/mesoporous surface and visible active photocatalysts on a large scale is a promising task from the practical perspective. Thermal spray is an important fabrication route to realize porous photocatalytic structures. Recently, some researchers focused on the doping/processing-porosity-property correlation of thermal-sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings. It was found that their photoactivity was comparable favorably to that of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coatings and compressed P25 disks, where the bimodal-sized porosity was believed to be optimal for desired photocatalytic performances (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>). Sugiyama et al. fabricated porous TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings with uniform porosity along depth direction by a modified spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) technique, where the porous surface with an effective area eight times higher than that of the non-porous sample was achieved. Consequently, the photocatalytic ability was enhanced by 2.5-2.8 times (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>). Additionally, Jbeli et al. investigated the synthesis and physical properties of Fe-doped La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings grown by spray pyrolysis with a doping rate of 0-5%. The optimal photocatalytic activity was reached at the doping rate of 4%, due to its dispersed and distorted porous structure constituted by small nanoparticles (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>). Moreover, Zhang et al. found that the lower plasma power and higher powder feeding rate resulted in formation of higher porosity content in the plasma sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> coating, where the porosity has a dominating effect deciding the photocatalytic performance (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>). The improvement in the photocatalytic performance of these porous coatings were proved via photodegradation of the subject matters, where the photocatalytic disinfection ability of the coatings is yet to be reported.</p><p id="Par44">Therefore, for versatile environmental applications, extensive research efforts have been devoted to achieving large-scale photocatalytic coatings. According to Lin et al., mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystalline (NC) membranes with average pore size of 0.35 μm were successfully fabricated by coating on an alumina support via a rapid atmospheric plasma spray (APS) approach (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>). The photodegradation experiments of dextran and humic acid prove its potential in photodegradation of bio-organisms and protein under UV light irradiation, which is essential in photocatalytic disinfection. Additionally, M. C. Bordes prepared TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalytic coatings by APS from different feedstocks (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>). The feedstocks were obtained by spray drying suspensions of a nano- and a submicron-sized TiO<sub>2</sub> powder, with different solids contents and/or ratios of the nano- to submicron-sized particles. It was revealed that the coating porosity as well as the amount of partially melted areas depended strongly on plasma spray conditions and on feedstock characteristics. In another work, Kim et al. investigated the photocatalytic property of plasma sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> coating on foamed waste-glass substrates (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>). The porous coating sample was found to be efficient in purify the green tide and the red tide when illuminated by UV light, where the nano-sized commercial TiO<sub>2</sub> particle and mesoporous structure of the foamed glass improve the photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, Mcfarlane et al. studied the sterilization mechanism of three different microbes (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>) by using jet spray formed titanium dioxide surfaces (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>). The authors point out two important factors that are responsible for the high efficiency of inactivation: the high surface area of the porous nanomaterial and the direct contact between the microorganisms and the UV-activated surface. Furthermore, Zhai et al. reported suspension plasma sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub>-SrCO<sub>3</sub> heterostructure nanomaterial coatings for the first time (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>). The TiO<sub>2</sub>-SrCO<sub>3</sub> co-catalyst with semiconductor heterostructures show significantly superior bactericidal activities against <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is partly attributed to the novel porous structure of the coating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Bacteria Recruitment and Killing Strategies</title><p id="Par45">To achieve effective sterilization, the photocatalytic material must essentially favor the attachment of bacteria because of the short lifetime and diffusion length of the released ROSs. Support for the photocatalytic nanoparticles is able to limit the aggregation phenomena of the particles and contribute to the efficient spatial separation between the photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, by using the biocompatible supporting materials (e.g., zeolite, perlite, hydroxyapatite (HA), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), etc.) as baits, the recruitment and killing strategies have been a research focus. The bactericidal effect can be improved by enhancing the adsorption of bacteria and optimizing the ROSs radical generation on the supports by using these strategies (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with regular dimension structure, channels and cavities called micropores, which can be used as the bait of the recruitment. Reddy et al. investigated the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> supported over different support systems of HY, Hβ, HZSM-5 and SiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> systems (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>). It was observed that Hβ zeolite exhibited the most mechanical adsorption of negative surface charged bacterial cells among the selected supports, which in turn enhanced the bactericidal activity given by ·OH radicals generated by photocatalytic TiO<sub>2</sub> under light irradiation. Based on the experimental results, 5 wt.% TiO<sub>2</sub> loading over Hβ is sufficient to get higher bactericidal activity in comparison with TiO<sub>2</sub> solely. The shortcoming is that the samples were prepared by mixing the supports with TiO<sub>2</sub> in an agate mortar using dry ethanol, which limits its yields for practical application.</p><p id="Par47">Thermal spray method has been used to prepare composite materials of support and photocatalysts in a large scale. As a highly porous and chemically inert media, perlite granules can act as a good adsorbent and support for TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts. M. Giannouri et al. presents the one-step synthesis of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/perlite composites by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processing. The composite samples exhibited improved photocatalytic activity in comparison with commercial TiO<sub>2</sub> P25. However, the disinfection performance of TiO<sub>2</sub>/perlite composites is yet to be reported (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>) TiO<sub>2</sub>-hydroxyapatite (HAp) hybrid films were proved to be candidates for photocatalytic decomposition of germs, viruses by Nakajima et al. through spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) method (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>). Liu et al. prepared photocatalytic TiO<sub>2</sub>-HA coatings with significantly promoted adherence of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>), since HA is essentially biomedical material that bacteria like to stay on. It was also revealed that the coatings consisting of 10 wt.% HA showed the best photocatalytic activity, which is comparable to that exhibited by immobilized Degussa P25 coating. However, the photocatalytic disinfection mechanisms of <italic>E. coli</italic> were not discussed in the study. To further investigate the antibacterial mechanism, Huang et al. fabricated two types of TiO<sub>2</sub>-HA nanocomposites (TiO<sub>2</sub>-HA, TiO<sub>2</sub>-HA-rGO) by liquid flame spray deposition (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>). HA-enwrapped TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite powder was fabricated by using P25 particles as nucleation sites. HA in the composite powder acts as bait attracting approaching of bacteria and pushing them to TiO<sub>2</sub>.

It is known that suspended reactors are more efficient than immobilized ones due to large surface area available for redox reactions. For instance, TiO<sub>2</sub> hollow particles showed promoted photocatalytic performance than spherical ones in degradation of <italic>dimethyl sulfoxide</italic> due to the multi-scattering of light inside the hollow structure that could increase light absorption (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>). However, the main drawback of using nano- or micro-sized particles in suspension is the necessity of post separation treatment or recycling of the catalyst, potentially making the use of the catalyst more complex and expensive.</p><p id="Par49">To overcome the shortcoming of reusability of suspended reactors, researchers fabricated hollow microspheres of TiO<sub>2</sub> that were easy to reuse. Ren et al. reported a suspension plasma sprayed hollow microsphere of TiO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> composites, exhibiting excelled photocatalytic performance and good reusability. Due to the presence of magnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles in the TiO<sub>2</sub> hollow spheres, the micro spheres can be easily recycled through external magnetic field (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Excellent photocatalytic sterilization performances were revealed for the TiO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> hollow microspheres (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>).

Photocatalyst coating with self-cleaning property combines dual functions of antibacterial effects: anti-adhesive/self-cleaning surfaces and photocatalytic sterilization, which prevents the adherence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the formation of biofilms. Many researchers have reported various photocatalyst coatings constructed by using superhydrophobic or low energy surfaces, which can be used in a variety of fields including the reduction of HAIS (healthcare associated infections), marine antifouling, food industry, etc.</p><p id="Par51">Self-cleaning photocatalyst coatings were fabricated by a number of techniques. According to He et al., a series of ZnO-rGO nanocomposite films were prepared by sol–gel technique. The ZnO-rGO films possess photocatalytic activity and photoinduced superhydrophilicity, and increased content of rGO enhanced both photocatalytic activity and photoinduced superhydrophilicity of the ZnO-based films (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>).

id="Sec16"><title>Photocatalytic Disinfection Mechanisms</title><p id="Par58">A variety of factors may influence the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency, including temperature, pH value of the aqueous solution, dissolved oxygen, light intensity, etc. Apart from the objective conditions, the inner mechanisms of photocatalysis are more important for the disinfection properties, including the roles of the photocatalysts in the disinfection process, and the response of pathogens to the catalysis at bio-molecular level. The exploration of the disinfection mechanisms will serve as a guidance to the design of photocatalysts for their large-scale industrial applications.</p><p id="Par59">The disinfection mechanisms of different photocatalysts can be categorized into three aspects: physical damage to the cells by sharp edges of two-dimensional nano structural photocatalysts, toxicity of metal ions released from metal-containing photocatalysts, chemical oxidation of reactive oxidative species (ROSs) and holes produced by photocatalysts. It is recognized that ROSs and holes generated from the photocatalytic process are primarily responsible for the disinfection property, especially against bacteria. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, a schematic diagram of the mechanism of disinfection of bacteria is presented. The photocatalytic disinfection mainly relies on the photoexcitation of a semiconductor by the incident photons with the energy larger than its band gap energy level. In the photocatalytic disinfection process, electrons in the valence band (VB) get excited and move to the conduction band (CB), and photogenerated holes were left in the VB. Finally, photogenerated holes and electrons pairs are involved in redox reactions. Various reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the photocatalyst are formed, including ·OH, ·HO<sub>2</sub>, ·O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, etc. It is recognized that hydroxyl radicals are majorly responsible for the disinfection property, especially against bacteria. Furthermore, other ROS species can attack the cell wall and cellular components, causing the oxidation of cellular components and membrane leakage (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>). Either of these species attacks the phospholipid membrane of the cell wall and also the oxidation/reduction of the intracellular Co enzyme A, causing cell death and reduction in microbial population. Recently, enormous efforts have been made to study the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism and develop new photocatalysts, in order to acquire high efficiency in disinfection approaches for a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The possible mechanisms of the photocatalytic disinfection of bacteria (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1118_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Photocatalytic Anti-bacteria Mechanisms</title><p id="Par60">Photocatalytic antibacterial properties are largely related to the bacterial structure. Schematic view of the difference in the antibacterial mechanisms for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>). Most bacteria can be classified as gram-positive and gram-negative groups. Their cell walls are made of a complex assembly of high molecular compounds (e.g., peptidoglycan polymers, teichoic acids, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, phospholipids), which are the first surface target of photocatalysis. The outer membrane is absent for the gram-positive bacteria, and the peptidoglycan content of the two is different. Therefore, the primary targets of the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria may vary, leading to different disinfection mechanisms for the two types of bacteria, where ROSs species with higher oxidation power and concentration are required for the inactivation of gram-positive bacteria because of the multilayered peptidoglycan. On the other hand, the damage effects caused by photocatalysis, including leakage of minerals, genetic material in the microbes, and peroxidation of lipids are common for both the bacteria. Therefore, the photocatalytic disinfections have broad-spectrum antibacterial property.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Differences in membrane structural composition and proposed antibacterial mechanism for the gram-negative bacteria (left) and the gram-positive bacteria (right) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1118_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par61">Among all kinds of microbes, bacteria are identified as an effective indicator for water pollution. <italic>E. coli</italic> is mostly studied among various bacteria and recognized as an indicator for water quality, since its presence generally reflects fecal contamination of water. Extensive studies have been carried out to evaluate various photocatalytic materials that are effective in disinfecting <italic>E. coli</italic>. The disinfection performances of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis have been widely studied over the last two decades. To overcome the shortcomings of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based photocatalysts, recent research has been pertained to enhancing their photocatalytic inactivation efficiency.</p><p id="Par62">Modification of crystal structure or doping of metals can be used to increase the photocatalytic efficiency by inhibiting photogenerated electron-hole recombination, or increasing visible-light absorption by forming impurity bands. For instance, Zheng et al. developed a one-dimensional photocatalyst from Cu-TiO<sub>2</sub> nanofibers, it has the advantages of high aspect ratio, large surface area, and limited aggregation (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>). Characterization of the photocatalyst demonstrated that Cu<sup>2+</sup> substituted Ti<sup>4+</sup> in the TiO<sub>2</sub> lattice and formed an impurity energy level below the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>, which enabled the nanofibers to realize visible-light response. According to Song et al., the surface modification of rutile phase nano TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibited two times larger efficiency in <italic>E. coli</italic> disinfection than the unmodified material (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>). Furthermore, it has also been shown that metal doping could enhance photocatalytic efficiency by formatting intermediate bands.</p><p id="Par63">To further investigate the photocatalytic antibacterial mechanisms, Ji et al. studied the disinfection mechanism of a composite nanomaterial of Bi<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>6</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>/rGO, by using <italic>E. coli</italic> as an indicator (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>). Four scavengers, namely t-BuOH, AO, BQ, and Cr(VI), can be used to scavenge the radical species of h<sup>+</sup>, ·OH, e<sup>-</sup>, and ·O<sup>2-</sup>, respectively. By intentionally adding different scavengers for comparison examination, the researchers claimed that the photoinduced h<sup>+</sup> played a vital role in the disinfection process, while ·OH, e<sup>-</sup>, and ·O<sup>2-</sup> exhibited synergistic effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Photocatalytic Anti-virus Mechanisms</title><p id="Par64">There is a vast variety of viruses, which show a different resistance to inactivation in photocatalysis due to different sizes, shapes, structures or compositions. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>, the viruses can be classified into two categories, RNA-type and DNA-type viruses, which usually consist of genetic gene (RNA or DNA) and protein shell (capsid). Viral inactivation is mainly related to physical damage, metal toxicity, or ROS species (e.g., ·OH). It must be noted that, unlike the anti-bacteria process, viral disinfection involves denaturation of the rigid protein shell, requiring much more oxidizing power. Based on the current research in the field of photocatalytic viral disinfection, the inactivation falls into three steps: (1) particle shape distortion, (2) protein oxidation, and (3) gene leakage or damage. According to Ishiguro et al., RNA <italic>phage</italic> Qβ and DNA <italic>phage</italic> T4 exhibited a different resistance in a TiO<sub>2</sub>-UV system, where the inactivation of Qβ was more rapid than that of T4, suggesting the virus gene type influences photocatalytic inactivation kinetics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Three major mechanisms of viral disinfection induced by photocatalysts (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1118_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par65">The physical damage effect can be evidenced by the comparison study on the viral inactivation ability of graphene oxide (GO) and GO-aptamer-based photocatalysts. Physical damage in viral disinfection is typically involved in graphene-based photocatalysis, for which graphene with many sharp edges cut through protein shells of viruses and inactivated them. It was noted that the bare GO exhibited a similar viricidal activity in dark as that in light (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>). As a comparison, the GO-aptamer with blunt edges posed less viral inactivation than that of the bare GO with sharp edges, confirming that sharp edges of GO played an important role for inactivating viruses physically.</p><p id="Par66">Considering the metal toxicity, it was revealed that combination of photocatalysis and toxicity of metal ions works synergistically to enhance the disinfection effect. Ditta et al. reported that TiO<sub>2</sub>/CuO films showed faster viral inactivation kinetics than undoped films, although low photoactivity was observed, confirming a major antibacterial and antiviral contribution of released toxic Cu ions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>). In contrast, there is little to no viral inactivation in the solution containing Ag<sup>+</sup>, of which the concentration was equivalent to that released from Ag/TiO<sub>2</sub> under UV irradiation, suggesting a minor viral disinfection contribution of Ag<sup>+</sup> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>).</p><p id="Par67">As to the ROS factors, according to the investigation conducted by Zhang (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>), although the estimated concentration of ·OH was several orders of magnitude lower than that of ·O<sup>2−</sup> in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based disinfection system, ·OH is still believed to play a critical role in viral inactivation with higher oxidizing power. Hence, ·OH with a more positive reduction potential than ·O<sup>2−</sup> could enable the denaturation process. Furthermore, Horovitz et al. found the difficulty in inactivation of the tested microorganisms is in the order <italic>E. coli</italic> &lt; <italic>MS</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> &lt; <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>). The photocatalytic disinfection testing indicates that the viruses (<italic>MS</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>phage</italic>) were inactivated mainly by the free hydroxyl radicals in the solution, while <italic>E. coli</italic> is inactivated by both the free and the surface-bound hydroxyl radicals and other ROS, such as O<sub arrange="stack">2</sub><sup arrange="stack">-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Photocatalytic Anti-fungi Mechanisms</title><p id="Par68">The occurrences of pathogenic fungi in daily use water arose increased attention, which posed a potential threat to human health and agriculture production. A couple of published works studied the photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> on disinfection of fungi. The denaturation of the cell wall of fungi is a major aspect for its disinfection. It is believed that the rigid cell wall of fungus acts as a major obstacle, which requires ROSs with high oxidizing power (e.g., ·OH). As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>, the nanoparticle generates hydroxyl radicals (·OH) under visible-light illumination, which directly apply to the surface of fungal cell wall. This radical reacts with glucan and chitin layers of fungal cell wall that results in cell wall degradation and subsequent cell death.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Proposed mechanism of antifungal activity of N, F co-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1118_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par69">Disinfection of fungi by TiO<sub>2</sub>-based nanomaterials has been reported.

The work also revealed that the damage of spore walls/membranes of the fungal spores was increased by the photocatalysis, suggesting photo-disinfection mechanism. In another study, disinfection of Fusarium oxysporum fungal was realized by TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles co-doped with N and F exposed under visible light. El-Sayyad et al. reported a gamma-irradiated nanocomposite Co<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub><italic>x</italic> = 0.9 which shows promising antifungal abilities (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>).

In this critical review, we have summarized the research works about the typical photocatalytic materials, their biocidal performance, and mechanisms. The thermal spray technique, as a most promising way in fabricating large-scale photocatalytic coatings, has also been reviewed in different trends. Tremendous achievements have been accomplished in this field during the past years, yet it should be pointed out that there still remain a number of challenges, while some of the problems still need to be tackled for further study.</p><p id="Par71">The large-scale preparation and the immobilization of nanomaterial photocatalysts are two key problems for practical applications. Among various surface modification routes, thermal spray method perfectly solves the above problems due to offering a facile one-step fabrication route in realizing large-scale photocatalytic coatings and synthesizing immobilized photocatalytic coatings on desirable solid surfaces for practical use. Through element doping, structure construction, and chemical synthesis during the spraying process, a number of photocatalytic disinfection purposes can be realized by using thermal spray method, including visible-light-induced sterilization, self-cleaning anti-biofouling surface, etc. Black TiO<sub>2</sub> and porous structured antimicrobial photocatalytic coatings are realized by using thermal spray methods to enhance the efficiency in disinfection. Recruitment and killing strategies are realized by employing thermal spraying and seeking answers in nature.</p><p id="Par72">All in all, thermal spraying method perfectly integrated the novel structural and functional properties in fabricating photocatalytic coatings. However, though a number of studies about the antibacterial application of thermal-sprayed coating were launched, the studies of thermal-sprayed photocatalytic materials and related disinfection mechanisms for anti-virus and anti-fungus applications are still rare. Development of new wide-spectrum and high efficiency photocatalytic materials, theoretical data and inactive mechanisms, and expanding applications for antiviral and anti-fungi purposes still need to explore. With ever-increasing number of scientists focused on this area, we believe that the goals in enhancing the performance and exploring practical use in versatile environments can be achieved in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant # 52071329), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant # LY18C100003), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (Grant # 2020299), and Innovation 2025 Major Special Programme of Ningbo, China.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kaur</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Karthikeyan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Assessment of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Reactivation After Photocatalytic Water Disinfection Using Flow Cytometry: Comparison with a Culture-Based Method</article-title><source>Water Sci.
