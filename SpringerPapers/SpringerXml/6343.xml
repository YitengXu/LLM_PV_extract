She is the South African Research Chair in clean and green energy, with an interest in solar-energy conversion with a desire to see a life off-grid with photovoltaics (PV) and green hydrogen. Her research in PV systems involves work on hybrid organic/inorganic materials for solar-cell applications and artificial photosynthesis (AP) systems through natural energy conversions of plants and algae to produce green hydrogen through water splitting. Diale’s significant understanding of the physics and properties of materials gives insight into further developments and actualization of solar devices based on PV and AP. A combination of PV and AP using a hybrid system has led to research in this area, resulting in low cost and high efficiency solar cells. Daile has over 150 publications, has given multiple special invitation lectures at physics and materials conferences, and was awarded a National Science and Technology Forum Prize in 2018 for capacity building in STEM (science-technology-engineering-mathematics). She is an active MRS member, having served as a symposium organizer and on the Academic Affairs Committee, while working toward increasing support for early-career researchers. Daile is an active member of SAIP (Society for African Internationals at Penn), serving on the council from 2010 to 2017, and is a founder of Women in Physics in South Africa. She has collaborated with researchers worldwide and works to develop research and researchers in Africa, using her laboratory space and resources to allow others to prosper. Daile has also been involved in business, serving as an adviser to Just Energy Transition, and is the developer and presenter of the Solar Energy Course for both business and engineering.</p><p><fig id="Figc" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2023_484_Figc_HTML.jpg" position="anchor" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par5"><bold>Kaining Ding</bold> is the head of the Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells and Modules Department at Forschungszentrum Jülich.
