Here we consider a budget of 33 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from the European electricity, heating, and transport sectors between 2020 and 2050, which represents Europe’s contribution to the Paris Agreement. We have found that following an early and steady path in which emissions are strongly reduced in the first decade is more cost-effective than following a late and rapid path in which low initial reduction targets quickly deplete the carbon budget and require a sharp reduction later. We show that solar photovoltaic, onshore and offshore wind can become the cornerstone of a fully decarbonised energy system and that installation rates similar to historical maxima are required to achieve timely decarbonisation. Key to those results is a proper representation of existing balancing strategies through an open, hourly-resolved, networked model of the sector-coupled European energy system.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">For a given carbon budget between 2020 and 2050, different transformation rates for the European energy system yield starkly different results.

Although carbon emissions will most likely sink by 20% in 2020 relative to 1990<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, it is unclear whether the 40% objective settled for 2030 will be met. The national energy plans for the coming decade submitted by member states do not add up the necessary reduction to meet the target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, while in the context of a European Green Deal a more ambitious reduction of 55% is under discussion in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A remaining global carbon budget of 800 Gigatons (Gt) of CO<sub>2</sub> can be emitted from 2018 onwards to limit the anthropogenic warming to 1.75 °C relative to the preindustrial period with a probability of &gt;66%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This is compatible with holding the temperature increase well below 2 °C as stated in the Paris Agreement. Different sharing principles can be used to split the global carbon budget into regions and countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Subtracting the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 and 2019, and considering an equal per-capita distribution translates into a quota of 48 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for Europe. An approach that took into account historical emissions would lead to more ambitious targets for Europe than other regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Assuming that sectoral distribution of emissions within Europe remains at present values, the carbon budget for the generation of electricity and provision of heating in the residential and services sectors accounts for ~21 GtCO<sub>2</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. The budget increases to 33 GtCO<sub>2</sub> when the transport sector is included.</p><p id="Par5">Electricity generation is expected to spearhead the transition spurred by the dramatic cost reduction of wind energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and solar photovoltaics (PV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A vast body of literature shows that a power system based on wind, solar and hydro generation can supply hourly electricity demand in Europe as long as proper balancing is provided<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This can be done by reinforcing interconnections among neighbouring countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> to smooth renewable fluctuations by regional aggregation or through temporal balancing using local storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, coupling the power system with other sectors could provide additional flexibilities facilitating the system operation and simultaneously helping to abate emissions in those sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from heating in the residential and services sectors show a more modest historical reduction trend compared to electricity generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Denmark, where more than half of the households are connected to district heating systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, has shifted the fuel used in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units from coal to biomass and urban waste incineration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Sector-coupling allows large CO<sub>2</sub> reductions before large capacities of storage become necessary, providing more time to further develop storage technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Greenfield optimisation is useful to investigate the optimal configuration of the fully decarbonised system, but it does not provide insights on how to transition towards it. Today’s generation fleet and decisions taken in intermediate steps will shape the final configuration.</p><p id="Par8">Transition paths for the European power system have been analysed using myopic optimisation, i.e., without full foresight over the investment horizon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Myopic optimisation results in higher cumulative system cost than optimising the entire transition period with perfect foresight because the former leads to stranded investments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, the myopic approach is less sensitive to the assumed discount rate and can capture better short-sighted behaviour of political actors and investors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Transition paths under stringent carbon budgets have been mainly investigated using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which represent a broader approach including other sectors, globe, land and climate models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, the low temporal resolution and outdated cost assumptions for wind and solar PV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> in IAMs could hinder the role that renewable technologies could play in decarbonising the energy sector.</p><p id="Par10">In this work, we use an hourly resolved sector-coupled networked model of the European energy system and myopic optimisation in 5 years steps from 2020 to 2050 to investigate the impact of different CO<sub>2</sub> reduction paths with the same carbon budget. In every time step, the expansion of generation, storage and interconnection capacities in every country is allowed if it is cost-effective under the corresponding global emissions constraint. We show that up-to-date costs for wind and solar, that take into account recent capacity additions and technological learning, together with proper representation of balancing strategies make a fully decarbonised system based on those technologies cost-effective. Furthermore, we find that a transition path with more ambitious short-term CO<sub>2</sub> targets reduces the cumulative system cost and requires a smoother increase of the CO<sub>2</sub> price and more stable build rates. Our research includes the coupling with heating and transport sectors, which is absent in transition path analyses for the European power system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, incorporates the notion of carbon budget to the analysis, and captures relevant weather-driven variability due to hourly and non-interrupted time stepping.

The transport sector is added at the end of this section. The baseline analysis assumes that district heating penetration remains constant at present values, annual heat demand is constant throughout the transition paths, and power transmission capacities are expanded as planned in the TYNDP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> up to 2030 and fixed after that year. The impacts of these assumptions are assessed later. The Early and Steady path represents a cautious approach in which significant emissions reductions are attained in the early years. In the Late and Rapid path, the low initial reduction targets quickly deplete the carbon budget, requiring a sharp reduction later. As in Aesop’s fable “The Tortoise and the Hare”, the tortoise wins the race by making steady progress, whereas following the hare and delaying climate action requires a late acceleration that will be more expensive.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cumulative costs and system configuration</title><p id="Par12">The two alternative paths arrive at a similar system configuration in 2050, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Towards the end of the period, under heavy CO<sub>2</sub> restriction, balancing technologies appear in the system. They include large storage capacities comprising electric batteries and hydrogen storage, and production of synthetic methane. Cumulative system cost for the Early and Steady path represents 7875 billion euros (B€), while the Late and Rapid path accounts for 8238 B€. It is worth remarking that the cumulative cost remains lower for the Early and Steady path provided that social discount rates &lt;15% are assumed. In 2050, the cost per unit of delivered energy (including electricity and thermal energy) is ~59 €/MWh. The newly built conventional capacity for electricity generation is very modest in both cases, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>. No new lignite, coal or nuclear capacity is installed. Thus, at the end of both paths, conventional technologies include only gas-fuelled power plants, CHP and boilers.

In both paths, yearly costs initially decrease as the power system takes advantage of the low costs of wind and solar. Removing the final emissions in heating causes total costs to rise again towards 2050. The main reason behind the higher cumulative system cost for the Late and Rapid strategy is that the earlier depletion of carbon budget forces it to reach zero emissions by 2040 when renewable generation and balancing technologies are more expensive than in 2050.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Required expansion of heating capacities in both paths.</title><p>Maximum heating capacities are shown for CHP plants.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2020_20015_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Stranded assets</title><p id="Par14">Part of the already existing conventional capacities become stranded assets, in particular, coal, lignite, CCGT (which was heavily deployed in the early 2000s, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and gas boilers.

The CO<sub>2</sub> price is not an input to the model, but a result that is obtained via the Lagrange/Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multiplier associated with the global CO<sub>2</sub> constraint, see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>M.V., K.Z., G.B.A. and M.G. are fully or partially funded by the RE-INVEST project, which is supported by the Innovation Fund Denmark under grant number 6154-00022B.
