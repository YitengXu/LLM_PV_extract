This system is designed to use coal as fuel to produce syngas as a first step, similar to that employed for the integrated gasification combined cycle. Subsequently, the solid-oxide fuel-cell (SOFC) system is used to convert chemical energy to electricity directly through an electrochemical reaction without combustion. This system leads to higher efficiency as compared with that from a traditional coal-fired power plant. The unreacted fuel in the SOFC system is transported to an oxygen-combustor to be converted to steam and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Through a heat-recovery system, the steam is condensed and removed, and CO<sub>2</sub> is enriched and captured for sequestration or utilization. Comprehensive economic analyses for a typical IGFC system was performed and the results were compared with those for a supercritical pulverized coal-fired power plant. The SOFC stacks selected for IGFC development were tested and qualified under hydrogen and simulated coal syngas fuel. Experimental results using SOFC stacks and thermodynamic analyses indicated that the control of hydrogen/CO ratio of syngas and steam/CO ratio is important to avoid carbon deposition with the fuel pipe. A 20-kW SOFC unit is under development with design power output of 20 kW and DC efficiency of 50.41%. A 100 kW-level subsystem will consist of 6 × 20-kW power-generation units, and the MW<sub>th</sub> IGFC system will consist of 5 × 100 kW-level subsystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC)</kwd><kwd>Solid oxide fuel cell</kwd><kwd>Stack module</kwd><kwd>Carbon dioxide capture</kwd><kwd>Oxygen-combustor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2017YFB06</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>China Coal Society, co-published with Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40789_2021_Article_429.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Fossil Fuels (incl.

Coal is used because China has vast coal reserves and its low cost. Unfortunately, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) produced by such plants is a major source of CO<sub>2</sub> emission and air pollution. In 2019, China’s CO<sub>2</sub> emission was more than the sum of that produced by Europe and the USA. In the Paris Agreement signed by international leaders in 2015, the Chinese government promised that CO<sub>2</sub> emission in China would peak in 2035 and then decrease gradually to &lt; 3 gigatons (Gt) by 2050, compared with 9 Gt in 2015 (Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). CHN Energy is one of the leading energy companies in China. It ranks 107 in the top-500 companies worldwide. The coal mining of CHN Energy is up to 500 million metric tons per year. The total electricity generated by a coal-fired power plant is 190 gigawatts per year, about 45% of total electricity by CHN Energy. Old coal-fired power plants have lower efficiency (up to 35%–40%) and also generate significant CO<sub>2</sub> emission as well as other contaminants (e.g., nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide, and dust) to cause air pollution. A supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) power plant has better efficiency (≤ 48%) but its cost is higher if CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and stored.</p><p id="Par19">Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) power-generation systems with CO<sub>2</sub> capture have been developed recently to use coal effectively and to reduce air pollution and CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Compared with IGCC, IGFC is more efficient and incurs an lower overall cost, especially for pressurized systems (Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>). IGFC is expected to be the most efficient power-generation system in coal-fired power-generation systems (Liese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>; Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>). A typical IGFC power-generation system comprises: (1) a coal-gasification subsystem to convert coal powder to syngas and remove all impurities; (2) high-temperature solid-oxide fuel-cell system (SOFC); (3) a subsystem for the capture, utilization, and storage of CO<sub>2</sub>. A simple IGFC system is similar to an IGCC system, but the gas turbine power island is replaced by a fuel cell power module. The fuel cell is a device to convert chemical energy to electricity through an electrochemical reaction. Hence, more efficient power generation can be achieved using IGFC than that using IGCC. The numerical simulation, by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan (Nomura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>), indicated that, power-generation efficiency of 64.5% (HHV) and 53.6% (HHV) could be achieved using high-grade bituminous coal under ideal conditions and low-grade coal, i.e., lignite and subbituminous coal, respectively. Developing an IGFC power-generation system to convert old coal-fired power plants to “green energy” to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission and air pollution significantly is an urgent task for CHN Energy. Since July 2017, the National Institute of Clean-and-Low-Carbon Energy (NICE), which is fully owned by China Energy, has been developing an IGFC demonstration system working with key partners: Huaneng Clean Energy Research Institute, China University of Mining Technology, and Huaqing Inc. High-quality coal syngas is being mass-produced at a coal-to-oil plant in Yinchuan (Ningxia Province, China) by a subsidiary of CHN Energy. This coal syngas will be used as fuel for the IGFC system being developed by NICE. Therefore, the purification processes for coal gasification and coal syngas will not be discussed here. Oxygen combustion of exhaust fuel from the fuel-cell system and CO<sub>2</sub> capture will be discussed in a separate study (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). The development status of the high-temperature SOFC power-generation system, including the system design and initial experimental results, are presented and discussed here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Economic analyses of the IGFC system</title><p id="Par20">First, comprehensive economic analyses for a typical IGFC system mentioned in the USA Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL) report (DOE/NETL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) were performed. This IGFC system consists of three main subsystems: (1) coal gasification and removal of various impurities; (2) SOFC power-generation subsystem with anode loop recycling; (3) an oxygen combustion and heat recovery system generation for CO<sub>2</sub> capture [Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; adapted from DOE/NETL reports (DOE/NETL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>)]. An ASPEN Plus model was built to estimate the costs for Case 1.1 and Case 2.1 in the DOE NETL report using a cost of production (CoP) gasifier. The assumptions and parameters used in the model are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Costing methods were used from various references. First, IGCC with a CoP gasifier without CO<sub>2</sub> capture (Case B4A) was used for cost estimates for most non-SOFC components. Case B5A was employed to evaluate the costs of the Selexol plant and adapt them for IGFC costing cases. Case 12F was used for estimating cryogenic separation of CO<sub>2</sub> from other components (DOE/NETL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>). The Quality Guidelines for Energy System Studies (QGESS) capital cost scaling methodology was employed for scaling the components to the size estimated for the IGFC cases (DOE/NETL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). The USA estimates were converted to Chinese renminbi using a conversion rate of USD: RMB of 1:6.5. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows a comparison of several cases. We have reported the estimates for SCPC and SCPC with CO<sub>2</sub> capture previously (Surinder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>). The SCPC study was used to calculate the factors that could reduce the capital cost and operating cost between the USA and China. These factors were used to update the IGFC cases in the USA to calculate the IGFC costs in China. This is a simplified methodology for calculating IGFC costs in China. A more detailed analysis is suggested for an additional study in which each unit operation is modeled and sized specifically for Chinese conditions. Such work is outside the scope of the present study. The Base IGFC case was modeled versus Case 1.1 in the DOE study with an SOFC degradation rate of 1.5%/1000 h. The lower degradation rate case was modeled according to Case 1.2 of the DOE study with an SOFC degradation rate of 0.2%/1000 h. The advanced IGFC case was modeled according to Case 3.1 in the DOE study at a pressure of 8 bars instead of 20 bars used in the DOE study. A capacity factor of 80% was chosen for Case 1.1, 1.2, CN 1.1 and CN 1.2 and 85% for Case 3.1 and CN 3.1 for comparison with DOE NETL cases. The results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Comparison of different cases revealed that China-based systems were consistently lower in cost compared with those in the USA. IGFC costs were higher compared to SCPC without and with CO<sub>2</sub> capture at an SOFC degradation rate of 1.5%/1000 h. The IGFC system could become competitive compared with SCPC with CO<sub>2</sub> capture if the SOFC degradation rate could be reduced to 0.2%/1000 h. Such SOFC technology has been demonstrated at 250 kW in the USA and Japan (Kobayashi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). The IGFC system at higher pressure indicates a further reduction in cost of electricity (COE).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A typical IGFC system for economic analysis (from DOE/NETL report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40789_2021_429_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Assumptions used for the ASPEN plus model</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Case</p></th><th align="left"><p>1.1</p></th><th align="left"><p>1.2</p></th><th align="left"><p>3.1</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Anode feed CH<sub>4</sub> content (mol%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>5.8</p></td><td align="left"><p>5.8</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.9</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SOFC operating pressure (bar)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>2</p></td><td align="left"><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SOFC degradation rate (5%/1000 h)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.5</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.2</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SOFC over potential (mV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>140</p></td><td align="left"><p>141</p></td><td align="left"><p>70</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Capacity factor  (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>80</p></td><td align="left"><p>80</p></td><td align="left"><p>85</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SOFC stack cost (RMB/kW)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1463</p></td><td align="left"><p>1463</p></td><td align="left"><p>1463</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Inverter efficiency (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>97</p></td><td align="left"><p>97</p></td><td align="left"><p>97</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cost of electricity (COE) of various cases of IGFC systems as compared with SCPC without and with CO<sub>2</sub> capture for the USA and China</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40789_2021_429_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Development of an IGFC system</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selection and evaluation of SOFC stacks</title><p id="Par21">CHN Energy is a traditional energy company. It has focused mainly on coal mining, coal-fired power plants, wind power, hydropower, and solar power in recent years: SOFC technology is not available in-house. We communicated with several domestic and international SOFC developers to obtain high-quality and low-cost stacks for this program. Based on quality, availability, cost, as well as mass-production capability and quality control, the stacks from Elcogen in Finland, Sanhuan in Chaozhou (China), Huaqing in Suzhou (China), and China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing) were considered for evaluation. Leakage was inspected for all incoming stacks, and followed by electrochemical testing using hydrogen fuel at 700–800 °C at ambient pressure based on stack specifications provided by the suppliers. More testing data from Sanhuan stacks were generated due to their availability. All testing stands/systems used for testing of SOFC stacks or modules in this work were designed and built by NICE with suppliers. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> summarizes the testing results (stack voltage and power output versus current density) of three individual stacks. For stack 1, the stack power output was 981 W at a current density of 250 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, and increased to 1021 W at a current density of 270 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. If the current density was &gt; 270 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, the stack voltage formed a tail, which was off the trend line.

In general (as expected), the ASR curve showed three distinct regions. At a low current density, the cell potential dropped as a result of activation polarization. Steam has a significant effect on anode polarization (e.g., hydrogen absorption and dissociation on Ni particles) and the charge can be transferred easier under an electric field. Hence, stack ASR decreased significantly with increasing current density (hydrogen fuel is pure hydrogen and the steam content in the fuel increased with increasing current density). At moderate current densities, the cell potential decreases linearly with current due to ohmic losses. Therefore, stack ASR showed almost no change with current density at 0.10–0.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. At high current densities (&gt; 0.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>), the decrease in cell potential departs from a linear relationship with current density as a result of more pronounced concentration polarization.

Therefore, the stack performance under coal syngas must be evaluated and the operating conditions for the designed system must be defined. The composition of coal syngas available for operation of the IGFC system is approximately 61.8% H<sub>2</sub>, 36.7% CO, and 1.1% N<sub>2</sub> with a minor content of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Based on thermodynamics, carbon monoxide (CO) tends to form carbon under certain conditions: “reverse Boudouard reaction” (Eq. (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>)). This is an exothermal reaction and is thermodynamically favored at &lt; 500 °C based on thermodynamic analyses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The carbon formed can be deposited on the inner surface of the fuel pipe to block the fuel flow channel or enter the stack with fuel gas stream and be deposited on the anode surface. The stack performance would be affected under either case. The contact material and properties of the material surface can also affect carbon formation. The amount of carbon formation at different temperatures was analyzed using ASPEN Plus for the syngas with different H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio in the syngas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a–c). When H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio is 1.68 (61.8% H, 37.7% CO), the high end temperature for carbon formation was decreased from about 400 °C to 300 °C with increasing steam/CO ratio from 1 to 1.15. When the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio was 2.3 (69.7% H<sub>2</sub>, 30.3% CO), the high-end temperature for carbon formation changed to ~ 200 °C and the steam/CO ratio, when changing from 0.8 to 1.0, showed no significant effect on the carbon-formation temperature (which is determined by the thermodynamics of the reaction). Above this temperature, the change in the Gibbs free energy of reactions (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>), G, is positive and the reaction would not occur. If the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio was increased further to 2.9 (74.4% H<sub>2</sub>, 25.6% CO), the highest temperature for carbon formation would decrease to ~ 150 °C even without steam addition. From a kinetics view point, the reaction speed would be too slow at lower temperatures and reaction (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>) may not occur because the fuel gas stream will pass this temperature range at high speed (~ 14 SLPM) under the operating conditions of the system.<disp-formula id="Equ4"><label>4</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ4_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">CO</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">CO</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ4_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Sulfur is removed before the syngas enters into SOFC stacks. After an electrochemical reaction in the stack, outlet fuel (which contains about 10%–20% of flammable material) is fed into an oxygen-combustor to convert H<sub>2</sub> into steam and CO into CO<sub>2</sub>. After passing through a heat-recovery system, steam is condensed and removed, and CO<sub>2</sub> is enriched to &gt; 95% for capture.

To clarify, this process flow diagram represents operation of the 20-kW power-generation unit under steady state. During system start-up or shut-down, a start-up gas burner will heat the system to the designed operating conditions or to provide extra heat during system shut-down to control the cooling rate. The fuel system comprises a mixing tank to thoroughly mix coal syngas and steam at &gt; 100 °C to prevent carbon formation in the fuel inlet before entering the stack, and a heat exchanger to heat the fuel stream to the desired temperature (which is ~ 700 °C for the stack selected for our IGFC system).

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted to better understand the fuel flow and air flow within the stack module because they are important for heat management and keeping a healthy stack during operation. The simulation results were promising (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The air flow was quite uniform and the variation in fuel flow was within ± 5%, which is acceptable for the system operation under design conditions. Uniform fuel flow will ensure no fuel starvation in any local area within the stack during system operation. Such uniform air flow could ensure that the temperature difference of all stacks in the module can be controlled within specifications. That is, the air inlet temperature of each stack will be 700 °C and outlet temperature will be ≤ 800 °C to maintain optimal performance and a healthy stack. The cathode loop consists of a gas start-up burner, and the hot exhaust gas can be used to heat up cold air if the system starts at room temperature. During steady operation of the system, the inlet air is heated through a heat exchanger. Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> is the assembly sketch of the 20-kW SOFC power-generation system without the oxygen-combustor. On the back of the sketch, a hotbox shows where the SOFC module is installed. The hotbox is designed to keep the fuel cell module at constant temperature during steady-state operation via selection of insulation material to minimize heat loss and control the gas flow rate through the cathode loop. The front part is the balance of plant (BOP), including fuel, air, and safe gas (to protect the SOFC module during emergency shutdown), pipe line, control valves, flow meters, pressure meters, inlet fuel, air preheaters, exhaust fuel, and air blowers. The corner box is the control system. There is no external reformer and most CO in the fuel gas stream will be converted to CO<sub>2</sub> within the fuel cell stack.

The system consists of 5 × 100 kW-level subsystems which can be controlled separately, and the generated DC power is converted to AC power. There are 5–6 SOFC modules within each subsystem, which are connected electrically in parallel. If a module malfunctions or needs maintenance, other modules will not be affected and can continue to generate power. There are multiple stack towers within each module. These stack towers are connected electrically in parallel. In each stack tower, an individual stack is connected electrically in series.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conceptual design of a 500-kW SOFC power-generation system.

Based on Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the design voltage of the stack tower during steady-state operation is 172.2 V. This voltage may be too low for direct DC/AC conversion; boosting to a higher DC voltage before conversion to AC power may be required. The desired DC voltage is dependent on the technology of the advanced DC/AC converter. The small amount of power loss through each DC booster and AC converter during system design will be considered.</p><p id="Par36">The layout sketch of a 100 kW-level SOFC power-generation system is shown as Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>. It consists of 6 × 20-kW fuel cell modules. Each module can generate 15-kW DC power during steady-state operation. All SOFC modules (including the hotbox) are located on one side of the layout, and the control system is located on another side. Gas pipe lines, heat exchangers, fuel preheaters, air preheaters, and blowers lie between them. The footprint of this 100 kW-level SOFC system is approximately 7 m × 30 m.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conceptual design of a 100 kW-level SOFC power-generation system.

The stack cost was 30.4% which, in general, is the stack cost percentage in a SOFC power-generation system published by other developers of fuel cells. However, the stack cost may be slightly higher in our system because we purchased the stacks from the supplier and the labor cost for system assembly was counted in other cost rather than materials cost only. The heat exchanger was 7.9% and hotbox was 14.8%, which are expected to be reduced significantly because it is a customized design and built in very small quantities. Upon mass production, it will become a standard product and the cost will be much lower. The major cost seems to be related to the BOP: gas-pipe materials; gas flow and pressure control meters; fuel and air preheaters or burner during system start-up; heat exchangers during system steady-state operation; blowers to transport exhaust fuel to the oxygen-combustor to burn residual fuel to CO<sub>2</sub> and steam for CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment; labor cost for system assembly. It is a demonstration unit, so the overall cost is higher. For a commercial product, the system cost (including materials and labor) can be reduced significantly.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cost model of a 100 kW-level SOFC system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40789_2021_429_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par38">Each subsystem consists of 5–6 SOFC modules which are connected electrically in parallel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Summary and conclusions</title><p id="Par39"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par40">Economic analyses indicated that the advanced IGFC system (power degradation rate = 0.2%/1000 h or lower) with CO<sub>2</sub> capture is competitive compared with SCPC, and its COE can be up to 20% lower than that of SCPC.

Average stack ASR was ~ 0.31 Ω-cm<sup>2</sup> in hydrogen. Under preferred testing conditions, the stack did not show noticeable degradation during &gt; 500 h of long-term durability testing in hydrogen fuel and coal syngas, which indicated a potential long service life. When using syngas as fuel, the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio and steam/CO ratio must be controlled to avoid carbon deposition within the fuel pipe. A H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio of 1.68–2.8 and steam/CO ratio of 1 are acceptable. If the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio is low, the mixing of steam with syngas is important.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">A 20-kW SOFC power-generation unit is being developed to verify technology feasibility.

The maximum power output of the unit is expected to be 20 kW when using syngas as fuel. The CFD simulation of a 20-kW module indicates that fuel flow was, in general, uniform among 16 stacks. Flow variation between stacks was less than ± 5%.
