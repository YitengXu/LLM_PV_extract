Herein, we developed an elastic hybrid triboelectric–electromagnetic microenergy harvester (named EHTE) to realize hybrid sensing and microenergy simultaneously. This EHTE is a highly integrated triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic nanogenerator (EMG). Based on the triboelectric–electromagnetic hybrid mechanism, an enhanced electrical output of the EHTE was achieved successfully, which demonstrates the feasibility of the EHTE for microelectronics powering. Moreover, with the merits of the EMG, the developed hybrid microenergy harvester integrated both active frequency sensing and passive inductive sensing capabilities. Specifically, the almost linear correlation of the electromagnetic outputs to the frequencies of the external stimulus endowed the proposed EHTE with an outstanding active frequency sensing ability. In addition, due to the unique structural configuration of the EMG (i.e., a conductive permanent magnet (PM), hybrid deformation layer, and flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) coil), an opportunity was provided for the developed EHTE to serve as a passive inductive sensor based on the eddy current effect (i.e., a form of electromagnetic induction). Therefore, the developed EHTE successfully achieved the integration of hybrid sensing (i.e., active frequency sensing and passive inductive sensing) and microenergy (i.e., the combination of electromagnetic effect and triboelectric effect) within a single device, which demonstrates the potential of this newly developed EHTE for wearable electronic applications, especially in applications of compact active microsystems.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of

ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> is regarded as an important component for the development of modern society in various sectors, including industry, economic activity, transportation, and security. Although the IoT has experienced advanced development in recent years, challenges still exist in meeting the increasing demands on quality of life, especially for the energy supply problems of the IoT sensing network. As the key interface media between the environment and client, the sensing network consists of trillions of distributed sensors for environmental stimulus collection and transduction, in which the power consumption of individual sensors is low but the energy requirements of the total sensing network can be large, on the order of billions of watts. Thus, how to sustainably power sensing networks has become an urgent issue for the further development of the IoT.</p><p id="Par3">One of the most effective approaches is harvesting micro/nano energy from the ambient environment, where diverse energy sources are widely distributed in various forms, such as solar, heat, wind, and vibration. Therefore, a massive effort has been devoted to developing different kinds of micro/nano energy harvesters based on different energy harvesting technologies, including photovoltaic nanogenerators (PVNGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, thermoelectric generators (ThEGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, electromagnetic generators (EMGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and many others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, different kinds of energy harvesting technology have unique working conditions and output properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For example, light and temperature differences are indispensable working conditions for PVNGs and ThEGs, respectively, but their DC outputs provide a great advantage for wearable electronics powering. For EMGs, the bulk permanent magnet (PM) and coil are two essential components to realize EMGs with high output, but bulky and heavy EMGs are inconvenient to wear. Although flexible EMGs using ferroelastomer materials or flexible coils have already been proposed to address weight and size issues, the output was sacrificed. In addition, organic or inorganic piezoelectric materials and complex manufacturing processes, e.g., polarization treatment, should be required to form PENGs. In comparison, TENGs, with advantages such as no material limitations, high output power and high energy conversion efficiency, have attracted more attention in the IoT, particularly in portable and wearable electronic fields. Thus, great effort has been made to develop different kinds of high-performance TENGs, serving as robust power sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and/or self-powered sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. With the proposal of hybrid energy harvesters, the potential of TENGs has been explored in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. By integrating a TENG with other energy harvesting technologies in a single device, e.g., hybrid triboelectric–photovoltaic nanogenerators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, hybrid triboelectric–piezoelectric nanogenerators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, hybrid triboelectric–electromagnetic nanogenerators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, hybrid triboelectric–piezoelectric–pyroelectric nanogenerators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, multiplex electrical outputs can be generated from a single stimulus input, thus enhancing the energy conversion efficiency and enlarging the total output power of these devices. Moreover, hybrid devices can realize functional integration or complementarity. For example, Guo et al. developed all-fiber hybrid piezoelectric-enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators that not only achieved enhanced electrical output but also active motion sensing for real-time fall detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Wan et al. proposed a flexible hybridized electromagnetic–triboelectric nanogenerator for mechanical energy harvesting and 3D trajectory sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Wang et al. demonstrated a complementary electromagnetic–triboelectric active sensor for detecting triggering force and velocity simultaneously.</p><p id="Par4">In this work, we developed an elastic hybrid triboelectric–electromagnetic microenergy harvester (named EHTE), which not only adopted the advantages of several triboelectric–electromagnetic hybrid microenergy harvesters with hybrid and enhanced outputs but also highly integrated active frequency sensing and passive inductive pressure sensing within a single device. Based on the coupling of the triboelectric effect and electromagnetic effect, the EHTE exhibited remarkable triboelectric and electromagnetic outputs and hybrid output for microelectronics powering. This EHTE was successfully demonstrated to directly/indirectly power light-emitting diode (LED) screens and calculators, revealing the attractive potential for micro/nano powering. For hybrid sensing, the proposed EHTE could achieve active frequency sensing in terms of the linear correlation of electromagnetic outputs to frequencies of the external stimulus. In addition, due to the unique structural configuration of the electromagnetic nanogenerator of the EHTE, the feasibility of serving as an inductive sensor for passive sensing is provided. Herein, the inductive response behaviors of the proposed EHTE are caused by the eddy current effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which is a form of electromagnetic induction. Thus, with the merits of the hybridization of this triboelectric nanogenerator and electromagnetic nanogenerator, this newly developed EHTE successfully realized the integration of hybrid sensing (i.e., active frequency sensing and passive inductive sensing) and microenergy (i.e., triboelectric–electromagnetic hybrid microenergy) in compact form, exhibiting promising potential for active microsystem applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of the developed EHTE</title><p id="Par5">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> illustrates an exploded view of the elastic hybrid triboelectric–electromagnetic microenergy harvester (EHTE), which consists of an FeSiAl/silicone rubber (FeSiAl/SR) ferroelastomeric substrate, a 4-layer FPCB coil (FPCB is the acronym for flexible printed circuit board), a hybrid silicone rubber–air (SR-air) deformation layer, a permanent magnet (PM) and a silicone rubber (SR) encapsulation layer. The 4-layer FPCB coil, hybrid SR-air deformation layer and PM were the main components of the triboelectric nanogenerator of the EHTE, in which the polyimide (PI) on the top surface of the 4-layer FPCB coil and SR on the bottom surface of the deformation layer were used as triboelectric pairs, and the PM was used as the electrode. Moreover, the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomeric substrate, 4-layer FPCB coil, hybrid SR-air deformation layer and PM formed the electromagnetic nanogenerator of the EHTE. These discrete components have unique properties. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, this deformation layer had different grooves on its upper and lower layers. The upper layer was used to fix the PM, and the lower layer was mainly used as an air medium layer for the triboelectric nanogenerator. Notably, the sheet resistance of the PM was 0.36 MΩ/sq, and its magnetic field intensity was ~110.63 mT. As a result, the PM served as the conductive electrode of the triboelectric nanogenerator as well as the magnet of the electromagnetic nanogenerator in the hybrid microenergy harvester. For the 4-layer FPCB coil, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> illustrates the top view of one of the layers of the FPCB coil. Each layer had an outer diameter of 20 mm, an inner diameter of 6.65 mm and 19 turns. This means that the total number of turns of the FPCB coil was 76. There was a 3 mm-diameter hole in the 4-layer FPCB coil, which was filled by the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomer to improve the magnetic flux of the coil. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> illustrates the cross-sectional view of the 4-layer FPCB coil. The thickness of the whole FPCB coil was 240 μm, the thickness of the copper trace was 18 μm, and the width and space of the copper trace were 200 and 150 μm, respectively. The FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomeric substrate was another crucial component of the hybrid microenergy harvester. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> shows the surface morphology of the ferroelastomeric substrate with a 50 wt% proportion of FeSiAl particles, in which the FeSiAl particles were well distributed within the silicone rubber matrix. It is noted that the smaller FeSiAl particles observed in the ferroelastomer are due to particles that were semi/fully embedded in the silicone rubber matrix. To confirm the ferromagnetic property of the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomeric substrate, the magnetic hysteresis loop of the substrate was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>. This result indicated that FeSiAl/SR had inherent properties of ferromagnetic materials, such as high permeability, low remnant magnetization and low coercivity. In addition, a comparison of the characteristics of the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomers with different proportions of FeSiAl particles was performed, including the surface morphologies of pure FeSiAl particles and FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomers with 25 wt%, 50 wt%, and 75 wt% proportions of FeSiAl particles, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S1</xref> of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary file</xref>, and the magnetic hysteresis loops of the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomers with 25 wt%, 50 wt%, and 75 wt% proportions of FeSiAl particles, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref> of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary file</xref>.

Here, the working mechanism of the hybrid microenergy harvester was described in two parts of the triboelectric nanogenerator and the electromagnetic nanogenerator, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, respectively. Initially, the triboelectric nanogenerator is in an electrostatic neutral state. When the external force placed the silicone rubber–polyimide (SR-PI) triboelectric pair in close contact, equivalent numbers of triboelectric charges with opposite polarities were generated at the interface of the triboelectric pair due to the triboelectrification effect. According to the triboelectric series, polyimide is much more triboelectrically positive than silicone rubber. Therefore, the silicone rubber surface is negatively charged, and the polyimide surface is positively charged. When the external force releases, resulting in the silicone rubber leaving the polyimide surface, the internal electrical potential is established. The unbalanced negative charges cause the accumulation of positive charges on the permanent magnet electrode due to electrostatic induction. As a result, the accumulated charges flow from the PM electrode to the ground through an external load; and a current pulse is generated. After the completed separation of the silicone rubber and polyimide, the device is in the electrostatic equilibrium state. As silicone rubber moves toward the polyimide again, the charges on the permanent magnet electrode are driven to flow back to the ground via the load, and an opposite current is obtained. Therefore, during the separating and approaching cycles of the triboelectric pair, electrons are induced to flow between the PM electrode and ground to form currents. Meanwhile, the electromagnetic nanogenerator generates currents during the removal and approaching cycles between the PM and the FPCB coil due to electromagnetic induction. When the PM moves away from the coil, the magnetic flux crossing the FPCB coil decreases, resulting in the induced current flow in the FPCB coil. In contrast, as the PM approaches the coil, the magnetic flux crossing the coil increases, thereby inducing an opposite current in the FPCB coil. As a result, the hybrid microenergy harvester can convert mechanical input into triboelectric and electromagnetic outputs simultaneously according to the hybrid mechanism of triboelectrification and electromagnetism.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic diagram of the work mechanism of the developed elastic hybrid triboelectric–electromagnetic microenergy harvester (EHTE), which includes two parts.</title><p>Based on the triboelectric effect and electromagnetic effect, triboelectric and electromagnetic outputs can be simultaneously generated from a single mechanical input. <bold>a</bold> Schematic view of the working mechanism of the TENG, i.e., the coupling of triboelectricity and electrostatic induction, which mainly includes four steps. In the initial state, the device is in the electrostatic neutral state. When the external force makes the lower surface of the deformation layer and the upper surface of the FPCB come into close contact, triboelectric charges are generated at the interface of the SR-PI triboelectric pair due to the triboelectrification effect. When the SR leaves the surface of PI, an internal electric potential can be established to accumulate charges on the PM electrode resulting from electrostatic induction. The accumulated charges flow from the PM electrode to the ground through an external load, thereby generating a positive current pulse. After the completed separation of the SR, the device is in the electrostatic equilibrium state. Subsequently, the SR-PI triboelectric pair moves toward each other, and the charges on the PM electrode are driven to flow back to the ground via the load; thus, an opposite current is obtained. Thus, during the separating and approaching cycles of the triboelectric pair, electrons are induced to flow between the electrode and ground to form currents. <bold>b</bold> Illustration of the working mechanism of EMG.

After 10,800 working cycles, both the triboelectric nanogenerator and the electromagnetic nanogenerator maintained remarkable electrical outputs.

As the FeSiAl proportion further increased to 75 wt%, the triboelectric peak-to-peak voltage increased to 544 V, but the electromagnetic peak-to-peak current declined to 5.6 mA. As a result, we chose the ferroelastomer with a 50 wt% proportion of FeSiAl particles as the ferroelastomeric substrate.

The declining trend could be explained by the under-recover effect of the hybrid microenergy harvester since the excessively short time span of the applied force did not allow it to recover to the original status completely.

Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> schematically illustrates the sensing mechanism of the inductive sensor. When the sensing coil (i.e., 4-layer FPCB coil) is excited by an alternative current (AC), the coil generates an alternative magnetic field, which induces eddy currents in the nearby conductive sensing target (i.e., PM) due to the eddy current effect. The induced eddy currents on the surface of the sensing target generate a magnetic field in a direction opposite to the magnetic field generated by the sensing coil, which reduces the magnetic flux crossing the sensing coil and thereby the effective inductance of the sensing coil due to the magnetic field coupling between the sensing coil and target. In addition, the resistance of the sensing coil increases due to the energy dissipation of the eddy currents. The induced eddy currents are affected by the distance between the sensing target and coil. Therefore, when the compression force moves the sensing target (i.e., PM) toward the sensing coil (i.e., FPCB coil), the induced eddy currents increase so that the magnetic field coupling between the sensing coil and the sensing target increases and the effective inductance of the sensing coil decreases. Thus, the sensing performance of the inductive sensor could be qualitatively evaluated by the inductance response behavior of the FPCB coil to the external compression force.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>EHTE serves as an inductive sensor for passive pressure sensing.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Sensing mechanism of the inductive sensor.

This behavior was mainly caused by the structural characteristics of the hybrid deformation layer of the hybrid microenergy harvester so that the air layer of the deformation layer was first deformed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c(i–ii)</xref>) and then deformed in the elastomeric layers in the whole device (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c(ii–iii)</xref>), including the silicone rubber layer and the ferroelastomeric layer.

Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> shows the inductance response behavior of the coil under seven continuous cycles of the compression–release process, which indicated a dynamic stability of the device. To study the anti-fatigue ability of the inductive sensor, we also studied the inductance outputs of the device under ten thousand cyclic compression–release cycles using the vibration platform to provide long-term stable and controllable forces. Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S10</xref> shows that the inductive sensor can maintain stable inductance changes under 10400 working cycles and indicates that the repeatability of the sensor is outstanding. The short-term and long-term stability of the sensor was also studied in this case.

Moreover, the effect of the frequency of the external force on the inductance changes was investigated in this section. As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>, the relative inductance change in the FPCB coil can be maintained at 31.3% as the frequency of the external force increases from 1 to 8 Hz. When the frequency further increased from 8 to 14 Hz, an increasing trend of the relative inductance change was presented. This can be explained by the large inertia force from the shaker of the vibration platform under a relatively high frequency, resulting in an enlarged deformation of the device. The results indicated that the inductance changes in the FPCB coil have no effect on the frequency of the external force. It is worth mentioning that the inductance increment exists for each working cycle of Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>, which is due to the high viscoelasticity of the silicone rubber encapsulation layer.

Third, the SR deformation layer replicated from mold 2 was bonded to the obtained FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomeric substrate by dipping a small amount of liquid SR at their interface. After curing the SR at room temperature, a permanent magnet (PM) was placed in the top round groove of the SR deformation layer and encapsulated by liquid SR. Finally, EHTE was obtained by curing the liquid SR at room temperature. It is noted that the used SR was prepared by mixing Part A and Part B solutions of Ecoflex 00-30 rubber at a weight ratio of 1:1.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41378_2022_393_Fig7_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Tests and measurements</title><p id="Par18">The surface morphologies of the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomer were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6490LV, JEOL Ltd.). The magnetic hysteresis loops of the FeSiAl/SR ferroelastomer were tested by a vibrating sample magnetometer (8600 Series VSM, Lake Shore CRYOTRONICS). A vibration platform consisting of a signal generating system (33250A, Agilent), an amplifier and a shaker was used to provide a stable and controllable force with designable frequency to the device. The triboelectric voltage outputs were measured using a digital oscilloscope (DS2302A, RIOGL) with a 100 MΩ probe, and the triboelectric current outputs were measured by a low-noise current preamplifier (SR570, Stanford Research Systems) and a digital oscilloscope (DS2302A, RIOGL) with a 100 MΩ probe. The electromagnetic outputs were measured using an electrometer (6514, KEITHLEY) and a digital oscilloscope (DS2302A, RIOGL) with a 1 MΩ probe. The charging curves of the device were tested by a digital oscilloscope (DS2302A, RIOGL) with a 100 MΩ probe. The external force applied by the vibration platform was tested by a commercial force sensor connected to a force gauge (HP-160, HANDPI).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62074029, No. 61905035, No. 61971108, No. 62004029, No. 51905554), the Key R&amp;D Program of Sichuan Province (No. 2022JDTD0020, No. 2022YFG0163, No. 2020ZHCG0038), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No. 2020YJ0015), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. ZYGX2019Z002).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>H.-T.D. conceived the research, designed and carried out the experiments, and prepared the paper.
