advantages such as self-sustainable capability and reduced operating expenditure, which cannot be offered by conventional grid powered communications. However, the used energy storage is subject to irreversible aging mechanisms, requiring intelligent management that considers both the energy cost and battery life cycle. In this paper, we propose a cognitive energy management strategy for small cell base stations powered by local renewable energy, a battery, and the smart grid to simultaneously minimize electricity expenditures of the mobile operators and enhance the life span of the storage device. Non-linear battery models and aging processes are considered to formulate the energy cost optimization problem. Simulation results in different configurations show that a degradation-aware policy significantly improves the battery lifetime, while achieving considerable cost savings.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cognitive energy management</kwd><kwd>Green communication</kwd><kwd>Energy harvesting</kwd><kwd>Small cell</kwd><kwd>Battery</kwd><kwd>Smart grid</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-collection-editor</meta-name><meta-value>Dominque Nouguet</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13638_2017_Article_913.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Signal,Image and Speech Processing</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Communications Engineering, Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last decades, mobile user density and data traffic volume have exponentially increased all over the world. To respond to this trend, the mobile network operators (MNOs) have deployed small cell base stations (SBSs) to enhance their network service capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], this solution results in a significant energy demand augmentation essentially generated by the base station power consumption that represents 75 to 80% of the entire mobile network. Based on this, the deployment of heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) requires an efficient energy management to ensure their economic and environmental sustainability.</p><p>A multitude of concepts have recently been proposed to improve the energy efficiency in wireless communications, addressing network planning, protocols, and equipments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, renewable energy (RE) usage in cellular networks has drawn attention for its numerous benefits such as decreasing carbon emissions, enabling long-term cost savings thanks to reduced operating expenditure (opex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and feeding off-grid base stations where the connection to the power grid is expensive or impossible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this context, cognitive techniques have been explored to improve energy-harvesting communications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. More specifically, the cognitive radio offers the ability to sense the conditions of the wireless communication networks and interact with the environment to adjust some parameters such as the transmission power, frequency band, and modulation mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The current energy-harvesting technologies require local energy storage to absorb the production fluctuation and ensure a continuous equilibrium between energy offer and demand. However, the typical used energy storage, i.e., electric battery, generates expensive investment cost and is subject to irreversible degradations. Such phenomenon, called battery aging, has been intensively studied and been classified into two categories: cycle aging, which is due to the energy exchanges with the battery, and calendar aging that appears when the battery is on rest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this context, Barre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have presented a comprehensive review of techniques, models, and algorithms used for Li-ion battery aging estimation.</p><p>The presence of energy storage requires intelligent energy management policies to optimize the energy cost of grid-connected base stations (BSs) with energy harvesting. Some studies in the literature have addressed this problem by using either offline or online optimization approaches. The first category assumes perfect knowledge of the stochastic energy variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] for example, the power consumption of a HetNet powered by RE and equipped with an infinite-capacity battery has been optimized by supervising the BS transmit power and the battery usage. In particular, non-linear model predictive control theory has been used to manage the stored energy considering the average electricity price and power production. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have proposed an energy-aware traffic offloading for a HetNet with multiple SBSs. They have used queuing theory to model the energy production and consumption and deduced an efficient power control according to the statistical information of energy arrival and traffic load. Online policies have also been proposed by assuming a casual knowledge of the environment. In this context, stochastic optimization has been implemented by assuming that the statistics of the energy processes are known and that past observations can correct the energy forecasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have investigated an online stochastic approach based on multi-period recourse. Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have considered a hybrid energy supply for the HetNet and formulated the energy cost minimization problem as a discrete Markov decision process. The monotony properties of the optimal policy have been inferred to simplify and solve the optimization problem using the backward induction algorithm. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we have proposed an energy controller that uses reinforcement learning techniques to elaborate an optimal energy flow policy without prior knowledge of the environment stochastic behavior.</p><p>These works have focused on maximizing the energy saving, and none has integrated both calendar and cycle battery agings in the energy management framework. As a matter of fact, the maximal use of the battery flexibility enables large cost savings but can lead to rapid battery life loss. However, the battery is an expensive investment of the system, and enhancing its life span is vital for an efficient return on investment. Consequently, there is a trade-off between pure cost-efficient and battery aging-aware strategies that has not been evaluated so far. This motivated us to investigate the design of a cognitive energy controller that optimizes the operating energy cost while using the battery in the most effective way to avoid accelerated cycle and calendar agings. The current study extends our work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] by introducing the battery aging models and formulating the energy cost problem such that the battery degradation factors are reduced while the optimal cost saving is still achieved. Additionally, the battery life evolution is studied to show the impact of the proposed energy strategies on the aging process.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Contributions and organization</title><p>The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Different from existing works, we propose a cognitive energy flow management framework for grid-connected energy-harvesting SBSs to jointly optimize the energy opex and the battery life cycle. The cognitive decision architecture is centered around the battery and uses realistic models to capture the non-linear battery behavior and aging mechanisms. Without loss of generality, the present framework is implemented in the offline case, in which we consider non-casual information about the environment variables. System simulations show that the proposed controller achieves considerable cost reduction compared to simpler strategies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The trade-off between pure energy cost optimization and battery aging-aware policies is explored. The energy cost and battery aging are evaluated in different configurations. Simulation results show that the proposed energy management allows considerable battery life extension such that the battery lasts five times longer compared to a pure energy cost optimization strategy. In exchange, the opex is slightly increased but this additional expense remains negligible with respect to the current battery replacement cost.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The paper is structured as follows.

Given this model, we can conclude that high voltages, and therefore high SOCs (Eq. (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>)), contribute to an accelerated battery degradation during rest. Also, the calendar aging grows exponentially with the temperature. Knowing the relation between the current intensity and the heat generated within the battery (Eq.

Not respecting these restrictions leads to a rapid attenuation of the battery performance (capacity loss and decrease of charge and discharge efficiencies). Also, avoiding a long battery rest duration can considerably lower the calendar aging. In this paper, we consider three aging constraints to preserve the battery from rapid degradations:

First, the HLC uses the statistical models of the energy variables to solve the long-term (which can be days, hours, or minutes) aging-aware energy cost optimization problem. Specifically, the policy planned by the HLC consists of a succession of the battery SOCs during the optimization period (the SOC variation means that the battery is being charged or discharged, see Section <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">2.2</xref>). Next, according to the SOC strategy, the LLC manages in the short term (minutes to milliseconds) the energy exchange with the SG and between each subsystem of the green small cell. Given the energy conservation law, the LLC senses the realizations of each energy variable and adjusts the power flows to meet the targeted SOC values while respecting the equilibrium between the power supply and demand. In other words, if the energy provided by the PV system and/or the battery is not sufficient to power the SBS and/or the battery, the LLC purchases the missing quantity from the SG. Similarly, the LCC sells the energy surplus when the provided energy exceeds the consumption.

Regarding the SBS, the general trend is a progressive increase of the traffic load such that the peak is reached around 21:00–22:00. Notice that the load between 3:00 and 10:00 is absent since it is completely handled by the under-layer macro base station. Concerning the solar radiation and ambient temperature, the profiles are both bell-shaped and the peak is reached around midday. In particular, the solar radiation is available only at daytime. Finally, the SG electricity price is characterized by two separated peak hours (between 14:00–16:00 and at 21:00) and off-peak intervals during night and evening.

In these figures, we have represented the average SBS energy consumption, RE production, energy transactions with the SG, and energy stored in the battery. We observe that, in average, the cognitive ESS buys electricity at night, when the PV system cannot produce any energy, to power the SBS and/or store it into the battery. Additionally, we can note that the amount of energy purchased from the SG depends closely on the energy price (the lower the price, the higher the amount of energy bought). Once the PV production becomes available or when the price is high, the cognitive ESS prioritizes the use of the energy produced by the PV panel and the energy already stored in the battery to feed the SBS and sells a quantity of the surplus to the SG. Note that the global behavior of the three policies is similar. However, there are some differences between these strategies, generated by the battery constraints imposed in each case.

In reality, these two strategies are very similar such that the only differences are noticed between 7:00–13:00 and 22:00–0:00 regarding the battery storage level and the energy bought from the grid. This difference is due to Eq. (<xref rid="Equ21" ref-type="disp-formula">21</xref>), which restricts the battery rest during two consecutive time steps and generates a sawtooth pattern with respect to the SOC.

In the reference strategy, the cost is exclusively generated by the SBS consumption. Once the PV production is considered, it appears that the naive strategy overlaps with the reference strategy during night, while energy production during day is sufficient to feed the SBS and sell energy back to the SG (negative cost). Concerning the ideal strategy, we first notice the energy purchase used to charge the battery during time intervals that match with off-peak price periods. The energy stored is then discharged when the electricity price is high to achieve a higher benefit compared to the aforementioned strategies.

Also, the RE energy can be saved in the battery until interesting selling prices are offered by the SG.

This architecture had for purpose to jointly optimize the energy cost and reduce the battery aging effects. Obtained simulation results have shown that the energy supervision system achieves very large cost reduction compared to basic strategies while enhancing the storage life span. In particular, the battery aging constraints allows to considerably reduce the calendar and cycle degradation (up to 51% in average of the initial state of health preserved per year). Furthermore, the respect of these constraints resulted in only ten points decrease of the average opex cost saving, which is negligible considering current battery costs. As future work, we plan to study the proposed cognitive energy supervision framework considering casual information about the environment energy variable. We also aim to realize a demonstrator of the proposed solution to assess its performances in real-life conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The research leading to these results is funded by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche in the framework of the SOGREEN project (ANR-14-CE29-0025-01).</p></sec></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>MM, ADeD, VH, RC, and NH substantially contributed to the conception or design of the work or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work.
