Renewable energy conversions including hydraulic, geothermal or solar generation methods generally depend on the environment. One strategy for stable generation is exploiting biological functions using low-cost fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. From the viewpoint of directly harvesting electricity, two major methods have been reported: glucose bio-fuel cells incorporating enzyme onto electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and MFCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> were reported. Differing from these approaches, we have focused on the unique biological function of strongly electric fish. These fish generate large electric pulses using ATP produced from glucose as energy sources to capture prey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. We selected the family <italic>Torpedinidae</italic> (electric rays) considering their availability and safety of handling for experiments. As seen in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>,b, the ray’s electric organs are aggregated electrocyte columns (500 to 1000/organ) having densely integrated proteins such as ion channels and pumps (molecular motors) on cell membranes of the electrocytes to increase the current. Also, stacked electrocyte layers (~1000/column) increase the voltage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Such complicated and delicate structures are difficult to reproduce artificially by current technology and are available only in nature, having been developed through evolution.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure and electric generation principle of the electric organ of <italic>Torpedo</italic> and concept of electric generation by fluid pressure-based chemical stimulation.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A schematic illustration showing structure of the electric organ and electrocyte columns in it. (<bold>b</bold>) A cross-sectional view of an electrocyte column showing the principle of electric power generation by Ach chemical stimulation from a nerve terminal. In the normal state, ion pumps generate an electric potential difference inside and outside the cells using ATP energy converted from glucose by mitochondria. When Ach stimulates the ion channels, ions are introduced into the cells from outside. This ion flow generates a large current due to the large integration of the proteins on one side of the cell membrane.

Inspired by these technological developments, we formed the idea to combine electric organ tissue, preserving its structure and fluidic control systems to create novel functional devices. As seen in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, electric power generation is controlled by simple pressure-driven fluidic control systems through needles inserted into the organs. These needles serve as alternative nervous systems. By using pressure-driven flow, Ach solution can be introduced into small gaps between electrocytes without complicated 3D microstructures.</p><p>With respect to energy conversion efficiency, mitochondria-based ATP synthesis efficiency from glucose is about 30% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Text 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, ATP consumption efficiency by molecular motors is nearly 100%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, the total efficiency from glucose to electricity is about 30%. By contrast, glucose fuel cells or MFCs have less than 10% efficiency, because decomposition of glucose to pyruvate provides just 1.5 electrons per glucose molecule while mitochondria synthesize about 30 ATP molecules per glucose molecule and provide 20 electrons by multiple chemical reaction steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. MFCs have more glucose decomposition steps, but their efficiency is still low being around 10%. The ATP-based high energy conversion efficiency from glucose to electricity is significant for large-scale power generation. Another advantage of our concept is that power load following operation (generation with arbitrary timing) is easy by controlling chemical stimuli. Therefore, this concept is also applicable to on-demand small-scale power generation.</p><p>To date, several studies have revealed the function of electric organs using structural analysis by electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, chemical analysis by separation techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and physiological analysis by lipid bilayer membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, analysis of living electric organs or electrocytes have not yet been reported. From an engineering viewpoint, protein-rich membranes of electric organs have been used for bioassay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, but not living whole electric organs. Therefore, investigation of fundamental electrical properties of living electric organs is indispensable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electric power generation from electric organs by physical stimuli</title><p>We first investigated the electric power generation of one member of the <italic>Torpedinidae</italic> family, <italic>Narke japonica</italic>, by physical stimuli to confirm its generation capability. <italic>N. japonica</italic> are often caught in winter in the sea near Japan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Text 2</xref>). During measurements the head of the electric ray was pressed continuously by hand to make the ray generate electric pulse (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Details of the measurements are described in the Methods section. Short, repetitive pulse type signals were observed for a few minutes (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The measured peak voltage was about 19 V and the peak current was about 8 A. These values were roughly comparable to previously reported values although the ray species was different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To show that the generated pulse energy was sufficient to drive a device, LED lighting test was carried out by directly connecting LED to the dorsal and ventral side of the ray. As a result, short time lighting was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">Supplementary Movies 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>N. japonica</italic> used in the experiments were considered to have sufficient electric power generation performance. We also demonstrated energy storage in a capacitor and its usage, showing that the electric power was usable more practically. A circuit with a capacitor (capacitance: <italic>C</italic> = 2500 μF) was constructed as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>. The dorsal and ventral sides of the ray were connected to ports 1 and 0 (ground), respectively. The electric energy was accumulated as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>. The accumulated voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>) and energy (<italic>E</italic>) were about 2 V and 200 mJ, respectively, as calculated from the equation: <italic>E</italic> = <italic>CV</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub><sup>2</sup>/2. Additionally, LED lighting and toy car driving by accumulated energy in the capacitor were also shown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">Supplementary Movies 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">4</xref>) by connecting ports 2 and 3 after the storage and the results showed the electric energy can be used for external work. We also applied direct physical stimulation manually by tweezers in an interval of a few seconds when extracting the electric organs with the nerve plexus and central nervous system (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). The organs were extracted from a living ray (Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref>) and it was used soon after extraction. Although the peak height was lower and unstable compared with living ray, similar peak signal was obtained as <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>. However, the response became weaker by repeated stimulation due to damage to the nerve plexus. In this experiment, we showed that electric organs have large power generation performance and the electric power generation is possible even using extracted electric organs. Simultaneously, however, the difficulty of control by physical stimulation was shown. We concluded that direct stimulation to organs by chemical stimuli is indispensable to realize an electric power generation device.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Measurement of electric power generation from electric organs by physical stimuli.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration showing the method to measure voltage and current generated by electric organs.

As seen in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, we used a multi-electrode array system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> to confirm that electric organs responded to chemicals. Since there have been no studies with culturing or even temporary storing of electrocytes yet, we tentatively used artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> which is commonly used for the measurement of electric properties of muscle cells or neurons. The extracted organs were thinly sliced (about 1 mm thickness) and the slices were temporarily immersed in ACSF solution for survival (Methods). This ACSF solution contained glucose (ingredients to ATP), so that energy was given to the electrocytes. A single slice was then set on an electrode dish and the electric signals were recorded (Methods) after Ach solution was introduced by both injection and perfusion (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> shows a representative channel for the response of the organs (data for all channels are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>). In the injection experiment, Ach solution was directly injected into the electrode dish using a micropipette. Ach concentration was 1 mM which is sufficient concentration to get response of membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. From the result, we confirmed that the slice responded to Ach. The perfusion result showed no physical effect. The obtained voltage was about 100 μV, which is roughly comparable to the outside-cell voltage of acute slice neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. From these results, survival of electrocytes using ACSF was confirmed for at least 1 h after explanting from the electric ray and also, electric generation by Ach chemical stimulation was demonstrated. This is the first analysis of living electric organs or cells and it provides fundamental knowledge to design power generation devices. However, this generation method could not effectively utilize the integrated structure of the electrocyte columns. For this purpose, a way to introduce Ach solution while keeping the organ structure is indispensable.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Measurement of electric property of electrocytes using the MED 64 system.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cross-sectional schematic views showing the method to measure voltage of the sliced electric organ for Ach stimulation by injection and perfusion conditions.

The experimental setup to inject Ach solution using syringe needles and to measure the electric response is shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>,b (Methods). We injected 1 mL of Ach solution by manual handing in very short time (within 1 s). We did not employ continuous injection to avoid consuming much amount of chemicals and energy. An electric organ was sandwiched by two pieces of conductive fiber connected to electrodes and seven stainless steel syringe needles per whole organ were inserted into the organ through the fiber. The voltage and current versus the time of Ach injection were recorded as seen in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>. The measured peak voltage was about 91 mV and the peak current was about 0.25 mA. To show that these peaks were not artifacts due to physical fluctuation by fluid flow, negative control data were obtained. When Ach solution was just added with a micropipette to get a concentration of 1 mM in a dish containing organs already immersed in ACSF without Ach, no clear signals were observed (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). So, injection was shown to be indispensable. If no Ach was present in an injected ACSF solution, there were small signals around the time of injection, probably due to the diffusion of naturally existing Ach in the organs, but the signals were far smaller than for Ach injection (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Similarly, there were almost no signals (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>) when we injected another transmitter 1 μM serotonin solution (a sufficient concentration to stimulate cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>) was injected (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). From these experiments, the peak of <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> was demonstrated to be caused by Ach injection. In the case of using an electric organ that was once frozen at −30 °C in a freezer and then thawed in ACSF solution at room temperature, there were also almost no signals when Ach was injected (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). This was probably because cell membranes and proteins were destroyed by ice forming inside the tissue, which indicated that just living tissue could be used for this power generation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electric power generation demonstration by chemical injection.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A cross-sectional schematic illustration showing the method to measure voltage and current generated by the electric organ.

The voltage, current and time duration (half width of peak height) of the organ are compared with those of a living ray in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. The peak voltage and current were smaller compared with the living <italic>N. japonica</italic> probably because not all electrocytes were stimulated by this method. However, the time duration was longer (over 1 s). This was because of the relatively long time for diffusion of Ach through the electric organs by pressure-driven flow and this long time is very useful for fluidic control of electric power generation. To investigate the repeatability, the voltage and current values were measured versus the number of cycles (about 5 min intervals) at the same conditions as the experiment for <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> shows the voltage and the current were decreased, probably because of ATP consumption and organ fatigue. However, the decrease for current was smaller than that for voltage and it became relatively stable after the second cycle. This was due to the change of the resistance after the Ach injection because the organs conserved the ACSF inside them and that decreased the resistance. The resistance was about 1 kΩ before injection, but became about 100 Ω after it. Therefore, repetitive usability of at least several times was demonstrated. Additionally, an example data showing repetitive (three cycles) current generation about 5 min intervals is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>. This data indicates that current was generated only just after Ach was injected and therefore power generation with arbitrary timing was demonstrated. Regarding the usable period, we investigated the voltage and current change using the organs that were kept in ACSF solution for several hours or days. As seen in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, the electric generating function was confirmed to continue for at least 1 day, although both the voltage and current decreased corresponding to elapsed time. This was probably because of a lack of glucose or organ fatigue since the organ storage conditions were not optimized. For long time use, these conditions must be improved. To clarify the effect of the number of needles used, the relationship between the current and needle numbers was investigated in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>. We used the same organ and increased the number of needles as 4, 7, 10 and 20 and measured the current every time. We expected that the current would decrease after the second cycle as seen in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>; however, the current was linearly proportional to the needle numbers, indicating that the area in contact with Ach increased. Therefore, the current could be controlled by the needle numbers and maximally 0.64 mA was obtained. To design a power generation device, size dependencies of the voltage and current are also important. To compare the voltage and current, whole electric organs and organs finely cut into 3 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> pieces, including about 100 columns and about 10 columns, respectively, were prepared (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref>) and four needles were inserted into each. The electric response for Ach injection of with different sizes (areas) is shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>. The voltage was not significantly changed even when the size was small. By contrast, current was decreased according to the decrease of the area. Therefore, cutting the organs is effective strategy to obtain a large power generation.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Detailed investigation and analysis of chemical injection-based electric generation.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of voltage (solid blue bar), current (solid red bar) and time duration (voltage: open blue bar, current: open red bar) indicated by their half width peak heights against physical stimulation to <italic>N. japonica</italic> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and chemical stimulation to the electric organ (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).

To accumulate electric power in a condenser, approximately 1 V voltage is necessary. To obtain this large voltage, electric organs were finely cut (3 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup>), packed in the device and serially connected by conductive wire (Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>). As alternative nervous systems in this device, stainless steel syringe needles were inserted (four needles/piece of organ). This was one generation unit. Aluminum holders and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets sandwiching the organs were required to fix the desired number of needles and to stabilize the signals (especially background fluctuation). For the serial connection and power storage demonstration, we fabricated a prototype device with 16 units as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>. Considering setup time of the device (preparing 16 serial units) about 1 h is needed for manual handling, which is actually the time limit to avoid organ deterioration. The maximum voltage 1.5 V was obtained when Ach (1 mM) solution was injected into this device (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). This was roughly 16 times higher than that for 1 layer of tissue (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). The current was 0.22 mA, roughly the same as that for 1 layer. Finally, we accumulated the generated electric power in a capacitor (<italic>C</italic> = 47 μF) using the same, 16 serial unit device (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref> confirmed that the accumulated voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>) was about 40 mV with a corresponding voltage loss.

First, we roughly estimated power density at an order level. The power density was calculated as about 10<sup>4</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> for the case of physical stimulation to the living ray, whereas it was 10<sup>−2</sup> W/m<sup>3</sup> for the case of fluid-pressure based chemical injection to electric organs. By contrast, representative power densities at room temperature are on the order of 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> W/m<sup>3</sup> for glucose fuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and 10<sup>−2</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> for MFCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, our method is roughly comparable to the MFCs. However, by improving the alternative nervous systems, higher power density up to 10<sup>4</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> can be possibly realized. By integrating the generation units using advanced microfabrication technology, such as employed for fabrication of the 3D microfluidic device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> to create more realistic alternative nervous systems, high power would be obtained. The results in this report are positioned as the first step to realize this high power density generator.</p><p>From the viewpoint of the membrane protein-based electric power generating system using ATP, single cell level electric power generation detected by the patch clamp method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> serves as prior research. Regarding the voltage, both electric organs and the single cell generate about 100 mV although the electrocyte columns of the organs have more than about 1000 serially connected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition to the difficulty to get simultaneous stimulation of the electrocytes, the difference of the measurement method would be a major reason for the same voltage: the patch clamp method measures voltages inside and outside the cells while our method just measures voltage outside the cells. On the other hand, the current of single cell is about 1 pA order<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> which is far smaller than the present method (0.1 mA order), simply due to the difference of the covered area: the patch clamp method measures about a micrometer square area while our method measures about a centimeter square area. Even using “whole cell patch clamp” covering a relatively large area, at most 100 pA to 1 nA order<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> is the actual limitation. Compared to this, electric organ-based generation is at least six orders higher. Recent progress in microfluidic systems has realized biosensors using isolated membrane proteins coupled with artificial cell membranes (lipid bilayer) fabricated by microfluidics that show controlled volume and performance of power generation, but the current per unit is also about 1 pA order<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which is similar to the current measured using the patch clamp. Our approach may offer future applications of these bio-hybrid technologies. As simulated previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, our system can be a model for electric power generation systems using a biological generation method based on the ATP energy conversion system if electrocytes, electric organs or similar systems can be artificially created.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measurement of voltage and current from <italic>N. japonica</italic></title><p>To investigate the electric property of <italic>N. japonica</italic> itself, we measured its generation property.
