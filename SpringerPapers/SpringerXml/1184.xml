The LCA shows the effects of system architecture, charging efficiency, hydrogen supply routes, and the predicted electric vehicle recharging demand on global warming potential and energy consumption and further gives recommendations to optimize the assessed environmental impact.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Demand scenarios of mobile recharging assistances due to BEVs, stranded with an uncharged battery, are predicted for Austria and the greater Vienna area. The introduction of MHP follows the discussion of system architecture, operation strategy, and energetic charging efficiency. The LCA follows the guidance of the ISO 14040 standard and applies the Circular Footprint Formula. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electrical energy, balanced at the charging interface. The system boundary includes raw material extraction, production, transport of resources and products, use, and end of life management. The hydrogen supply is modeled representatively for Austria. The selected impact categories are global warming potential and cumulated energy demand. The data originate, among others, from GEMIS Austria, GREET2, and ProBas.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par3">Environmental impacts vary between 0.40 and 1.58 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh-el and 4.95 to 7.68 kWh/kWh-el in the life cycle. In production and end of life processes, the hydrogen storage system leads to the highest weight-specific GWP and CED of MHP sub-systems due to the large share of CFRP. The efficiency of the MHP system is directly reflected in the use phase’s environmental impacts. The impact of MHP cooling efficiency, charging efficiency, and operation strategy on GWP and CED is below 12%. The CED primarily originates from hydrogen production. If the hydrogen supply route is mostly renewable and generates minor GWP, the MHP efficiency has only a small impact on the life cycle’s GWP and the production and end of life processes gain importance.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Optimized material selection and lightweight construction reduce the life cycle impact. Further, the paper demonstrates that hydrogen supply significantly affects MHP’s environmental impact. Therefore, besides optimizing the production and end of life processes, implementing a renewable hydrogen infrastructure and providing renewable energies and fuels must be strongly accelerated.

Increasing shares of sustainable powertrains and fuels in the European vehicle fleet are expected. With the increasing number of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and the limited range (especially at low ambient temperatures), the demand for mobile battery recharging devices for stranded vehicles rises (Storandt and Funke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2012</xref>; Budde Christensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the development of the registered BEVs—personal cars (PC)—in Austria and the annual roadside assistances to charge BEV batteries by ÖAMTC (Austrian Automobile, Motorcycle, and Touring Club).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Development of registered BEVs in Austria and roadside assistances to recharge BEVs by ÖAMTC</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2022_2122_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">In 2021, the ÖAMTC performed 7.5 roadside assistances due to discharged batteries (hence mostly user errors) per 1000 registered BEVs, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. With the increasing spread of the mass-produced BEV, more and more drivers are also not technology-savvy. Thus, a growing ratio can be expected.</p><p id="Par7">This paper discusses MHP (Mobile Hydrogen Powersupply), an off-grid fuel cell electric system to recharge (stranded) BEVs, from the life cycle perspective. First, demand scenarios of mobile recharging assistances due to BEVs, stranded with an uncharged battery, are predicted for Austria and the greater Vienna area for the next ten years. Further, a literature review discusses off-grid charging infrastructure systems. The introduction of MHP follows the discussion of system architecture, operation strategy, and energetic charging efficiency. Different conventional and regenerative routes are set up and balanced for the hydrogen supply of the life cycle assessment’s (LCA) use phase. The LCA shows the effects of system architecture, charging efficiency, hydrogen supply routes, and the predicted MHP-demand scenarios on global warming potential and energy consumption. Recommendations to optimize the assessed environmental impact conclude the paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Forecast of the Austrian BEV fleet and demand for recharging stranded BEVs</title><p id="Par8">Based on Bruckmüller and Tober (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>), Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows scenarios for the future development of the PC vehicle fleet in Austria. In scenario 2, the estimation of future new registrations and the renewable fuel share is based on the legal regulations of CO<sub>2</sub> fleet goals and fuel blending goals of 2021. This results in 0.58 million BEVs in 2030. With 5.30 million PCs, this is approximately 11% of the fleet. Scenario 3 sets the boundary conditions to accelerate the market penetration of BEVs and FCEVs (fuel cell electric vehicles). The BEV share in 2030 is about 13% (0.71 million). Scenario 1 assumes a higher penetration of synthetic fuels. This leads to increased fractions of PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles), hybrid, and ICE vehicles (internal combustion engine). Scenario 1 assumes a BEV share of about 8% (0.45 million) in 2030. The ICE powertrain fractions of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> also include hybrid powertrains that cannot be charged externally.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Development of Austrian PC fleet with prediction of stranded BEVs in the greater Vienna area due to discharged battery</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2022_2122_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">The greater Vienna area is a typical European metropolitan region and provides representative boundary conditions for the LCA. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the estimation of daily stranded BEVs in the area of the Vienna ÖAMTC bases. These estimations are based on the ÖAMTC roadside assistance statistics of 2021 and conservatively assumed growth rates of scenario 1: 0% p.a., scenario 2: 1% p.a., and scenario 3: 3% p.a. It is predicted that in 2030 daily between 2.2 and 5.2 BEVs will stand due to an uncharged battery. Scenario 2 predicts over a 10-year period from 2022 to 2031, a total of 6422 stranded BEVs in Vienna. Scenario 1 leads to 4544, and scenario 3 leads to 9803 cases. For Austria, the comparable predictions result in between 9.3 and 21.7 BEVs that will strand daily 2030. Over a 10-year period, between 18960 and 40904 BEVs will stand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Solutions for off-grid charging</title><p id="Par10">Different solutions for off-grid charging are presented in the literature (Afshar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). A variant is the utilization of a mobile battery like Cui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>) propose or a combination of battery and ultracapacitor (Atmaja and Amin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>)) to recharge the BEV battery. Yet, the main drawback of these technologies is the long recharging time of the mobile battery, which leads to significant downtimes and, hence, inflexible application periods, as well as an additional loading of the power grid. Moreover, the limited capacity of the battery restricts the refueling events of BEVs, as Cui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>) argue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Life cycle perspective of BEV charging in literature</title><p id="Par11">There is, however, a lack of life cycle perspective in mobile BEV charging systems. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no previous published studies are available that investigate impacts from a life cycle perspective, i.e., how system structure and operation strategy affect the use phase or how materials affect impacts upstream and downstream from the use phase.</p><p id="Par12">Life cycle energy demand and the environmental impact of on-grid charging infrastructure have already been discussed in the literature. Nansai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2001</xref>) analyzed the installation of BEV charging infrastructure in Japan and found that the life cycle carbon emissions of the charging infrastructure, including storage batteries, are responsible for 16% of the total emissions in a BEV’s life, powered with Japanese electricity mix. Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2019</xref>) projected the environmental life cycle impact of different charging systems in China for 2020 to 2040. They predict that home chargers have the lowest cumulative energy demand and global warming potential (GWP), followed by public AC chargers, public DC chargers, and public AC and DC chargers, due to differences in materials and charging technologies. They found that the average chargers account for less than 2% of the GWP in a BEV’s life. Traut et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>) proposed an optimization model to minimize the annual lifecycle GWP and costs from the PC fleet of conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and BEVs. Two charging modes were compared: home charging and additional workplace charging. The results show that additional workplace charging reduces the GWP by up to 21% if the grid offers low-carbon electricity. The impact of the charging infrastructure (without storage batteries) is thereby less than 3% of the GWP of a BEV’s life if the US-electricity mix is applied. Marmiroli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>) assessed the life cycle of constructing and maintaining an electrified road (e-road) equipped with an inductive charging system. These e-roads seem to lead to almost double impact compared to a traditional road. McLaren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016</xref>) analyzed the use phase carbon emissions of charging BEVs and PHEVs depending on charging scenario (at home or workplace), time restriction, and carbon intensity of the grid. They argue that workplace charging leads to the lowest emissions. BEVs achieve lower emissions in one out of five scenarios (due to a low-carbon grid) than highly efficient PHEVs. Xu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>) examined the life cycle GWP of electricity generation and BEV batteries in Europe in 2050 for different charging strategies: uncontrolled, unidirectional controlled, and bidirectional charging (vehicle-to-grid). They found that uncontrolled charging increases the electricity production from controllable sources like natural gas slightly. The emissions are lowest for bidirectional charging due to the increasing use of electricity from renewable energy sources. Thereby, the impact on the lifecycle emissions of the enhanced battery degradation due to the bidirectional charging is outperformed. Burchart-Korol et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>) analyzed the life cycle impact of the highly diversified energy production in the European Union countries (2015–2050) on BEV charging. They show a generally lower environmental impact from charging BEVs in countries with a high share of electricity generated from regenerative energy sources.</p><p id="Par13">In contrast to the works cited, most studies on alternative powertrains exclude the energy infrastructure, as Bothe and Steinfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) show in their meta-analysis of LCA studies. They estimate the energy infrastructure effect on 5 to 8% of the overall emissions and recommend considering GWP resulting from energy infrastructure. Also, Chester and Horvath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>) suggest considering infrastructure in the LCA of passenger transportation next to fuel production and supply chains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mobile BEV charging system MHP</title><p id="Par14">The solution proposed in this paper is to use a hydrogen fuel cell (FC) supplied from a high-pressure tank in addition to a high-voltage battery (HVB) to recharge stranded BEVs. In this way, the system can store more energy, provide more refueling events to stranded BEVs, and reduce the downtimes due to the fast hydrogen refueling process. This system is called Mobile Hydrogen Powersupply (MHP).</p><p id="Par15">MHP is designed as a trailer (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) so that a conventional breakdown service vehicle can tow MHP to the site of operation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MHP: CAD rendering of MHP and photo of MHP charging a BEV</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2022_2122_Fig3_HTML.jpg" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec6"><title>System architecture</title><p id="Par16">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the system architecture of MHP. A 30 kW-el polymer electrolyte membrane FC converts the electrical power from hydrogen, supplied by the 4.1 kg 700 bar storage system. The air supply system supplies ambient air to the FC using a compressor. As a galvanic element, the FC provides electrical energy and emits water vapor from atmospheric oxygen and hydrogen. The exhaust gas, composed mainly of atmospheric nitrogen and water vapor, is released into the ambient air through the exhaust system.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MHP: system architecture with sub systems</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2022_2122_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">In addition, an HVB with a capacity of 8 kWh (6.1 kWh usable) is available for start-up and shut-down and as a supplementary power source. The DC-voltage of HVB and FC is converted via the power electronics and directed to auxiliary consumers and the DC-charging interface CCS. The 3-phase AC-charging interface Type 2, with an optional adapter for Tesla vehicles, is supplied through an inverter. As a result, MHP fits all relevant BEV charging interfaces on the European market. Thereby, the maximum charging power is above 20 kW, regardless of the charging interface.</p><p id="Par18">MHP is operated and monitored via a human–machine interface (HMI) designed as a touch screen. The low voltage system supplies auxiliary consumers like FC BoP (balance of plant), fans and pumps of the cooling system, the system control unit, and the HMI. The liquid-cooled components are divided into two cooling circuits. Heat exchangers transfer the thermal power to the ambient air.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Operation strategy</title><sec><p id="Par19">The operational process of MHP is divided into three successive phases: start-up, charging, and shut-down.

The FC efficiency is highest in the low to middle power range. With increasing power, the FC efficiency decreases due to rising losses. In a very low power range, the BoP power demand decreases the FC efficiency, see O’Hayre et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>) or Klell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>). This correlation is visible since the FC provides the charging power when using the parallel operating strategy. As the ambient temperature increases, the electrical power consumption of the thermal system’s fans and pumps rises. For example, the electrical fan power at 22 kW charging power and 40 °C ambient temperature is approximately 1 kW. This leads to decreasing charging efficiencies with increasing outside temperatures. The efficiency of the HV components increases towards their rated power. The high charging power reduces the charging time. The shorter charging time decreases auxiliary consumers’ energy share. However, the FC efficiency characteristic outweighs these effects. Consequently, the charging efficiency is 6.9% below the maximum at high charging power and high ambient temperature.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Serial operation strategy</title><p id="Par25">The FC charges the HVB with maximum efficiency independent of the BEV charging power. Thus, the serial operation strategy’s efficiency map is decoupled from the significant FC influence. The HV components’ efficiency rises with increasing charging power, and the auxiliary consumers’ energetic share reduces. Thus, the charging efficiency increases. The highest efficiency is achieved at high charging power and low ambient temperature. With rising ambient temperatures, the system efficiency decreases due to the increasing power demand of the thermal system.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par26">Despite the charging and discharging of the HVB, the serial operating strategy’s maximum efficiency is 1% higher than the parallel operation strategy’s maximum. This has several reasons: The fuel cell works at high efficiency regardless of the operation strategy. The maximum efficiency of the serial operating strategy is at a higher charging power than the maximum of the parallel operation strategy. Thus, the HV components operate at higher efficiencies, and the auxiliary consumers’ power demand is less significant due to the reduced charging time. In addition, the HVB has low charging and discharging losses.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par27">Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows, at a constant ambient temperature of 20 °C, the effects of operation strategy, charging energy, and charging interface on the charging process efficiency as a function of charging power.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Charging efficiency: effects of operation strategy, charging energy and charging interface at 20 °C ambient temperature</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2022_2122_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec><p id="Par28">With rising charging energy, the efficiency of the charging process also rises because start-up and shut-down processes are proportionally less significant. AC charging leads to a reduced charging process efficiency compared to DC charging. This is due to the additional energy conversion via the DC/AC inverter, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. In the map, serial DC charging achieves the maximum charging efficiency, and parallel AC charging the lowest at high charging powers in each case. The difference in efficiency is thereby 10%.

According to the current Austrian government program, Austria should be climate neutral by 2040 at the latest, see Bundeskanzleramt Österreich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). According to the Austrian hydrogen strategy of BMK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>), the government intends to introduce renewable hydrogen with a focus on hard to decarbonize sectors, including transport. Since an exact path is not public, the AT-traffic hydrogen mix route is assumption-based for the year 2030. In the biomass gasification route, BG, supplied with sustainable forest residues, is the only hydrogen source. A role model for this path can be the BioH2Modul of the FCTRAC project, which includes gasification, purification, compression, and supply of the HRS, see Gubin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> shows the GWP and CED category indicator results of assessed hydrogen supply routes. The global hydrogen mix route leads to the highest GWP: 17,12 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kg-H<sub>2</sub>. The hydrogen production by SMR-CCS leads to relatively low GWP but is very energy-intensive, which is reflected in the high CED. The net zero emissions scenario owns the highest share of CCS-SMR, resulting in the highest CED of 95.75 kWh/kg-H<sub>2</sub>. The lowest GWP and CED result from the BG route with 2.27 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kg-H<sub>2</sub> and 63,04 kWh/kg-H<sub>2</sub>. Decentralized hydrogen supply—as in the case of electrolysis and BG—shows an environmental impact reduction compared to the centralized routes also due to the almost complete omission of transport efforts. Production leads to the largest share of environmental impacts for all hydrogen supply routes. Renewable energy and renewable fuels further decrease the GWP impact of transport and compression.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hydrogen supply routes: GWP and CED for production, transport, and compression</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2022_2122_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Full life cycle with sensitivity analysis</title><p id="Par57">The life cycle combines the environmental impacts of production, use, and end of life phases.

With the present boundary conditions, the CED primarily originates from the use phase – in detail: from hydrogen production. Thus, high efficiencies of hydrogen supply route and MHP system cause low life cycle CED. For the global and the BG hydrogen routes (extremes), serial DC charging reduces the life cycle CED by approximately 11% compared to parallel AC charging.</p><p id="Par60">The hydrogen supply route is crucial for the GWP of the use phase and, thus, the life cycle. If the hydrogen supply route causes minor GWP, such as the AT-traffic or BG route, the MHP efficiency has only a small impact on the life cycle’s GWP. The production and end of life processes gain importance in this case. For example, the BG hydrogen supply route with serial DC charging, combined with MHP 2.0 shows a 25% GWP reduction compared to MHP.

This decrease results from the cooling system’s rising power demand and increases GWP and CED. The efficiency curve depending on BEV charging power (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) mirrors in GWP and CED. The effects of cooling/charging efficiency and operation strategy are minor for sustainable hydrogen supply. The reduction potential by optimal boundaries is approximately 10% for CED and 4% for GWP, considering the AT-traffic hydrogen mix. Their influence increases if the use phase gains relevance (by conventional hydrogen supply). Applying the global hydrogen supply route shows a reduction potential of approximately 10% for CED and 10% for GWP.</p><p id="Par63">The PC fleet’s future development and, thus, the fundamental demand for recharging stranded BEVs is strongly dependent on the legal boundary conditions and road users’ acceptance.

Scenario 1, with a total of 4544 BEV charged, results in 0.71 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh-el and 8.03 kWh/kWh-el. Scenario 3, with more than a doubling of operations to 9803, leads to 0.41 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh-el and 6.41 kWh/kWh-el.</p><p id="Par65">The impacts of the production and end of life phase significantly influence the GWP for all three scenarios. Therefore, the specific GWP decreases considerably with increasing BEV charging numbers. The opposite is the case for CED: the main share results from the use phase. The specific CED reduces slightly with increased charging energy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion and outlook</title><p id="Par66">This paper introduces MHP—Mobile Hydrogen Powersupply—an off-grid fuel cell electric system to recharge (stranded) BEVs, and discusses MHP from the life cycle perspective. A polymer electrolyte membrane FC and a HVB are the power sources. The maximum charging power is above 20 kW.</p><p id="Par67">The system architecture allows parallel and serial operation of FC and HVB. In parallel operation, the maximum efficiency is directly dependent on the FC’s efficiency map. The maximum is in the low to middle power range. In serial operation, the HVB powers the loads and the FC recharges the HVB efficiently. The HV components’ efficiency rises with increasing charging power, and the auxiliary consumers’ energetic share reduces. Thus, the highest efficiency is achieved at the highest charging power. With rising ambient temperature, the power consumption of the thermal system rises and the efficiency decreases. Due to the additional energy conversion, AC charging leads to reduced efficiency compared to DC.</p><p id="Par68">MHP was assessed with the guidance of the ISO 14040 standard and the application of the Circular Footprint Formula. The LCA aimed to present the life cycle impact of the MHP application by an Austrian breakdown service with varying MHP parameterization and hydrogen supply routes. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electrical energy, balanced at the charging interface.</p><p id="Par69">MHP weighs a total of approx. 1500 kg. The most common materials are weight-balanced, aluminum, steel, CFRP, and copper. The production and end of life result in 12.81 t-CO2eq. The total CED amounts to 68.97 MWh. The hydrogen storage system leads to the highest weight-specific GWP and CED due to the large share of CFRP (hydrogen tank). Apart from the vehicle system, the hydrogen storage system has the highest absolute GWP and CED, surpassing the high voltage and fuel cell system. MHP 2.0 was designed on paper and achieved a 33% reduction of GWP and a 39% reduction of CED.</p><p id="Par70">The highest life cycle environmental impacts result from parallel AC charging with the basic system setup and the global hydrogen mix supply route: 1.58 kg-CO2eq/kWh-el and 7.68 kWh/kWh-el. In combination with the most efficient serial DC charging and the MHP 2.0 system setup, the biomass gasification route leads to the lowest environmental impacts: 0.40 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh-el and 4.95 kWh/kWh-el. The efficiency of the MHP system is independent of the hydrogen supply route directly reflected in the use phase’s environmental impacts. The impact of MHP cooling efficiency, charging efficiency, and operation strategy on total GWP and CED is below 12%. The CED primarily originates from hydrogen production. Thus, high efficiencies cause a low life cycle CED. The hydrogen supply route is crucial for the GWP of the use phase. If the hydrogen supply route generates minor GWP, the MHP efficiency has only a small impact on the life cycle’s GWP and the production and end of life processes gain importance. With increasing MHP application numbers, the specific GWP and CED decrease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project manager of “MHP” is Axel-Oscar Bernt of MAGNA STEYR Fahrzeugtechnik AG &amp; Co KG, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.magna.com/" ext-link-type="uri">axel-oscar.bernt@magna.com</ext-link>.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Conceptualization: Johannes Konrad; Methodology: Johannes Konrad; Formal analysis and investigation: Johannes Konrad; Writing—original draft preparation: Johannes Konrad; Writing—review and editing: Axel-Oscar Bernt, Peter Hofmann; Supervision: Peter Hofmann; Project management: Axel-Oscar Bernt.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by TU Wien (TUW).
