Beyond utilizing their tumor targeting ability, chemical explorations have been made to directly conjugate drug loaded nanomaterials to tumor-targeting bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Magnetococcus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. As a biological strategy, genetic engineering was also used to program bacteria for achieving in situ anti-cancer agents synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, both these strategies have their own intrinsic drawbacks. The limited carrying capacity of chemical approaches and the loss of transgene expression in biological strategy led to insufficient dosage of anti-cancer agents and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Clearly, neither synthetic nor genetic approaches alone can fully satisfy the current requirements on both stability and high efficiency.</p><p id="Par4">Some bacteria can spontaneously metabolize nontoxic compounds to antineoplastic products (e.g., NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> to NO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However these natural bioreactions are usually too feeble to realize satisfactory therapeutic effects. As we know, some bacteria possess the capacity of driving intracellular reaction at the expense of exogenous electrons. Inspired from this phenomenon, we conceive an idea that charging bacteria with abundant exogenous electrons could help control their intrinsic metabolic activities and boost their latent anti-cancer potential. Recently, numerous nano-sized photocatalytic materials such as CdS and C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> have attracted considerable attention for their photoelectric converting ability, which could continuously transfer light into electric energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These kind of materials not only “charge” bacteria to strengthen their metabolic activities, but also bypass loading limits to realize abundant anti-cancer agents production. This universal strategy might construct a biotic/abiotic loop that allows the photo-induced synthesis of NO from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> possible.</p><p id="Par5">Inspired by the above photo-induced reduction, we have fused photocatalytic systems with tumor targeted bacteria, and thus to obtain a biotic/abiotic hybrid for light-controlled NO generation. In support of this goal, <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655, a non-pathogenic bacterium with both tumor targeting and nitrate/nitrite reductase expression, is chosen for modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. First, we synthesize carbon-dot doped carbon nitride (CCN) with suppressed free radical generation capability to achieve in situ photoelectric conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CCN and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are assembled through electrostatic interactions to obtain CCN@<italic>E. coli</italic>. Herein, we propose a concept of photo-controlled bacterial metabolite therapy (PMT), which utilizes modified CCN@<italic>E. coli</italic> to metabolize NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> to antineoplastic NO for cancer treatment under photo-irradiation. We also verify its detailed mechanism by using isotope labeling method and proteomics study. In mammals, endogenic NO is enzymatically produced from <sc>l</sc>-arginine by nitric oxide synthase. During its physiological processes, NO could be spontaneously oxidized into NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>, which is useless to mammalian cells. However, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> is the primary nitrogen source of the PMT system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, the irreversible NO generation is transformed into circular reaction that maximizes the bioavailability of NO. In all, PMT, which optimizes the biomedical applications of biotic/abiotic hybrid systems, creates a paradigm shift in the way of bacterial cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization and mechanism of PMT system</title><p id="Par6">The preparation of CCN@<italic>E. coli</italic> is schematically illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>.

During the photo-induced reaction, the intracellular NADH concentration of CCN@<italic>E. coli</italic> increased by 4.4 times, and this result indicated that <italic>E. coli</italic> utilized photogenerated electrons from illuminated CCN to carry out intracellular reactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">After the successfully demonstration of material-cell electron transfer process, we further investigated the intracellular conversion of electric energy to chemical energy.

To comprehensively reveal the tumor penetrability feature of CCN@<italic>E. coli</italic>, the surfactant assistant tissue clearing technology, namely CLARITY, was used to convert tumor tissue into transparent form (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, PMT treatment inhibited 79.3% of tumor growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>).

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>, after PMT treatment, 222 upregulated differential proteins and 17 downregulated differential proteins within tumor tissue were determined (fold change ≥ 1.5 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, hypergeometric test). Results of both cluster analysis and principal component analysis revealed the significant differences between phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and PMT treatment groups. On the basis of the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on differential proteins in biological processes, we found that proteins that respond to stimuli, signals, cell death, immune system and cell killing were more upregulated in PMT group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). In contrast, more downregulations were observed in cell proliferation and growth-related proteins. These data evidenced that PMT induced a high stress level in tumor, which was ascribe to the oxidative damage induced by NO. As a proof, proteins associated with antioxidant activity also obviously decreased. Commonly, the cytotoxicity of NO towards cancer cells was mainly attributed to its capacity of inducing oxidative stress and initiating DNA damage. The Venn diagram shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> indicated that there was no overlap between <italic>E. coli</italic> infection/invasion related proteins and DNA damage/oxidative stress associated proteins.

This phenomenon suggested that immune system might contribute to the anti-cancer effect of PMT in vivo. The same conclusion could also be drawn from protein–protein interactions network analysis after PMT treatment. Four optimal clusters containing differential proteins involved in metabolic pathway responding to stress, regulation of cell stress, and bacteria invasion were identified (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>, in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, the comprehensive activation of antigen presentation pathway was found. Besides, the upregulation of high-mobility-group box alarmin protein (HMGB), a dominant protein involved in triggering antigen presentation leading to immunogenic cell death, was also affirmed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. All these discoveries revealed that PMT might induce immunogenic cell death via HMGB triggered MHC class I-mediated pathway. In an in vitro simulation environment, PMT treatment was found to induce DCs mutation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). By using Euler distance and dead-cell proximity index analysis, both DC and CD8 + cytotoxicity T cells immune activation was verified (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g–i</xref>), and increased concentration of immune cytokines in serum demonstrated that PMT provoked this immune response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref> and detailed discussed in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Overall, these results uncovered that, apart from directly generating cytotoxic NO, immune response might also play a critical role in the anti-cancer mechanism of PMT.
